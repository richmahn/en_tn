PHM	front	intro	sz2w			0		# Introduction to Philemon<br><br>## Part 1: General Introduction<br><br>### Outline of the Book of Philemon<br><br>1. Paul greets Philemon (1:1-3)<br>2. Paul makes requests of Philemon about Onesimus (1:4-21)<br>3. Conclusion (1:22-25)<br><br>### Who wrote the Book of Philemon?<br><br>Paul wrote Philemon. Paul was from the city of Tarsus. He had been known as Saul in his early life. Before becoming a Christian, Saul was a Pharisee. He persecuted Christians. After he became a Christian, he traveled several times throughout the Roman Empire telling people about Jesus.<br><br>Paul was in a prison when he wrote this letter.<br><br>### What is the Book of Philemon about?<br><br>Paul wrote this letter to a man named Philemon. Philemon was a believer in Jesus who lived in the city of Colossae. He owned a slave named Onesimus. Onesimus had run away from Philemon and possibly stole something from him as well. Onesimus went to Rome and visited Paul in prison there, where Paul brought Onesimus to Jesus.<br><br>Paul told Philemon that he was sending Onesimus back to him. Philemon had the right to execute Onesimus according to Roman law. But Paul said that Philemon should accept Onesimus back as a Christian brother. He even suggested that Philemon should allow Onesimus to come back to Paul and help him in prison.<br><br>### How should the title of this book be translated?<br><br>Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “Philemon.” Or they may choose a clearer title, such as “Paul’s Letter to Philemon” or “The Letter Paul wrote to Philemon.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])<br><br>## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts<br><br>### Does this letter approve the practice of slavery?<br><br>Paul sent Onesimus back to his former master. But that did not mean that Paul thought that slavery was an acceptable practice. Instead, Paul was more concerned with people being reconciled to each other and that they serve God in whatever situation they were in. It is important to note that in the culture of the time, people became slaves for various reasons and it was not considered a permanent state.<br><br>### What does Paul mean by the expression “in Christ,” “in the Lord,” etc.?<br><br>Paul meant to express the idea of a very close union with Christ and the believers. See the introduction to the Book of Romans for more details about this kind of expression.<br><br>## Part 3: Important Translation Issues<br><br>### Singular and plural “you”<br><br>In this book, the word “I” refers to Paul. The word “you” is almost always singular and refers to Philemon. The two exceptions to this are 1:22 and 1:25. There “you” refers to Philemon and the believers that met at his house. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])<br><br>Three times Paul identifies himself as the author of this letter (in verses 1, 9, and 19). Evidently Timothy was with him and may have written down the words as Paul said them. All instances of “I,” “me,” and “my” refer to Paul. Philemon is the main person to whom this letter is written. All instances of “you” and “your” refer to him and are singular unless otherwise noted. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
PHM	1	1	ne8k	figs-123person	Παῦλος	1		Your language may have a particular way of introducing the author of a letter. Use that here. Alternate translations: “From me, Paul” or “I, Paul” (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person)
PHM	1	1	cgs4		δέσμιος Χριστοῦ Ἰησοῦ	1	a prisoner of Christ Jesus	Paul was in prison because people in authority did not want him to preach about Jesus. They put him there in order to stop him and to punish him. This does not mean that Jesus had put Paul in prison. Alternate translation: “a prisoner for the sake of Christ Jesus”
PHM	1	1	sv3p		ὁ ἀδελφὸς	1	our brother	Paul is using the term **brother** figuratively to mean someone who shares the same faith. Alternate translation: “our fellow Christian” or “our companion in the faith” (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor)
PHM	1	1	y9zu	figs-exclusive	ὁ ἀδελφὸς	1		Here, the word **our** is not in the original, but was necessary for English, which requires that a relationship word indicate who the person is related to. In this case, **our** would be inclusive, relating Timothy to Paul and the readers as a brother in Christ. If your language requires this, you can do the same. If not, you can follow the original wording, which says, “the brother.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
PHM	1	1	gvmy	translate-names	Φιλήμονι	1		This is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
PHM	1	1	q84z	figs-explicit	Φιλήμονι	1		If it would be more natural in your language, you can include the information that this is a letter in which Paul is speaking directly to Philemon, as in the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
PHM	1	1	r3l9	figs-exclusive	ἡμῶν	1	our	The word **our** here refers to Paul and those with him, but not to the reader. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
PHM	1	1	ww3l		καὶ συνεργῷ ἡμῶν	1	and our fellow worker	If your readers would misunderstand this phrase, you could state more specifically how Philemon worked with Paul. Alternate translation: “who, like us, works to spread the gospel” or “who works as we do to serve Jesus”
PHM	1	2	b37l	translate-names	Ἀπφίᾳ	1		This is the name of a woman. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
PHM	1	2	bb1s	figs-exclusive	τῇ ἀδελφῇ	1		Here, the word **our** is not in the original, but was necessary for English, which requires that a relationship word indicate who the person is related to. In this case, **our** would be inclusive, relating Apphia to Paul and the readers as a sister in Christ. If your language requires this, you can do the same. If not, you can do the same as the original, which says, “the sister.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
PHM	1	2	hhpc	figs-metaphor	τῇ ἀδελφῇ	1		Paul is using the term **sister** figuratively to mean a woman who shares the same faith. Alternate translation: “our fellow Christian” or “our spiritual sister” (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor)
PHM	1	2	e8su	figs-exclusive	ἡμῶν	1	our	The word **our** here refers to Paul and those with him, but not to the reader. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
PHM	1	2	kyzo		Ἀπφίᾳ…Ἀρχίππῳ…τῇ…ἐκκλησίᾳ	1		The letter is predominantly addressed to Philemon. It could be misleading to suggest Paul is writing to **Apphia**, **Archippus**, and **the church** in Philemon’s house, on the same level as he is writing to Philemon.
PHM	1	2	sq44	translate-names	Ἀρχίππῳ	1	Archippus	This is the name of a man in the church with Philemon. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
PHM	1	2	mnn5	figs-metaphor	τῷ συνστρατιώτῃ ἡμῶν	1	our fellow soldier	Paul speaks here of Archippus as if he and Archippus were both soldiers in an army. He means that Archippus works hard, as Paul himself works hard, to spread the gospel. Alternate translation: “our fellow spiritual warrior” or “who also fights the spiritual battle with us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
PHM	1	2	uof9		καὶ τῇ κατ’ οἶκόν σου ἐκκλησίᾳ	1		Apphia and Archippus were probably also members of the church that met at Philemon’s house. If mentioning them separately would imply that they were not part of the church, you could include a word like “other.” Alternate translation: “to the other members of the church in your house”
PHM	1	3	r4nq	translate-blessing	χάρις ὑμῖν καὶ εἰρήνη, ἀπὸ Θεοῦ Πατρὸς ἡμῶν καὶ Κυρίου ἡμῶν Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and our Lord Jesus Christ	After introducing the senders and recipients of the letter, Paul gives a blessing.

PHM	1	3	iv7e	figs-abstractnouns	χάρις ὑμῖν καὶ εἰρήνη, ἀπὸ Θεοῦ Πατρὸς ἡμῶν καὶ Κυρίου ἡμῶν Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ.	1		If your readers would misunderstand the abstract nouns **grace** and **peace**, you could express the idea behind them with adjectives such as “gracious” and “peaceful.” Alternate translation: “May God our Father and our Lord Jesus Christ be gracious to you and make you peaceful” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
PHM	1	3	e5z8	figs-exclusive	ἡμῶν…ἡμῶν	1	our	The word **our** here is inclusive, referring to Paul, those with him, and the reader. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
PHM	1	3	qglx	figs-yousingular	ὑμῖν	1		Here, **you** is plural, referring to all of the recipients named in verses 1–2. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
PHM	1	3	lh8a	guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	Πατρὸς	1	Father	This is an important title for God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
PHM	1	4	puh8	figs-yousingular	σου	1		Here, the word **you** is singular and refers to Philemon. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])

Alternate translation: “hearing how much you love and believe in the Lord Jesus and all the saints” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
PHM	1	5	ojcu	writing-poetry	ἀκούων σου τὴν ἀγάπην καὶ τὴν πίστιν, ἣν ἔχεις πρὸς τὸν Κύριον Ἰησοῦν, καὶ εἰς πάντας τοὺς ἁγίους	1	writing-poetry	Paul is using a poetic structure here in which the first and last parts relate and the second and third parts relate. Therefore, the meaning is: “hearing of the faith that you have in the Lord Jesus and of your love for all the saints.”Paul said exactly that in Colossians 1:4 without the poetic structure. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry]])
PHM	1	5	pf1y	figs-yousingular	σου…ἔχεις	1		Here, the words **your** and **you** are singular and refer to Philemon. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
PHM	1	6	mfrp	figs-explicit	ὅπως	1		Here, **that** introduces the content of the prayer that Paul mentions in verse 4. If your readers would misunderstand this connection, you can repeat the idea of prayer here. Alternate translation: “I pray that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
PHM	1	6	t54l	figs-abstractnouns	ἡ κοινωνία τῆς πίστεώς σου	1	the fellowship of your faith	The word translated **fellowship** means a sharing or a partnership in something. Paul probably intends both meanings, but if you must choose, it could mean: (1) that Philemon shares the same faith in Christ as Paul and others. Alternate translation: “the faith that you share with us” (2) that Philemon is a partner with Paul and others in working for Christ. Alternate translation: “your working together with us as believers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
PHM	1	6	hcwp	figs-abstractnouns	ἡ κοινωνία τῆς πίστεώς σου, ἐνεργὴς γένηται ἐν ἐπιγνώσει παντὸς ἀγαθοῦ τοῦ ἐν ἡμῖν εἰς Χριστόν.	1		If your readers would misunderstand these abstract nouns **faith** and **knowledge**, you could express the idea behind **faith** with a verb such as “trust” or “believe,” and **knowledge** with a verb such as “know” or “learn.” Alternate translation: “as you trust in the Messiah along with us, you may become increasingly better at serving the Messiah, as you learn about all of the good things that he has given us to use for him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
PHM	1	6	pxw1	figs-abstractnouns	ἐν ἐπιγνώσει παντὸς ἀγαθοῦ	1	may be effective for the knowledge of everything good	This could mean: (1) “and will result in you knowing every good thing” (2) “so that those you share your faith with will know every good thing” Alternate translation: “by knowing everything good” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
PHM	1	6	n25e	figs-explicit	εἰς Χριστόν	1	in Christ	If your readers would misunderstand this phrase, you could state more explicitly how “everything good” is **for Christ**.

PHM	1	7	vyc7	figs-abstractnouns	χαρὰν γὰρ πολλὴν ἔσχον καὶ παράκλησιν	1		If your readers would misunderstand the abstract nouns **joy** and **comfort**, you could express the idea behind them with adjectives.

PHM	1	7	xlp6	figs-abstractnouns	ἐπὶ τῇ ἀγάπῃ σου	1		If your readers would misunderstand the abstract noun **love**, you could express the idea behind it with a verb. Alternate translation: “because you love people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
PHM	1	7	shpv	figs-activepassive	τὰ σπλάγχνα τῶν ἁγίων ἀναπέπαυται διὰ σοῦ	1	the inward parts of the saints are being refreshed by you	If your language does not use this passive form, you can state this in active form. Alternate translation: “you have refreshed the inward parts of the saints” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
PHM	1	7	aq4g	figs-metonymy	τὰ σπλάγχνα τῶν ἁγίων	1	the inward parts of the saints	Here, **inward parts** figuratively refers to a person’s emotions or inner being.

PHM	1	7	z0ne	figs-metaphor	τὰ σπλάγχνα τῶν ἁγίων ἀναπέπαυται διὰ σοῦ	1		Here, **being refreshed** figuratively refers to the feeling of encouragement or relief.

PHM	1	7	m5ip	figs-metaphor	σοῦ, ἀδελφέ	1	you, brother	Paul called Philemon **brother** because they were both believers, and he wanted to emphasize their friendship. Alternate translation: “you, dear brother” or “you, dear friend” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
PHM	1	8	ayy1			0	Connecting Statement:	Paul begins his plea and the reason for his letter.
PHM	1	8	fd84		πολλὴν ἐν Χριστῷ παρρησίαν	1	all boldness in Christ	This could mean: (1) “all authority because of Christ” (2) “all courage because of Christ.”
PHM	1	8	x3nc	grammar-connect-logic-result	διό	1		The word **Therefore** signals that what Paul has just said in verses 4–7 is the reason for what he is about to say.

PHM	1	9	l9fh	figs-abstractnouns	διὰ τὴν ἀγάπην	1	because of love	Paul does not say for whom this love is.

PHM	1	9	sb31		δέσμιος Χριστοῦ Ἰησοῦ	1		Paul was in prison because people in authority did not want him to preach about Jesus. They put him there in order to stop him and to punish him.

PHM	1	10	mui3	figs-metaphor	τέκνου, ὃν ἐγέννησα	1	whom I have fathered in my chains	Here, **fathered** is a metaphor that means that Onesimus became a believer as Paul taught him about Christ. Alternate translation: “who received new life and became my spiritual son when I taught him about Christ” or “who became a spiritual son to me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
PHM	1	10	nx1p	figs-metonymy	ἐν τοῖς δεσμοῖς	1	in my chains	Prisoners were often bound in **chains**. Paul was in prison when he taught Onesimus and was still in prison when he wrote this letter. Alternate translation: “here in prison” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
PHM	1	12	t1kp		ὃν ἀνέπεμψά σοι	1	I sent him back to you	Paul was probably sending Onesimus with another believer who carried this letter.
PHM	1	12	fdwn	figs-metaphor	τὰ ἐμὰ σπλάγχνα	1	my inward parts	The phrase **this one is my inward parts** is a metaphor for deep feelings about someone. Paul was saying this about Onesimus. Alternate translation: “this is a person whom I love dearly” or “this person is very special to me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
PHM	1	12	yn1d	figs-metonymy	τὰ ἐμὰ σπλάγχνα	1		Here, ** inward parts** is figurative for the place of a person’s emotions. If your language has a similar figure, then use that.

PHM	1	13	t4xl		ἵνα ὑπὲρ σοῦ μοι διακονῇ	1	so that he might serve me on behalf of you	Paul knows that Philemon wants to help him, and so he suggests that a way to do that would be to allow Onesimus to serve Paul in prison.

PHM	1	13	bb3t	figs-metonymy	ἐν τοῖς δεσμοῖς	1	in the chains	Prisoners were often bound in **chains**. Paul was in prison when he told Onesimus about the Messiah, and he was still in prison when he wrote this letter. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
PHM	1	13	vver	figs-explicit	ἐν τοῖς δεσμοῖς τοῦ εὐαγγελίου	1		Paul was in prison because he preached **the gospel** publicly. You can state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “in the chains that they put on me because I preach the gospel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
PHM	1	14	ngg8	figs-abstractnouns	ἵνα μὴ ὡς κατὰ ἀνάγκην τὸ ἀγαθόν σου ᾖ	1	but according to good will	If your readers would misunderstand the abstract noun **compulsion**, you could express the idea behind it with a verb. Alternate translation: “for I did not want you to do this good deed because I commanded you to do it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
PHM	1	14	fg6l	figs-abstractnouns	ἀλλὰ κατὰ ἑκούσιον.	1		If your readers would misunderstand the abstract noun **will**, you could express the idea behind it with a verb. Alternate translation: “but because you wanted to do it” or “but because you freely chose to do the right thing” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
PHM	1	15	tcrd	figs-activepassive	τάχα γὰρ διὰ τοῦτο, ἐχωρίσθη πρὸς ὥραν, ἵνα	1		If your language does not use this passive form, you can state this in active form. Alternate translation: “For perhaps the reason that God took Onesimus away from you for a time was so that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
PHM	1	15	bx4q	figs-idiom	πρὸς ὥραν	1		Here, the phrase **for an hour** is an idiom meaning “for a short time.” If your readers would misunderstand this phrase, you could use an equivalent idiom or use plain language. Alternate translation: “for this short time” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
PHM	1	16	l3e4		ὑπὲρ δοῦλον	1	better than a slave	Alternate translation: “more valuable than a slave” or “more dear than a slave”
PHM	1	16	dg1w		οὐκέτι ὡς δοῦλον	1		This does not mean that Onesimus will no longer be a slave to Philemon. If your readers would misunderstand this phrase, you can use a word such as “just” or “only.” Alternate translation: “no longer only as a slave”

PHM	1	16	scj1		ἐν Κυρίῳ	1	in the Lord	Alternate translation: “in the fellowship of brotherhood through Jesus” or “in the fellowship of believers in the Lord”
PHM	1	17	e1j2	grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἰ…με ἔχεις κοινωνόν	1	if you have me as a partner	Paul is writing in a way that makes it seem as though it is possible that Philemon does not consider that Paul is his partner, but he knows that Philemon does consider Paul to be his partner. This is a way of getting Philemon to agree on one thing (that Paul is a partner) so that he will agree to the other thing (to receive Onesimus). If your language does not state something as uncertain if it is certain or true, and if your readers might misunderstand and think that what Paul is saying is not certain, then you can translate his words as an affirmative statement. Alternate translation: “since you have me as a partner” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
PHM	1	17	e0es	grammar-connect-logic-result	οὖν	1		**Therefore** means that what came before this word is the reason for what comes after it. It may be that Paul intends for everything that came before to be the reason, because this word also indicates that Paul is now coming to the main point of the letter. Use a natural method in your language to indicate this transition. Alternate translation: “Because of all of these things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
PHM	1	17	d56r	figs-ellipsis	προσλαβοῦ αὐτὸν ὡς ἐμέ.	1		Paul is leaving out some of the words here that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete. If your readers would misunderstand this phrase, you could supply these words from the context. Alternate translation: “receive him just as you would receive me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
PHM	1	18	nq4j	grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἰ δέ τι ἠδίκησέν σε ἢ ὀφείλει	1		Onesimus certainly did wrong to Philemon by running away, and he probably also stole some of Philemon’s property. But Paul is stating these things as uncertain in order to be polite. If your language does not use a conditional statement in this way, then use a more natural way to state this. Alternate translation: “But whatever he has taken or whatever wrong he has done to you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
PHM	1	18	w4ys		εἰ δέ τι ἠδίκησέν σε ἢ ὀφείλει	1		These two phrases mean similar things, although **wronged you** is more general than **owes you**. If it would be more natural in your language, you can put the more general phrase second. Alternate translation: “But if he owes you anything or has wronged you in any way”
PHM	1	18	j3ou		τοῦτο ἐμοὶ ἐλλόγα.	1		Alternate translation: “I will take responsibility for repaying you” or “say that I am the one who owes you”
PHM	1	19	wb53		ἐγὼ Παῦλος ἔγραψα τῇ ἐμῇ χειρί	1	I, Paul, write this with my own hand	Paul wrote this part with his **own hand** so that Philemon would know that these words were really from Paul, and that Paul really would pay him. He used the past tense here because the action of writing would be in the past when Philemon read the letter. Use the tense that is most natural in your language. Alternate translation: “I, Paul, write this myself.”
PHM	1	19	gn6c	figs-irony	ἵνα μὴ λέγω σοι	1	in order not to say to you	Paul says that he will not say something to Philemon while saying it. This is a polite way of emphasizing the truth of what Paul is telling him. If your language would not use irony like this, then use a more natural expression. Alternate translation: “I do not need to remind you” or “You already know” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])
PHM	1	19	st7e	figs-explicit	καὶ σεαυτόν μοι προσοφείλεις	1	you also owe me your own self	Paul was implying that whatever Onesimus or Paul owed to Philemon was canceled by the larger amount that Philemon owed to Paul, which was Philemon’s own life. The reason that Philemon owed Paul his life can be made explicit. Alternate translation: “you even owe me your own life” or “you owe me much more because I saved your life” or “you owe me your own life because I told you about Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
PHM	1	20	mw03	figs-metaphor	ἀδελφέ	1		Here, **brother** is a metaphor for a fellow believer. Alternate translation: “spiritual brother” or “brother in Christ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
PHM	1	20	cqd0	figs-metaphor	ἐν Κυρίῳ	1		See how you translated **in the Lord** in verse 16. This metaphor refers to being a believer in Jesus and means the same as **in Christ**. Alternate translation: “as you serve the Lord” or “because we are fellow believers in the Lord” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
PHM	1	20	xp0b	figs-explicit	ἀνάπαυσόν μου τὰ σπλάγχνα ἐν Χριστῷ	1	refresh my inward parts in Christ	How Paul wanted Philemon to refresh him can be made explicit. Alternate translation: “refresh my inward parts in Christ by accepting Onesimus kindly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
PHM	1	20	j8lh	figs-metaphor	ἀνάπαυσόν μου τὰ σπλάγχνα	1	refresh my inward parts	Here, **refresh** is a metaphor for comfort or encourage. Alternate translation: “encourage me” or “comfort me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
PHM	1	20	kmpp	figs-metonymy	ἀνάπαυσόν μου τὰ σπλάγχνα	1	refresh my inward parts	Here, **inward parts** is a metonym for a person’s feelings, thoughts, or inner being. Alternate translation: “encourage me” or “comfort me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
