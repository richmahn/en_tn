# Jesus who is called Justus

This is a man who also worked with Paul.

# These alone of the circumcision are my fellow workers for the kingdom of God

Paul uses "circumcision" here to refer to Jews because, under the Old Testament law, all male Jews had to be circumcised. Alternate translation: "These three men are the only Jewish believers working with me to proclaim God as king through Christ Jesus" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# These alone of the circumcision

"These men—Aristarchus, Mark, and Justus—alone of the circumcision"
