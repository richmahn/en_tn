# General Information:

Onesimus was a slave of Philemon in Colossae. He had stolen money from Philemon and run away to Rome where he became a Christian through the ministry of Paul. Now Tychicus and Onesimus are the ones bringing Paul's letter to Colossae.

# Connecting Statement:

Paul closes with special instructions about certain people as well as greetings to and from individual believers.

# the things concerning me

"everything that has been happening to me"

# fellow slave

"fellow servant." Though Paul is a free man, he sees himself as a servant of Christ and sees Tychicus as a fellow servant.
