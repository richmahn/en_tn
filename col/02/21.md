# Connecting Statement:

The rhetorical question that begins with the words "why do you live as obligated to the world" in verse 20 ends here.

# "Do ... touch"?

The rhetorical question that begins with the words "why do you live as obligated to the world" in verse 20 ends here. Paul uses this question to rebuke the Colossians for following the false beliefs of the world. "you should not live as obligated to the world: 'Do ... touch'!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# "Do not handle, nor taste, nor touch"

Paul is quoting what other people have been telling the Colossians. "why do you believe them when they say, 'Do not handle, nor taste, nor touch'?" or "you should not obey them when they say, 'Do not handle, nor taste, nor touch'"
