# why do you live as obligated to the world: "Do ... touch"?

Paul used this question to rebuke the Colossians for following the false beliefs of the world. Alternate translation: "stop submitting to the world's beliefs! Stop believing them when they say, 'Do ... touch'!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
