# Be rooted ... be built ... be established ... abound

These words explain what it means to "walk in him." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# Be rooted in him

Paul speaks of a person with true faith in Christ as if that person were a tree growing in solid ground with deep roots. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# be built on him

Paul speaks of a person with true faith in Christ as if that person were a building that has a strong foundation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# be established in faith

"trust in Jesus for everything"

# just as you were taught

This is best stated without naming or otherwise calling attention to the teacher, who was Epaphras ([Colossians 1:7](../01/07.md)). Alternate translation: "just as you learned" or "just as they taught you" or "just as he taught you"

# abound in thanksgiving

Paul speaks of thanksgiving as if it were objects that a person could obtain more of. Alternate translation: "be very thankful to God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
