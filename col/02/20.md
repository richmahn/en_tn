# If you died together with Christ to the elements of the world

With this metaphor, Paul speaks of a believer as a person who is spiritually united with Christ: as Christ died, so the believer has spiritually died; as Christ has come back to life, so the believer has come back to spiritual life, that is, to responsiveness to God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# why do you live as obligated to the world: "Do ... touch"?

Paul used this question to rebuke the Colossians for following the false beliefs of the world. AT: "stop submitting to the world's beliefs! Stop believing them when they say, 'Do ... touch'!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# live as obligated to the world

"think you must obey the desires of the world"

# the world

the thoughts, desires, and assumptions of the sinful majority of the world's people (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# are destined for corruption

"perish." Paul uses a metaphor here of a body rotting ("corrupting") in the grave. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# These rules have the wisdom of self-made religion and humility and severity of the body

"These rules seem wise to unbelieving people because they allow those who follow them to appear humble because they hurt their own bodies"

# have no value against the indulgence of the flesh

"do not help you stop following your human desires"
