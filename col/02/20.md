# If you died together with Christ to the elements of the world

With this metaphor, Paul speaks of a believer as a person who is spiritually united with Christ: as Christ died, so the believer has spiritually died; as Christ has come back to life, so the believer has come back to spiritual life, that is, to responsiveness to God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# why do you live as obligated to the world: "Do ... touch"?

Paul used this question to rebuke the Colossians for following the false beliefs of the world. AT: "stop submitting to the world's beliefs! Stop believing them when they say, 'Do ... touch'!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# live as obligated to the world

"think you must obey the desires of the world"

# the world

the thoughts, desires, and assumptions of the sinful majority of the world's people (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
