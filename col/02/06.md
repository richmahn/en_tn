# walk in him

Walking on a path is a metaphor for how a person lives his life. The words "in him" refer to being in close relationship with Christ and so doing what pleases him. AT: "live your lives the way he wants you to" or "live so that people can see that you belong to him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
