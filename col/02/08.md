## translationNotes

* **See that** - be cautious. This could be translated as "Beware" or "Watch out that".
* **captures you** - This metaphor compares the way a person can be physically caught and held by force to how a person can be emotionally and spiritually caught and captured by false teachings. (See:[[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **captures you** - "captures you, Colossian believers"
* **philosophy** - the religious doctrines and beliefs that are not from God's word but are based on man's thoughts about God and life.
* **empty deceit** - misleading ideas that do not lead to life in christ. They produce nothing, they are empty or without value.
* **human tradition and upon sinful belief systems of the world** - Both Jewish traditions and pagan (gentile) belief systems are worthless.
* **after Christ** - "according to Christ". Only those belief systems based on Christ have value.
* **because all the fullness of God's nature lives in his body.** - "God's full nature lives in Christ's body." Not to be confused with all of God's nature dwelling in Christ, which is not true.
