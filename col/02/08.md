# Connecting Statement:

Paul urges the believers to be careful not to turn to the words and rules of others because nothing can add to the fullness of God that believers have in Christ.

# See that

"Make sure that"

# captures you

Paul speaks of the way a person can believe false teachings (because they believe false things or love the wrong things) as if someone had physically caught and held that person by force. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# philosophy

religious doctrines and beliefs that are not from God's word but are based on man's thoughts about God and life

# empty deceit

Paul speaks of false ideas that produce nothing and so are without value as though they are containers with nothing in them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the tradition of men ... the elements of the world

Both Jewish traditions and pagan (Gentile) belief systems are worthless. "The elements of the world" perhaps refers to evil spirits that claimed to rule the world and that were adored by people. But some interpreters view "the elements of the world" as people's basic teachings about the world.

#  in him all the fullness of God lives in bodily form

"God's total nature lives in physical form in Christ"
