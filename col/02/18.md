## translationNotes

* **Let no one be robbed of a prizeâ€‹** - "Let no one be cheated out of their prize." This metaphor compares people who teach false humility and worshiping of angels to robbers who steal the Colossians' salvation. This passive phrase could be translated in active form as "Do not let anyone steal someone's reward." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]], [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
* **false humility** - "voluntary humility." Doing things that make you appear to be humble to others. It could be translated "pious self-denial."
* **obsesses about things** - Having thoughts that constantly control the mind or being excessively preoccupied with something.
* **fleshly thinking** - Thinking as a natural or sinful person rather than as a spiritual person.
* **hold on to** - "firmly grasp" or "cling to" just as a child firmly holds on to his parent.
* **Christ, the head, from whom the whole body is supplied and held together through joints and ligaments** - This metaphor compares the authority of Christ over the Church to a human head which controls and governs all of the body. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
