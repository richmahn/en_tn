# In him all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden

Only Christ can reveal God's true wisdom and knowledge. This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "God has hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge in Christ" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# the treasures of wisdom and knowledge

Paul speaks of God's wisdom and knowledge as if they were material wealth. Alternate translation: "the very precious wisdom and knowledge" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# wisdom and knowledge

These words mean basically the same thing here. Paul uses them together to emphasize that all spiritual understanding comes from Christ. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
