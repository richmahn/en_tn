# Connecting Statement:

Paul continues to encourage the believers in Colossae and Laodicea to understand that Christ is God and that he lives in believers, so they should live in the same way they received him.

# how great a struggle I have had for you

Paul has exerted much effort in developing their purity and understanding of the gospel.

# those at Laodicea

This was a city very close to Colossae where there was also a church for which Paul was praying.

# as many as have not seen my face in the flesh

Here "face in the flesh" represents the person as a whole. AT: "all those who have never seen me personally" or "all those whom I have never met face to face" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
