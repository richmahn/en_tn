# in eating or in drinking

The law of Moses included what one can eat and drink. "for what you eat or what you drink"

# about a feast day or a new moon, or about Sabbath days

The law of Moses specified the days to celebrate, to worship, and to offer sacrifice. "for the way you celebrate feast days or new moons or the Sabbath"

# a shadow of the things to come

A shadow gives only a vague idea of the shape and nature of an object. In a similar way, religious traditions such as the law of Moses can only partially show the reality of Jesus Christ. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the substance

Here this means "the reality," the thing that casts the "shadow."
