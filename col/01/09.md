# Connecting Statement:

Because the Spirit has enabled them to love others, Paul prays for them and tells them here how he prays for them.

# Because of this love

"Because the Holy Spirit has enabled you to love other believers"

# we heard ... we have not stopped ... We have been asking ... We have been praying

These words do not include the Colossians. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

# from the day we heard this

"from the day Epaphras told us these things"

# that you will be filled with the knowledge of his will

Paul speaks of the Colossian believers as though they were containers. AT: "that God will fill you with what you need to know so that you can do his will" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# in all wisdom and spiritual understanding

", so that the Holy Spirit will make you wise and able to understand what God wants you to do"

# that you will walk worthily of the Lord

Walking here signifies behavior in life. AT: "that you will live the way God expects you to" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# in pleasing ways

"in ways that will please the Lord"

# will bear fruit

Paul is speaking of the Colossian believers as if they were trees or plants. As a plant grows and bears fruit, so also believers are to keep getting to know God better and doing good deeds. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
