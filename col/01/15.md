# He is the image of the invisible God

"His Son is the image of the invisible God." Here "image" does not mean a representation of something that is visible. Instead, "image" here means that by knowing the Son, we learn what God the Father is like. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the firstborn of all creation

The expression "firstborn" does not refer to when Jesus was born. Instead, it refers to his position as the eternal Son of God the Father. In this sense, "firstborn" is a metaphor meaning "most important." Jesus is the most important and the unique Son of God. Alternate Translation: "God's Son, the most important one over all creation" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# all creation

The noun "creation" can be translated with a verb. Alternate Translation: "all that God created" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnoun]])
