These things are spoken of as if they were physical objects that God was keeping in heaven for the believers to possess later.

# This gospel is bearing fruit and is growing

Paul is speaking here of the gospel as if it were a tree or plant that grows and produces food. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

This is a generalization referring to the part of the world that they knew about. AT: "throughout the world" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
