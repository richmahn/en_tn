# He himself is before all things

"It is he who existed before all things"

# in him all things hold together

Paul is speaking here of the Son controlling all things as if he were physically holding them together. "he holds everything together" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
