# We pray

The word "we" refers to Paul and Timothy but not to the Colossians. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

# into all perseverance and patience

Paul speaks of the Colossian believers as if God would move them into a location of perseverance and patience. In reality, he is praying that they will never stop trusting in God and that they will be completely patient as they honor him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
