# We pray

The word "we" refers to Paul and Timothy but not to the Colossians. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

# into all perseverance and patience

Paul speaks of the Colossian believers as if God would move them into a location of perseverance and patience. In reality, he is praying that they will never stop trusting in God and that they will be completely patient as they honor him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# has made you able to have a share

"has allowed you to share"

# has made you able

Here Paul is focusing on his readers as receivers of God's blessings. But he does not mean that he himself has no share in those blessings.

# inheritance

Receiving what God has promised believers is spoken of as if it were inheriting property and wealth from a family member. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# in light

This idea is opposite to the idea of the dominion of darkness in the next verse. AT: "in the glory of his presence" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
