# our beloved ... our behalf ... to us

The words "our" and "us" do not include the Colossians. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

# your love in the Spirit

Paul speaks of the Holy Spirit as if he were a place in which the believers were located. Alternate translation: "how the Holy Spirit has enabled you to love believers" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
