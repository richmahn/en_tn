# in whom

Paul often speaks as if the believers were "in" Jesus Christ or "in" God. This can be translated as the beginning of a new sentence. Alternate translation: "by means of whom" or "By means of his Son" or "Because of his Son" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins

The nouns "redemption" and "forgiveness" can be translated as verbs. Alternate translation: "we are redeemed; our sins are forgiven" or "God redeems us; he forgives our sins" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnoun])
