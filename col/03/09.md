# Connecting Statement:

Paul continues to tell the believers how to live and reminds them that Christians should treat everyone according to the same standard.

# you have taken off the old man with its practices

Here Paul is speaking of a Christian's rejecting his old sinful life as if it were an old garment that he takes off in order to put on a new garment. It was very common for Israelites such as Paul to speak of moral qualities as if they were pieces of clothing. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
