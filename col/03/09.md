## translationNotes

* **you have stripped off** - The word "you" refers to the Colossian believers.
* **you have stripped off your old self with its practices, and you have put on your new self ** - This metaphor contrasts the Christian who is to remove ungodly behavior and to begin acting godly to that of the person who removes dirty clothes and puts on new clean clothes. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **his image** - This is a metonym for Jesus Christ. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
* **the knowledge of his image ** - To know and understand Jesus Christ.
* **there is no Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, freeman ** - This is saying that God sees every person alike; not race, religion, nationality or caste (social status). This could be translated "Here race, religion, culture and social status do not matter".
* **Christ is all things and in all things** - Nothing is excluded or left out of the existence of Christ. It can be translated as "Christ is all important."
