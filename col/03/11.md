# there is no Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, freeman

These terms are examples of the categories of people that Paul says do not matter for God. God sees every person alike, not by race, religion, nationality, or social status. Alternate translation: "race, religion, culture, and social status do not matter" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# barbarian

a foreigner who does not know local customs

# Scythian

This is someone from the land of Scythia, which was outside the Roman Empire. Greeks and Romans used this word for someone who grew up in a place where everyone did wicked things all the time.

# Christ is all, and is in all

Nothing is excluded or left out of the rule of Christ. Alternate translation: "Christ is all important and lives in all his people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
