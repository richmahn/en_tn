# So the word of Yahweh

"So Yahweh's message"

# command upon command, command upon command; rule upon rule, rule upon rule; here a little, there a little

These are the words that the drunk priests and prophets used to criticize how Isaiah teaches them. See how you translated this in [Isaiah 28:10](./10.md).

# so that they may go and fall backward, and be broken, ensnared, and captured

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "in order that the army of Assyria will come and defeat them and take them as captives" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# go and fall backward, and be broken

People losing in battle to the enemy army is spoken of as if the people will fall down and break. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# ensnared

The enemy soldiers capturing the people of Israel is spoken of as if they were hunters that catch an animal in a snare. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
