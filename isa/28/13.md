## So the word of Yahweh ##

AT: "So Yahweh's message"

## command upon command, command upon command; rule upon rule, rule upon rule; here a little, there a little ##

See how you translated this in [Isaiah 28:9](./09.md).

## so that they may go and fall backward, and be broken, ensnared, and captured ##

AT: "in order that the army of Assyria will come and defeat them and take them as captives." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
