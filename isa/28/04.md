# that is on the head of the rich valley

The city of Samaria, the capital of Israel, sits above a fertile valley. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# will be as the first ripe fig ... gulps it down

This speaks of the enemy soldiers seeing the beauty of Samaria and quickly plundering it as if they were a person who sees the first fig of the season and quickly eats it. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
