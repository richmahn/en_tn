"Listen to this"

# I will lay in Zion a foundation stone ... sure foundation

Yahweh sending a strong person to help the people of Israel is spoken of as if Yahweh is constructing a strong foundation for a building. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# a tried stone

"a stone that is solid"

# a sure foundation

"a firm support"

# He who believes will not be ashamed

"Anyone who trusts in this foundation stone will not be sorry"
