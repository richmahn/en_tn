# General Information:

Isaiah continues to speak about the people and the city of Samaria as if they were a garland. (See: [Isaiah 28:1-2](./01.md))

# The proud garland of the drunkards of Ephraim will be trodden underfoot

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "The enemy army will crush the proud drunkards of Samaria as if they were crushing flowers under their feet" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# proud garland ... of Ephraim ... that is on the head of the rich valley

A "garland" is a crown made of flowers. Here it represents the city of Samaria, the capital of Israel, which sits above a fertile valley. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# will be as the first ripe fig ... gulps it down

This speaks of the enemy soldiers seeing the beauty of Samaria and quickly plundering it as if they were a person who sees the first fig of the season and quickly eats it. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
