## translationNotes

* **So listen to the word of Yahweh** - AT: "So listen to Yahweh's message." Isaiah now speaks to the leaders of Jerusalem.
* **We have made a covenant with death; with Sheol we have reached an agreement** - Isaiah quotes the leaders who believe nothing bad will happen. They describe death and Sheol as a person that makes a covenant with them. AT: "Nothing bad will ever happen to us in Jerusalem. It is like we made a deal with death itself." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
* **So when the overflowing judgment passes through, it will not reach us** - AT: "As a result when God judges the people, and the enemy army comes like a flood, it will not harm us." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **for we have made a lie our refuge, and in falsehood we have hidden** - AT: "for we trust in a lie and it will protect us."
