# Woe to the proud garland ... on the head of the lush Valley of those who are overcome with wine

A "garland" is a crown made of flowers. Here it represents the city of Samaria, the capital of Israel, which sits above a fertile valley. Samaria and its people being destroyed is spoken of as if the flowers in the garland will grow old and stop being beautiful. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
