# Isaiah 28 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations set each line of poetry further to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetry in this chapter.

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter ####

##### Metaphors #####
There are many metaphors used to describe Yahweh's punishment as well as the sin of the people of Ephraim. In one such metaphor, they are described as being drunk. Construction and weather metaphors are also used in this chapter. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### "That day" #####
This is a common phrase in this section of Isaiah. This chapter appears to prophesy about a time of restoration when the messiah will reign. This chapter pictures a time of great peace and harmony in the world. The translator does not need to add an explanation, but should try to maintain the tense of the original text, as a future or uncompleted action. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/restore]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/christ]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/fulfill]])
