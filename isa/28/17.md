Yahweh continues to compare what he will do for the people in Jerusalem to a builder setting up a building. (See: [Isaiah 28:16](./16.md))

## I will make justice the measuring stick ##

A builder uses a measuring stick to determine if something is the correct length. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## and righteousness the plumbline ##

A builder uses a plumbline to determine if something is straight upright and level. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## Hail will sweep away the refuge of lies, and floodwaters will overwhelm the hiding place ##

See how you translated the similar word "hailstorm" in [Isaiah 28:1](./01.md). AT: "The enemy army will come like a hailstorm and a flood, and they will destroy you and everything you thought would protect you."
