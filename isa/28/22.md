# Now

This does not mean "at this moment," but is used to draw attention to the important point that follows.

# your bonds will be tightened

Yahweh punishing the people even more severely is spoken of as if he would tighten their bonds. This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "Yahweh will tighten your bonds" or "Yahweh will punish you even more severely" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# Yahweh of hosts

See how you translated this in [Isaiah 1:9](../01/09.md).

# a decree of destruction on the earth

This can be reworded so that the abstract noun "destruction" is expressed as the verb "destroy." Alternate translation: "that he is going to destroy people throughout the land" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
