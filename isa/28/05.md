# Yahweh of hosts

See how you translated this in [Isaiah 1:9](../01/09.md).

# will become a beautiful crown and a diadem of beauty

Yahweh is spoken of as if he were to become a beautiful crown that the people who honor him as their true king would wear. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# a beautiful crown and a diadem of beauty

These mean the same thing. AT: "a beautiful crown" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
