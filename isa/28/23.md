Isaiah continues to speak to the people of Jerusalem.

## Pay attention and listen to my voice; be attentive and listen to my words ##

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## Does a farmer who plows all day to sow, only plow the ground? Does he continually break up and harrow the field? ##

In this parable Isaiah uses questions to make them think deeply. AT: "A farmer does not plow the ground over and over. He does not only continue to work on the soil." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
