Isaiah continue telling a parable to the people of Jerusalem. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])

## When he has prepared the ground ##

AT: "When the farmer has plowed the soil"

## does he not scatter caraway seed, sow the cumin, put in the wheat in rows and the barley in the right place, and the spelt at its edges ##

Isaiah uses a question to make the people of Jerusalem think deeply. AT: "then he plants each kind of seed in the correct way." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## caraway...cumin...barley...spelt ##

These are all names of plants. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

## His God instructs him; he teaches him wisely ##

AT: "Yahweh helps the farmer know how to care for each kind of plant"
