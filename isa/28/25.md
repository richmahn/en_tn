# General Information:

Isaiah continues telling a parable to the people of Jerusalem. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])

# When he has prepared the ground

"When the farmer has plowed the soil"

# does he not scatter caraway seed, sow the cumin, put in the wheat in rows and the barley in the right place, and the spelt at its edges?

Isaiah uses a question to make the people of Jerusalem think deeply. If your language does not have a word for each of these seeds, they can be stated more generally. AT: "he will certainly plant each kind of seed in the correct way and in the proper places." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# caraway ... cumin

These are names of plants that are spices. Translators may represent them in general as seeds of spices used to spice food. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

# wheat ... barley ... spelt

These are all names of plants that are grains. Translators may represent them in general as seeds of grains. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

# His God instructs him; he teaches him wisely

These two phrases mean basically the same thing. AT: "Yahweh helps the farmer know how to care for each kind of plant" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
