# But even these

"But even the leaders"

# The priest and the prophet

This does not mean a specific priest or prophet. It refers to priests and prophets in general. AT: "The priests and the prophets" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])

# reel with wine, and stagger with strong drink

These two phrases mean basically the same thing and emphasize that the priests and the prophets cannot do their job because they are very drunk. AT: "stumble around because they are drunk" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# they are swallowed up by wine

Their drinking so much that they can no longer think properly is spoken of as if the wine swallowed them. This can be stated in active form. AT: "the wine is causing them to be confused" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# staggering in vision and reeling in decision

Just like they are too drunk to walk correctly, they are too drunk to understand the visions God gives them or to make good decisions.
