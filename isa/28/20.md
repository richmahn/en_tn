Yahweh continues to speak to the people of Jerusalem.

## For the bed is too short for a man to stretch out on, and the blanket too narrow for him to wrap himself in ##

Yahweh is emphasizing that trusting in lies will always cause the people to be disappointed. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## Yahweh will rise up ##

Isaiah is now speaking.

## Mount Perazim...Valley of Gibeon ##

These refer to times when God miraculously defeated enemy armies.  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

## his strange work...his strange deed ##

This work is strange because God is using a foreign army to defeat the people of Jerusalem. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
