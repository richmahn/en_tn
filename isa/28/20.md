# General Information:

Yahweh continues to speak to the people of Jerusalem.

# For the bed is too short for a man to stretch out on, and the blanket too narrow for him to wrap himself in

This was probably a proverb that the people knew at the time. It means that what they believe will keep them safe from Yahweh's punishment will disappoint them like a bed that is too short or a blanket that is too narrow. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-proverbs]])

# Yahweh will rise up

Yahweh preparing to act is spoken of as if he were sitting and then rising up. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# Mount Perazim ... Valley of Gibeon

These refer to places where God miraculously defeated enemy armies. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# he will rouse himself

"he will become very angry"

# his strange work ... his strange deed

These two phrases mean the same thing. This work is strange because God is using a foreign army to defeat the people of Jerusalem rather than helping the people of Jerusalem defeat their enemies. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
