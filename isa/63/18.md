# General Information:

The people of Israel continue speaking.

# who were never called by your name

This can be stated in active form. The word "name" refers to a family relationship. AT: "who never belonged to your family" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# We have become ... called by your name

Some modern versions interpret this passage differently: "We are like the people over whom you have not ruled, like those who have not been called by your name."
