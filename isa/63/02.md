# Why are your clothes red, and why ... winepress?

This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: "The red on your clothing looks makes you look like you have been treading on grapes in a winepress." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# winepress

A winepress is a low place carved out of rock in the ground where workers step on the grapes to crush them with their feet, in order to remove the grape juice.
