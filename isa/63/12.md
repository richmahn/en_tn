The people of Israel continue speaking.

## who made his glorious power go with the right hand of Moses ##

Here "arm" represents the power of Yahweh. This means it was God's power that enabled Moses to split the Reed Sea. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## Like a horse running on flat land, they did not stumble ##

This means that the people of Israel were sure-footed as horses in open country on their travels toward Israel from Egypt. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
