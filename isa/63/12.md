## translationNotes

* The people of Israel continue speaking.
* **who made his glorious power go with the right hand of Moses** - Here "arm" represents the power of Yahweh. This means it was God's power that enabled Moses to split the Reed Sea. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
* **Like a horse running on flat land, they did not stumble** - This means that the people of Israel were sure-footed as horses in open country on their travels toward Israel from Egypt. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
