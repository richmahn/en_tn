# General Information:

The people of Israel continue speaking.

# Yahweh, why do you make us wander from your ways and harden our hearts, so we do not obey you?

Here the writer uses a question to express a complaint of the people to God. This question can be translated as a statement. AT: "Yahweh, you have made us wander from your ways and become stubborn so that we do not obey you." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# why do you make us wander from your ways

To not do what Yahweh commands is spoken of as if a person wanders off of the correct path. AT: "why do you make do what is wrong" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# harden our hearts

This means to become resistant to Yahweh's teaching by refusing to listen and obey. Here "heart" represents their motives, feelings and desires. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
