## Who is this who comes from Edom ##

This Isaiah speaking as a watchman. The question and answer format is a way of presenting this information, but it is not to be understood literally. Isaiah did not actually see Yahweh approaching.

## Bozrah ##

This is the capital city of Edom. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

## It is I ##

Here "I" refers to Yahweh.
