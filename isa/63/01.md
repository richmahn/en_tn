## translationNotes

* **Who is this who comes from Edom** - This Isaiah speaking as a watchman. The question and answer format is a way of presenting this information, but it is not to be understood literally. Isaiah did not actually see Yahweh approaching.
* **Bozrah** - This is the capital city of Edom. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
* **It is I** - Here "I" refers to Yahweh.
