# Who is this who comes from Edom ... Bozrah

Isaiah speaks as a watchman using the question and answer format to present this information about Yahweh's judgment on Edom, an enemy of Israel. This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement. AT: "I, Yahweh, am coming from Edom, clothed in red from Bozrah" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Bozrah

This is the capital city of Edom. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# It is I

Here "I" refers to Yahweh.
