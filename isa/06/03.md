Isaiah continues to describe his vision.

## Each one called to another and said ##

“The seraphim called out to one another” or "The creatures proclaimed to one another"

## Holy, holy, holy ##

Repeating the word "holy" three times indicates God is completely holy. Alternate translation: "He is holy beyond all else" or "He is completely holy." (UDB)

## The whole earth is full of his glory ##

“The glory of Yahweh fills all the earth”
