# General Information:

Isaiah continues to describe his vision.

# Each one called to another and said

"The seraphim called out to one another and said" or "The winged creatures proclaimed to one another"

# Holy, holy, holy, is Yahweh of hosts

Repeating the word "holy" three times indicates God is completely holy. AT: "Yahweh of hosts is holy beyond all else" or "Yahweh of hosts is completely holy"

# The whole earth is full of his glory

This speaks of the earth as if it were a container and glory were the contents in the container. AT: "Everything on the earth is evidence of God's glory" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
