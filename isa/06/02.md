# Above him were the seraphim

The word "seraphim" is the plural of seraph. This means the Lord was seated on the throne and the seraphim were standing or flying near the Lord ready to serve him.

# seraphim

This word suggests that the creatures might have a fiery appearance or resemble snakes. Because we do not know exactly what "seraphim" means, you could translate this as "winged creatures" or "winged living things." Or, you can borrow the word and use it in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate]])

# each one had six wings

The words "wings" and "seraph" are understood. AT: "with two wings each seraph covered his face, and with two wings he covered his feet, and with two wings he flew" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
