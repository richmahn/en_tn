# General Information:

Isaiah continues to describe his vision.

# the voice of the Lord say

Here "voice" represents the Lord himself. Alternate translation: "the Lord say" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# Whom shall I send

It is implied that Yahweh will send someone to speak his message to the people of Israel. Alternate translation: "Whom shall I send to be a messenger to my people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# who will go for us

It seems "us" refers to Yahweh and the members of his heavenly council to whom he is speaking. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-inclusive]])
