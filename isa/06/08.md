Isaiah continues to describe his vision.

## the voice of the Lord say ##

AT: "the Lord say." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

## who will go for us ##

Possible meanings are 1) The word "us" refers to God and his angels. 2) The Lord refers to himself as "us." When a person refers to himself this way, it emphasizes the person's  authority and importance.

## this people ##

"the people of Israel"

## Listen, but do not understand; see, but not perceive ##

"Listen very carefully, but may you not understand; look very carefully, but may you not know."
