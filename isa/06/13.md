# it will again be destroyed

This can be stated in active form. AT: "armies will again destroy the land of Israel" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# as a terebinth or an oak is cut down and whose trunk remains, the holy seed is in its stump

This simile means that even after Yahweh destroys Israel, he will still set apart people from among the Israelites to serve him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
