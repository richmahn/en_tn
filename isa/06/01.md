## translationNotes

* **on a high and elevated throne** - The words "high" and "elevated" mean the same thing and are used to emphasize that the throne was "very high" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])(See the other three other similar examples in Isaiah 33:10, 52:13 and 57:15.)
* **the hem of his robe** - "the edge of his garment"
* **filled the temple** - "filled the palace." The word used for temple here is often used to refer to the palace of kings.
* **Seraphim** - This word suggests that the creatures might have a fiery appearance or resemble snakes. Because we do not know exactly what "seraphim" means, you could translate these as "creatures" or "living things" or "beings". (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
* **each one had six wings** - "each seraph had six wings" or "each creature had six wings"
* **with two each covered** - The words "wings" and "seraph" are left out of this phrase, but they are understood. AT: "with two wings each seraph covered." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
* **with two he covered his feet** - AT: "with two wings each seraph covered his feet"
* **with two he flew** - AT: "with two wings each seraph flew"
