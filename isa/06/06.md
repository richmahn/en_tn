# General Information:

Isaiah continues to describe his vision.

# seraphim

This word suggests that the creatures might have a fiery appearance or resemble snakes. Because we do not know exactly what "seraphim" means, you could translate these as "creatures" or "living things" or "beings." Or you can borrow the word and use it in your language. See how you translated this word in [Isaiah 6:2](./01.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate]])

# tongs

a tool used for grabbing or holding objects

# your guilt has been taken away, and your sin atoned for

These two phrases say basically the same thing. This can be stated in active form. AT: "Yahweh has taken away your guilt and has forgiven your sins" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# your guilt has been taken away

Yahweh no longer considering a person to be guilty is spoken of as if "guilt" were an object that someone could take away from someone else. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
