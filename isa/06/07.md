# your guilt has been taken away, and your sin atoned for

These two phrases say basically the same thing. This can be stated in active form. AT: "Yahweh has taken away your guilt and has forgiven your sins" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# your guilt has been taken away

Yahweh no longer considering a person to be guilty is spoken of as if "guilt" were an object that someone could take away from someone else. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
