Isaiah continues to describe his vision.

## The doors and the thresholds shook at the voices of those who were crying out ##

“When the seraphim called out, their voices shook the foundations under the doorways"

## and the house was filled with smoke ##

AT: “and smoke filled the temple" or "and smoke filled the palace." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## Woe is me! For I am doomed because I am a man of unclean lips, and I live among a people of unclean lips, because my eyes have seen the King, Yahweh, Commander of the angel armies!" ##

AT: "What great trouble I am in! For my eyes have seen Yahweh, Commander of the angel armies, but I am a man of unclean lips, and I live among a people of unclean lips."

## unclean lips ##

AT: "who says things that are sinful" or "who says things that are not right." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## because my eyes have seen ##

AT: "I have seen." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
