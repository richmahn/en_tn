The Lord is speaking to Isaiah

## Make the heart of this people calloused ##

"Make their minds dull"

## and make their ears deaf, and blind their eyes ##

"and make it so that they cannot hear, and make it so that they cannot see."

## and then turn again ##

"and follow me again" or "and then start trusting in me again"

## and be healed ##

AT: "and I would heal them." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
