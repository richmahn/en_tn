## Your dead will live ##

AT: "Your people who have died will live again." Here "your" refers to Yahweh.

## our dead bodies ##

Here "our" refers to Isaiah and all the righteous people. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-inclusive]])

## for your dew is the dew of herbs ##

Yahweh's grace will fall on the people like Spring dew that revives plants after the "death" of winter. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

AT: "and the earth will release the dead to live again"
