# he will bring down those who live proudly

Yahweh humiliating those who are proud is spoken of as if proud people were up high and he would cause them to come down low. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the fortified city

This means fortified cities in general not a specific city. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])

# he will lay low ... he will level

Yahweh causing an army to destroy fortified cities is spoken of as if Yahweh would do it himself. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# It will be trampled down by the feet of the poor and the treading of the needy

Both statements mean the same thing. This can be stated in active form. AT: "The poor and oppressed people will trample on the ruins of the city" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
