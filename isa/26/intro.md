# Isaiah 26 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetry in this chapter.

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### "That day" #####
This is a common phrase in this section of Isaiah. This chapter appears to prophesy about a time of restoration when the messiah will reign. This chapter pictures a time of great peace and harmony in the world. The translator should not add explanation, but should try to maintain the tense of the original text, as a future or uncompleted action. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/restore]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/christ]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/fulfill]])
