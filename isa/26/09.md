# my spirit within me seeks you earnestly

Wanting to know Yahweh and his laws better is spoken of as if the person were seeking to find Yahweh. Alternate translation: "I earnestly want to know you better" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# my spirit within me seeks you earnestly

Here "spirit" represents the speaker as a whole. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
