## The path of the righteous is level...the path of the righteous you make straight ##

Here, obeying God is compared to walking a path. For God to make the path straight emphasizes that God always leads them in truth. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## in the way of your judgments, Yahweh, we wait for you ##
