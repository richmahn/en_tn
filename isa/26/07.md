# The path of the righteous is level ... the path of the righteous you make straight

These two phrases mean basically the same thing. People obeying Yahweh is spoken of as if they were walking on his path. Yahweh ensuring the people that what they do is right is spoken of as if he were making the path level and straight for them.
