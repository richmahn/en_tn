Isaiah continues to compare the suffering of the people of Judah to a woman giving birth. (See: [Isaiah 26:16](./16.md))

## but it is as if we have brought forth only wind ##

AT: "but it is as if we gave birth to nothing" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

## We have not brought salvation to the earth ##

AT: "We have not saved the earth"

## and the inhabitants of the world do not fall ##

AT: "nor have we caused the world to fall"
