# Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? Have they rescued Samaria from my power?

The chief commander uses these questions to ridicule the people of Judah. These questions may be combined and written as a statement. Alternate translation: "The gods of Hamath, Arpad, Sepharvaim, and Samaria did not rescue their people from my power." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Hamath ... Arpad

Translate the names of these cities the same as you did in [Isaiah 10:09](../10/09.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# Sepharvaim

This is the name of a city. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
