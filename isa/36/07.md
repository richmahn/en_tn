# is not he the one whose high places and altars Hezekiah has taken away ... Jerusalem"?

The king of Assyria uses this question to ridicule the people and to imply that Yahweh was angry about what Hezekiah did and would not protect them. This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: "he is the one whose high places and altars Hezekiah has taken away ... Jerusalem." or "he is the one whom Hezekiah insulted by tearing down his high places and altars ... Jerusalem." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# has said to Judah and to Jerusalem, "You must worship before this altar in Jerusalem"?

This can be written as an indirect quote. "Judah" and "Jerusalem" refer to the people who live in them. Alternate translation: "has told the people of Judah and Jerusalem that they must worship only at this altar in Jerusalem."
