# General Information:

This continues the king of Assyria's message to Hezekiah by speaking the message to Hezekiah's men ([Isaiah 36:4-5](./04.md)).

# How could you resist even one captain ... servants?

The chief commander continues to ridicule Hezekiah and his army. When he says "you," referring to Hezekiah, he is actually referring to Hezekiah's army. This question may be written as a statement. Alternate translation: "Your army could not even defeat one captain ... servants." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
