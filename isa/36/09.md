This continues the king of Assyria's message to Hezekiah by speaking the message to Hezekiah's men. (See: [Isaiah 36:4](./04.md))

## How could you resist even one captain ##

The Rabshakeh continues to ridicule Hezekiah and his army. AT: "You could not even defeat one captain"  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## Now then, have I traveled up here without Yahweh to fight against this land and destroy it? ##

The Rabshakeh uses another question to ridicule Hezekiah and the people of Judah. AT: "I came here with Yahweh's command to destroy Jerusalem." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
