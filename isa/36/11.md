AT: "Certainly, my master has sent me to speak this message to you and to all who can hear." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **Has he not sent me to the men who sit on the wall, who will have to ...?** - Rabshakeh continues using a question for emphasis. AT: "My master has sent me to everyone who hears this, who will have to ...."
