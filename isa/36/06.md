# General Information:

This continues the king of Assyria's message to Hezekiah. The chief commander is speaking the message to Hezekiah's men ([Isaiah 36:4-5](./04.md)).

# Look

Sennacherib uses this word to draw Hezekiah's attention to what he says next. Alternate translation: "Listen"

# trusting in Egypt

Here "Egypt" refers to the Egyptian army. Alternate translation: "trusting in the Egyptian army" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# that splintered reed that you use as a walking staff, but if a man leans on it, it will stick into his hand and pierce it

This speaks of Egypt, specifically its army and its Pharaoh, as if it were a splintered reed to emphasize that relying on them would not help them but would only harm them. Alternate translation: "that is like walking with a splintered reed for a staff. If a man leans on it, it will stick into his hand and pierce it" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# splintered reed

A reed is the long, thin stem of a plant like tall grass. If it is splintered or damaged it cannot carry any weight.

# walking staff

This is a stick that someone would use for support when walking, made of whatever kind of tree limb that is found along the way.
