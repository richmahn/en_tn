This continues the king of Assyria's message to Hezekiah. The Rabshakeh is speaking the message to Hezekiah's men. (See: [Isaiah 36:4](./04.md))

## you trust in the walking stick of this bruised reed of Egypt, but if a man leans it will stick into his hand and pierce it ##

The bruised reed of Egypt refers to Pharaoh and the armies of Egypt. The Rabshakeh warns Hezekiah that Egypt will not be able to help and will cause Judah harm. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## bruised reed ##

A reed is the long, thin stem of a plant like tall grass. If it is bruised (damaged) it cannot carry any weight.

## is not he the one whose shrines and altars Hezekiah has taken away, …? ##

The king of Assyria uses this question to ridicule the people and to imply that Yahweh was angry about what Hezekiah did and would not protect them. AT: “He is the one whose shrines and altars Hezekiah has taken away …“ or “He is the one whom Hezekiah insulted by tearing down his shrines and altars” (UDB).  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

## has said to Judah and to Jerusalem, 'You must worship before this altar in Jerusalem ##

“has said to the people of Judah and Jerusalem that they must worship only at the altar in Jerusalem.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
