## translationNotes

* Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.
* **Who among you has announced these things?** - Yahweh uses a question to emphasize that the idols have not told them these things. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **Yahweh's ally will accomplish his purpose against Babylon. He will carry out Yahweh's will against the Chaldeans.** - Both of these clauses mean the same thing and are used for emphasis. Here "ally" refers to Cyrus, the king of Persia. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
* **I, I** - The word "I" is repeated for emphasis.
