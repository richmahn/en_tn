Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.

## Who among you has announced these things? ##

Yahweh uses a question to emphasize that the idols have not told them these things. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## Yahweh's ally will accomplish his purpose against Babylon. He will carry out Yahweh's will against the Chaldeans. ##

Both of these clauses mean the same thing and are used for emphasis. Here "ally" refers to Cyrus, the king of Persia. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## I, I ##

The word "I" is repeated for emphasis.
