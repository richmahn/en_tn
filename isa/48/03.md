Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.

## from my mouth they came forth ##

AT: "I spoke these things" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

## your neck muscles tight as iron, and your forehead like bronze ##

"you have stiff necks and hard heads." Both of these phrases mean the people were stubborn. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

## I declared these things to you beforehand; before they happened I informed you ##

This is also saying the same thing twice for emphasis.  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
