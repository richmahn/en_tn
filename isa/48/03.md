## translationNotes

* Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.
* **from my mouth they came forth** - AT: "I spoke these things" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
* **your neck muscles tight as iron, and your forehead like bronze** - "you have stiff necks and hard heads." Both of these phrases mean the people were stubborn. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]] and [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
* **I declared these things to you beforehand; before they happened I informed you** - This is also saying the same thing twice for emphasis.  (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
