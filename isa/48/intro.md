# Isaiah 48 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations set each line of poetry further to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetry in this chapter.

##### Yahweh and the false gods #####

This chapter is set up to compare Yahweh with various false Gods whom the Israelites worship. There really is no comparison between the two because Yahweh alone is God. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/falsegod]])

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter ####

##### Exile #####
Yahweh explains purpose behind the Jews exile in Babylon, even though it is still in the future. This emphasizes that that Yahweh is much more powerful than the false gods.
