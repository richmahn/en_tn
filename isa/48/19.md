# General Information:

Yahweh continues describing a hypothetical situation to the people of Israel.

# Your descendants would have been as numerous as the sand, and the children from your womb as numerous as the grains of sand

These both mean that the people would have had more descendants than they could count. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# the children from your womb

Yahweh speaks of the descendants of the people of Israel as if they were children to which the nation gives birth. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# their name would not have been cut off nor blotted out

The people of Israel being destroyed is spoken of as if their name had been cut off, as one would cut a piece of cloth or cut a branch from a tree, or blotted out. This can be translated in active form. AT: "I would not have cut off nor blotted out their name" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# their name

Here the word "name" refers to the descendants who would carry on the name of Israel. AT: "they" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# cut off nor blotted out

These two expressions in this context refer to destroying the people. AT: "destroyed" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
