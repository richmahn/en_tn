Yahweh continues describing a hypothetical situation to the people of Israel. (See: [Isaiah 48:17](./17.md).)

## Your descendants would have been as numerous as the sand, and the children from your womb as numerous as the grains of sand ##

These both mean that the people would have had more descendants than they could count.  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

## their name would not have been cut off ##

The people would not have lost their reputations or family histories. AT: "I would not have needed to destroy them"  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
