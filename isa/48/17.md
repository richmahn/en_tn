## your God ##

Here "your" refers to the people of Israel. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

## who leads you by the way that you should go ##

This compares Yahweh telling the people what they should do to a shepherd leading his sheep on the correct path. This means Yahweh cares for the people and wants them to do what is right. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## If only you had obeyed my commandments ##

In 48:18-19 Yahweh describes something that could have happened but did not. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])

## Then your peace and prosperity would have flowed like a river, and your salvation like the waves of the sea ##

Both of these mean their peace and security would have been abundant. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
