# General Information:

Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.

# For the sake of my name I will defer my anger

Here the word "name" refers to Yahweh's reputation. AT: "For the sake of my reputation I will delay my anger" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# for my honor I will hold back from destroying you

This part of the sentence means basically the same thing as the first part. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# Look, I refined you, but not as silver; I have purified you in the furnace of affliction

Yahweh speaks of using affliction to purify his people as if they were precious metals and affliction were a furnace in which he refines them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# for how can I allow my name to be dishonored?

Yahweh uses a question to emphasize that he can never allow his own name to be dishonored. This can be stated in active form. AT: "for I cannot allow anyone to dishonor my name." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
