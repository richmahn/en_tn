# General Information:

Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.

# For the sake of my name I will defer my anger

Here the word "name" refers to Yahweh's reputation. AT: "For the sake of my reputation I will delay my anger" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# for my honor I will hold back from destroying you

This part of the sentence means basically the same thing as the first part. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
