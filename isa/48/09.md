Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.

## For the sake of my name I will defer my anger ##

AT: "For the sake of my reputation I will delay my anger. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## and for my honor I will hold back from destroying you ##

This part of the sentence means basically the same thing as the first part. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## Look, I refined you, but not as silver; I have purified you in the furnace of affliction ##

Just like people put silver in the hot fire to remove dirt and impurities, Yahweh has purified his people from their sinful behavior by making them suffer much. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## for how can I allow my name to be dishonored? ##

Yahweh uses a question to emphasize that he can never allow his own name to be dishonored. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
