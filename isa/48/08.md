Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.

## these things were not unfolded to your ears beforehand ##

AT: "I never explained these things to you before" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

## from birth ##

Here "birth" refers to when they became a nation. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Isaiah 46:3](../46/03.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
