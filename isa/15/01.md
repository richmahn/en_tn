# General Information:

Often in prophecy events that will happen in future are described as happening now or in the past. This emphasizes that the event will certainly happen. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture]])

# A declaration

"This is what Yahweh declares" or "This is a message from Yahweh"

# Ar ... Kir ... Dibon ... Nebo ... Medeba

These are names of cities and towns in Moab. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# Ar of Moab is laid waste and destroyed

The words "laid waste" and "destroyed" mean the same thing and emphasize that the city was completely ruined. This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "Enemy armies will completely destroy Ar of Moab" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
