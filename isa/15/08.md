# General Information:

This continues the prophecy about the people of Moab. God describes events that will happen in the future as if it is happening in the present. (See: [Isaiah 15:1-2](./01.md))

# The cry has gone around the territory of Moab

People's crying out and others hearing it is spoken of as if the cry had gone out. AT: "People all over the territory of Moab cry out" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the wailing as far as Eglaim and Beer Elim

The words "has gone" are understood. People's wailing and others hearing it is spoken of as if the wailing had gone as far away as these two places. AT: "the wailing has gone as far as Egalim and Beer Elim" or "people even as far away as Elaim and Beer Elim wail"

# Eglaim ... Beer Elim ... Dimon

These are names of cities and towns. Dimon was the principal city of the country of Moab. Several modern versions have "Dibon" instead of "Dimon." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# but I will bring even more upon Dimon

Here "I" refers to Yahweh. Also, "Dimon" refers to the people who live there. AT: "but I will cause even more trouble for the people of Dimon" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
