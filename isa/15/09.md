# Eglaim ... Beer Elim ... Dimon

These are names of cities and towns. Dimon was the principal city of the country of Moab. Several modern versions have "Dibon" instead of "Dimon." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# but I will bring even more upon Dimon

Here "I" refers to Yahweh. Also, "Dimon" refers to the people who live there. Alternate translation: "but I will cause even more trouble for the people of Dimon" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
