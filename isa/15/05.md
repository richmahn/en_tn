# General Information:

This continues the prophecy about the people of Moab. God describes events that will happen in the future as if it is happening in the present. (See: [Isaiah 15:1-2](./01.md))

# My heart cries out for Moab

Here God is represented by his "heart" which emphasizes his emotions. God speaks of his great sadness as if his heart cried out. AT: "I am extremely sad about what is happening to Moab" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]] or [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# her fugitives flee

"the fugitives from Moab will flee." A fugitive is a person who runs away so that his enemy will not capture him.

# Zoar ... Eglath Shelishiyah ... Luhith ... Horonaim ... Nimrim

These are names of cities and towns. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# over their destruction

This can be reworded so that the abstract noun "destruction" is expressed as the verb "destroyed." AT: "because their city is destroyed" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
