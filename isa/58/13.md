# General Information:

Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.

# you turn back your feet from traveling on the Sabbath day, and from doing your own pleasure on my holy day

Here the people are represented by their "feet." God did not allow long travels or work on the day of rest. AT: "you stop traveling and doing what you want to do on the Sabbath, my holy day" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
