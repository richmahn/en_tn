Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.

## satisfy the dry region of your soul ##

AT: "satisfy you like a rain falling in the desert" or "satisfy you even in the driest desert" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

## You will be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters never fail ##

This means they will have all they need for an abundant life. Judah was a dry land, and water was essential to life.  Also, it may recall the garden of Eden . (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
