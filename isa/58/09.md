## translationNotes

* Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.
* **then your light will rise in the darkness, and your darkness will be like the noonday** - This means their acts of kindness will be examples of light in the community, and the "darkness," the bad deeds, will be overcome by the light. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
