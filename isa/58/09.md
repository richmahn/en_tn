# General Information:

Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.

# then your light will rise in the darkness, and your darkness will be like the noonday

"Your light" represents the acts of kindness that will be examples to everyone, and the "darkness," the bad deeds, will be overcome by their good deeds. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
