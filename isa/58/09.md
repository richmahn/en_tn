Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.

## then your light will rise in the darkness, and your darkness will be like the noonday ##

This means their acts of kindness will be examples of light in the community, and the "darkness," the bad deeds, will be overcome by the light. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
