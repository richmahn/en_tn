Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.

## Is not this the fast that I choose ##

Yahweh uses a question to teach the people about the kind of fast that pleases him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## to release wicked bonds, to undo the ropes of the yoke, to set the crushed ones free, and to break every yoke? ##

## Is it not to ##

Yahweh uses another question to teach the people.
