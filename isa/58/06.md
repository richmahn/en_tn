# General Information:

Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.

# Is not this the fast that I choose ... break every yoke?

Yahweh uses a question to teach the people about the kind of fast that pleases him. Alternate translation: "This is the fast that I choose ... break every yoke." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# To release wicked bonds, to undo the ropes of the yoke, to set the crushed ones free, and to break every yoke

All of these phrases mean they should help those people whom the wicked are hurting and oppressing. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
