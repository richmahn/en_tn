## translationNotes

* Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.
* **Is not this the fast that I choose** - Yahweh uses a question to teach the people about the kind of fast that pleases him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **to release wicked bonds, to undo the ropes of the yoke, to set the crushed ones free, and to break every yoke?** - All of these phrases mean they should help those people that the wicked are hurting and oppressing. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
* **Is it not to** - Yahweh uses another question to teach the people.
