# Lift up your voice like a trumpet

This means shout loudly. Here "your" refers to Isaiah. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# Confront my people with their rebellion, and the house of Jacob with their sins

These two phrases mean basically the same thing. Together they strengthen the urgency to confront Yahweh's people. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
