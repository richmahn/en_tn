# They will say

All the people on the earth are speaking.

# In Yahweh all the descendants of Israel will be justified

Here the word "justified" does not refer to Yahweh forgiving their sins, but to proving to the nations that Israel was right to worship him. This can be stated in active form. AT: "Yahweh will justify all the descendants of Israel" or "Yahweh will vindicate all the descendants of Israel" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
