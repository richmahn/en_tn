# Holy One of Israel

See how you translated this phrase in [Isaiah 1:4](../01/04.md).

# Why do you ask questions about what I will do for my children? Do you tell me what to do concerning the work of my hands?

Yahweh uses questions to scold those who argue with him about what he does. AT: "Do not question me about what I do for my children. Do not tell me ... my hands." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# my children

This refers to the people of Israel.

# the work of my hands

Here the word "hands" represents Yahweh. AT: "the things that I have made" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
