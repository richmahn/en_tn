# Isaiah 45 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations set each line of poetry farher to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetry in this chapter.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Potter and clay #####
The potter and the clay are important images used in Scripture. They emphasize the power and control of God. This chapter connects this to the truth that Yahweh is the creator of all, which it repeatedly emphasizes. He is even able to "anoint" or chose a future, pagan king. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/anoint]])
