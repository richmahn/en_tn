Yahweh continues speaking.

## Turn to me and be saved ##

AT: "Worship me and I will save you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## To me every knee will bend, every tongue will swear ##

AT: "Every person will kneel before me, and everyone will swear" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
