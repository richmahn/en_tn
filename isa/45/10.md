Yahweh continues to scold those who argue with him about what he does. (See: [Isaiah 45:9](./09.md))

## What are you fathering...What are you giving birth to? ##

A person is using questions to scold the parents for what they are doing by making a child. This refers to the people arguing with Yahweh for what he does. AT: "You should not be a father...You should not be a mother" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
