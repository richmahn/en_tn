# General Information:

Yahweh continues to scold those who argue with him about what he does.

# Woe to him who says to a father, ... 'What are you giving birth to?'

Yahweh speaks of those who would argue him as if they were unborn children who argue with their own parents. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# What are you fathering? ... What are you giving birth to?

The unborn child asks these rhetorical questions to scold his parents for giving birth to him. These can be translated as statements. AT: "You should not be my father ... You should give birth to me." or "You are not fathering me correctly ... You are not giving birth to me correctly." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
