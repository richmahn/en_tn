# General Information:

Yahweh continues speaking.

# I form the light and create darkness; I bring peace and create disaster

Both of these expressions form merisms that emphasize that Yahweh is sovereign creator of everything. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])

# You heavens, rain down from above ... righteousness spring up together with it

Yahweh speaks of his righteousness as if it were rain that falls on the earth, and of his righteousness and salvation as plants that grow on the earth. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# You heavens

Yahweh momentarily turns his attention from his people and begins to speak to the heavens. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe]])
