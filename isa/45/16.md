## translationNotes

* **They will all be ashamed and disgraced together; those who carve idols will walk in humiliation** - The words "ashamed," "disgraced," and "humiliation" mean basically the same the thing. AT: "Yahweh will humiliate all those who make idols" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
* **Israel will be saved by Yahweh** - AT: "Yahweh will save the people of Israel"
* **you will never again be ashamed or humiliated** - Here "you" refers to the people of Israel, but Isaiah would also include himself as a part of Israel. AT: "No one will ever humiliate you again" or "No one will ever humiliate us again"
