## They will all be ashamed and disgraced together; those who carve idols will walk in humiliation ##

The words "ashamed," "disgraced," and "humiliation" mean basically the same the thing. AT: "Yahweh will humiliate all those who make idols" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## Israel will be saved by Yahweh ##

AT: "Yahweh will save the people of Israel"

## you will never again be ashamed or humiliated ##

Here "you" refers to the people of Israel, but Isaiah would also include himself as a part of Israel. AT: "No one will ever humiliate you again" or "No one will ever humiliate us again"
