Yahweh continues speaking.

## An earthen potshard among all the earthen potshards in the ground ##

In 45:9 God compares himself to a potter and the people as the clay. This emphasizes that he is the creator. AT: "You are like broken pieces of pottery on the ground" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## Should the clay say to the potter ##

God uses a question to rebuke those who argue with him about what he does. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
