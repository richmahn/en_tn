Yahweh continues speaking to the refugees. (See: [Isaiah 45:20](./20.md))

## Let them counsel together ##

"them" are the people who might challenge Yahweh's power to foretell the events.

## Who has shown this from long ago? Who announced it? Was it not I, Yahweh? ##

Yahweh uses questions to emphasize that he was the one who told them these things would happen. AT: "It was I, Yahweh, who told you these things long ago" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
