## Listen to me ##

Here "me" refers to Yahweh's servant.

## He has made my mouth like a sharp sword ##

This means that his message has the power to save or destroy. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

## he hid me in the shadow of his hand ##

This means Yahweh has protected his servant and kept his purpose secret. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]]).

## he has made me into a polished arrow; in his quiver he has hidden me ##

This also means Yahweh has protected his servant to be ready for attack later and kept his purpose secret. An arrow is used to attack an enemy. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
