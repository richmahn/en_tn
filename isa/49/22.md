Yahweh continues speaking to Zion as if it were a woman. He explains how she is able to have so many children. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# I will raise my hand to the nations; I will raise my signal flag to the peoples

These two clauses mean basically the same thing. AT: "I will raise my hand and signal with a flag for the people of the nations to come" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# They will bring your sons in their arms and carry your daughters on their shoulders

Yahweh speaks of the people who will inhabit Jerusalem as if they were the city's children. He also speaks of the people of other nations helping the Israelites to return to Jerusalem as if they were carrying the Israelites. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
