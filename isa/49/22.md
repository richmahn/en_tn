Yahweh continues speaking to Zion as if it were a person.

## I will raise my hand to the nations; I will raise my signal flag to the peoples ##

These clauses mean basically the same thing and are combined for emphasis. AT: "I will call the people of the nations to me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## your sons â€¦ your daughters ##

This refers to the Israelites who will return from exile.
