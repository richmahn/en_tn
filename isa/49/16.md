Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.

## I have inscribed your name on my palms ##

This means that God is always thinking about the honor of his people. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## Your children are hurrying back ##

AT: "Your descendants are hurrying back to rebuild your city" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

## As surely as I live ##

This is an oath formula.

## declaration of Yahweh ##

See how you translated this in [Isaiah 14:21](../14/21.md).

## you will surely wear them like jewelry; you will put them on, like a bride ##

This means the descendants that return will cause the city of Jerusalem to be beautiful and happy again. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
