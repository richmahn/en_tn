Yahweh continues speaking to Zion as if it were a person.

## And I will feed your oppressors with their own flesh ##

This means Yahweh will cause the Babylonians to fight each other. Some will even join the enemies of Babylonia who are out to conquer them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## and they will get drunk on their own blood, as if it were wine ##

This means Yahweh will cause Israel's enemies to kill one another and that there will be much bloodshed and even enjoyment in it. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
