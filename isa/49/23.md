Yahweh continues speaking to Zion as if it were a person.

## Kings will be your foster fathers, and their queens your nursemaids ##

AT: "Kings and queens from the nations will take care of you and your children"

## lick the dust of your feet ##

At that time, people bowed to the ground to show their submission to a king. This is a sign that kings and queens will completely humble themselves and respect Zion.

## will not be put to shame ##

AT: "I will not put to shame" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
