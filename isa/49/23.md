## translationNotes

* Yahweh continues speaking to Zion as if it were a person.
* **Kings will be your foster fathers, and their queens your nursemaids** - AT: "Kings and queens from the nations will take care of you and your children"
* **lick the dust of your feet** - At that time, people bowed to the ground to show their submission to a king. This is a sign that kings and queens will completely humble themselves and respect Zion.
* **will not be put to shame** - AT: "I will not put to shame" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
