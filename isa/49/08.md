## I will answer you ##

Here "you" refers to Yahweh's servant.

## At a time I decide to show my favor I will answer you, and in a day of salvation I will help you ##

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## and give you as a covenant for the people ##

See how you translated a similar phrase in [Isaiah 42:5](../42/05.md).
