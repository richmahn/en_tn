# At a time I decide to show my favor I will answer you, and in a day of salvation I will help you

# in a day of salvation

The word "salvation" can be translated as a verb. AT: "when the time comes for me to save you" (See:[[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# give you as a covenant for the people

Here the word "covenant" is a metonym for the one who establishes or mediates a covenant. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Isaiah 42:6](../42/05.md). AT: "make you be the mediator of a covenant with the people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# to rebuild the land

Here the word "land" represents the cities in the land that had been destroyed. AT: "to rebuild the ruined places in the land" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
