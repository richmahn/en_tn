# you will surely wear them like jewelry, and you will put them on like a bride

Yahweh speaks of the inhabitants of Zion as if they were jewelry that the city wears to show her beauty and joy. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# you will put them on like a bride

The last part of the phrase can be clarified from the previous line. Alternate translation: "you will put them on, like a bride wears jewelry" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
