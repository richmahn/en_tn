# Can a woman forget her baby, nursing at her breast, so she does not have compassion on the son she has borne?

Yahweh uses a question to help his people understand that he will never forget about them or stop caring for them. Alternate translation: "A woman would not forget her nursing baby or stop caring for the son she bore." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
