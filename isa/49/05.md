Yahweh's servant continues speaking.

## that Israel be gathered to him ##

This part of the sentence means the same as the part before it. AT: "to bring the people of Israel back to himself." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## I am honored in the eyes of Yahweh ##

Here "eyes" means God's thoughts or opinion. AT: "Yahweh considers me honored" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## I will make you a light to the Gentiles ##

This means he will cause even those who are not Israelites to  understand and to worship Yahweh. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
