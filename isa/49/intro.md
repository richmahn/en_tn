# Isaiah 49 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations set each line of poetry further to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetry in this chapter.

Many scholars believe that there are four songs or poems which Isaiah records about the messiah. Isaiah 49:1-6 is the second of these songs. They are often called the "servant songs" because they focus on the messiah being a servant. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/christ]])

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### A day of salvation #####
It is unclear if this is a reference to the gospel proclaimed by the messiah or to the day of restoration of all things. The translator should not try to explain its reference to the reader. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/salvation]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/goodnews]], and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/restore]])
