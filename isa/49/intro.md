# Isaiah 49 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of this chapter, which is an extended quotation.

Many scholars believe that there are four songs or poems which Isaiah records about the messiah. Isaiah 49:1-6 is the second of these songs. They are often called the "servant songs" because they focus on the messiah being a servant. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/christ]])

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### A day of salvation #####
It is unclear if this is a reference to the gospel proclaimed by the messiah or to the day of restoration of all things. The translator should not try to explain its reference to the reader. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/salvation]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/goodnews]], and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/restore]])
