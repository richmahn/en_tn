# General Information:

Yahweh continues speaking.

# They will not

Here "they" refers to God's people.

# nor will the heat or sun beat on them

Here the word "heat" describes the word "sun." The people suffering from the sun's heat is spoken of as if the heat struck them. Alternate translation: "nor will they suffer from the sun's heat" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# for he who has mercy on them ... he will guide them

Yahweh speaks of himself in the third person. He speaks of protecting the people and caring for them as if he were their shepherd. Alternate translation: "I, the one who has mercy on them ... I will guide them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
