Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Babylon.

## they will become like stubble; the fire will burn them up ##

Yahweh compares the magicians and sorcerers to straw that burns quickly in a fire. This means they will be no help to the people of Babylon. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

## there are no coals here suitable for warming them nor no fire suitable to sit before ##

Again, this means the magicians and sorcerers will burn up so quickly the fire will not help the people. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## They will be for you nothing but toil ##

"Those from whom you expected help will make more work for you."
