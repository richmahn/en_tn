# Connecting Statement:

Yahweh continues to speak to Babylon about her downfall as if she were a queen who is humiliated. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# they will become like stubble. The fire will burn them up

Yahweh compares the magicians and sorcerers to straw that burns quickly in a fire. This means that Yahweh will destroy them as easily as fire burns stubble, and so they are powerless to save Babylon. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# the hand of the flame

Here the word "hand" represents strength. AT: "the power of the flame" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# There are no coals to warm them and no fire for them to sit by

Yahweh emphasizes that this is a destructive fire by stating that it is not one that people will use to warm themselves.
