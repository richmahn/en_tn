## translationNotes

* Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Babylon.
* **they will become like stubble; the fire will burn them up** - Yahweh compares the magicians and sorcerers to straw that burns quickly in a fire. This means they will be no help to the people of Babylon. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
* **there are no coals here suitable for warming them nor no fire suitable to sit before** - Again, this means the magicians and sorcerers will burn up so quickly the fire will not help the people. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
* **They will be for you nothing but toil** - "Those from whom you expected help will make more work for you."
