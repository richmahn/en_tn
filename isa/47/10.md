# Connecting Statement:

Yahweh continues to speak to Babylon about her downfall as if she were a queen who is humiliated. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# you say in your heart

Here the word "heart" refers to the inner person. Alternate translation: "you say to yourself" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
