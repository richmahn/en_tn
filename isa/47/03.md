## Yahweh of hosts ##

See how you translated this in [Isaiah 1:24](../01/24.md).

See how you translated this in [Isaiah 5:15](../05/15.md).

## daughter of the Chaldeans ##

See how you translated this in [Isaiah 41:1](../41/01.md).

## for you will no longer be called ##

## Queen of kingdoms ##

This means that people will no longer consider Babylon to be the greatest kingdom of all. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
