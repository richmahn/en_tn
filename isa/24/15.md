# Therefore in the east glorify Yahweh

The phrase "in the east" represents the people living east of Israel. Isaiah is commanding these people as if they were there with him. But, he is talking to the people in the future after God devastates the earth. Alternate translation: "Therefore everyone from distant lands in the east will glorify Yahweh" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture]])

# in the isles of the sea give glory

Alternate translation: "everyone in the islands will give glory" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture]])

# to the name of Yahweh

Here "name" represents Yahweh. Alternate translation: "to Yahweh" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
