# Then the moon will be ashamed, and the sun disgraced

The sun and the moon are described as a person who is ashamed of being in front of someone with greater power. In the presence of Yahweh, the light of the moon and sun will seem less bright. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
