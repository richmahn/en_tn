## the foundations of the earth will shake ##

The word "foundation" normally refers to a stone structure that gives support to a building from underneath. Here it describes a similar structure that was thought to support and and hold the earth in place. Isaiah says even the structure that holds the earth will shake. AT: "and the earth will shake terribly" or "and there will be a terrible earthquake."
