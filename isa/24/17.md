"You people of the earth will experience terror, the pit, and the snare"

# the pit, and the snare ... caught in the snare

"the terrifying sound"

# will be caught in the snare

This can be stated in active form. AT: "the snare will catch him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# The windows of the heavens will be opened

This speaks of large amounts of rain falling from the sky as if Yahweh opened a window in the sky and let the water pour through. AT: "The sky will split open and torrents of rain will fall" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the foundations of the earth will shake

The word "foundation" normally refers to a stone structure that gives support to a building from underneath. Here it describes a similar structure that was thought to support and hold the earth in place. Isaiah says even the structure that holds the earth will shake. AT: "the earth will shake terribly" or "there will be a terrible earthquake"
