# Terror, the pit, and the snare are upon you, inhabitants of the earth

"You people of the earth will experience terror, the pit, and the snare"

# the pit, and the snare ... caught in the snare

Here "pit" and "snare" represent all the different bad things that will happen to people. People will run away to escape one bad thing but they will just experience another bad thing. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
