## and will joyfully shout from the sea ##

"and those near the Mediterranean Sea will shout with joy"

## Therefore in the east glorify Yahweh ##

The phrase "in the east" refers to the people leaving east of Israel. Isaiah is commanding these people as if they were there with him. But, he is talking to the people in the future after God judges the world. Alternate translation: "Therefore everyone from distant lands in the east will glorify Yahweh." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe]])

## and in the isles of the sea give glory ##

"and everyone in the islands will give glory"

## to the name of Yahweh ##

Here "name" refers to Yahweh. Alternate translation: "to Yahweh."
