* **and will joyfully shout from the sea** - "and those near the Mediterranean Sea will shout with joy"
* **Therefore in the east glorify Yahweh** - The phrase "in the east" refers to the people leaving east of Israel. Isaiah is commanding these people as if they were there with him.

(See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_apostrophe]])
