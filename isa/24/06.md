# General Information:

Isaiah continues to describe a time in the future when God will judge the earth. Prophets sometimes describe a future event as something in the past or in the present. This emphasizes the event certainly will happen. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture]])

# a curse devours the earth

Yahweh cursing the earth and destroying it is spoken of as if a curse were either a wild animal that completely eats the earth or a fire that completely burns up the earth. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# its inhabitants are found guilty

This can be stated in active form. AT: "Yahweh will declare that the people are guilty" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
