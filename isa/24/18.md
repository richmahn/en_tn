# the pit, and the snare ... caught in the snare

Here "pit" and "snare" represent all the different bad things that will happen to people. People will run away to escape one bad thing but they will just experience another bad thing. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# the sound of terror

"the terrifying sound"

# will be caught in the snare

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "the snare will catch him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# The windows of the heavens will be opened

This speaks of large amounts of rain falling from the sky as if Yahweh opened a window in the sky and let the water pour through. Alternate translation: "The sky will split open and torrents of rain will fall" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the foundations of the earth will shake

The word "foundation" normally refers to a stone structure that gives support to a building from underneath. Here it describes a similar structure that was thought to support and hold the earth in place. Isaiah says even the structure that holds the earth will shake. Alternate translation: "the earth will shake terribly" or "there will be a terrible earthquake"
