* **The city of chaos has been broken down** - AT: "Yahweh will break down the city of chaos." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
* **The city of chaos** - Possible meanings are 1) the city was in chaos before the Lord breaks it down. The people did not obey God, the government was corrupt, and the city was full of drinking and parties, or 2) The city will be in chaos after God breaks it down.
