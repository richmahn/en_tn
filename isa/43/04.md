# General Information:

Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.

# Since you are precious and special in my sight

The words "precious" and "special" mean basically the same thing and emphasize how much Yahweh values his people. Alternate translation: "Because you are very precious to me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# therefore I will give people in exchange for you, and other peoples in exchange for your life

Both phrases mean the same thing. Alternate translation: "therefore I will let the enemy conquer other peoples instead of you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
