Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.

## precious and special in my sight ##

AT: "you are very precious to me" (UDB) (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

## therefore I will give people in exchange for you, and other peoples in exchange for your life ##

Both phrases mean the same thing. AT: "therefore I will let the enemy conquer other peoples instead of you." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
