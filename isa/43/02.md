# General Information:

Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.

# When you pass through the waters ... the flames will not destroy you

Yahweh speaks of suffering and difficult experiences as if they are deep waters and fires through which the people walk. The words "waters" and "flames" form a merism and emphasize any difficult circumstance. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])

# When you pass through the waters, I will be with you; and through the rivers, they will not overwhelm you

These two statements mean basically the same thing and emphasize that the people will experience no harm because Yahweh is with them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# you will not be burned

This can be stated in active form. AT: "it will not burn you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# I have given Egypt as your ransom, Cush and Seba in exchange for you

These two phrases share similar meanings and emphasize that Yahweh will allow Israel's enemy to conquer these nations instead of Israel. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# Seba

This is the name of a nation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
