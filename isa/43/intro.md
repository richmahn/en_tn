# Isaiah 43 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations set each line of poetry farher to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetry in this chapter.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Exodus #####
This chapter pictures Judah's eventual return from exile in Babylon as a kind of second exodus. It was reminiscent of their exodus from Egypt. 

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### Exile #####
This chapter prophesies about the Jews return from Babylon, but the exile has yet to happen and is still more than a hundred years in the future. These events will show that Yahweh alone is God. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
