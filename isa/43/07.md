# everyone who is called by my name

Here to be called by someone's name represents belonging to that person. This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "everyone whom I have called by my name" or "everyone who belongs to me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# whom I have formed, yes, whom I have made

Both of these mean the same thing and emphasize that it is God who made the people of Israel. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
