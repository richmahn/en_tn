## the blind people...the deaf ##

This refers to those who are spiritually blind and deaf. This means they do not listen to or obey God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## Who among them could have declared this and announced to us earlier events? ##

Here "us" refers to Isaiah and the people of Israel. Isaiah uses a question to mock the people of other nations and their idols. AT: "None of them could have declared this or told us what would happen in the future" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-inclusive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## Let them bring their witnesses to prove themselves right,  let them listen and affirm, 'It is true." ##

Isaiah challenges them to prove that the idols could tell them the future. But, he knows they cannot. AT: "None of them can say they heard their idol tell what would happen in the future." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])
