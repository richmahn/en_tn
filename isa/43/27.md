Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.

## I will hand Jacob over to the destructive ban, and Israel to abusive humiliation ##

Here "Jacob" and "Israel" mean the same thing. AT: "I will allow the enemy to completely destroy and humiliate the people of Israel" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
