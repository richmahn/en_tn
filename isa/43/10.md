# You ... my servant

Here "you" is plural and refers to the people of Israel. The phrase "my servant" refers to the nation, as a whole. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# Before me ... after me

In speaking this way, Yahweh is not saying that there was a time before which he did not exist or a time after which he will not exist. He is asserting that he is eternal and that the gods whom the people of other nations worship are not.

# Before me there was no god formed

Here the word "formed" indicates that Yahweh is speaking of idols that people have made. This can be stated in active form. AT: "None of the gods whom people have formed existed before me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# there will be none after me

"none of those gods will exist after me"

# I, I am Yahweh

The word "I" is repeated to emphasize the focus on Yahweh. AT: "I alone am Yahweh" or "I myself am Yahweh" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# there is no savior but me

This can be expressed positively. AT: "I am the only savior" or "I am the only one who can save you"
