Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.

## no one can rescue anyone from my hand ##

AT: "no one can save someone from my powerful hand"

## who can turn it back? ##

Yahweh uses a question to emphasize his power. AT: "no one can stop me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
