# General Information:

Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.

# Do not think about these former things, nor consider the things of long ago.

These two phrases mean basically the same thing and emphasize that they are not to worry about what happened in the past. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
