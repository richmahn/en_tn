Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.

## former things…the things of long ago ##

“what happened in the past” (See: Doublet)

## Look ##

"Listen" or "Pay attention"

## do you not perceive it? ##

Yahweh uses a question to teach the people of Israel. AT: "Surely you have noticed it" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
