Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.

## sweet-smelling cane ##

This is a plant with a pleasant smell used to make anointing oil. It did not grow in the land of Israel so the people had to buy it from other nations.

## burdened me with your sins, you have wearied me with your evil deeds ##

These both mean the same thing and emphasize the complaint Yahweh has with his people. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## burdened me with your sins ##

"troubled me with your sins"
