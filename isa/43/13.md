# no one can rescue anyone from my hand

Here the word "hand" represents Yahweh's power. AT: "no one can rescue anyone from my power" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# who can turn it back?

Yahweh uses this question to say that no one can turn back his hand. It can be translated as a statement. Turning back his hand represents stopping him from doing something. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Isaiah 14:27](../14/27.md). AT: "no one can turn it back." or "no one can stop me." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
