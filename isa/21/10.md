# My threshed and winnowed ones, children of my threshing floor

The people of Israel suffering because of the Babylonians is spoken of as if the people were grain that was threshed and winnowed. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# My threshed

The word "my" refers to Isaiah.

# Yahweh of hosts

See how you translated this in [Isaiah 1:9](../01/09.md).
