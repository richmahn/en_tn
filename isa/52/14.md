# his appearance was so disfigured beyond that of any man

It is implied that the servant is disfigured because enemies beat him very badly. The full meaning of this can be made clear. AT: "his enemies beat his body so badly that he did not even look like a human anymore" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
