Isaiah continues speaking to the people of Israel.

## Shake yourself off from the dust ##

"Shake the dust off of you"

## take off the chain from your neck, captive ##

The people of Jerusalem have been captives in Babylon.  Now Yahweh is going to bring them home.  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

## the daughter of Zion ##

See how you translated this in [Isaiah 1:7](../01/07.md).

## You were sold for nothing, and you will be redeemed without money ##

AT: "I sold you for nothing, and I will redeem you without money" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
