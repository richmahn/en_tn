# Yahweh will go before you; and the God of Israel will be your rearguard

Yahweh protecting his people from their enemies is spoken of as if he were the warriors who go ahead of the people and the warriors who stay behind the people to protect them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
