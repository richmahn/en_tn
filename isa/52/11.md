# General Information:

Isaiah continues speaking to the people of Israel.

# Leave, leave

This word is repeated to emphasize that the people must indeed leave, although not necessarily right away.

# go out from there

It is assumed knowledge that the people of Israel were slaves in Babylon. This can be stated explicitly. Alternate translation: "go out from the land where you are slaves" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# touch nothing unclean

Something that Yahweh has stated is unfit to touch or eat is spoken of as if it were physically unclean. Alternate translation: "touch nothing that is unacceptable to Yahweh" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# leave from her midst

Here "her" represents Babylon.
