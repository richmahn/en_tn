# General Information:

Isaiah continues speaking to the people of Israel.

# Leave, leave

This word is repeated to emphasize that the people must indeed leave, although not necessarily right away.

# go out from there

It is assumed knowledge that the people of Israel were slaves in Babylon. This can be stated explicitly. AT: "go out from the land where you are slaves" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# touch nothing unclean

Something that Yahweh has stated is unfit to touch or eat is spoken of as if it were physically unclean. AT: "touch nothing that is unacceptable to Yahweh" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# leave from her midst

Here "her" represents Babylon.

# Yahweh will go before you; and the God of Israel will be your rearguard

Yahweh protecting his people from their enemies is spoken of as if he were the warriors who go ahead of the people and the warriors who stay behind the people to protect them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
