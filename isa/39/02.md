# Hezekiah was pleased by these things

This can be made more explicit. AT: "When the king's messengers arrived, Hezekiah was pleased with what they brought to him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# showed the messengers his storehouse of valuable things

"he showed the messengers everything of value he had"

# storehouse

a building where goods are kept

# all that was found in his storehouses

This can be stated in active form. AT: "everything that was in his storehouses" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# There was nothing in his house, nor in all his kingdom, that Hezekiah did not show them

This is a slight exaggeration as Hezekiah showed them many things, but not everything. Also, this can be expressed positively. AT: "Hezekiah showed them almost everything in his house and in his kingdom" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
