# The virgin daughter of Zion ... the daughter of Jerusalem

These are idioms. Both of these phrases have the same meaning. The "daughter" of a city means the people who live in the city. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Isaiah 1:8](../01/08.md). Alternate translation: "The people of Zion ... the people of Jerusalem" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
