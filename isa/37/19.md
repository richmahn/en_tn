# General Information:

Hezekiah continues praying to Yahweh.

# for they were not gods but the work of men's hands, just wood and stone

This emphasizes that humans made these idols with their own hands and are therefore worthless. Alternate translation: "because they were false gods that men made out of wood and stone" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
