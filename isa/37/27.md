This speaks of how weak and vulnerable the cities are before the Assryian army by comparing the cities to grass. AT: "The cities are as weak as the grass in the fields before your armies. They are as weak as the grass that grows on the roofs of houses and is scorched by the hot east wind" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# before the east wind

The east wind is hot and dry from the desert and plants die when it blows.
