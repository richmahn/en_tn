This continues Yahweh's message to Hezekiah.

## the house of Judah ##

"the descendants of Judah"

## will again take root and bear fruit ##

Yahweh compares the coming prosperity of the people of Judah to the plantings they will do. AT: "will prosper like a plant that takes root and produces fruit" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## For from Jerusalem a remnant will come out; from Mount Zion survivors will come ##

These mean the same thing and are used together for emphasis. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
