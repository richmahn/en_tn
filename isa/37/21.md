## The virgin daughter of Zion...the daughter of Jerusalem ##

Both of these phrases refer to the people of Jerusalem. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Isaiah 1:7](../01/07.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## Whom have you defied and insulted? And against whom have you exalted your voice and lifted up your eyes in pride? Against the Holy One of Israel. ##

Yahweh uses questions to ridicule the king of Assyria. AT: "You have rebelled against, and spoken against, and lifted yourself above Yahweh, the Holy One of Israel"  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
