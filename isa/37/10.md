# Jerusalem will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria

This can be stated in active form. The word "hand" refers to the king's military power. Alternate translation: "The king of Assyria and his army will not conquer you in Jerusalem" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
