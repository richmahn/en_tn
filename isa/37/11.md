## So will you be rescued? ##

The king of Assyria uses a questions in 37:11-13 to ridicule Hezekiah and his army. AT: "So you too will not be saved." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## Have the gods of the nations rescued them ##

AT: "The gods of the nations have not rescued them"

## Gozan… Haran… Rezeph… Eden…Telassar…Hena… Ivvah ##

These are towns and kingdoms which Assyria had conquered. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

## Where are the king ##

AT: "We also conquered the king"

## Hamath...Arpad...Sepharvaim ##
