# General Information:

This continues the king of Assyria's message to Hezekiah.

# See, you have heard

The word "see" here is used to add emphasis to what is said next. Alternate translation: "You have certainly heard"

# So will you be rescued?

The king of Assyria uses this question to ridicule Hezekiah and his army. This may be written as a statement. Alternate translation: "So you too will not be saved." or "So of course no one will rescue you either!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
