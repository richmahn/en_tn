Hezekiah continues praying to Yahweh.

## Turn your ear, O Yahweh, and listen. Open your eyes, O Yahweh, and see, and hear the words ##

Hezekiah pleads for Yahweh to see and hear what the king of Assyria is saying against Judah. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## Sennacherib ##

See how you translated this in [Isaiah 36:1](../36/01.md).
