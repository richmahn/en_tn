# General Information:

Hezekiah continues praying to Yahweh.

# which he has sent

Hezekiah is referring to the letter from Sennacherib. The meaning of this can be made clear. AT: "in the message he has sent" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# Turn your ear

"Incline your ear" or "Turn your head." This means to turn your head so that you can hear something better.

# Sennacherib

See how you translated this man's name in [Isaiah 36:1](../36/01.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# all the nations and their lands

This is a generalization. The kings had destroyed many of the nearby lands, but not necessarily all lands. AT: "many of the nations and their lands" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
