This continues Yahweh's message to the king of Assyria.

## Have you not heard how...? ##

Yahweh assumes Sennacherib should know this. AT: "Certainly you have heard how ...." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## They are plants in the field, green grass, the grass of the roof or of the field, before the east wind ##

This emphasizes how weak the people are before the army of Assyria. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## before the east wind ##

The east wind is hot and dry from the desert and plants die when it blows.
