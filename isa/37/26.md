# General Information:

This continues Yahweh's message to the king of Assyria.

# Have you not heard how ... times?

Yahweh uses this rhetorical question to remind Sennacherib of information that he should already be aware of. This can be written as a statement. Alternate translation: "Certainly you have heard how ... times." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# You are here to reduce impregnable cities into heaps of ruins

Yahweh had planned for Sennacherib's army to destroy the cities that they had destroyed. This can be stated clearly. Alternate translation: "I planned that your army would destroy cities and cause them to become piles of rubble" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# impregnable

strong and heavily guarded

# I am bringing it to pass

The idiom "to bring something to pass" means to cause a specific thing to happen. Alternate translation: "I am causing it to happen" or "I am causing these things to take place" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
