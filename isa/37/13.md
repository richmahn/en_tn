# Gozan ... Haran ... Rezeph ... Eden ... Tel Assar ... Hena ... Ivvah

These are places that the Assyrians had conquered. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# Where is the king ... Ivvah?

The king of Assyria uses this question to ridicule Hezekiah and his army. This may be written as a statement. AT: "We also conquered the king ... Ivvah!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Hamath ... Arpad ... Sepharvaim

Translate the names of these cities the same as you did in [Isaiah 36:19](../36/19.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
