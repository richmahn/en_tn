# I send him ... I order him

The word "him" here also refers to the king of Assyria. But it does not mean God is only sending the king; he is sending with him the army of Assyria. AT: "I send the army of Assyria ... I order them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# against an arrogant nation and against the people who bear my overflowing wrath

"to attack a nation full of proud people who have made me very angry"

# who bear my overflowing wrath

Yahweh speaks of his wrath as if it were more liquid than a container could hold; "the people" are trying to carry this container, but it is heavy, and Yahweh keeps pouring liquid in even after it starts to spill out. AT: "at whom I continue to be angry even after I have punished them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# to take the spoil

"to take everything they have"

# to take the prey

to take the people like prey. See how you translated "prey" in [Isaiah 5:29](../05/29.md).

# trample them like mud

Possible meanings are 1) Yahweh compares the army of Assyria attacking Israel to people stomping through mud who do not care what happens to the mud. AT: "trample them until they become like mud" or 2) the people are stomping on other people so they are lying in the mud and unable to rise. This is a metaphor for completely defeating them. AT: "completely defeat them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
