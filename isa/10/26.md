# Yahweh of hosts

See how you translated this in [Isaiah 1:9](../01/09.md).

# will wield a whip against them

"will beat the Assyrians with a whip." God will not really use a whip. This refers to God's power to punish the Assyrians severely. Alternate translation: "will punish the Assyrians severely as if with a whip" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# as when he defeated Midian at the rock of Oreb

This refers to when God helped a man named Gideon defeat the army of Midian. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# He will raise his rod over the sea and lift it up as he did in Egypt

This speaks of God rescuing the people from the Assyrians as if they were the Egyptian army. This refers to when God caused the water of the Red Sea to split so the people of Israel could escape from the Egyptian army and so that the Egyptian army would drown in it. Alternate translation: "He will help you escape from the army of Assyria as he helped your ancestors escape the army of Egypt" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
