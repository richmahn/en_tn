Isaiah compares orphans to animals that other animals hunt and eat. This emphasizes that orphans are powerless and judges can easily harm them. Alternate translation: "and harm children who do not have parents like an animal that goes after its prey." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
