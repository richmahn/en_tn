## translationNotes

* **But this is not what he intends, nor does he think this way** - The meaning of "this" and "this way" can be made explicit: "But the king of Assyria does not intend to do what I tell him, nor does he think that I am using him as my weapon." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
* **It is in his heart to destroy and eliminate many nations** - The words "destroy" and "eliminate" mean basically the same thing. They are used for emphasis. Alternate translation: "He wants to completely destroy many nations." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
* **Are not all my princes kings?** - The king of Assyria uses a question to emphasize what he believes everyone should already know. Alternate translation: "I have made captains of my army kings over lands I have conquered." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **Is not Calno like Carchemish? Is not Hamath like Arpad? Is not Samaria like Damascus?** - The king of Assyria uses these questions for emphasis. Alternate translation: "Calno is no different than Carchemish. Hamath is no different than Arpad. Samaria is no different than Damascus. I have conquered them all!"
* **Calno…Carchemish…Hamath…Arpad** - These are all names of cities. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
