## translationNotes

* Yahweh continues to quote what the king of Assyria says. (See: [[en:bible:notes:isa:10:07]])
* **As my hand has overcome** - "As my powerful army has defeated" or "As I have conquered." Here the word "my" refers to the king of Assyria. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
* **whose carved figures were greater** - During this time people believed the power of a kingdom indicated the power of the god they worshiped. The king of Assyria is saying that he can defeat Jerusalem since he has defeated other kingdoms that were more powerful than Jerusalem.
* **just as I did to Samaria and her worthless idols** - The word "Samaria" refers to the people who lived there. And, "her" refers to the city of Samaria. Cities and nations were often spoken of as if they were women. Alternate translation: "just as I did to the people of Samaria and their worthless idols." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
* **will I not also do the same to Jerusalem and to her idols?** - The king of Assyria used this question to emphasize the certainty that he will conquer the people of Jerusalem. Alternate translation: "I will certainly do the same to Jerusalem and her idols!" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
