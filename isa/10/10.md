# General Information:

Yahweh continues to quote what the king of Assyria says. (See: [Isaiah 10:8](./07.md))

# As my hand has overcome

"Hand" here is a reference to military strength. AT: "As my powerful army has defeated" or "As I have conquered" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# my

This refers to the king of Assyria.

# whose carved figures were greater

During this time people believed that the greatness of an idol showed how powerful the kingdom that had built it was. The king of Assyria is saying that because the idols in Jerusalem are not as great as the idols of the kingdoms he has defeated, Jerusalem would be less able to defeat him than they were.
