## Will the axe boast about itself against the one who wields it? Will the saw praise itself more than the one who cuts with it ##

The speaker uses these questions to mock the king of Assyria. Alternate translation: "An axe is not better than the one who holds it. And a saw does not get more glory than the one who cuts with it." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## the saw ##

a sharp tool used for cutting wood

## as if a rod could lift up those who raise it, or as if a wooden club could lift up a person ##

These phrases mean basically the same thing and are used to strengthen the meaning of the two questions before it. This could be translated as a new sentence: "And neither can a rod or staff lift the person who picks it up." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## Therefore the Lord Yahweh of Hosts will send emaciation among his elite warriors ##

It is unclear whether Yahweh or Isaiah is speaking. Alternate translation: "Therefore I, Lord Yahweh of Hosts, will make the king's strongest soldiers weak."

## under his glory there will be kindled a burning like fire ##

Yahweh compares his punishment to a fire. This emphasizes that his punishment will completely destroy all the splendor and greatness of the kingdom of Assyria. Alternate translation: "like a burning fire I will destroy his greatness" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
