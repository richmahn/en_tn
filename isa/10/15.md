# Will the ax boast about itself against the one who wields it? Will the saw praise itself more than the one who cuts with it?

The speaker uses these questions to mock the king of Assyria. Alternate translation: "An ax cannot boast that it is better than the one who holds it. And a saw does not get more glory than the one who cuts with it." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# the saw

a sharp tool used for cutting wood

# It is as if a rod could lift up those who raise it, or as if a wooden club could lift up a person

These phrases mean basically the same thing and are used to strengthen the meaning of the two questions before it. This can be translated as a new sentence. Alternate translation: "And neither can a rod or staff lift the person who picks it up" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
