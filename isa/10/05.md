# Woe

This word marks the beginning of God's announcement about a severe punishment against Assyria.

# the Assyrian

This refers to the king of Assyria.

# the club of my anger, the rod by whom I wield my fury

Both of these phrases mean basically the same thing. Yahweh compares the king of Assyria to a weapon a person holds in his hand and hits other people with. It emphasizes that the king of Assyria and his army are a tool that Yahweh uses to punish Israel. Alternate translation: "who will be like a weapon in my hands that I will use to show my anger" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
