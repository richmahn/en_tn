# Gallim ... Laishah ... Anathoth ... Madmenah ... Gebim ... Nob

These are names of more cities and villages near Jerusalem that the Assyrian army traveled through causing fear among the people. All of these refer to the people who live in these places. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# he will halt at Nob and shake his fist

Here "he" and "his" refer to the king of Assyria and his soldiers. People would shake their fists at people whom they were threatening. Alternate translation: "the army of Assyria will stop at Nob and threaten" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# the mountain of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem

The words "mount" and "hill" are metonyms for the people who live on them. The words "mount of the daughter of Zion" mean almost the same thing as the words "hill of Jerusalem." See how they are translated in [Isaiah 2:14](../02/14.md). Alternate translation: "the people of Mount Zion and the people living on the hill in Jerusalem" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
