# Therefore the Lord Yahweh of hosts will send emaciation among his elite warriors

It is unclear whether Yahweh or Isaiah is speaking. This can be reworded so that the abstract noun "emaciation" is expressed as the verb "make weak." Alternate translation: "Therefore I, Lord Yahweh of hosts, will make the king's strongest soldiers weak" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# under his glory there will be kindled a burning like fire

Yahweh compares his punishment to a fire. This emphasizes that his punishment will completely destroy all the splendor and greatness of the kingdom of Assyria. Alternate translation: "I will destroy his greatness as if I were starting a fire to burn everything he is proud of" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
