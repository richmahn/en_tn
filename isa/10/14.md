## translationNotes

* Yahweh is still quoting the king of Assyria. (See: [[en:bible:notes:isa:10:12]])
* **My hand has seized, as from a nest, the wealth of nations** - The king of Assyria compares taking the treasures from the nations to a person taking eggs out of a bird's nest. This emphasizes how easy it was for him and his army to conquer these other kingdoms. Alternate translation: "My army has stolen the wealth from the nations just as easily as a man takes eggs from a nest." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
* **and as one gathers abandoned eggs, I gathered all the earth** - "and just as a person takes eggs from a nest when the bird is not there to protect them, my army has taken the treasures of every nation."
* **None fluttered their wings or opened their mouth or chirped** - This compares the nations to a bird who sits quietly while her eggs are taken. This emphasizes that the nations did nothing while the army of Assyria took all of their possessions. Alternate translation: "And like a bird that does not make a sound or flap her wings when someone steals her eggs, the nations did nothing as we took their treasure."
