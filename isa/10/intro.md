# Isaiah 10 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

This chapter begins with a prophecy that is a continuation of the prophecy beginning in 8:21. Some translations set each line of poetry farher to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetry in 10:1-11, 13-14, 15-19, 27-34.
