# They deprive the needy of justice, rob the poor of my people of their rights

These two phrases mean basically the same thing. Alternate translation: "They are unjust to the poor and needy among my people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# the needy

"poor people"

# plunder widows

"take everything from women whose husbands have died"

# make the fatherless their prey

Isaiah compares orphans to animals that other animals hunt and eat. This emphasizes that orphans are powerless and judges can easily harm them. Alternate translation: "harm children who do not have parents like an animal that goes after its prey" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# prey

Translated "prey" as in [Isaiah 5:29](../05/29.md).
