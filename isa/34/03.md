## translationNotes

* **Their slain will be left unburied** - "No one will bury the dead people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
* **the sky will be rolled up like a scroll** - This emphasizes that God's anger will affect the heavens and the earth. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
* **and all their stars will fade away, as the leaf fades from off the vine, and as the overripe figs from the fig tree** - "and and all the stars will fall from the sky like a leaf falls from a vine or a fig falls from a tree." This emphasizes even the things in the sky that people thought would be there forever will fall as easily as a leaf.
