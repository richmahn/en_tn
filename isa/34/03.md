## Their slain will be left unburied ##

"No one will bury the dead people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## the sky will be rolled up like a scroll ##

This emphasizes that God's anger will affect the heavens and the earth. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

## and all their stars will fade away, as the leaf fades from off the vine, and as the overripe figs from the fig tree ##

"and and all the stars will fall from the sky like a leaf falls from a vine or a fig falls from a tree." This emphasizes even the things in the sky that people thought would be there forever will fall as easily as a leaf.
