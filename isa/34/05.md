## when my sword will have drunk its fill in heaven ##

Yahweh is satisfied with destroying the heavens like a person puts a sword down when he has finished killing people. AT: "When I am finished destroying the objects in heaven." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## it will now come down on Edom, on the people whom I am consigning to annihilation ##

"I will now come to punish the people Edom whom I have set aside so that I may destroy them"

## The sword of Yahweh is dripping with blood and covered with fat, dripping with the blood of lambs and goats, covered with the fat of the kidneys of rams ##

Because of their sins, Yahweh slaughters the people of Edom the way priests sacrifice animals.

## Bozrah ##
