# will live there

"will live in the land of Edom"

# owl

See how you translated this in [Isaiah 13:21](../13/21.md).

# raven

This is a large black bird. It is difficult to identify some of the precise kinds of birds mentioned in this passage. However, they were all birds that preferred to live in places where there were no people, so they symbolize deserted places.

# in it

"there." This refers to Edom.

# He will stretch over it the measuring line of ruin and the plumbline of destruction

This speaks of Yahweh as if he were a careful builder as he causes destruction in Edom. AT: "Yahweh will measure that land carefully; he will measure it to to decide where to cause ruin and destruction" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# measuring line ... plumbline

These are builders' tools. See how you translated similar words in [Isaiah 28:17](../28/17.md).
