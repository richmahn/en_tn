# Her nobles ... her princes

"The nobles of Edom ... the princes of Edom"

# all her princes will be nothing

This exaggerates the princes losing their royal status by saying that they will become nothing. Alternate translation: "all her princes will no longer rule" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
