Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Jerusalem.

## And all your children will be taught by Yahweh ##

"children" refers to the future population of Jerusalem. AT: "And Yahweh will teach all your people"

## and nothing frightening will come near you ##

This means that no one in the city or outsiders will ever terrify the inhabitants.
