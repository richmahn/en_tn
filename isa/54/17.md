# General Information:

Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Jerusalem.

# No weapon that is formed against you will succeed

Enemies not succeeding against Yahweh's people is spoken of as if their weapons would not succeed against Yahweh's people. This can be stated in active form. AT: "Enemies may form weapons to attack you but they will not defeat you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# This is the heritage of the servants of Yahweh

The reward that Yahweh will give to those who serve him is spoken of as if the reward were something they would inherit. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# this is Yahweh's declaration

Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. Translate as in [Isaiah 30:1](../30/01.md). AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
