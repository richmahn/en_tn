# General Information:

Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Jerusalem.

# you will forget the shame of your youth and the disgrace of your abandonment

Yahweh telling the people that in the future they will not even think about the shame they experienced when their enemies defeated them is spoken of as if Yahweh were telling a woman that she will no longer think about the shame she experienced from being unable to have children and having her husband abandon her.
