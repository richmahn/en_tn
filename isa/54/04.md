Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Jerusalem.

## you will forget the shame of your youth and the disgrace of your abandonment ##

Yahweh is speaking to the people of Jerusalem as if they were a woman whose husband had left them and is addressing the shame they felt when the army of Babylon defeated them and took them into exile. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
