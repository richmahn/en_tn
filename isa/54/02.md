# General Information:

Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Jerusalem.

# Make your tent larger ... strengthen your stakes

This continues the metaphor that began in [Isaiah 54:1](./01.md). Yahweh telling the people of Jerusalem to prepare because Yahweh will greatly increase their people is spoken of as if he is telling a woman to make her tent bigger to make room for many children.
