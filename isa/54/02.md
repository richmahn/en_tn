# General Information:

Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Jerusalem.

# Make your tent larger ... strengthen your stakes

This continues the metaphor that began in [Isaiah 54:1](./01.md). Yahweh telling the people of Jerusalem to prepare because Yahweh will greatly increase their people is spoken of as if he is telling a woman to make her tent bigger to make room for many children. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# For you will spread out

Here "you" is singular and refers to the barren woman. She represents herself and all of her descendants. AT: "For you and your descendants will spread out" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# will conquer nations

Here "nations" represents the people. AT: "will conquer the people of other nations" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
