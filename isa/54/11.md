# General Information:

Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Jerusalem.

# Afflicted one

Here Yahweh speaks to the city of Jerusalem as if it were listening to him. Here Jerusalem represents the people who live there. Alternate translation: "You afflicted people of Jerusalem" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# storm-driven

Yahweh speaks of the people as if they were blown around and damaged by the winds and storms. This means the people were hurt and without stability. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# uncomforted one

"without comfort"

# I will set your pavement in turquoise ... lay your foundations with sapphires

Yahweh describes in ideal terms how he will restore Jerusalem and cause it to be beautiful again. Although the language may be exaggerated, you should translate this just as Yahweh described it.

# turquoise ... sapphires

These are precious gemstones. Turquoise is light blue-to-green, sapphires are typically dark blue. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
