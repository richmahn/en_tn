# I will set your pavement in turquoise ... wall of beautiful stone

Yahweh describes in ideal terms how he will restore Jerusalem and cause it to be beautiful again. Although the language may be exaggerated, you should translate this just as Yahweh described it.

# turquoise ... sapphires ... rubies

These are precious gemstones. Turquoise is light blue-to-green, sapphires are typically dark blue, and rubies are red-to-pink. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
