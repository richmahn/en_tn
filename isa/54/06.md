# Yahweh has called you back as a wife ... like a woman married young and rejected

Yahweh sending his people away into exile then bringing them back is spoken of as if Yahweh were a husband who had rejected his wife but now accepts her. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# grieved in spirit

Here "spirit" represents a person's inner being. AT: "grieved" or "made sad" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
