## translationNotes

* **by his right hand and by the arm of his strength** - This shows God will surely fulfill what he says. AT: "by his power" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
* **Surely I will no longer give your grain as food for your enemies** - This means God will not let the enemy conquer the people of Israel and take their grain. Perhaps the enemy took the grain in the past as a tax or to feed their own armies.
