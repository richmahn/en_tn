# I have put

Here "I" may refer to Isaiah or to Yahweh.

# watchmen on your walls

This refers to prophets, officials, or possibly angels, who are constantly praying for the people of Jerusalem like watchmen who constantly guard the city. See how you translated "watchmen" in [Isaiah 52:8](../52/08.md) and [Isaiah 56:10](../56/09.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# they are not silent day or night

This means they are continually pleading to Yahweh or calling to each other. Alternate translation: "they are earnestly praying to Yahweh throughout the entire day" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
