## translationNotes

* **You will also be a crown of beauty in the hand of Yahweh, and a turban of kingship in the hand of your God** - These mean the same thing and are combined for emphasis. They are indications that Jerusalem will become a royal city under the authority (hand) of God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
* **It will no more be said of you** - AT: "People will no longer call you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
* **and your land will be married** - This means Yahweh will love the people of Israel and will always be with them as a husband is. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
