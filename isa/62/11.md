# Look

"Take notice!"

# the ends of the earth

The places on the earth that are very far away are spoken of as if they were the places where the earth ends. This phrase also forms a merism and refers to everywhere in between the ends. See how you translated this in [Isaiah 40:28](../40/27.md). AT "the farthest places of the earth" or "the entire earth" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])

# the daughter of Zion

"Daughter" represents the people of Jerusalem (Zion). See how you translated this in [Isaiah 1:8](../01/07.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# See, his reward is with him, and his recompense is going before him

These clauses represent the same idea for emphasis. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Isaiah 40:10](../40/09.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# you will be called

This can be stated actively, "they will call you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
