# For Zion's sake I will not be silent, and for Jerusalem's sake I will not be quiet

Both of these statements mean the same thing. Here "Zion" and "Jerusalem" both represent the people who live in Jerusalem. AT: "For the sake of the people of Jerusalem I will not be silent" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# I will not be silent

It is most likely that "I" refers to Isaiah.

# until her righteousness proceeds brightly, and her salvation as a burning torch

Both clauses reassure the people that God will eventually come and save the people of Israel and that it will be as apparent as light is. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
