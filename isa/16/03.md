# General Information:

This continues the prophecy about the people of Moab. God describes events that will happen in the future as if it is happening in the present. Verses 3 and 4 is probably the message that the Moabite rulers send to the king of Judah. (See: [Isaiah 15:1-2](../15/01.md))

# provide some shade like night in the middle of the day

The heat of the middle of the day represents the Moabites' suffering from their enemies, and shade represents protection from their enemies. Comparing the shade to night shows that they want strong protection. AT: "protect us completely from our enemies as a large shadow protects people from the hot sun" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# Let them live among you, the refugees from Moab

"Allow the refugees from Moab to live with you." Here "you" refers to the people of Judah.

# be a hiding place for them from the destroyer

Providing a hiding place is spoken of as being a hiding place. AT: "give them a place to hide from those who are trying to destroy them" or "hide them from those who want to destroy them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
