## translationNotes

* This continues the prophecy about the people of Moab. God describes events that will happen in the future as if it is happening in the present. (See: [[en:bible:notes:isa:15:01]])
* **provide some shade like night in the middle of the day** - AT: "provide a place to rest like if night came during the hottest part of the day." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
* **Let them live among you, the refugees from Moab** - "Allow the refugees from Moab to live with you." Here "you" refers to the people of Judah. See how you translated "refugee" in [[en:bible:notes:isa:15:05]].
* **be a hiding-place for them from the destroyer** - "give them a place to hide from those who are trying to destroy them"
