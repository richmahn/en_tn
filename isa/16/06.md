## translationNotes

* This continues the prophecy about the people of Moab. God describes events that will happen in the future as if it is happening in the present. (See: [[en:bible:notes:isa:15:01]])
* **We have heard of Moab's pride, his arrogance, his boasting, and his anger** - "We" refers to Isaiah and includes the people of Judah. And the words "Moab's" and "his" refer to the people of Moab. AT: "We have heard that the people of Moab are proud and arrogant, and they boast and are full of rage." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
* **his boastings are empty words** - "but what they say about themselves means nothing"
* **So Moab wails for Moab, everyone wails** - "So all the people of Moab will cry out loud over what has happened to their cities."
* **You mourn for the raisin-cakes of Kir Hareseth that was completely devastated** - "You will mourn because Kir Hareseth is ruined and you can no longer go there to buy cakes made from raisins." Here "you" refers to the people of Moab. And, "Kir Hareseth" is the name of a city. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
