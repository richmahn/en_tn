# General Information:

This continues the prophecy about the people of Moab. God describes events that will happen in the future as if it is happening in the present. (See: [Isaiah 15:1-2](../15/01.md))

# We have heard of Moab's pride, his arrogance, his boasting, and his anger

The words "Moab's" and "his" refer to the people of Moab. AT: "We have heard that the people of Moab are proud and arrogant, boastful and angry" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# We have heard

Possible meanings are that 1) Isaiah is speaking and "We" refers to him and the people of Judah, or 2) God is speaking and "We" refers to God.

# But his boastings are empty words

"But what they say about themselves means nothing" or "But what they boast about is not true"
