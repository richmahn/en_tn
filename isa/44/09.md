# General Information:

Yahweh continues speaking.

# the things they delight in are worthless

"the idols they delight in are worthless"

# their witnesses cannot see or know anything

This phrase refers to those who worship these idols and who claim to be witnesses of the idols' power. Yahweh speaks of their inability to understand the truth as if they were blind. Alternate translation: "those who serve as witnesses for these idols are like blind people who know nothing" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# they will be put to shame

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "they will be ashamed" or "their idols will put them to shame" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
