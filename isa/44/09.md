Yahweh continues speaking.

## the things they delight in are worthless ##

"the images that are precious to them are useless"

## their witnesses cannot see or know anything ##

This means that those who say idols have power are spiritually blind and do not understand the truth. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## they will be put to shame ##

AT: "and I will put them to shame" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## Who would form a god or cast an idol that is worthless? ##

Yahweh is using this question to rebuke those who make idols. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
