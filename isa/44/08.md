# General Information:

Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.

# Do not fear or be afraid

Yahweh uses two similar expressions in order to strengthen his encouragement. Alternate translation: "Do not be afraid" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# Have I not declared to you long ago, and announced it?

Yahweh uses this question to emphasize that he is the one who predicted the events that have now happened. This can be translated as a statement. The word "announced" means basically the same thing as "declared." Alternate translation: "I declared these things to you long ago." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# Is there any God besides me?

Yahweh uses a question again to emphasize that there is no other God. This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: "There is no God besides me." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# There is no other Rock

Yahweh speaks of himself as if he were a large rock under which people can find shelter. This means he has the power to protect his people. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
