Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.

## Have I not declared to you long ago, and announced it? ##

Yahweh uses this question to emphasize that he is the one who predicted the events that have now happened. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## Is there any God besides me? ##

Yahweh uses a question again to emphasize the that there is no other God.

## There is no other Rock ##

Here Yahweh compares himself to a rock. This means he has the power to protect his people (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
