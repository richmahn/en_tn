# It is as if he were eating ashes

Yahweh speaks of a person worshiping an idol as if that person were eating the burned ashes of the wood from which he made the idol. Just as eating ashes does not benefit a person, neither does worshiping an idol. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# his deceived heart misleads him

The heart represents the inner person. AT: "he misleads himself because he is deceived" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# He cannot rescue himself

"The person who worships idols cannot save himself"
