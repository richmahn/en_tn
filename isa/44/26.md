## who fulfills the declarations of his servant and brings to pass the counsel of his messengers ##

Yahweh is saying the same thing twice for emphasis. It is only Yahweh who causes the prophesies to be fulfilled. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## She will be inhabited ##

AT: "People will live there again" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## They will be built again, and I will raise up her waste places ##

AT: "I will rebuild the ruined cities"

## who says to the deep sea ##

Yahweh commands the sea to do what seems impossible to demonstrate his power. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
