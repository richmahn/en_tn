## translationNotes

* **Sing, you heavens...glory in Israel** - In 44:23 Isaiah turns his attention from the people of Israel and speaks to others as if they were there. Isaiah speaks to the heavens, mountains, and trees as if they were people. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_apostrophe]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
