# Now should I make ... something disgusting to worship? Should I bow down to a block of wood?

Yahweh says that these people should be asking themselves these rhetorical questions. The questions anticipate negative answers and emphasize how foolish it would be for a person to do these things. These questions can be translated as statements. AT: "I should not now make ... something disgusting to worship. I should not bow down to a block of wood." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
