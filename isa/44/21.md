Yahweh continues speaking.

## Jacob, and Israel ##

AT: "you descendants of Israel" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

## you will not be forgotten by me ##

AT: "I will not forget you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## I have blotted out, like a thick cloud, your rebellious deeds, and like a cloud, your sins ##

Both of these statements mean the same thing. God has removed their sins as quickly and easily as a wind can blow away a cloud. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
