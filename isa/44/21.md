# General Information:

Yahweh continues speaking.

# Jacob, and Israel

This refers to people descended from Jacob, Israel. AT: "you descendants of Israel" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# you will not be forgotten by me

This can be stated in active form. AT: "I will not forget you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# I have blotted out, like a thick cloud, your rebellious deeds, and like a cloud, your sins

Both of these statements mean the same thing. God has removed their sins as quickly and easily as a wind can blow away a cloud. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# like a cloud, your sins

The verb may be supplied from the previous phrase. AT: "like a cloud, I have blotted out your sins" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
