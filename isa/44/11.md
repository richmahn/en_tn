Yahweh continues speaking.

## all his associates will be put to shame ##

AT: "I will put to shame all who help him make his idol" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## Let them take their stand together ##

"Let them all come together before me"

## they will cower and be put to shame ##

AT: "they will be afraid and I will put them to shame"
