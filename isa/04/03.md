# the one who is left in Zion and the one who remains in Jerusalem

Both of these statements mean the same thing. Here "the one who" does not refer to a specific person but to people in general who are still alive in Jerusalem. Alternate translation: "everyone who remains in Jerusalem" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])

# will be called holy

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "the Lord will call them holy" or "will belong to the Lord" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# everyone who is written down as living in Jerusalem

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "everyone whose name is on the list of the people who live in Jerusalem" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
