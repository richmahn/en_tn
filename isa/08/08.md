The Lord continues to describe the army of Assyria as a river that will flood Judah. (See: [Isaiah 8:5](./05.md))

## and it will sweep onward into Judah, flooding and passing on, until it reaches to the your neck ##

"and more and more soldiers will come like waters rising up to your neck" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]]) AT: "The army will spread out over your entire land like a bird spreading its wings over its prey."

## O Immanuel ##

See how you translated this in [Isaiah 7:13](../07/13.md).
