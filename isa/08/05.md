## Because this people have refused the gentle waters of Shiloah ##

These gentle, flowing waters are compared to the teachings of the Lord that were always available to lead the people of Jerusalem. AT: "Because this people have rejected Yahweh's help which is like the gentle waters of Shiloah." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

## and are happy over Rezin and Remaliahâ€™s son ##

See how you translated these names in [Isaiah 7:1](../07/01.md). The full meaning can be made explicit: "and are happy that the armies of Assyria have defeated Rezin, king of Aram, and Pekah, Remaliah's son, king of Israel." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

## therefore the Lord is ##

Yahweh is still speaking. He refers to himself as "the Lord." AT: "therefore I am."

## up on them ##

"up on the people of Judah"

## the waters of the River, mighty and many, the king of Assyria and all his glory ##

AT: "the army from Assyria that is powerful like a mighty river."
