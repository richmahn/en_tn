## Yahweh  spoke  to me, with his strong hand upon me ##

"Yahweh spoke to me in a very powerful way"

## and warned me not to walk in the way of this people ##

"and warned me not to act like this people." This is an indirect quote that ends in 8:17. AT: "and warned me and said, 'do not act like this people.'" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])

## Do not call conspiracy anything that this people calls conspiracy ##

AT: "Do not worry like this people who think someone is always trying to harm them."

## Yahweh of Hosts, him you will treat as holy; him you will fear, him you will be in awe of ##

If you translate this as a direct quote you can also translate it with Yahweh speaking in the first person: "But, you will consider me, Yahweh of Hosts, as holy. And, you will fear and be in awe of me."
