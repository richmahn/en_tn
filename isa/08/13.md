# It is Yahweh of hosts whom you will honor as holy; he is the one you must fear, and he is the one you must dread

If you translate this as a direct quote, you can also translate it with Yahweh speaking in the first person: "But you will consider me, Yahweh of Hosts, as holy. And you will fear and be in awe of me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pronouns]])
