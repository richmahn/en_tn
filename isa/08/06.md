# Because this people has refused the gentle waters of Shiloah

The words "gentle waters" are a metaphor for the law of the Lord. AT: "Because this people has rejected Yahweh's law, which is like the gentle waters of Shiloah" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# this people

"this people group." If your language needs a plural here, you can translate this phrase and the following verbs as "these people have refused ... are happy."

# is happy over Rezin and Remaliah's son

The full meaning can be made explicit. See how you translated these men's names in [Isaiah 7:1](../07/01.md). AT: "is happy that the armies of Assyria have defeated Rezin, king of Aram, and Pekah, Remaliah's son, king of Israel" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
