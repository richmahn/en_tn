## Bind up my testimony, seal the the official record ##

AT: "Close up tightly the scroll with this message written on it." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## my testimony...my disciples ##

It is unclear to whom the word "my" refers. It could be Isaiah or Yahweh. It is best to leave the pronouns ambiguous if your language will allow it. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ambiguity]])

## I will wait for Yahweh ##

Here "I" refers to Isaiah.

## who hides his face from the house of Jacob ##

AT: "who has taken away his blessing from the people of Israel." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## I and the sons whom Yahweh has given me are for signs and for wonders in Israel ##

"I and the sons Yahweh has given me are like signs to warn the people of Israel." The sons are Shear-Jashub and Maher-shalal-hash-baz whose names are a message to the people of Israel. (See: [Isaiah 7:3](../07/03.md) and [Isaiah 8:1](./01.md))
