# Bind up my testimony, seal the official record

These two phrases mean basically the same thing. AT: "Close up tightly the scroll with this message written on it" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# my testimony ... my disciples

It is unclear to whom the word "my" refers. It could be Isaiah or Yahweh. It is best to leave the pronouns ambiguous if your language will allow it.

# I will wait for Yahweh

Here "I" refers to Isaiah.

# who hides his face from the house of Jacob

Yahweh's "face" is a metonym for his blessing or favor. AT: "who has taken away his blessing from the house of Jacob" or "who no longer looks with favor on the house of Jacob" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# house of Jacob

people of Israel

# I and the sons whom Yahweh has given me are for signs and for wonders in Israel

"I and the sons Yahweh has given me are like signs to warn the people of Israel." The sons are Shear-Jashub and Maher-shalal-hash-baz, whose names are a message to the people of Israel. (See: [Isaiah 7:3](../07/03.md) and [Isaiah 8:1](./01.md))
