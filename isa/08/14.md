# General Information:

Isaiah continues the indirect quote of Yahweh that began in [Isaiah 8:11-13](./11.md). It can be translated as a direct quote with Yahweh speaking in the first person. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pronouns]])

# He will become a sanctuary

The word "sanctuary" is a metaphor for Yahweh keeping his people safe and protecting them. AT: "He will protect them when they go to him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# he will be a trap and a snare to the people of Jerusalem

The words "trap" and "snare" mean almost the same thing and emphasize that when Yahweh decides to punish the people of Jerusalem they will not be able to escape. AT: "he will trap the people of Jerusalem so they cannot escape him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
