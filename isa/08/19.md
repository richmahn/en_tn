# General Information:

Isaiah is speaking.

# They will say to you, "Consult with the those who speak with the dead and with spirits," the ones who chirp and mutter incantations. But should a people not consult their God? Should they consult the dead on behalf of the living? To the law and to the testimony!

Other possible meanings are 1) "They will say to you, 'Consult with the mediums and spiritists, those who chirp and mutter incantations. Should a people not consult their gods? They should consult the dead on behalf of the living for teaching and for testimony.'" or 2) "When they say to you, 'Consult with the mediums and spiritists, those who chirp and mutter incantations,' should a people not consult their God? Should they consult the dead on behalf of the living? To the law and to the testimony!"

# They will say to you

The word "they" refers to those who do not trust Yahweh. The word "you" is plural and refers to those who trust Yahweh. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# the ones who chirp and mutter incantations

The words "chirp" and "mutter" refer to the sounds mediums and spiritists made when trying to speak to dead people. AT: "they people who whisper and mutter their magic words to try and speak to dead people"

# chirp

make sounds like birds

# But should a people not consult their God? Should they consult the dead on behalf of the living?

These questions are to show that people should consult God instead of foolishly trying to talk to dead people. AT: "But people should ask Yahweh to guide them. They should not seek answers from those who have died." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
