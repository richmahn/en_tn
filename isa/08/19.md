## translationNotes

* Isaiah is speaking.

* **Consult with** - "Talk with"
* **mediums and magicians** - "witches and wizards." This refers to those who said they could speak with those who had died.

* **If they do not say such things, it is because they have no light of dawn** - AT: "If they do not speak of the law and the testimony, it is because they are like a person lost in the dark." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
