# I and the sons whom Yahweh has given me are for signs and for wonders in Israel

"I and the sons Yahweh has given me are like signs to warn the people of Israel." The sons are Shear-Jashub and Maher-shalal-hash-baz, whose names are a message to the people of Israel. (See: [Isaiah 7:3](../07/03.md) and [Isaiah 8:1](./01.md))
