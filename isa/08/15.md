# Many will stumble over it and fall and be broken, and be ensnared and captured

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "Many people will stumble over the stone, and when they fall they will not get up. And many people will step into the trap, and they will not be able to get out" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# ensnared and captured

These two words mean basically the same thing and emphasize that they will be caught in the trap. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
