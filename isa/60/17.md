# General Information:

Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.

# instead of wood, bronze, and instead of stones, iron

Yahweh will give more valuable building materials to them now. AT: "instead of wood, I will bring bronze, and instead of stones, I will bring iron" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# I will appoint peace as your governors, and justice your rulers

Yahweh describes "peace" and "justice" as human rulers. This means there will be complete peace and justice in the land of Israel. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# Violence will no longer be heard in your land

This can be stated in active form. AT: "There will no longer be reports of violence in your land" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# but you will call your walls Salvation, and your gates Praise

The physical objects have the names of spiritual qualities. The city of Jerusalem will be a safe place, and the people there will praise Yahweh. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
