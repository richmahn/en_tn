Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.

## instead of wood, bronze, and instead of stones, iron ##

Yahweh will give them more valuable building materials to them now. AT: "instead of wood, I will bring bronze, and instead of stones, I will bring iron"  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

## I will appoint peace as your governors, and justice your rulers ##

Yahweh describes "peace" and "justice" as human rulers. This means there will be complete peace and justice in the land of Israel. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

## Violence will no longer be heard in your land ##

AT: "There will no longer be violence in your land" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## but you will call your walls Salvation, and your gates Praise ##

This means the city of Jerusalem will be a safe place, and the people there will praise Yahweh. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
