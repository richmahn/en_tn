Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.

## that I may be glorified ##

AT: "so that you may glorify me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## the branch of my planting ##

Yahweh is comparing the people to young shoots coming up, which he, as a gardener, planted. Yahweh has placed his people in the land of Israel. This gives hope to the people. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## a thousand ##

"1,000" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])
