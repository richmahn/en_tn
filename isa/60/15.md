# General Information:

Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.

# with no one passing through you

"with everyone avoiding your land" or "with all the foreigners avoiding your land"

# You will also drink the milk of the nations, and will nurse at the breast of kings

This refers to the wealth and plenty that will be drained from foreign nations. Both clauses repeat the same idea for emphasis. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
