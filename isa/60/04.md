Isaiah continues speaking to the people of Israel.

## They all gather themselves ##

"They" refers to the rest of the people of Israel returning to Jerusalem.

## your daughters will be carried in their arms ##

AT: "You will be brought back like daughters being carried on the hip" or "they will carry your daughters on the hip" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## Then you will look and be radiant, and your heart shall rejoice and overflow ##

This is saying the same thing in two different ways and emphasizes that they will be very happy at what will happen in Jerusalem. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## the abundance of the sea ##

This refers to the riches and goods that will come to Jerusalem via ships, perhaps from along the Mediterranean Sea.
