Isaiah is speaking to the people of Israel. He continues the metaphor about "light" and "dark." (See: [Isaiah 60:1](./01.md))

## Though darkness will cover the earth, and thick darkness the nations ##

Both of these phrases mean the same thing and are combined for emphasis. They refer to "spiritual darkness." This means all the other people of the world will not know Yahweh or how to please him. This is a metaphor for divine judgment. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## yet Yahweh will arise upon you ##

This means the people of Israel will have the light of God's presence, and it will light their way.

## and his glory will be seen on you ##

AT: "and the people of the nations will see his glory on you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
