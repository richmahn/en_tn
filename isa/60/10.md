Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.

## they will not be shut day nor night ##

AT: "no one will ever shut them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])

## so that the wealth of the nations may be brought, with their kings being led ##

AT: "so that the people of the nations may bring their wealth, along with their kings"
