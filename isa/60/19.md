Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.

## Your sun will no longer set, nor will your moon withdraw and disappear ##

This is not to be understood literally. The sun and moon will not disappear. This is saying that in comparison to the light of Yahweh, they will be nothing. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
