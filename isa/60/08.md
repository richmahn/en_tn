# General Information:

Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.

# Who are these who fly along like a cloud, and like the doves to their shelters?

Yahweh uses questions and poetic images to draw attention here. He compares the sails of the ships to clouds and doves. This is also a picture of the Israelites returning to the country where they belong. AT: "Look, I see something like clouds moving quickly and like doves returning to their shelters." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# The coastlands

This refers to the people who live on the coastlands and describes the area of coastlands as if it was people looking out. AT: "The people from the coastlands" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
