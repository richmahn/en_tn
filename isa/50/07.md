# General Information:

Yahweh's servant continues speaking.

# therefore I am not disgraced

Even though the servant has been mistreated, he will not be ashamed because he has obeyed Yahweh. This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "therefore I will not be ashamed" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# so I have made my face like flint

Here "my face" refers to the servant. The servant being steadfastly determined to obey Yahweh is spoken of as if his face were as hard as flint. Alternate translation: "so I am absolutely determined" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# for I know that I will not be put to shame

The servant looks to the future with confidence, secure in Yahweh's calling. This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "for I know that my enemies will not be able to make me feel shame" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
