## all you who light a fire â€¦ flames that you have ignited ##

Isaiah continues to speak here for God. This refers to the people in darkness who try to save themselves by their own light or their own wisdom and do what they want to do instead of obeying God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## From my hand ##

This refers to Yahweh. AT: "From me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

## you will lie down in a place of pain ##

Here to "lie down" refers to dying. AT: "You will die with great suffering" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
