# General Information:

The servant of Yahweh continues speaking.

# The Lord Yahweh has opened my ear

Yahweh enabling his servant to hear and understand is spoken of as if Yahweh opened his ear. AT: "The Lord Yahweh has enabled me to hear and understand him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# I was not rebellious, nor did I turn away backward

These two phrases mean basically the same thing. Disobeying what Yahweh said is spoken of as if it were turning one's back toward him. This can be stated in positive terms. AT: "I obeyed what he said" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
