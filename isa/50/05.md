The servant of Yahweh continues speaking.

## has opened my ear ##

AT: "has enabled me to hear him speaking" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

## and I was not rebellious, nor did I turn away backward ##

AT: "and I obeyed what he said"

## I did not hide my face from acts of shame and spitting ##

AT: "I gave myself to those who mocked me and spat at me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
