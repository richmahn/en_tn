Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.

## Why did I come but there was no one there? Why did I call but no one answered? ##

Yahweh uses a question to emphasize that the people are in exile not because he was not willing to save them but because they did not respond to him. AT: "I came to you, but you did not respond to me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## Was my hand too short to ransom you? Was there no power in me to rescue you? ##

Yahweh uses a question to emphasize that he has the power to rescue his people. AT: "I certainly have the power to rescue you from your enemies"

## I clothe the sky with darkness; I cover it with sackcloth ##

This means Yahweh has the power to make the sky dark. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
