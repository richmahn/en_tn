## Where is the certificate of divorce with which I divorced your mother? ##

Yahweh uses a question for emphasis. Here "mother" refers to the city of Zion. This means that Yahweh did not send the people of Zion away like a man who decides to divorce his wife. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## And to which of my creditors did I sell you? ##

Yahweh uses a question for emphasis. This means Yahweh did not send his people into slavery like a man who sells his children to pay for his debts.

## you were sold because of your sins, and because of your rebellion, your mother was sent away ##

AT: "I sent you away because you continually sinned and rebelled against me." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
