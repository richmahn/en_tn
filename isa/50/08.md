# General Information:

Yahweh's servant continues speaking.

# Who will oppose me? Let us stand ... Who is my accuser? Let him come

The servant uses these questions to emphasize that there is no one who can legitimately accuse him of wrong. AT: "If anyone would oppose me, let us stand ... If anyone would accuse me, let him come" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
