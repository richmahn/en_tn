# General Information:

Yahweh's servant continues speaking.

# Who will oppose me? Let us stand ... Who is my accuser? Let him come

The servant uses these questions to emphasize that there is no one who can legitimately accuse him of wrong. AT: "If anyone would oppose me, let us stand ... If anyone would accuse me, let him come" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Who will declare me guilty?

The servant uses this question to assert that no one can declare him guilty. AT: "There is no one who can declare me guilty." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# they will all wear out like a garment; the moth will eat them up

There being no one left to accuse the servant of being guilty is spoken of as if the accusers were garments that wear thin and are eaten by moths. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
