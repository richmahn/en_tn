Yahweh's servant continues speaking.

## Who will oppose me… Who is my accuser… Who will declare me guilty? ##

The servant uses these questions to emphasize that no one can prove before God that he has done anything wrong. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## they will all wear out like a garment; the moth will eat them up ##

This means God will remove those who accuse his servant. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
