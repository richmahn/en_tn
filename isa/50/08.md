## translationNotes

* Yahweh's servant continues speaking.
* **Who will oppose me… Who is my accuser… Who will declare me guilty?** - The servant uses these questions to emphasize that no one can prove before God that he has done anything wrong. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **they will all wear out like a garment; the moth will eat them up** - This means God will remove those who accuse his servant. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
