# General Information:

The servant continues speaking to the people of Israel.

# Who among you fears Yahweh? Who obeys the voice of his servant? Who walks in deep darkness without light? He should ... his God.

The servant uses these questions to identify those to whom he is speaking. Alternate translation: "If someone among you fears Yahweh and obeys the voice of his servant, but he walks in deep darkness without light, then he should ... his God." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# obeys the voice of his servant

Here the word "voice" represents what the servant says. Alternate translation: "obeys his servant" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# walks in deep darkness without light

The servant speaks of people who are suffering and feel helpless as if they were walking in a very dark place. Alternate translation: "is suffering and feels helpless" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# trust in the name of Yahweh and lean on his God

These two phrases mean basically the same thing. Here the word "name" represents Yahweh himself. Trusting in God is spoken of as if it were leaning on him. Alternate translation: "trust in Yahweh, his God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
