## translationNotes

* The servant continues speaking to the people of Israel.
* **Who among you fears Yahweh? Who obeys the voice of his servant? Who walks in deep darkness without light?** - Here Isaiah lays out responses to the servant in question form, telling God's people to continue to trust and obey Yahweh, even in the darkness.
