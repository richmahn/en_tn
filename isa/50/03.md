# I clothe the sky with darkness; I cover it with sackcloth

These two phrases mean basically the same thing. Yahweh speaks of causing the sky to become dark as if he were clothing it with sackcloth. AT: "I make the sky dark, as if it were wearing dark sackcloth" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
