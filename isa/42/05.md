# the one who created the heavens and stretched them out, the one who made the earth

The prophet speaks of Yahweh creating the heavens and the earth as if the heavens and earth were fabric which Yahweh stretched out. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# gives breath to the people on it and life to those who live on it

These phrases mean basically the same thing and emphasize that Yahweh gives life to every person. The word "breath" is a metonym for life. AT: "gives life to the people who live on the earth" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
