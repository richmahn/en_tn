# General Information:

Yahweh continues speaking.

# A crushed reed he will not break, and a dimly burning wick he will not quench

Yahweh speaks of weak and helpless people as if they were crushed reeds and dimly burning wicks. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# crushed reed

A reed is the long, thin stem of a plant like tall grass. If it is crushed, it cannot carry any weight. See how you translated this in [Isaiah 36:6](../36/06.md).

# he will not break

"My servant will not break"

# the coastlands

This refers to the people who live on the islands and in the lands bordering or beyond the Mediterranean Sea. See how you translated this in [Isaiah 41:1](../41/01.md). AT: "the people who live on the coastlands" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
