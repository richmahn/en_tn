# General Information:

Yahweh continues speaking.

# you deaf ... you blind

Here "you" is plural and refers to the people of Israel. Yahweh speaks of their failure to listen to him and obey him as if they are deaf and blind. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
