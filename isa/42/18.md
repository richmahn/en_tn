Yahweh continues speaking.

## you deaf...you blind ##

Here "you" is plural and refers to the people of Israel. The people are spiritually deaf and blind which means they do not listen to or obey God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## Who is blind...as Yahweh's servant? ##

In 42:18 Yahweh uses questions to scold his people. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
