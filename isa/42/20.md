Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.

## You see many things, but do not comprehend ##

"Although you see many things, you do not know understand what they mean"

## It pleased Yahweh to praise his justice and make glorious the Law ##

"Yahweh was pleased to honor his justice and his law"
