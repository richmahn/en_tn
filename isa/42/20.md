# General Information:

Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.

# You see many things, but do not comprehend

"Although you see many things, you do not understand what they mean"

# ears are open, but no one hears

The ability to hear is spoken of as if the ears were open. Here the word "hears" refers to understanding what one hears. AT: "people hear, but no one understands what they hear" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
