Isaiah speaks of Yahweh's anger as if it were a liquid that could be poured out. Alternate translation: "he showed them just how angry he was" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# on them

"against us." Here "them" refers to the people of Israel, but Isaiah still included himself as part of the people.

# and the violence of war

The word "devastation" can be translated with a verb. Alternate translation: "by devastating them with war" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# Its flames encircled them ... it consumed them

Isaiah speaks of Yahweh's fierce anger as if it were a fire that burned the people. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# they did not take it to heart

Paying attention to something and learning from it is spoken of as if it were placing that thing on one's heart. Alternate translation: "they did not pay attention" or "they did not learn from it" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
