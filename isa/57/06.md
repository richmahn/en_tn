Yahweh continues speaking to the unfaithful people of Israel.

## that have been assigned to you ##

AT: "that is your lot" or "that is your inheritance" The exact meaning in Hebrew is unclear. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## In these things should I take pleasure? ##

Yahweh uses a question to scold the people. AT: "Certainly, these things do not please me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
