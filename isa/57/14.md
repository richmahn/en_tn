## translationNotes

* **Build, build! Clear a way! Remove all the stumbling blocks from the path of my people** - Yahweh is emphatic and urgent that a clear and level road be available for the people to return to him. Basically he is referring to their lives being rid of idols. This echoes Isaiah 40:3. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **For this is what the high and lofty One says, who lives eternally, whose name is holy ** - See the way you translated something similar in 6:1, 33:10, and 52:13.
* **to revive the spirit of the humble ones, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones** - This is saying the same thing in two ways for emphasis. Yahweh will greatly encourage the humble. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
* **spiritâ€¦heart** - Here these refer to a person's thoughts and emotions, not the spirit and heart literally. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
