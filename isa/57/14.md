# Build, build! Clear a way! Remove all the stumbling blocks from the path of my people

Yahweh is emphatic and urgent that a clear and level road be available for the people to return to him and free of obstacles to worshiping Yahweh. This echoes [Isaiah 40:3](../40/03.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# For this is what the high and elevated One says

The words "high" and "elevated" have basically the same meaning here and emphasize Yahweh being exalted. See how you translated this in [Isaiah 6:1](../06/01.md) and [Isaiah 33:10](../33/10.md). See how you translated a similar phrase in [Isaiah 52:13](../52/13.md).

# to revive the spirit of the humble ones, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones

These two phrases mean basically the same thing and emphasize that Yahweh will strengthen and encourage those who humble themselves before him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# spirit ... heart

Here these refer to a person's thoughts and emotions, not the spirit and heart literally. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
