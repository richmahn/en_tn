## Build, build! Clear a way! Remove all the stumbling blocks from the path of my people ##

Yahweh is emphatic and urgent that a clear and level road be available for the people to return to him. Basically he is referring to their lives being rid of idols. This echoes Isaiah 40:3. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## For this is what the high and lofty One says, who lives eternally, whose name is holy  ##

See the way you translated something similar in 6:1, 33:10, and 52:13.

## to revive the spirit of the humble ones, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones ##

This is saying the same thing in two ways for emphasis. Yahweh will greatly encourage the humble. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## spiritâ€¦heart ##

Here these refer to a person's thoughts and emotions, not the spirit and heart literally. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
