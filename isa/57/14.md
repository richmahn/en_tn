# Build, build! Clear a way! Remove all the stumbling blocks from the path of my people

Yahweh is emphatic and urgent that a clear and level road be available for the people to return to him and free of obstacles to worshiping Yahweh. This echoes [Isaiah 40:3](../40/03.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
