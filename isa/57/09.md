Yahweh continues speaking to the unfaithful people of Israel.

## you went down to Sheol ##

The people did not literally go to Sheol. Yahweh is exaggerating slightly to emphasize how far they were willing to travel to find new gods to worship. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

## therefore you did not weaken ##

This means they continued seeking for other gods. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
