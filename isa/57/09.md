## translationNotes

* Yahweh continues speaking to the unfaithful people of Israel.
* **you went down to Sheol** - The people did not literally go to Sheol. Yahweh is exaggerating slightly to emphasize how far they were willing to travel to find new gods to worship. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
* **therefore you did not weaken** - This means they continued seeking for other gods. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
