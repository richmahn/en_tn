Yahweh continues speaking to the unfaithful people of Israel.

## Whom are you worried about and afraid of, that you acted so deceitfully? ##

Yahweh uses a question to scold the people. AT: "You must really fear these idols for you to act so deceitfully" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## call me to mind ##

"pay attention to me" or "remember me"

## I was not long silent, was I? ##

Yahweh uses a question to scold the people. AT: "I waited a long time before I punished you for your sins"

## I will proclaim your 'righteousness' ##

Here Yahweh is being sarcastic, calling their evil deeds so-called righteousness. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])
