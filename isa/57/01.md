# are gathered away ... rest in their beds

Both of these refer to dying. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])

# that the righteous is gathered away from the evil

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "that the righteous people die, and Yahweh takes them away from all that is evil" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
