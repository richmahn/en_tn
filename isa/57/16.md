## translationNotes

* Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.
* **I hid my face** - This means God gave up on his people and no longer helped or blessed them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
* ** he went backward in the way of his heart. ** - This means the Israelites kept rejecting the true God for false ones.
