# General Information:

Yahweh continues speaking to the unfaithful people of Israel.

# let your collection of idols rescue you

Yahweh is mocking the people and their idols. He tells the idols to save the people though he knows they cannot. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])

# the wind will carry them all away, a breath will carry them all away

This is saying the same thing in two ways to emphasize that idols are helpless and worthless. AT: "the wind, or even a breath, will blow them away" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# holy mountain

The "holy mountain" is Mount Zion, in Jerusalem. See how you translated this in [Isaiah 11:9](../11/08.md).
