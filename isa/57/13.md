Yahweh continues speaking to the unfaithful people of Israel.

## let your collection of idols rescue you ##

Yahweh is mocking the people and their idols. He tells the idols to save the people though he knows they cannot. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])

## Instead the wind will carry them all away, a breath will carry them all away. ##

This is saying the same thing in two ways for emphasis. It means the idols are helpless and worthless. AT: "Instead the wind or even a breath will blow them away."  This might refer to the breath of God's spirit. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

## holy mountain ##

See how you translated this in [Isaiah 11:8](../11/08.md).
