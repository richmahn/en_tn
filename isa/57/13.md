## translationNotes

* Yahweh continues speaking to the unfaithful people of Israel.
* **let your collection of idols rescue you** - Yahweh is mocking the people and their idols. He tells the idols to save the people though he knows they cannot. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
* **Instead the wind will carry them all away, a breath will carry them all away.** - This is saying the same thing in two ways for emphasis. It means the idols are helpless and worthless. AT: "Instead the wind or even a breath will blow them away."  This might refer to the breath of God's spirit. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
* **holy mountain** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:isa:11:08]].
