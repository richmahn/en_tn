Yahweh continues speaking to the unfaithful people of Israel.

## on a high mountain ##

People often went on top of hills and mountains to worship false gods. They thought those were the best places for worship. This might even refer to Jerusalem, too. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

## you prepared your bed ##

This refers to having sex with prostitutes as a part of worshiping false gods. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])

## You made a covenant with them  ##

AT: "You made a contract with them" or "You bribed them"

## made yourselves naked, and went up; you made your bed wide. You made a covenant with them; you loved their beds; you saw their private parts ##

This refers to the Israelites joining with those who worship false gods. This also included participating in sexual immorality.
