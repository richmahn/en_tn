# Isaiah 57 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetry in this chapter.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Child sacrifice #####
This chapter references the killing of children. Some religions in the ancient Near East practiced the sacrificing of their children. This was considered evil by Yahweh. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/evil]])

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### Mocking #####
The people abandoned the worship of Yahweh in favor of other gods. When they needed help, he tells them to ask these false gods. This is mocking the power of the false gods and shows the people the uselessness of their worship of these gods. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/falsegod]])
