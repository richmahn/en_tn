Yahweh continues speaking to the coastlands and the nations.

## He pursues them and passes by safely ##

"The powerful ruler from the east and his army pursue the nations, and the nations do not harm him"

## by a swift path that his feet scarcely touch ##

"and he and his army will even move quickly over paths they have never traveled before" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## Who has performed and accomplished these deeds? Who has called forth the generations from the beginning? ##

Yahweh uses questions to emphasize that he is the one in control of all people and nations. AT: "I, Yahweh, the first, and with the last ones, I am he who performed and accomplished these deeds. I called forth the generations from the beginning." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## the first, and with the last ones ##

This means God has no beginning or ending. He is eternal.
