## translationNotes

* Yahweh continues speaking to the coastlands and the nations.
* **He pursues them and passes by safely** - "The powerful ruler from the east and his army pursue the nations, and the nations do not harm him"
* **by a swift path that his feet scarcely touch** - "and he and his army will even move quickly over paths they have never traveled before" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
* **Who has performed and accomplished these deeds? Who has called forth the generations from the beginning?
* Yahweh uses questions to emphasize that he is the one in control of all people and nations. AT: "I, Yahweh, the first, and with the last ones, I am he who performed and accomplished these deeds. I called forth the generations from the beginning." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
* **the first, and with the last ones** - This means God has no beginning or ending. He is eternal.
