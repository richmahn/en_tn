# Listen before me in silence

Here "me" refers to God.

# you coastlands

This refers to the people who live on the islands and in the lands bordering or beyond the Mediterranean Sea. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe]])

# renew their strength

See how you translated this phrase in [Isaiah 40:31](../40/31.md).

# let them come near and speak; let us come near together to argue a dispute

These two phrases share similar meanings. The second explains the reason for the first. AT: "then let them come near so they may speak and reason with me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
