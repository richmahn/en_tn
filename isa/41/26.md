# Who announced this from the beginning, that we might know? Before this time, that we may say, "He is right"?

Yahweh uses these rhetorical questions to mock the idols that the people worship. The implied answers are 1) that the idols have not done these things and 2) that Yahweh is the one who has done these things. AT: "None of the idols announced this from the beginning, that we might know. And none of them announced this before time, that we may say, 'He is right.'" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and[[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# Indeed none of them decreed it, yes, none heard you say anything

"Indeed, none of the idols decreed it. Indeed, no one heard you idols say anything"
