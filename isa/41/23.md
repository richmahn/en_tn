# Connecting Statement:

Yahweh continues to mock the idols and the people who worship them. (See: [Isaiah 41:21-22](./21.md))

# do something good or evil

The words "good" and "evil" form a merism and represent anything. Alternate translation: "do anything at all" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
