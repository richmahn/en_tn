Yahweh continues mocking the idols and the people who worship them. (See: [Isaiah 41:21](./21.md))

## Do something good or evil ##

AT: "Do anything at all" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])

## he who chooses you ##

Here "you" is plural and refers to the idols. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
