# you whom I am bringing back from the ends of the earth, and whom I called from the far away places

These two lines mean basically the same thing and emphasize that Yahweh is bringing the people of Israel back to their land from distant countries. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# the ends of the earth

The places on the earth that are very far away are spoken of as if they were the places where the earth ends. See how you translated this in [Isaiah 41:5](./05.md). AT "the farthest places of the earth" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# I have chosen you and not rejected you

These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The second states in negative terms what the first states in positive terms. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
