# Connecting Statement:

Yahweh continues to use the metaphor of separating grain from chaff to describe how Israel will defeat their enemies.

# You will winnow them ... the wind will scatter them

Here the word "them" refers to the mountains and hill in [Isaiah 41:15](./14.md). This represents the next step in the process of threshing grain, in which the grain is winnowed to get rid of the chaff. Israel's enemies will disappear like chaff blown away by the wind. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the wind will carry them away; the wind will scatter them

These two phrases mean the same thing. AT: "the wind will blow them away" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
