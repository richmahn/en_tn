Yahweh continues describing to the people of Israel how they will defeat their enemies. (See: [Isaiah 41:14](./14.md))

## You will winnow them, and the wind will carry them away; the wind will scatter them. ##

Yahweh tells the people of Israel they will defeat their enemies so completely that they will disappear. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
