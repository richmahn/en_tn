Yahweh continues speaking.

## I have raised up one ##

"I have appointed and given the strength"

## from the sun's rising ##

AT: â€œfrom the east" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

## and he will trample the rulers like mud, like a potter who is treading on the clay ##

This means this king and his army will defeat their enemy. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

## he will trample the rulers ##

AT: "he will conquer the rulers" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## Who announced this from the beginning, that we might know? And before time, that we may say, 'He is right'? ##

Yahweh uses questions to scold the people and their idols. AT: "I was the one who announced this a long time ago, so that you might know and say 'Yahweh is right.'" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## Indeed none of them decreed it, yes, none heard you say anything ##

"Certainly, none of your idols announced it. They did not say anything"
