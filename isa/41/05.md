# General Information:

Yahweh continues speaking.

# The isles ... the ends of the earth

These phrases represent the people who live in those places. Alternate translation: "People who live on the isles ... people who live at the ends of the earth" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# The isles

You can translate "isles" the same way you translated "coastlands" in [Isaiah 41:1](../41/01.md).

# the ends of the earth

The places on the earth that are very far away are spoken of as if they were the places where the earth ends. AT "the farthest places of the earth" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# they approach and come

This doublet means that the people gather together. Alternate translation: "they come together" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
