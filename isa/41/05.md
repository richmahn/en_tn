Yahweh continues speaking.

## The isles ##

You can translate "isles" the same way you did "coastlands" in [Isaiah 41:1](./01.md).

## anvil ##

an iron block on which a person shapes metal with a hammer

## They fasten it with nails so it will not topple over. ##

Here "it" refers to the idol which they are repairing because they think it will protect them from Yahweh.
