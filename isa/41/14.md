Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.

## Jacob you worm, and you men of Israel ##

Here "Jacob" and "men of Israel" mean the same thing. AT: “you descendants of Jacob who are small and weak” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## declaration of Yahweh ##

See how you translated this in [Isaiah 14:21](../14/21.md).

## Holy One of Israel ##

See how you translated this in [Isaiah 1:4](../01/04.md).

## Look, I am making you like a sharp threshing sledge, new and two-edged you will thresh the mountains and crush them; you will make the hills like chaff ##

edged you will thresh the mountains and crush them; you will make the hills like chaff** - A threshing sledge was a board with sharp spikes that someone would drag over the wheat to separate the grain from the chaff. This means God will make the people strong enough to defeat their enemies. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## you will thresh the mountains and crush them ##

Yahweh compares the power he will give Israel to a sledge that will tear down mountains. AT: "you will be so strong you will defeat powerful nations." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

## the mountains ##

Yahweh compares the powerful nations to mountains. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
