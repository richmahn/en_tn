Isaiah continues to describe the Messiah.

## He will strike the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips he will slay the wicked ##

AT: "He will speak and judge against the wicked like he is using a weapon to kill his enemies." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
