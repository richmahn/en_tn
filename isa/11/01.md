# A shoot will sprout from the stump of Jesse ... a branch out of his roots will bear fruit

Isaiah speaks of Jesse and his descendants as if they were a tree that had been cut down. Both of these phrases tell about a descendant of Jesse who would be king. AT: "As a shoot sprouts out of a tree stump, so a descendant of Jesse will become king over what remains of Israel" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the stump of Jesse

A stump is what remains of a tree after it is chopped down. The "stump of Jesse" represents what was left of the kingdom that Jesse's son David was once king of. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
