# A shoot will sprout from the stump of Jesse ... a branch out of his roots will bear fruit

Isaiah speaks of Jesse and his descendants as if they were a tree that had been cut down. Both of these phrases tell about a descendant of Jesse who would be king. AT: "As a shoot sprouts out of a tree stump, so a descendant of Jesse will become king over what remains of Israel" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the stump of Jesse

A stump is what remains of a tree after it is chopped down. The "stump of Jesse" represents what was left of the kingdom that Jesse's son David was once king of. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# The Spirit of Yahweh will rest upon him

Resting upon him represents being with him and helping him. The word "him" refers to the one who would become king. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the Spirit of wisdom ... the Spirit of instruction ... the Spirit of knowledge ... the fear of Yahweh

Here the word "Spirit" refers to an ability or quality that the Spirit of Yahweh would give him. AT: "and he will cause him to have wisdom and understanding, instruction and might, knowledge and the fear of Yahweh" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
