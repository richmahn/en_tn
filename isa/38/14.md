## translationNotes

* Hezekiah continues his written prayer.
* **Like a swallow I chirp; I coo like a dove** - Both of these clauses mean the same thing and they emphasize how said and pitiful Hezekiah's cries were. A swallow and a dove are types of birds. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]] and [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
* **I am oppressed** - AT: "My sickness is troubling me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
* **What shall I say?** - Hezekiah uses a question to emphasize he has nothing left to say. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **because my soul is overcome with grief** - AT: "because I am full of grief" or "because I am very sad" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
