Hezekiah continues his written prayer.

## Like a swallow I chirp; I coo like a dove ##

Both of these clauses mean the same thing and they emphasize how said and pitiful Hezekiah's cries were. A swallow and a dove are types of birds. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

## I am oppressed ##

AT: "My sickness is troubling me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## What shall I say? ##

Hezekiah uses a question to emphasize he has nothing left to say. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## because my soul is overcome with grief ##

AT: "because I am full of grief" or "because I am very sad" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
