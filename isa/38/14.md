# General Information:

Hezekiah continues his written prayer.

# Like a swallow I chirp; I coo like a dove

Both of these clauses mean the same thing and they emphasize how sad and pitiful Hezekiah's cries were. A swallow and a dove are types of birds. Alternate translation: "My cries are pitiful--they sound like the chirp of a swallow and the coo of a dove" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# my eyes

Here Hezekiah refers to himself my his "eyes" to emphasize that he is looking for something. Alternate translation: "I" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# with looking upward

This refers to Hezekiah looking to heaven for God to help him. The full meaning of this statement can be made clear. Alternate translation: "of waiting for help to come from heaven" or "of waiting for you to help me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# I am oppressed

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "My sickness oppresses me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
