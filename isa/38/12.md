Hezekiah continues his written prayer.

## My life is removed and carried away from me ##

AT: "Yahweh has taken my life and carried it away from me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## like a shepherdâ€™s tent ##

This emphasizes that God has taken his life quickly and easily like someone removing a tent. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

## I have rolled up my life like a weaver; you are cutting me off from the loom ##

Hezekiah compares his life quickly coming to an end to a weaver who cuts the threads from the loom and rolls up the cloth.

## you are cutting ##

Here "you" is singular and refers to God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

## loom ##

a device used to weave thread together to make cloth.

## Like a lion he breaks all my bones ##

This emphasizes that Hezekiah was in extreme pain because God was taking his life away.
