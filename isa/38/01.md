# Set your house in order

This means to prepare your family and those in charge of your affairs so that they know what to do after you die. This can be written clearly. Alternate translation: "You should tell the people in your palace what you want them to do after you die" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
