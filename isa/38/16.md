Hezekiah continues his written prayer.

## may my life be given back to me ##

AT: "may you give my life back to me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## from the pit of destruction ##

"from dying" (UDB) or "from Sheol"

## for you have thrown all my sins behind your back ##

This emphasizes that God has removed Hezekiah's sins and he no longer looks at them or remembers them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
