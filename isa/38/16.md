## translationNotes

* Hezekiah continues his written prayer.
* **may my life be given back to me** - AT: "may you give my life back to me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
* **from the pit of destruction** - "from dying" (UDB) or "from Sheol"
* **for you have thrown all my sins behind your back** - This emphasizes that God has removed Hezekiah's sins and he no longer looks at them or remembers them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
