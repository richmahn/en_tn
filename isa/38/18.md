## translationNotes

* Hezekiah continues his written prayer.
* **For Sheol does not thank you; death does not praise you** - Here "Sheol" and "death" refer to "dead people."  (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
* **Those who go down into the pit** - "Those who go to Sheol" or "Those who go down to the grave"
* **do not hope in your trustworthiness** - "do not have hope in your faithfulness." Here "your" is singular and refers to Yahweh. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
* **The living person, the living person** - This is repeated for emphasis. ([[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
