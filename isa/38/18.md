Hezekiah continues his written prayer.

## For Sheol does not thank you; death does not praise you ##

Here "Sheol" and "death" refer to "dead people."  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## Those who go down into the pit ##

"Those who go to Sheol" or "Those who go down to the grave"

## do not hope in your trustworthiness ##

"do not have hope in your faithfulness." Here "your" is singular and refers to Yahweh. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

## The living person, the living person ##

This is repeated for emphasis. ([[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
