# General Information:

Hezekiah continues his written prayer.

# For Sheol does not thank you; death does not praise you

Here "Sheol" and "death" refer to "dead people." AT: "For those in Sheol do not thank you; dead people do not praise you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# those who go down into the pit

"those who go down to the grave"

# do not hope in your trustworthiness

"do not have hope in your faithfulness." Here "your" is singular and refers to Yahweh. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# The living person, the living person

Hezekiah repeats this phrase to emphasize that only a living person, not a dead person, can give thanks to Yahweh. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
