Isaiah continues to speak God's message to Shebna.

## He will surely wind you round and round, and toss you like a ball into a vast country ##

This compares the enemy army taking Shebna as captive to a foreign land to God throwing him like a ball. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## You will be pulled down ##

AT: “I will bring you down from your honored position” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
