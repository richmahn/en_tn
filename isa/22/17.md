# General Information:

Isaiah continues to speak God's message to Shebna.

# He will surely wind you round and round, and toss you like a ball into a vast country

The enemy soldiers coming and taking Shebna as a captive to a foreign land is spoken of as if Yahweh were throwing him like a ball into another land. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# you will be the shame of your master's house

Here "house" represents the people who work in the king's palace. AT: "you will cause shame for all those in your master's palace" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# I will thrust you from your office and from your station. You will be pulled down

Yahweh causing Shebna to no longer work in the king's palace is spoken of as if Yahweh will throw him to the ground. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# You will be pulled down

This can be stated in active form. AT: "I will bring you down from your honored position" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
