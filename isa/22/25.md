# General Information:

This continues the imagery from the previous verses. (See: [Isaiah 22:23-24](./23.md))

# the peg driven in a firm place ... will be cut off

Yahweh causing Shebna to lose his authority in the king's palace is spoken of as if Shebna were a peg in the wall that breaks off and falls to the ground. This emphasizes that Shebna thought his authority was secure but God will remove him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the weight that was on it will be cut off

Here "weight" represents Shebna's power and authority. It is spoken of as if it were an object hanging on the peg that represents Shebna. Yahweh causing Shebna to lose his power and authority is spoken of as if someone were to cut off the object that was hanging on the peg. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
