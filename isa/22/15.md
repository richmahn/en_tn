## Yahweh of Hosts ##

See how you translated this in [Isaiah 1:9](../01/09.md).

## Shebna ##

This is the name of the manager of the king's palace in Jerusalem. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

## What do you have here, and who are you, that you have hewn out a grave ##

Yahweh uses this question to scold Shebna. AT: "You have no right to make for yourself a grave here!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
