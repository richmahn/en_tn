Isaiah continues to speak God's message to Shebna.

## Eliakim ... Hilkiah ##

These are names of men. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

## sash ##

See how you translated this in [Isaiah 3:18](../03/18.md).

## into his hand ##

AT: "to him"

## He will be a father ##

This emphasizes that Eliakim will care for and protect the people of Judah. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## I will place the key of the house of David on his shoulder ##

Here "key" refers to authority. AT: "I will put him in charge of the king's palace" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
