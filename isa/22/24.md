# They will hang on him all the glory of his father's house

Yahweh causing Eliakim's whole family to be honored because of Eliakim is spoken of as if Eliakim were a peg in the wall and his family were something that hangs on the peg. Alternate translation: "They will give honor to his whole family because of him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# every small container from the cups to all the jugs

This continues to speak of Eliakim as a peg. His offspring will be like cups that hang on the peg. This means his descendants will be honored because of him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the cups to all the jugs

A cup is a small container that holds water. A jug is a larger container that holds water.
