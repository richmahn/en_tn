# General Information:

Yahweh continues to describe Eliakim, who will replace Shebna in the king's palace.

# I will fasten him, a peg in a secure place

Yahweh causing Eliakim's authority to be strong and secure in the king's palace is spoken of as if Eliakim were a peg and Yahweh will set him firmly in the palace wall. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# he will become a seat of glory for his father's house

Here "seat of glory" represents a place of honor. Alternate translation: "Eliakim will bring honor to his family" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# his father's house

Here "house" represents family. Alternate translation: "his father's family" or "his family" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
