Isaiah continues to describe a time in the future when an army will attack the people of Jerusalem. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture]])

# You counted the houses

Here "counted" means they inspected the houses to find material to help them rebuild the city wall.

# You made a reservoir

"You made a storage place"

# between the two walls

It is unclear what two walls Isaiah meant. The main point is that they built the reservoir within the city walls.

# the city's maker

This refers to Yahweh.
