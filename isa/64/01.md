# General Information:

The people of Israel continue speaking to Yahweh. (See: [Isaiah 63:11](../63/11.md))

# Oh, if you had

Isaiah introduces this desire for Yahweh's presence in their past history with a strong exclamation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])

# if you had split open the heavens

If Yahweh had shown himself very dramatically by tearing open the sky. The words "split open" refer to ripping a piece of cloth apart. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# mountains would have shaken

The mountains would have trembled as in an earthquake. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])

# as when fire kindles the brushwood, or the fire makes water boil

This possibly emphasizes how easily God's presence would have caused the mountains and the people to tremble. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
