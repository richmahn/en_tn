The people of Israel continue speaking to Yahweh.

## and all our righteous deeds are like a menstrual rag ##

A "menstrual rag" is a cloth that a woman uses during the time of month when she bleeds from her womb. This means all their attempts to please God fail. This sentence was meant to be shocking. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

## We have all withered like leaves; and our iniquities, like the wind, carry us away ##

This means their sins, as a community, are the reason for their failure.

## you have hidden your face from us ##

This means God gave up on his people and let them suffer. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
