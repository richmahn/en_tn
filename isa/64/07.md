# you have hidden your face from us

This means God gave up on his people and let them suffer. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])


# in the hand of our iniquities

Here the word "hand" is a metonym for the power of those who are punishing the people for their iniquities. Alternate translation: "as you punish us for our iniquities" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
