# Isaiah 07 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetry in 7:7-9, 18-25.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### "Young woman" #####
Some translations choose to translate this as "virgin" and believe it is a reference to the Messiah being born of a virgin woman. This is only one possible translation, therefore most translations have avoided forcing this specific connotation into the meaning of the term. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/christ]]) 

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### Israel #####
In this chapter, Israel is a reference to the northern kingdom of Israel and not the nation as a whole. They are also called Ephraim in this chapter after its most prominent tribe.
