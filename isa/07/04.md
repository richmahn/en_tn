# Tell him

"Tell Ahaz"

# do not be afraid or intimidated by these two smoldering firebrands, by the fierce anger of Rezin and Aram, and of Pekah son of Remaliah

God compares Rezin and Pekah to burning sticks whose fire has gone out and are making smoke now. God is emphasizing that they are not real threats to Judah. This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "do not let Rezin and Pekah make you afraid; their fierce anger is like a burning stick whose fire has gone out and there is only smoke" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# afraid or intimidated

The words "afraid" and "intimidated" mean the same thing and can be translated as one word. Alternate translation: "afraid" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
