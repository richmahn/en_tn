# house of David

The word "house" is a metonym for the family living in the house. See how you translated this in [Isaiah 7:2](./02.md). Alternate translation: "King Ahaz, you and your counselors" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# Is it not enough for you people to test the patience of people? Must you also test the patience of my God?

These questions emphasize that the king has sinned greatly. Alternate translation: "You test the patience of people! Now you even test the patience of my God!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
