* **at the end of the conduit of the upper pool** - AT: "where the water enters the upper pool."
* **on the road to the Launderer's field** - AT: "near the place where the women wash and dry clothes."
* **Tell him** - "Tell Ahaz"
* **do not be afraid or intimidated by these two smoldering firebrands, the fierce anger of Rezin and Aram, and of Pekah, the son of Remaliah.** - God compares Rezin and Pekah to burning sticks whose fire has gone out and are making smoke now. God is emphasizing that they are not real threats to Judah. AT: "do not let Rezin and Pekah scare you. Because their fierce anger is like a burning stick whose fire has gone out and there is only smoke. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
