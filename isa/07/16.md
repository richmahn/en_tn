# General Information:

Isaiah continues to describe the sign that God will give the house of David.

# refuse the evil and choose the good

Here "the evil" and "the good" refer to evil and good things in general. See how you translated this in [Isaiah 7:15](./15.md). Alternate translation: "refuse to do evil deeds and choose to do good deeds" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])

# you dread

"you fear." Here "you" is singular and refers to Ahaz. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
