AT: "the king of Damascus is Rezin, who is only a man" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# sixty-five years

"65 years" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])

# Ephraim will be shattered and will no longer be a people

Here "Ephraim" refers to all of the northern kingdom of Israel. This can be stated in active form. AT: "an army will destroy Ephraim, and there will no longer be a people of Israel" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
