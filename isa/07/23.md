Isaiah continues to describe the time the army from Assyria will attack the land of Israel.

## there were a thousand vines ##

"there were 1000 vineyards" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])

## because all the land will be briers and thorns ##

Why the hunters come to these lands can be made explicit: "because there will be nothing in these lands but briers, thorns, and wild animals." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

## They will stay away from all the hills that were cultivated with the hoe ##

AT: "People will stay away from the hills where they once prepared the soil to plant crops." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
