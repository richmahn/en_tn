# Instead of the thornbushes, the cypress will grow; and instead of the brier, the myrtle tree will grow

The words "thornbushes" and "brier" refer to species of plants that have sharp thorns growing on them. The words "cypress" and "myrtle" refer to species of evergreen trees. The thorny plants symbolize desolation, while the evergreens symbolize life and prosperity. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

# for his name

Here the word "name" represents Yahweh's fame. AT: "for his fame" or "for his honor" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# that will not be cut off

Something ceasing to exist is spoken of as if it were cut off, as a branch is cut off of a tree or a piece of fabric is cut off of clothing. This can be stated in active form. AT: "that will never end" or "that will last forever" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
