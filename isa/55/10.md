# General Information:

Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Jerusalem.

# For as the rain and snow ... do not return there

This is likely a description of the rain and snow evaporating.

# so also my word ... it will achieve the purpose for which I sent it

Yahweh speaks of his word as if it were a person whom he sends out as his messenger to accomplish a task. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# my word will be that goes from my mouth

Here the word "mouth" represents Yahweh himself. AT: "the word that I speak" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# it will not return to me empty

Here the description of the word returning to Yahweh means that it has completed the task that Yahweh had sent it to complete. That it will not return "empty" means that it will not fail to accomplish its task. AT: "it will not fail to complete its task" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
