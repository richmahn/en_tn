Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.

## For as the rainâ€¦for which I sent it ##

This means God will certainly accomplish all that he has promised and planned. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

## so also my word will be that goes from my mouth ##

AT: "so also will be the word that I speak" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## my word ##

This refers to God's promises, plan and purpose.

## it will not return to me uselessly ##

Here Yahweh describes his word as active and creative, which will accomplish his plans. AT: "my plan will not fail"

## but it will accomplish that which I wish, and it will succeed in that for which I sent it ##

AT: "but I will accomplish what I wish, and I will fulfill the purpose of my plan"
