## translationNotes

* Yahweh continue speaking to the people of Jerusalem.
* **Why do you weigh out silver for what is not bread? And labor for what does not satisfy?** - Yahweh uses questions to emphasize that he is frustrated because the people are seeking things that have no value. AT: "Do not spend your money on food that is not beneficial. Do not work for things that will not satisfy you." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **eat what is good, and delight your lives in fatness** - This means if the people will obey Yahweh he will bless them and give them what can truly satisfy them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **in fatness** - "in an abundance of the best food"
