Yahweh continue speaking to the people of Jerusalem.

## Why do you weigh out silver for what is not bread? And labor for what does not satisfy? ##

Yahweh uses questions to emphasize that he is frustrated because the people are seeking things that have no value. AT: "Do not spend your money on food that is not beneficial. Do not work for things that will not satisfy you." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## eat what is good, and delight your lives in fatness ##

This means if the people will obey Yahweh he will bless them and give them what can truly satisfy them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## in fatness ##

"in an abundance of the best food"
