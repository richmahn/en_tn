# the sheep will feed as in their own pasture

Yahweh will destroy the city of Jerusalem, which was called a "vineyard" in [Isaiah 5:1](./01.md). It will become good for nothing except for sheep to eat grass there.

# graze

eat grass

# in the ruins, lambs will graze as foreigners

That is, the lambs will graze there. The land will be worthless for any other use. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
