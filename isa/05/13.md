## translationNotes

* **my people have gone into captivity** - In prophecy things that will happen in the future are described as something in the past. This emphasizes that the prophecy will certainly come true. Alternate translation: "enemies from other countries will take my people, Israel, as slaves."

* **their masses** - "their common people"
* **death has made its appetite greater and has opened its mouth very wide** - This phrase compares death to an animal that is ready to eat other animals. It emphasizes that many, many people will die. Alternate translation: "Death is like a hungry animal that has opened its mouth wide to eat up many people." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **their elite, the people, their leaders, and the revelers and jubilant among them, descend into Sheol.** - "Many people of Israel, their important people and common people, their leaders and those who enjoy wild parties, will go into Sheol."
