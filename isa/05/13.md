# General Information:

These verses tell what will happen to the people because they have disobeyed God.

# my people have gone into captivity

In prophecy things that will happen in the future are often referred to as if they had already happened. This emphasizes that the prophecy will certainly come true. AT: "enemies from other countries will take my people, Israel, as slaves" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture]])

# for lack of understanding

What they do not understand can be made explicit. AT: "because they do not understand Yahweh or his law" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# Sheol has made its appetite greater and has opened its mouth very wide

This phrase speaks of Sheol, which stands here for the grave, to an animal that is ready to eat other animals. It implies that many, many people will die. AT: "death is like a hungry animal that has opened its mouth wide to eat up many people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# their elite, the people, their leaders, and the revelers and those who are happy among them, descend into Sheol

The prophet speaks of the future as if it were happening now. AT: "Many people of Israel, their important people and common people, their leaders and those who enjoy wild parties, will go into Sheol" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture]])
