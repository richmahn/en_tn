# General Information:

These verses tell what will happen to the people because they have disobeyed God.

# my people have gone into captivity

In prophecy things that will happen in the future are often referred to as if they had already happened. This emphasizes that the prophecy will certainly come true. Alternate translation: "enemies from other countries will take my people, Israel, as slaves" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture]])

# for lack of understanding

What they do not understand can be made explicit. Alternate translation: "because they do not understand Yahweh or his law" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
