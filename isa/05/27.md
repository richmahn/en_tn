# General Information:

Isaiah continues to describe the army that will attack Judah. He describes it as if it were already existing. (See: [Isaiah 5:26](../05/26.md))

# tire ... stumble ... slumbers ... sleeps

These four words progress from being tired from work to being unable to walk well, to being unable to stay awake, to full sleep, so all four should appear in the translation.

# Nor are their belts loose

The soldiers kept their clothes tight so it would easier to move and fight.

# the thongs of their sandals

"the straps of their sandals"
