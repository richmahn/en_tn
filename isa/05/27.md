Isaiah continues to describe the army that will attack Judah. (See: [Isaiah 5:26](./26.md))

## None tire or stumble among them ##

"None of their soldiers get tired or fall"

## nor will their belt be loose ##

The soldiers kept their robes tight so it would easier to move and fight.

## the thong of their sandals ##

"the strap of their sandals"

## their horses' hooves are like flint ##

Isaiah compares the hard part of a horse's foot to a hard stone which can cause a spark when struck. Alternate translation: "their horses' hooves are hard as stone." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

## and their chariot wheels like storms ##

Isaiah compares the chariot wheels to a storm to emphasize how quickly they are moving. Alternate translation: "and the wheels of the chariots will spin like a windstorm."
