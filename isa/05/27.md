## translationNotes

* Isaiah continues to describe the army that will attack Judah. (See: [[en:bible:notes:isa:05:26]])
* **None tire or stumble among them** - "None of their soldiers get tired or fall"
* **nor will their belt be loose** - The soldiers kept their robes tight so it would easier to move and fight.
* **the thong of their sandals** - "the strap of their sandals"
* **their horses' hooves are like flint** - Isaiah compares the hard part of a horse's foot to a hard stone which can cause a spark when struck. Alternate translation: "their horses' hooves are hard as stone." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
