This continues the parable about the vineyard that Isaiah began in [Isaiah 5:1](./01.md). The one who planted the vineyard is speaking.

## O inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Judah ##

"You who live in Jerusalem and Judah"

## judge between me and my vineyard ##

"decide between me and my vineyard who is right"

## What more could have been done for my vineyard, that I have not done for it ##

Yahweh uses this question to scold the people of Jerusalem and Judah. Alternate translation: “I have done all that I could do for my vineyard.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## When I looked for it to bring forth good grapes, why did it produce wild grapes ##

Yahweh uses a question to scold the people of Jerusalem and Judah. Alternate translation: “I wanted it to make good grapes, but it only produced worthless grapes.”
