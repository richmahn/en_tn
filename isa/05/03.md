# inhabitant of Jerusalem and man of Judah

These expressions refer in general to all people living in Jerusalem and Judah, so they can be translated with plural nouns. AT: "all of you who live in Jerusalem and Judah" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])

# Jerusalem ... Judah

"Judah" was the name of the southern kingdom of Israelites, and Jerusalem was the capital city.

# judge between me and my vineyard

The idea of a space separating two things is often used to express the idea of choosing one or the other of those things. AT: "decide who has acted right, I or my vineyard" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
