Those who do these things are the same as those "who call evil good, and good evil." These things are opposites and people know the difference between them, but some people lie and say that bad things are good. AT: "They are like people who call darkness light and light darkness. They are like people who call bitter things sweet and sweet things bitter" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# to those who are wise in their own eyes

Here the metonym "eyes" refers to their thoughts. AT: "to those who consider themselves to be wise" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
