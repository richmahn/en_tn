## translationNotes

* **tongue of fire** - "flame of fire" or "flame"
* **as the tongue of fire devours stubble, and as the dry grass goes down in flame** - These phrases mean basically the same thing. God will punish the people described in 5:18-23 as  a fire that completely and easily burns up dead grass.  Alternate translation: "as a fire burns up stubble and grass" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
* **stubble** - "dry grain stalks." This refers to the part of the plant that is left in the garden to die after the farmer collects the food.
* **their root will rot, and their blossom will blow away like dust** - Isaiah compares those people to a dying plant. Alternate translation: "they will die like a plant whose roots have rotted and whose blossom has dried up and blown away in the wind" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
