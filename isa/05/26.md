## He will lift up a signal flag for a far away nation and will whistle for them from the end of the earth ##

Isaiah says the same thing in two different ways to emphasize that God will use another nation to punish his people. Alternate translation: "He will call for the army of a nation that is far away from Judah and tell them to come." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## They will come ##

"The enemy army will come"

## speedily and promptly ##

These words mean basically the same thing and are used for emphasis. Alternate translation: "very quickly." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
