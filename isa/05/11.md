# those who rise up early in the morning ... who linger late into the night

This refers to people who do nothing all day but drink alcoholic drinks. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])

# until wine inflames them

Here the power of wine to make its drinkers drunk is spoken of as if it were inflaming them, that is, setting them on fire. Alternate translation: "until they are drunk with wine" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
