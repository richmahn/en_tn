# General Information:

Isaiah continues to describe the army that will attack Judah. (See: [Isaiah 05:26](../05/26.md))

# young lions

A young age is a metonym for strength. Alternate translation: "the strongest lions" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# They will growl and seize the prey

Isaiah compares the enemy killing the people of Judah to a lion killing a weaker animal. Possible meanings are 1) lions make a sound not as loud as a roar just before they strike, or 2) the writer is using two words to mean the same thing. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# prey

animals that another animal wants to catch and kill

# with none to rescue

"and no one will be able to save them"
