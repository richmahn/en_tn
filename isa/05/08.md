# to those who join house to house, who join field to field

"to those who take more and more houses, and who take more and more fields." Isaiah assumes that his audience knows that the law forbids someone from taking land from a family permanently. The full meaning of this statement can be made clear. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# a ten-yoke vineyard

The size of the vineyard is represented by the number of pairs of oxen that could plow it in one day. Each pair of oxen would be connected by a yoke. AT: "a vineyard that is large enough for ten pairs of oxen to plow it" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
