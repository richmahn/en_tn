Isaiah announces God's judgment.

## to those who join house to house, who join field to field ##

"to those who take more and more houses, and who take more and more fields"

## Yahweh of Hosts ##

See how you translated this in [Isaiah 1:9](../01/09.md).

## without inhabitant ##

"without anyone living in it"

## four hectares ##

This is the amount of land that ten teams of oxen could plow in one day. (Each team would have two oxen.)

## one bath ##

"one bath of wine" or  "22 liters of wine" (UDB). (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/biblicalvolume]])

## one homer of seed will yield only an ephah ##

"220 liters of seed will produce only 22 liters of grain." One homer equals ten ephahs. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/biblicalvolume]])
