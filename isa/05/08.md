# General Information:

Isaiah announces God's judgment.

# to those who join house to house, who join field to field

"to those who take more and more houses, and who take more and more fields." Isaiah assumes that his audience knows that the law forbids someone from taking land from a family permanently. The full meaning of this statement can be made clear. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
