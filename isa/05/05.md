Yahweh continues the parable about the vineyard.

## remove the hedge ##

A hedge refers to bushes or small trees planted around the vineyard to protect it. Here it may refer to the thorns that grew on the stone wall. Alternate translation: “take away the border.”

## a pasture ##

This is a grassy place where animals are kept. Alternate translation: "I will allow animals to go there and eat."

## and it will be trampled on ##

This can be translated with an active verb: "and animals will trample on it." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## I will lay it waste ##

“I will make the ground useless"

## it will not be pruned nor hoed ##

This can be translated with active verbs: "No one will prune it or hoe it" or "no one will cut off the branches that are not needed and no one will take care of the soil."
