# General Information:

In Isaiah's parable, the owner of the vineyard continues to talk about his vineyard. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])

# remove the hedge

"take away the border of bushes." A hedge is a row of bushes or small trees that have been planted in order to protect a garden or some other kind of area. Here "hedge" probably refers to the thorn bushes that were planted to grow on the stone wall surrounding the vineyard.

# I will turn it into a pasture

"I will allow animals to go there and eat." This is a grassy place where animals feed.

# it will be trampled down

This can be stated in active form. AT: "animals will trample it down" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
