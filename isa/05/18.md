# Woe to those who pull along iniquity with useless cords and who pull along sin as if it were with a cart rope

These phrases mean basically the same thing. They speak of people who continue to sin on purpose as if they were using all their strength to pull a heavy cart along. God will punish them for their sin. AT: "Woe to those who work hard to sin as a person who drags a cart by a rope" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
