## translationNotes

* **to those who pull along iniquity with cords of emptiness and who pull along sin with a cart rope** - These phrases mean basically the same thing. They compare people who continue to sin on purpose to a person who uses all his strength to keep pull a heavy cart along. The word "emptiness" means it is all in vain. God will judge them and they will not benefit from their sin. Alternate translation: "to those who work hard to sin like a person who drags a cart by a rope." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]] and [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **those who say** - This refers to those who continue to sin and then challenge God to stop them. Alternate translation: "those who challenge God and say"
* **let the plans of the Holy One of Israel take shape and come** - "let the Holy One of Israel accomplish his plans"
* **the Holy One of Israel** - See how you translated "the Holy One" in [[en:bible:notes:isa:05:15]].
