# Woe to those who pull along iniquity with useless cords and who pull along sin as if it were with a cart rope

These phrases mean basically the same thing. They speak of people who continue to sin on purpose as if they were using all their strength to pull a heavy cart along. God will punish them for their sin. AT: "Woe to those who work hard to sin as a person who drags a cart by a rope" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# those who say

This refers to those who continue to sin (verse 18) and then mockingly challenge God to stop them. AT: "those mockers who say" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])

# let the plans of the Holy One of Israel come

God's plans are spoken of as if they were objects that could come by themselves. AT: "let the Holy One of Israel accomplish his plans" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the Holy One of Israel

Translate "the Holy One" as in [Isaiah 5:16](./15.md).
