# harp, lute, tambourine, flute, and wine

These musical instruments and the wine imply that the people enjoying these things are celebrating very much.

# tambourine

A musical instrument with a head like a drum that can be beaten with the hand. It probably had pieces of metal around the side that sounded when the player shook it. The tambourine was small enough for the player to hold it and shake it with one hand. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

# considered

thought seriously about

# the doings of his hands

This can be reworded so that the abstract noun "doings" is expressed as the verb "done" or "created." Alternate translation: "what he has done" or "what he has created" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# the doings of his hands

Here the metonym "hands" represents the person who has done something. Alternate translation: "what Yahweh has done" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
