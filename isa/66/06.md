## A sound of battle tumult comes from the city, a sound from the temple ##

AT: "a loud uproar like the noise of a battle comes from the city and from the temple" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## the sound of Yahweh paying back his enemies ##

This refers to the sound of Yahweh punishing those who contaminated their worship with Canaanite practices.
