# For you will nurse and be satisfied; with her breasts you will be comforted

This means Jerusalem will be a place of safety and comfort for God's people. This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "For she will satisfy you with her milk; she will comfort you with her breasts" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
