# General Information:

Yahweh continues speaking about Jerusalem as if it were a mother ([Isaiah 66:7-8](./07.md)).

# like a river ... like an overflowing stream

This means God will cause the people of the nations to bring a very large amount of riches, which will be permanent like a river and abundant. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# You will nurse at her side, be carried in her arms, and be dandled on her knees

This means Jerusalem will be a place of safety and comfort for God's people. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# be carried in her arms, and be dandled on her knees

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "she will carry you in her arms and bounce you on her knees with delight" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
