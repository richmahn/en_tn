Yahweh continues speaking about Jerusalem as if it were a mother. (See: [Isaiah 66:7](./07.md))

## like a riverâ€¦like an overflowing stream ##

This means God will cause the people of the nations to bring a very large amount of riches, which will be permanent like a river and abundant. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

## You will nurse at her side, be carried in her arms, and be dandled on her knees ##

This means Jerusalem will be a place of safety and comfort for God's people. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## be carried in her arms, and be dandled on her knees ##

AT: "she will carry you in her arms and bounce you on her knees with delight" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## so I will comfort you, and you will be comforted in Jerusalem ##

AT: "so I will comfort you in Jerusalem"
