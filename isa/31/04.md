Yahweh speaks to Isaiah.

## As a young lion… that hill ##

Yahweh will defend those people who belong to him, and no one can scare him away. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

## thus Yahweh of hosts will descend…that hill ##

It may be more clear if you move the last line to before the first line: “Yahweh of hosts will descend to fight on Mount Zion, on that hill, as a lion, even a young lion…”

## lion, even a young lion ##

"female lion or killer lion." You may need to translate as one word, "lion."

## growls ##

warns others to stay away

## when a group of shepherds is called out against it ##

AT: "when someone sends shepherds to stop the lion" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
