# General Information:

Yahweh continues speaking.

# Like birds in flight, so Yahweh of hosts will protect Jerusalem

Here the way that Yahweh protects Jerusalem is compared to the way that a mother bird protects her baby birds in their nest. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# he will protect and rescue as he passes over it and preserves it

This speaks of how Yahweh protects and rescues Jerusalem, describing him as a bird that flies over the city. Alternate translation: "he will protect and rescue the city from it's enemies" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Yahweh of hosts

See how you translated this phrase in [Isaiah 1:9](../01/09.md).

# Jerusalem

This refers to the people who live there. Alternate translation: "the people of Jerusalem" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
