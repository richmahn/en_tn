# General Information:

Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Judah, referring to the Assyrians as though they are one person.

# Assyria will fall by the sword; a sword not wielded by man will consume him

"Sword" refers to military might. This can be stated in active form. AT: "God's sword, and not a man's sword, will destroy the Assyrian army" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# He will flee

"The Assyrians will flee"

# They will lose all confidence because of terror

The word "confidence" can be expressed with the adjective "confident." The word "terror" can be expressed with the adjective "terrified." AT: "They will no longer be confident because they are so terrified" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# his young men will be forced to do hard labor

This can be stated in active form. AT: "enemies will capture their young men and force them to do hard labor" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# his princes

"their leaders"

# at the sight of Yahweh's battle flag

The word "sight" can be expressed with the verb "see." AT: "when they see the flag of Yahweh's army" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# this is Yahweh's declaration

Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. Translate as in [Isaiah 30:1](../30/01.md). AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# whose fire is in Zion and whose firepot is in Jerusalem

Both of these clauses mean the same thing and are used together for emphasis. Here God's presence and his power to judge and destroy are spoken of as if they were a fire. AT: "whose powerful presence is in Zion" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
