Yahweh continues speaking to the Israelites, referring to the Assyrians as though they are one person.

## Assyria will fall by the sword, a sword not wielded by man will consume him ##

AT: "God's sword, and not a man's sword, will destroy the Assyrian army." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## he will flee ##

"the Assyrians will flee"

## and his young men will be forced to do hard labor ##

AT: "and enemies will capture their young men and force them to do hard labor" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## and his princes ##

"and their leaders"

## at the Yahweh's battle flag ##

"when they see the flag of Yahweh's army." See how you translated "flag" in [Isaiah 5:26](../05/26.md).

## declaration of Yahweh ##

See how you translated this in [Isaiah 14:21](../14/21.md).

## whose fire is in Zion and whose firepot is in Jerusalem ##

Both of these clauses mean the same thing and are used together for emphasis. Here fire and firepot refer to God's presence and his power to judge and destroy. AT: "whose powerful presence is in Zion." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
