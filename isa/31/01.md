# General Information:

Isaiah continues speaking to the people of Judah.

# go down to Egypt

The phrase "go down" is used here because Egypt is lower in Elevation than Jerusalem.

# those who go down

"those people of Judah who go down"

# lean on horses

This speaks about people relying on their horses to help them as if they were leaning on their horses. Alternate translation: "rely on their horses" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Holy One of Israel

See how you translated this name in [Isaiah 1:4](../01/04.md).

# nor do they seek Yahweh

"nor do they ask Yahweh to help them"
