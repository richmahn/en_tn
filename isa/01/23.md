## Your princes are rebels ##

"Your leaders rebel against God"

## companions of thieves ##

"they are friends with people who steal from others"

## everyone loves bribes and runs after payoffs ##

These are two different ways of saying the same thing to emphasize how wicked the leaders were. Alternate translation: "They all are happy to lie and make bad decisions if someone will pay them enough money." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

## they do not defend the fatherless ##

"they do not protect those who do not have fathers"

## nor does the widow's legal plea come before them ##

"nor do they listen when widows go to them for help" or "and they do not help widows who go to them for help"
