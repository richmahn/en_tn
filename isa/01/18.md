## translationNotes

* God continues to speak to the people of Judah.
* **let us reason together** - "let us think about this together" or "let us discuss this." Here the word "us" refers to God and includes the people of Judah. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive]])
* **though your sins are like scarlet** - "though your sins are bright red."
* **they will be white like snow** - White is often a symbol for holiness or purity. "Snow" refers to something like frozen rain that is very white. Since this simply to describe something as very white, you could replace it with something else that is white: "white as a seashell" or "white as a dove." This means that they will be forgiven. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
* **though they are red like crimson** - "though they are dark red"
* **they will be like wool** - How they will be like wool can be made explicit: "They will be white like wool." Wool is the hair of a sheep or goat. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
