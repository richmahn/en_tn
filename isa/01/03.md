# I have nourished ... does not understand

Words that Yahweh spoke and which Isaiah is speaking to the Israelites for Yahweh.

# the donkey his master's feeding trough

You can make clear the understood information. Alternate translation: "the donkey knows his master's feeding trough" or "the donkey knows where his master gives him food" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# but Israel does not know, Israel does not understand

This probably means "but the people of Israel do not know me, they do not understand that I am the one who cares for them."

# Israel

This is a metonym for the people of Israel. Judah is part of what had been the nation of Israel. Alternate translation: "the people of Israel" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
