# make straight the oppression

God speaks of people who oppress others as if they had made crooked something that should be straight, and he calls on them to make that object straight again. The abstract noun "oppression" can be translated as a verb. AT: "make sure that those helpless people you have harmed no longer suffer from the bad things you have done to them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
