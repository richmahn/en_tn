# Your silver has become impure, your wine mixed with water

Possible meanings are that Isaiah uses silver and wine as metaphors for 1) the people of Jerusalem. Alternate translation: "You are like silver that is no longer pure, and like wine that is mixed with water" or 2) the good deeds that the people formerly did. Alternate translation: "You used to do good deeds, but now your bad deeds make your good deeds worthless" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# silver ... impure

Someone needs to clean silver often or it will no longer shine brightly.

# wine ... water

Wine with water in it has little taste and so is no better than water.
