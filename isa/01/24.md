## translationNotes

* **"Therefore"** - "For that reason"
* **this is the declaration of the Lord** - "declares the Lord"
* **I will take vengeance against my adversaries, and avenge myself against my enemies** - Both of these phrases mean basically the same thing. Alternate translation: "I will punish those who opposed me." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
* **I will turn my hand against you** - Here "hand" refers to God's power which he would use to punish his people.  Alternate translation: "I will turn my power against you." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
* **refine away your dross, and take away all of your impurities** - This is what God would do.  God compared removing the sin from his people to using fire to remove dirt from silver.  Alternate translation: "and like fire removing the filth from silver, I will remove all the evil from among you." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
