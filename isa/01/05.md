## translationNotes

* **Why are you still being struck? Why do you rebel more and more?** - Isaiah uses these questions to scold the people of Judah. These could be translated as statements with active verbs: "You keep doing things that Yahweh has to punish you for. You continue to rebel against him" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:translate:active]])
* **you** - Here the word "you" refers to the people who live in Judah. (See: [[en:ta:translate:formsofyou]])
* **The whole head is sick, the whole heart is weak** - This compares the nation of Israel to a person who has been beaten. Alternate translations: "You are like someone whose head is wounded and whose heart is weak" or "You are like someone whose whole mind and heart are sick." (UDB) (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **they have not been closed, cleansed, bandaged, nor treated with oil** - This can be translated with an active verb: "no one has closed, cleansed, bandaged, or treated them with oil."
