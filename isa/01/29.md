# General Information:

Isaiah speaks Yahweh's words to the people of Judah in the form of a poem. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# the sacred oak trees ... gardens

These phrases refer to places where the people of Judah worshiped idols.

# you will be embarrassed by

Some versions read, "you will blush because of." A person blushes when his face turns hot and red, often because he feels that he has done something wrong.

# For you will be like an oak whose leaf fades, and like a garden that has no water

Water gives life to trees and gardens. The people have cut themselves off from Yahweh, who gives them life. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
