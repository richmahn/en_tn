## translationNotes

* **The vision of Isaiah…that he saw** - Verse 1 can be translated as a sentence by starting it with "This is the vision of Isaiah … that Yahweh showed him" or "This is what God showed Isaiah."
* **Amoz** - Amoz was the father of Isaiah. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
* **Judah and Jerusalem** - "Judah" refers to the southern kingdom of Israel. "Jerusalem" was its most important city. This can be translated as "those living in Judah and Jerusalem" or "the people of Judah and Jerusalem." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
* **in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.** - This can be translated as "when Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah were kings of Judah."
* **Hear, O heavens, and listen, O earth** - Although these prophecies were meant for the people of Jerusalem and Judah to hear, Isaiah told the “heavens” and “earth” to listen to what Yahweh said. By doing this, he emphasized how bad the people were. They were so bad that he was telling the heavens and earth about their sins. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_apostrophe]], [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
* **I have nourished and brought up children** - This is what Yahweh was saying. It can be translated as "I have taken care of the people living in Judah like they were my children." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
