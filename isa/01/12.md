# who has required this of you, to trample my courts?

The word "trample" means to step on and crush with one's feet. God is using a question to scold the people who live in Judah. This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: "no one told you to stomp around in my courtyards!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
