God continues to speak to the people of Judah.

## who has required this of you, to trample my courts? ##

The word "trample" means to step on and crush with one's feet. God is using a question to scold the people who live in Judah. This could be translated as "no one told you to stomp around in my courtyards." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## Bring no more meaningless offerings ##

"Do not bring me anymore of your worthless gifts"

## Incense is an abomination to me ##

"I hate the incense the priests burn"

## I cannot tolerate these wicked assemblies ##

"I cannot endure when you gather together because of the wicked things you do"
