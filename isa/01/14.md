## translationNotes

* God continues to speak to the people of Judah.
* **Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hates** - God refers to himself with the phrase "my soul". This can be translated as "I hate all your new moon celebrations and special feasts." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
* **they are a burden to me; I am tired of enduring them** - This compares how God feels about the people's celebrations to carrying a heavy object. It can be translated as “they are a heavy load that I am tired of carrying.” (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **I hide my eyes from you** - This is a way of saying "I will not look at you" or "I will not pay attention to you." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]]).
* **your hands are full of blood** - This is the reason that God will not listen to their prayers. The blood likely refers to violence that they have done against people. Alternate translations: "because it is like your hands are covered with the blood of those you have harmed" or “because your hands are guilty of violence against the weak” or "because you are guilty of violence." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
