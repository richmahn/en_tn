# General Information:

Isaiah speaks Yahweh's words to the people of Judah in the form of a poem. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# your new moons and your appointed feasts

The words "new moons" are a metonym for the celebrations of the new moon. They are also a synecdoche for all regular celebrations. Alternate translation: "your celebrations of the new moon and your other regular feasts" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# new moons

A new moon is when the moon first shows light after having been dark.

# they are a burden to me; I am tired of enduring them

This compares how God feels about the people's celebrations to carrying a heavy object. Alternate translation: "they are a heavy load that I am tired of carrying" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
