Isaiah speaks Yahweh's words to the people of Judah in the form of a poem. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# your new moons and your appointed feasts

The words "new moons" are a metonym for the celebrations of the new moon. They are also a synecdoche for all regular celebrations. AT: "your celebrations of the new moon and your other regular feasts" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# new moons

A new moon is when the moon first shows light after having been dark.

# they are a burden to me; I am tired of enduring them

This compares how God feels about the people's celebrations to carrying a heavy object. AT: "they are a heavy load that I am tired of carrying" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# I hide my eyes from you

This idiom is a way of saying "I will not look at you" or "I will not pay attention to you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# your hands are full of blood

This is the reason that God will not listen to their prayers. The blood likely refers to violence that they have done against people. AT: "because it is like your hands are covered with the blood of those you have harmed" or "because you are guilty of violence" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
