# for the sea has spoken, the mighty one of the sea ... nor brought up young women

Possible meanings are 1) Yahweh describes the city of Tyre as a mother who speaks about the people who live in the city as her children, or 2) Yahweh is describing the Mediterranean Sea as speaking. The people of Tyre considered the sea their god and father. In either meaning the speaker mourns because its children are destroyed. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
