## for the sea has spoken, the mighty one of the sea ##

Possible meanings are 1) Yahweh describes the city of Tyre as a mother who speaks about the people who live in the city as her children, or 2) Yahweh is describing the Mediterranean sea as speaking. The sea is considered the father of the people who live in the coastal city of Tyre. In either meaning the speaker mourns because its children are destroyed.
