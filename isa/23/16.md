# like in the song of the prostitute ... so that you may be remembered

This speaks about the people of Tyre as if they were a prostitute. Just as a prostitute who is no longer popular may sing in the streets to regain her former lovers, the people of Tyre will try to get people from other nations to return to them to continue trading so that the people of Tyre will be rich and powerful again.

# so that you may be remembered

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "so that people remember you" or "so that people return to you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
