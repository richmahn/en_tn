## translationNotes

* **for seventy years** - "for 70 years" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
* **like in the song of the prostitute** - This compares the people of Tyre to a prostitute. Just as a prostitute who is no longer popular may sing in the streets to regain her former lovers, so Tyre will seek to regain her former position of power and wealth with other nations. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
