# In that day

"At that time" or "Then"

# Tyre will be forgotten for seventy years

Since people will no longer go to Tyre to buy or sell goods, it will be like they have forgotten about the city. This can be stated in active form. AT: "for seventy years it will be like the people have forgotten about Tyre" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# for seventy years

"for 70 years" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])

# like the days of a king

"like the years of a king" or "which is about as long as a king lives"

# like in the song of the prostitute ... so that you may be remembered

This speaks about the people of Tyre as if they were a prostitute. Just as a prostitute who is no longer popular may sing in the streets to regain her former lovers, the people of Tyre will try to get people from other nations to return to them to continue trading so that the people of Tyre will be rich and powerful again.
