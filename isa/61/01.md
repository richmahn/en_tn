# The Spirit of the Lord Yahweh is on me

"Spirit" here is the Holy Spirit of Yahweh who compels or motivates the person. See how you translated this in [Isaiah 11:2](../11/01.md) or in [Isaiah 42:1](../42/01.md).

# the afflicted

This refers to poor people, those in great sorrow, or oppressed people who have problems they cannot overcome by themselves.

# liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison for those who are bound

These two phrases mean the same thing. They state that God will certainly give freedom to captives. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
