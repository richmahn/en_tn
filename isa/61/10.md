# I will greatly rejoice in Yahweh

"I" refers to the people of God speaking as one person whom Yahweh has restored.

# clothed me with the garments of salvation; he has clothed me with the robe of righteousness

The people of God speaking as one person now have salvation and righteousness as their distinct appearance visible to all. "Garments" and "robe" are clothing that everyone can see. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# as a bridegroom adorns himself with a turban, and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels

This comparison emphasizes that the speaker is extremely happy, joyful, celebrating. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# turban

See how you translated this in [Isaiah 61:3](./03.md).

# For as the earth produces its sprouting plants, and as the garden makes its planting grow

This is saying the same thing in two ways. The fact that whatever God says he will do is certainly going to happen is compared to the fact that seeds sprout after planting. AT: "Just as seeds sown in a garden sprout from the soil and grow" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# righteousness and praise to sprout up

This expression describes these virtues as growing from seed like plants do. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
