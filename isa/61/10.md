# I will greatly rejoice in Yahweh

"I" refers to the people of God speaking as one person whom Yahweh has restored.

# clothed me with the garments of salvation; he has clothed me with the robe of righteousness

The people of God speaking as one person now have salvation and righteousness as their distinct appearance visible to all. "Garments" and "robe" are clothing that everyone can see. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# as a bridegroom adorns himself with a turban, and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels

This comparison emphasizes that the speaker is extremely happy, joyful, celebrating. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# turban

See how you translated this in [Isaiah 61:3](./03.md).
