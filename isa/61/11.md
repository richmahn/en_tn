# For as the earth produces its sprouting plants, and as the garden makes its planting grow

This is saying the same thing in two ways. The fact that whatever God says he will do is certainly going to happen is compared to the fact that seeds sprout after planting. Alternate translation: "Just as seeds sown in a garden sprout from the soil and grow" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# righteousness and praise to sprout up

This expression describes these virtues as growing from seed like plants do. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
