# you will have double

This probably refers to a double portion of land.

# they will rejoice over their share ... they will ... their land ... will be theirs

This still refers to the people of Israel. This can be stated in second person. AT: "you will rejoice over your share ... you will ... your land ... will be yours" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
