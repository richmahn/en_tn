Yahweh's servant continues speaking to the people of Israel.

## You will be called ##

AT: "People will call you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

##  you will have double  ##

This probably refers to a double portion of land.

## they will rejoice over their share ##

This still refers to the people of Israel. AT: "you will rejoice over your share"
