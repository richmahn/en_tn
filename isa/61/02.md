# General Information:

Isaiah continues speaking.

# the year of Yahweh's favor, the day of vengeance

Both of these phrases refer to the same span of time. "Year" and "day" are both specific examples that represent the greater whole. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# year of Yahweh's favor

"time when Yahweh will act kindly toward his people"
