* Isaiah continues speaking to the people in exile in Babylonia, describing Yahweh's servant. (See: [[:en:bible:notes:isa:53:01]])
* **He was oppressed** - AT: "They treated him harshly" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
* **he did not open his mouth** - AT: "he did not protest" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
* **as a lamb that is led to the slaughter, and as a sheep that before its shearers is silent** - Isaiah compares the servant to a lamb and a sheep to emphasize that he will remain silent as people harm and humiliate him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
* **as a lamb that is led to the slaughter** - AT: "just as a lamb is silent as a person slaughters it"
