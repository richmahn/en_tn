* **We all like sheep have gone astray** - Sheep often leave the path on which the shepherd leads them. Isaiah means that every person has done what God commands not to do. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
* **the iniquity of us all** - Our "iniquity" here represents the punishment for our sin. AT: "the punishment for the sin of every one of us." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
