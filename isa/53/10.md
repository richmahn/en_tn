# General Information:

Isaiah continues describing Yahweh's servant ([Isaiah 53:1-2](./01.md)).

# he will see his offspring

Here, "offspring" means those people that Yahweh has forgiven because of the servant's sacrifice. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# he will prolong his days

This speaks of making him live for more time. Alternate translation: "Yahweh will make his servant live again" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# Yahweh's purpose will be accomplished through him

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "Yahweh will accomplish his purpose through his servant" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
