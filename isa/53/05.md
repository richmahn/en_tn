# The punishment for our peace was on him

This refers to peace with God. This can be made explicit. Alternate translation: "He accepted this punishment so we could live in harmony" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# with his wounds we are healed

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "he healed us by his suffering of the wounds" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
