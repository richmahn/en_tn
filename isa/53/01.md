# General Information:

Isaiah continues describing Yahweh's servant. Here Isaiah describes events that will happen in the future as if they happened in the past. This emphasizes that they certainly will happen. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture]])

# Who has believed what they heard from us

What Isaiah just found out is so amazing that he wonders if the exiles will believe it. The "we" includes him and those in exile. Alternate translation: "It is hard for anyone to believe what we have heard" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-inclusive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# to whom has the arm of Yahweh been revealed?

Arm refers to God's power. This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "Yahweh has revealed his power to people." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
