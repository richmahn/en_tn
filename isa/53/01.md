* **Who would have believed what we heard?** - What Isaiah just found out is so amazing that he wonders if the exiles will believe it. The "we" includes him and those in exile. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **Who would have believed** - This question is like the one above, expressing surprise.
* **And the arm of Yahweh, to whom was it revealed?** - AT: "And to whom has Yahweh revealed his power?" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
* **For he grew up before Yahweh like a sapling, and like a sprout out of parched earth** - Here "he" refers to God's servant whom Isaiah compares to a very young tree. This emphasizes that he will appear weak. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
