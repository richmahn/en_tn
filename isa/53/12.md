## translationNotes

* Yahweh continues describing his servant.
* **Therefore will I give him his portion among the multitudes, and he will divide the spoils with the many** - This refers to a king after a victorious battle sharing the plunder or rewards with his army. This means God will greatly honor his servant because of his sacrifice. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **because he exposed his life to death** - AT: "he willingly risked death" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
* **and was numbered with the transgressors** - AT: "and allowed people to treat him as a criminal" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
* **He bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors** - The word "intercession" here means the servant pleaded or prayed to Yahweh on behalf of sinners.
