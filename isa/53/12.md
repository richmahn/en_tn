# General Information:

Yahweh continues describing his servant.

# Therefore will I give him his portion among the multitudes, and he will divide the spoils with the many

These two clauses mean basically the same thing. "Portion" and "spoils" refer to a king after a victorious battle sharing the plunder or rewards with his army. This means God will greatly honor his servant because of his sacrifice. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the multitudes

Many versions interpret this expression as "the many" or "the strong."

# because he exposed himself to death

"Exposed" means to be vulnerable or unprotected. The servant of Yahweh put himself in a situation where he would die. AT: "he willingly accepted the possibility of death" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# was numbered with the transgressors

This can be stated in active form. AT: "allowed people to treat him as a criminal" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
