Yahweh continues describing his servant.

## Therefore will I give him his portion among the multitudes, and he will divide the spoils with the many ##

This refers to a king after a victorious battle sharing the plunder or rewards with his army. This means God will greatly honor his servant because of his sacrifice. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## because he exposed his life to death ##

AT: "he willingly risked death" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

## and was numbered with the transgressors ##

AT: "and allowed people to treat him as a criminal" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## He bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors ##

The word "intercession" here means the servant pleaded or prayed to Yahweh on behalf of sinners.
