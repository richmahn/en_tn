# the glory of Jacob will become thin, and the fatness of his flesh will become lean

Here "Jacob" refers to the kingdom of Israel. Israel would no longer be glorious. Rather it would be weak and poor. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# It will be as when a harvester gathers the standing grain ... in the Valley of Rephaim

There will be nothing left in the land after God punishes the people of Israel. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
