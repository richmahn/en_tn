## translationNotes

* **It will come about that** - This phrase is used here to mark an important event that will happen. If your language has a way for doing this, you could consider using it here.
* **the glory of Jacob will become thin and the fatness of his flesh will become lean** - Here "Jacob" refers to the people of Israel. God emphasizes that they were strong but they will become weak. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **It will be as when a harvester gathers the standing grain, and his arm reaps the heads of grain. It will be as when one gleans heads of grain in the valley of Rephaim** - There will be nothing left in the land after God punishes the people of Israel. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
