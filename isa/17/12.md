## translationNotes

* **The uproar of many peoples, that roar like the roaring of the seas, and the rushing of nations, that rush like the rushing of mighty waters** - the enemy armies appear to be a powerful force that no one can stop. AT: "The armies from the nations will roar and come rushing in like the mighty waters." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
* **as the dead weeds on the mountains before the wind, and like weeds whirling before a storm** - the armies seemed powerful but God will easily stop them.
* **loot us...rob us** - The word "us" refers to Isaiah and includes the people of Judah. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive]])
