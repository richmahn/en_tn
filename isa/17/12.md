## The uproar of many peoples, that roar like the roaring of the seas, and the rushing of nations, that rush like the rushing of mighty waters ##

the enemy armies appear to be a powerful force that no one can stop. AT: "The armies from the nations will roar and come rushing in like the mighty waters." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

## as the dead weeds on the mountains before the wind, and like weeds whirling before a storm ##

the armies seemed powerful but God will easily stop them.

## loot us...rob us ##

The word "us" refers to Isaiah and includes the people of Judah. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-inclusive]])
