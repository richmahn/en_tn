# They will not look to the altars

Looking to the altars represents worshiping idols with the hope that the idols will help them. Alternate translation: "They will not worship idols at their altars" or "The people of Israel will not go to their altars and ask their idols to help them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# the work of their hands

Here the people are represented by their "hands" to emphasize that they made the altars or idols. Alternate translation: "that they made with their hands" or "which they themselves built" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# what their fingers have made ... the Asherah poles or the sun images

The second phrase identifies the things that the people made. Speaking of the fingers here emphasizes that the people made them, so these things are not real gods. Alternate translation: "the Asherah poles or the sun images, which they themselves made" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
