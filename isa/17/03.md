# Fortified cities will disappear from Ephraim

Ephraim was the largest tribe in Israel. Here it represents the entire northern kingdom of Israel. AT: "Strong cities will disappear from Israel" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# will disappear

This does not mean that they will vanish, but that the cities will be destroyed.

# the kingdom from Damascus

The words "will disappear" are understood from the previous phrase. Damascus was where the king of Aram ruled from. The kingdom disappearing represents the king no longer having royal power. AT: "the kingdom will disappear from Damascus" or "there will be no royal power in Damascus" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# this is the declaration of Yahweh of hosts

Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. Translate as in [Isaiah 14:22](../14/22.md). AT: "this is what Yahweh of hosts has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh of hosts, have declared" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
