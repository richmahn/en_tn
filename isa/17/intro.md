# Isaiah 17 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations set each line of poetry further to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetry in this chapter.

The ULB indents the lines in 17:1-6, 9-14 because they are part of a long quotation.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Damascus #####
This chapter prophesies destruction against the people of Damascus. Damascus was the capital of Aram. The people of Damascus worship gods other than Yahweh and have fought Yahweh's people. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/falsegod]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/peopleofgod]])

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### Ephraim #####
This chapter prophesied destruction against the kingdom of Israel. They are also called Ephraim in this chapter. Both the northern kingdom of Israel and Aram were conquered at about the same time in history.
