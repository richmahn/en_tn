# Isaiah 17 General Notes

#### Structure and formatting

Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in this chapter.

The ULT sets the lines in 17:1-6, 9-14 farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because they are part of a long quotation.
