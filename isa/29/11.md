# All revelation has become to you as the words of a book that is sealed

The other prophets in Jerusalem are unable to hear or understand God's message. Alternate translation: "All that Yahweh has revealed is to you like a sealed book" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# is sealed, which men might give to one who is learned

This can be stated as a new sentence. Alternate translation: "is sealed. A person may take the sealed book to someone who can read"
