# You will be brought down

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "Your enemy will bring you down" or "Your enemy will humble you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# will speak from the ground; your speech will be low from the dust. Your voice will sound like a spirit that speaks from the ground, and out of the dust your speech will whisper

All of these statements mean basically the same thing. They emphasize that the people who once spoke with proud words will be weak and grieving after the enemy defeats them. Alternate translation: "you will only be able to speak with weak whispers like a spirit speaking from where dead people dwell" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
