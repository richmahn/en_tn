## translationNotes

* **Woe to Ariel** - Ariel is another name for Jerusalem. If possible translate this as "Ariel" rather than "Jerusalem" since the meaning of "Ariel" is important in 29:2.  AT: "How terrible it will be for the people of Ariel." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]] and [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
* **David encamped** - "David dwelled" or "David lived"
* **Add year to year; let the festivals come round** - “Year after year you go through your ritual of sacrifices” or "Keep celebrating your festival year after year"
* **But I will** - The word "I" refers to Yahweh.
* **she will be mourning and lamenting** - "she" refers to the people of Ariel. AT: "they will mourn deeply." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
* **like Ariel** - Translators may add footnote that says "The name Ariel means 'altar.'" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
