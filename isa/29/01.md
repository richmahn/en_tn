# Woe to Ariel

Here "Ariel" represents the people who live in the city of Ariel. AT: "How terrible it will be for the people of Ariel" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# Ariel

This is another name for Jerusalem, and it means "altar." If possible translate this as "Ariel" rather than "Jerusalem" since the meaning of "Ariel" is important in 29:2. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# David encamped

"David dwelled" or "David lived"

# Add year to year; let the festivals come round

"Keep celebrating your festival year after year." This is an ironic statement. Yahweh tells the people to keep celebrating their festivals where they sacrifice to him, but he knows it will not prevent him from destroying them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])

# But I will besiege

The word "I" refers to Yahweh. This represents Yahweh causing an enemy army to besiege Jerusalem. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# she will

Here "she" refers to Ariel, which represents the people of Ariel. AT: "the people of Ariel will" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# mourning and lamenting

The words "mourning" and "lamenting" mean basically the same thing and emphasize the intensity of mourning. AT: "they will mourn deeply" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# like Ariel

Translators may add a footnote that says, "The name Ariel means 'altar.'" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
