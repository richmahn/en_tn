# The great number of your invaders will become like fine dust, and the multitude of the ruthless ones as chaff that passes away

This emphasizes how weak and insignificant the invading army is before God. AT: "Yahweh will easily remove the horde of your invaders and the multitude of the ruthless ones"(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# great number of your invaders

"many soldiers that will attack you"

# the ruthless ones as chaff

The translator can supply the verb "will become." AT: "the soldiers who show you no mercy will become as chaff" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
