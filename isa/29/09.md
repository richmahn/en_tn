## Astonish yourselves and be astonished ##

The word "yourselves" refers to the people of Jerusalem. Why they are astonished can be made explicit: AT: "Be astonished at what I am telling you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

## blind yourselves...be drunk ##

Isaiah compares the people of Jerusalem to a blind person and a drunk person. This emphasizes they are senseless and do not understand God's plans. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## blind yourselves and be blind ##

AT: "keep being ignorant and spiritually blind to what I am showing you"

## Be drunk, but not with wine; stagger, but not with beer ##

AT: "Be senseless like a drunk person, but it is not because you have drank too much wine"

## For Yahweh has poured out on you the spirit of deep sleep ##

AT: "The reason you are senseless is because Yahweh has caused you to be spiritually asleep."

## He has closed your eyes, the prophets, and has covered your heads, the seers ##

AT: "He has made your prophets and seers unable to hear and understand his message"
