# blind yourselves and be blind

The people ignoring what Yahweh says is spoken of as if they would make themselves blind. Alternate translation: "keep being ignorant and spiritually blind to what I am showing you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Be drunk, but not with wine; stagger, but not with beer

The people being senseless and not understanding what Yahweh is doing is spoken of as if they were drunk. Alternate translation: "Be senseless like a drunk person, but it is not because you have drank too much wine or beer" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
