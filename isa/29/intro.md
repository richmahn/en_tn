# Isaiah 29 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations indent each line of poetry to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetry in this chapter.

This chapter begins a series of "woes" against specific nations. It presents judgments against the kingdoms of Ephraim and eventually Judah. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/woe]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/judge]])

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Ariel #####
This is another name for Jerusalem. It is an uncommon name. 

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### Prophecies #####
This chapter appears to prophesy about a time of restoration when the messiah will reign. It pictures a time of great peace and harmony in the world. The translator does not need to add an explanation, but should try to maintain the tense of the original text, as a future or uncompleted action. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/restore]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/fulfill]])
