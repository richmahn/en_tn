## I will encamp against you ##

The word "I" refers to Yahweh. AT: "I will command the army of your enemies to surround you."

## palisade...siege works ##

A "palisade" is a tower armies would build to attack cities with high walls. Also, "siege works" refers to other various weapons armies would build to attack cities.

## You will be brought down ##

AT: "Your enemy will bring you down" or "Your enemy will humble you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## and will speak from the ground; your speech will be low from the dust. Your voice will be like a ghost out of the ground, and your speech will be very weak from the dust. ##

This emphasizes that the people who once spoke with proud words will be weak and grieving after the enemy defeats them. AT: "and you will only be able to speak with weak whispers like a spirit speaking from where dead people dwell." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
