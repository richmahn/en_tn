# I will encamp against you

The word "I" refers to Yahweh. This represents Yahweh causing an enemy army to surround Jerusalem. AT: "I will command the army of your enemies to surround you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# palisade ... siege works

A "palisade" is a tower armies would build to attack cities with high walls. Also "siege works" refers to other various weapons armies would build to attack cities. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

# You will be brought down

This can be stated in active form. AT: "Your enemy will bring you down" or "Your enemy will humble you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# will speak from the ground; your speech will be low from the dust. Your voice will be like a ghost out of the ground, and your speech will be very weak from the dust

All of these statements mean basically the same thing. They emphasize that the people who once spoke with proud words will be weak and grieving after the enemy defeats them. AT: "you will only be able to speak with weak whispers like a spirit speaking from where dead people dwell" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
