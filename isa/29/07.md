# It will be like a dream, a vision of the night

The phrase "a vision of the night" is the same thing as "a dream." The two phrases emphasize that soon it will be like the invading army was never there. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# A horde of all the nations

"Large armies from all the nations"

# fight against Ariel

The name "Ariel" is another name for Jerusalem, and it represents the people who live there. See how you translated "Ariel" in [Isaiah 29:1](../29/01.md). Alternate translation: "fight against the people of Ariel" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# her stronghold. They will attack her and her fortifications to press upon her

The word "her" refers to Ariel which represents the people who live there. Alternate translation: "their stronghold. They will attack the city of Ariel and its defenses and cause the people to be in great distress" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# It will be like when a hungry man dreams he is eating ... his thirst not quenched

These similes mean that the enemy will expect victory but they will fail because God will not allow them to conquer Jerusalem. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
