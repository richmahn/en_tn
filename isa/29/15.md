This may be Isaiah speaking or it may continue Yahweh's speech in 29:13-14.

## who deeply hide their plans ##

AT: “who completely hide their plans”

## deeds are in darkness ##

AT: “acts are done in secret”

## Who sees us, and who knows us? ##

AT: "No one, not even Yahweh, sees us or knows what we are doing." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
