# The oppressed will again rejoice in Yahweh, and the poor among men will rejoice in the Holy One of Israel

These two phrases mean basically the same thing. Alternate translation: "The poor and oppressed people will again be happy because of what Yahweh, the Holy One of Israel, has done" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
