## This people draws near to me with their mouth and honor me with their lips but their heart is far from me ##

The words "mouth" and "lips" refer to what people say. AT: "The people of Jerusalem honor me with what they say, but they do not honor me in their thoughts." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## Their honoring me is a commandment taught by men ##

AT: “They honor me only because that is what men tell them to do” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## Therefore, see, I will proceed to do a marvelous thing among this people, wonder after wonder ##

AT: "Therefore, look and see! I am going to do something among you that you cannot explain"

## The wisdom of their wise men will perish ##

AT: “What the wise men say will no longer be wise”

## the understanding of their prudent men will disappear. ##

AT: "the intelligence of the smart men no one will understand."
