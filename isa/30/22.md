# General Information:

Isaiah continues speaking to the people of Judah.

# You will throw them away like a menstrual rag

This simile means they will throw away their idols like they were garbage. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# You will say to them, "Get out of here."

This speaks of the idols as if they could hear and get up and leave a place. Yahweh means that the people will no longer need or want the idols. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
