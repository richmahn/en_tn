# General Information:

Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Judah.

# Therefore Pharaoh's protection will be your shame, and the refuge in Egypt's shade, your humiliation

This can be reworded so that the abstract nouns "protection," "shame," and "humiliation" are expressed as adjectives or verbs. AT: "Therefore you will be ashamed because you relied on Pharaoh to protect you; you will be humiliated because you relied on the Egyptians to keep you safe" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# the refuge in Egypt's shade

Egypt's protection from enemy armies is spoken of as if it were a shadow that protects someone from the burning heat of the sun. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# their princes

Here "princes" mean an official or ambassador, not necessarily sons of the king.

# their ... They ... them

These words refer to the people of Judah.

# Zoan ... Hanes

These were cities in the northern part of Egypt. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# have come to Hanes

Here "come" can be stated as "gone." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])

# because of a people

"because of the people of Egypt"
