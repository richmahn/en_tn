# General Information:

Isaiah continues speaking to the people of Judah.

# He will give

"Yahweh will give"

# bread with abundance from the ground

Here "bread" represents food in general. AT: "he will cause the ground to produce plenty of food for you to eat" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# In that day

"At that time"

# that has been winnowed with a shovel and a fork

Shovels and forks were used to throw the grain in the air so the wind would blow away the chaff, leaving only the part that could be eaten. This can be stated in active form. AT: "that you have winnowed with a shovel and a pitchfork" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
