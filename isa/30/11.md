# Turn aside from the way, stray off the path

How Yahweh wants his people to behave is spoken of as if it were a way or path on which to walk. To disobey Yahweh is spoken of as if the person strays away from Yahweh's path. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Holy One of Israel

See how you translated this name in [Isaiah 1:4](../01/04.md).
