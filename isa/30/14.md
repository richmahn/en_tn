# General Information:

Isaiah describes how Yahweh will destroy the people of Judah. (See: [Isaiah 30:12-13](./12.md))

# He will break it

Here "it" refers to the part in the wall that is about to fall. The part in the wall is a metaphor that represents the people of Judah and their sin mentioned in [Isaiah 30:12-13](./12.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# as a potter's vessel is broken

This simile means that the piece of wall will break as quickly and completely as a clay jar that falls to the ground. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# potter

A potter is a person who makes pots and jars out of clay.

# there will not be found

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "no one will be able to find" or "there will not be" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# a shard with which to scrape

"a shard big enough to scrape"

# fire from the hearth

The word "fire" here refers here to ashes. Alternate translation: "ashes from the fireplace" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
