# General Information:

This continues God's declaration concerning the people of Judah.

# A declaration

"This is what Yahweh declares"

# of the lioness and the lion, the viper and fiery flying serpent

This refers to these types of animals in general. AT: "where lionesses and lions dwell, and where there are vipers and serpents" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])

# fiery flying serpent

Here the word "fiery" probably refers to the serpent's poisonous bite and the word "flying" refers to its quick movements. See how you translated this in [Isaiah 14:29](../14/29.md).

# they carry their riches

"the people of Judah carry their riches"
