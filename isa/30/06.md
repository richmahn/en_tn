# General Information:

This continues God's declaration concerning the people of Judah.

# A declaration

"This is what Yahweh declares"

# of the lioness and the lion, the viper and fiery flying serpent

This refers to these types of animals in general. AT: "where lionesses and lions dwell, and where there are vipers and serpents" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])

# fiery flying serpent

Here the word "fiery" probably refers to the serpent's poisonous bite and the word "flying" refers to its quick movements. See how you translated this in [Isaiah 14:29](../14/28.md).

# they carry their riches

"the people of Judah carry their riches"

# I have called her Rahab, who sits still

There were popular stories about a sea monster named Rahab. The name Rahab means "strength" or "arrogance." AT: "I call Egypt a loud boaster who does nothing" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
