# lying children, children who will not hear the instruction of Yahweh

This speaks of Yahweh's people as if they were his children. This can be translated as a new sentence. Alternate translation: "They behave like children who lie and do not listen to what Yahweh commands" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
