# General Information:

Isaiah continues speaking to the people of Judah.

# On every high mountain ... sunlight of seven days

Isaiah describes what will be an ideal situation after Yahweh rescues his people. Although the language may be exaggerated, you should translate this just as Isaiah described it.

# in the day of the great slaughter when the towers fall

"when Yahweh slaughters your enemies and causes their strong towers to fall"

# in the day

"at the time"
