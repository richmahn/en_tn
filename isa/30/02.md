# They seek protection from Pharaoh

This can be reworded so that the abstract noun "protection" is expressed as the verb "protect." Alternate translation: "They ask Pharaoh to protect them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# take refuge in the shadow of Egypt

Egypt's protection from enemy armies is spoken of as if it were a shadow that protects someone from the burning heat of the sun. Alternate translation: "they rely on the Egyptians to keep them safe" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
