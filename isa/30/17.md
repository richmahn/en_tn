# One thousand will flee at the threat of one; at the threat of five you will flee

The word "solider" is understood. AT: "One thousand soldiers will flee at the threat of one enemy soldier; at the threat of five enemy soldiers all of your soldiers will flee" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# One thousand

"1,000" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])

# until your remnant will be like a flagstaff on the top of a mountain, or like a flag on a hill

This simile means there will be so few people left that they will be like a single flag on top of a hill. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
