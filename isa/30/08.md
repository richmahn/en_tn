Yahweh continues speaking to Isaiah.

## Now ##

This word is used here to mark a break in Yahweh's declaration about Judah. Here he tells Isaiah to do something.

## in their presence ##

"in the presence of the people of Judah"

## lying children, children who will not hear the instruction of Yahweh. ##

This can be translated as a new sentence. AT: "They behave like children who lie and do not listen to what Yahweh commands." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
