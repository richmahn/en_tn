Isaiah speaks to the people of Jerusalem.

## He will be the stability in your times ##

"He will make you secure all your lives"

## abundance of salvation, wisdom, and knowledge ##

"he will save you and give you an abundance of wisdom and knowledge"

## the fear of Yahweh is his treasure ##

If the people fear Yahweh, he will be like valuable treasure to them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
