# Your heart will recall the terror

This refers to the audience by their "hearts." "The terror" refers to their war with the Assyrians. This can be stated clearly. AT: "You will remember the terror that the Assyrians caused you when they attacked" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# where is the scribe, where is he who weighed the money? Where is he who counted the towers?

These rhetorical question are asked to emphasize that the Assyrian officials are gone. These questions may be written as statements. AT: "The officers of Assyria who counted the tax money that we were forced to pay to them have disappeared! Those men who counted our towers are gone!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# weighed the money

Money was valuable metal; its value was determined by its weight.
