# Yahweh in majesty will be with us, in a place of broad rivers and streams

Here "us" refers to Isaiah and includes the people of Judah. This speaks of the safety of living with Yahweh as if it were a place that has rivers around it so that enemies cannot attack it. Alternate translation: "Yahweh who is majestic will be with us, and we will be safe as if we were in a place surrounded by broad rivers" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-inclusive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# will travel it

"will travel the river"
