# General Information:

Yahweh continues to speak.

# You who are far away, hear what I have done; and, you who are near, acknowledge my might

Yahweh uses the words "far away" and "near" to mean all people. The word "might" can be expressed with the adjective "mighty." Alternate translation: "All people everywhere hear what I have done and acknowledge that I am mighty" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
