Yahweh continues to speak.

## You who are far away, hear what I have done; and, you who are near, acknowledge my might ##

Yahweh uses the words "far away" and "near" to mean all people. "All people everywhere listen to what I have done and admit that I am mighty." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])

## sojourn ##

live in a place that is not one's home
