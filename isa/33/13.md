* Yahweh continues to speak.
* **You who are far away, hear what I have done; and, you who are near, acknowledge my might** - Yahweh uses the words "far away" and "near" to mean all people. "All people everywhere listen to what I have done and admit that I am mighty." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
* **sojourn** - live in a place that is not one's home
