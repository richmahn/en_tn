# Isaiah 33 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of this chapter, which is an extended quotation.

This chapter continues the series of "woes." It speaks against ungodly or evil people in general. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/woe]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/ungodly]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/evil]])
