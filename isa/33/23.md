Possible meanings: 1) The Assyrian army is like a boat that is unable to move through the water: the ropes that support the mast and sail have come loose and no longer support the mast, so the sail is useless ([Isaiah 33:1](./01.md)) or 2) the people of Judah are no longer at war: "You have loosened the cords that supported your flagpole; the flag no longer flies" ([Isaiah 33:17](./17.md)-[Isaiah 22](./22.md)).
