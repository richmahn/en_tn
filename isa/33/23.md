## translationNotes

* **Your riggings are slack; they cannot hold the mast in place; they cannot spread the sail** - Possible meanings: 1) The Assyrian army is like a boat that is unable to move through the water: the ropes that support the mast and sail have come loose and no longer support the mast, so the sail is useless ([[:en:bible:notes:isa:33:01]]) or 2) the people of Judah are no longer at war: "You have loosened the cords that supported your flagpole; the flag no longer flies" ([[:en:bible:notes:isa:33:17]]-[[:en:bible:notes:isa:33:22]], see UDB). (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **mast** - tall poles that support the sail
* **sail** - a large cloth that fills with wind and moves a boat through the water
* **when the great spoil is divided** - AT: "when they divide the treasure" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
* **the people who live there will be forgiven for their iniquity** - AT: "Yahweh will forgive the sins of the people who live there"
