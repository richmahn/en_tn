Isaiah continues to speak to the people of Judah.

## a tent that will not be removed ##

It may be translated as a new sentence. AT: "It will be like a tent that no one will ever remove." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## whose stakes will never be pulled up or will any of its cords be broken ##

This can be translated as a new sentence. AT: "No one will ever pull up its stakes or break its cords."

## Yahweh in majesty will be with us, in a place of broad rivers and streams ##

Here "us" refers to Isaiah and includes the people of Judah. This compares the safety of living with Yahweh to a place that has rivers around it so that enemies cannot attack them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-inclusive]])
