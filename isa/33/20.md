## translationNotes

* Isaiah continues to speak to the people of Judah.
* **a tent that will not be removed** - It may be translated as a new sentence. AT: "It will be like a tent that no one will ever remove." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
* **whose stakes will never be pulled up or will any of its cords be broken** - This can be translated as a new sentence. AT: "No one will ever pull up its stakes or break its cords."
* **Yahweh in majesty will be with us, in a place of broad rivers and streams** - Here "us" refers to Isaiah and includes the people of Judah. This compares the safety of living with Yahweh to a place that has rivers around it so that enemies cannot attack them. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive]])
