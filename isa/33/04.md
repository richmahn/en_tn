# Your spoil is gathered as the locusts gather; as locusts leap, men leap on it

This compares how quick and eager Yahweh's people are when they gather the spoils from their enemies to the eagerness of locusts when they gather food. This can be stated in active form. AT: "Your people gather spoils from your enemies with the same fierceness as the locusts have who devour green plants" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
