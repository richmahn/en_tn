# from your suffering and anguish

The word "your" is singular, but it refers to the people of Israel. Also, "suffering" and "anguish" mean basically the same thing and are used together for emphasis. AT: "from the things that have caused you to suffer greatly" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
