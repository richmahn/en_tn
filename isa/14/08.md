# Even the cypress trees rejoice over you with the cedars of Lebanon

Isaiah speaks of the trees as if they were people who could rejoice. This emphasizes that it is such a great thing that God has stopped the king of Babylon that even nature would rejoice if it could. AT: "It will be as if even the cyprus trees and the cedars of Lebanon rejoice over you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# rejoice over you

Why they rejoice can be stated clearly. AT: "rejoice that God has made you powerless" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# Since you are laid low

Being laid low represents being made powerless and unimportant. AT: "Since you have become powerless" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
