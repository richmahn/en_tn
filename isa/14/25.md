# Then his yoke will be lifted from off them and his burden from off their shoulder

This can be expressed with an active verb. Alternate translation: "Then I will lift his yoke from them and his burden from their shoulder" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# Then his yoke will be lifted from off them and his burden from off their shoulder

These two phrases mean basically the same thing. Lifting the yoke and burden represents setting people free from slavery.

# his yoke ... his burden

The word "his" refers to Assyria.

# from off them ... from off their shoulder

The words "them" and "their" refer to the people of Israel.
