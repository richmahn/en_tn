# the rod that struck you is broken

The rod that struck Philistia represents a king who sent his army to attack them. Being broken represents either being dead or being defeated. Alternate translation: "the king that sent his army against you is dead" or "the army that attacked you is defeated" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# For out of the serpent's root will grow out an adder ... his offspring will be a fiery flying serpent

These two phrases are both the image of a serpent's offspring being even more harmful than the serpent. They represent a king's successor being more powerful and cruel than the first king. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# an adder

a kind of poisonous snake

# a fiery flying serpent

Here the word "fiery" probably refers to the serpent's poisonous bite, and the word "flying" refers to its quick movements. Alternate translation: "a quickly moving poisonous snake" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
