# You will not join them in burial

The word "them" refers to the other kings who died and were buried properly. Joining them in burial represents being buried as they were. Alternate translation: "you will never be buried as other kings were buried" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# The offspring of evildoers will never be mentioned again

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "no one will ever speak again about the descendants of evildoers" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
