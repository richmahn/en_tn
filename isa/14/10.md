# Connecting Statement:

This is part of the taunt song that the Israelites will sing to the king of Babylon. Here they sing about what the dead kings in Sheol will say to him.

# They all will speak and say to you

The word "they" refers to the dead kings in Sheol, and the word "you" refers to the king of Babylon.
