This may be Isaiah speaking or it may be Yahweh speaking

## this is the hand that is stretched out over all the nations ##

Here "hand" refers to Yahweh's power. AT: "this is my power to punish all the nations." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## who will thwart him? ##

This question emphasizes that no one can stop Yahweh. AT: "there is no one who can stop him." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## Yahweh of Hosts ##

See how you translated this in [Isaiah 1:9](../01/09.md).

## His hand is stretched out, and who will turn it back? ##

AT: "His powerful hand is ready to punish the nations, and no one is able to stop it."
