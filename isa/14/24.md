## Yahweh of Hosts ##

See how you translated this in [Isaiah 1:9](../01/09.md).

## as I have intended, so it will come to pass; and as I have purposed, so it will be ##

AT: "the things that I have planned will surely happen" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## the Assyrian ##

AT: "the king of Assyria and his army" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## Then his yoke will be lifted from off them and his burden from off their shoulder ##

AT: "Then I will free the people of Israel from the king of Assyria like taking the yoke off of an ox." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
