# Connecting Statement:

This is part of the taunt song that the Israelites will sing to the king of Babylon.

# How you are fallen from heaven, daystar, son of the morning

The daystar is a bright star that rises just before morning. The people of Israel will refer to the king of Babylon in terms of this star in order to imply that he once was great, but now he was not. AT: "You were like the bright morning star, but you have fallen from the sky" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# How you are cut down to the ground

The people of Israel will speak of the king of Babylon as if he were a tree that was cut down. AT: "You are defeated like a tree that someone has cut down to the ground" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# I will sit on the mount of assembly

This alludes to the myth that many people in the Ancient Near East knew, that the Canaanite gods met in council on the top of a mountain in the northern part of Syria. Sitting on the mountain represents ruling with the gods. AT: "I will rule on the mountain where the gods assemble" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# in the far reaches of the north

"in the most northern places." The mountain in the north was apparently called Zaphon. Some modern versions say "far away on the sides of Zaphon."
