# Isaiah 14 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 14:3-27, 29-32, which are extended quotations.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Satan #####
It is believed that this chapter references Satan. It describes Satan as a star fallen from heaven. There are five important statements beginning with the words "I will" which appear to show the essence of Satan's sin. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/satan]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/heaven]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

##### Babylon #####
This is the name of the kingdom that conquered Judah, but it is also the name representing Satan's kingdom in prophecies. They were not yet a world power when these words were spoken. It should be translated as "Babylon," but translators should be aware of its dual meaning. 

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### Israel #####
The use of Israel in this chapter is in reference to the nation or people group of Israel. It is this Israel who will be restored and not the kingdom of Israel. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/restore]])
