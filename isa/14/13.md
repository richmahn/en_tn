# I will sit on the mount of assembly

This alludes to the myth that many people in the Ancient Near East knew, that the Canaanite gods met in council on the top of a mountain in the northern part of Syria. Sitting on the mountain represents ruling with the gods. AT: "I will rule on the mountain where the gods assemble" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# in the far reaches of the north

"in the most northern places." The mountain in the north was apparently called Zaphon. Some modern versions say "far away on the sides of Zaphon."
