# Isaiah 02 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 2:2-3:26, which is a vision Isaiah receives. These are the words of Yahweh.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Latter days #####
This is probably a reference to the "last days." This makes parts of this prophecy reference events near the end of this world. Most scholars expect these prophecies to be fulfilled by Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lastday]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/fulfill]])

##### Idolatry #####
While the first prophecy of Isaiah concerned the lack of justice in Judah, this chapter focuses on the presence of idolatry in Judah. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/justice]])
