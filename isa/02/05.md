# General Information:

In 2:5 Isaiah speaks to the people of Judah, and in 2:6 he speaks to Yahweh. Both times he speaks in the form of a poem. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# House of Jacob

"You descendants of Jacob." The word "house" is a metonym for the people who live in the house, the family. Here "Jacob" represents the nation of Judah, but it would be best to use "Jacob" here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# come

a gentle encouragement to do what the speaker is about to tell the hearer to do

# let us walk in the light of Yahweh

Isaiah speaks of people learning and then doing what Yahweh wants them to do as if they were walking at night with a lamp that Yahweh has provided so they can see the path. AT: "let us learn how Yahweh wants us to live and then live that way" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
