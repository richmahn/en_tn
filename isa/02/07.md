# General Information:

Isaiah speaks to Yahweh in the form of a poem. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# Their land is full of silver ... their land also is full of horses ... Their land also is full of idols

Isaiah speaks as if the land were a container in which someone had placed silver, horses, and idols. The word "land" is a metonym for the people themselves, and the words "is full of" is a metaphor for the people possessing these items. Alternate translation: "They possess much silver ... they also possess many horses ... They also possess many idols" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
