# General Information:

In 2:9 Isaiah finishes speaking to Yahweh. In 2:10-11 Isaiah speaks to the people of Judah. Both times he speaks in the form of a poem. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# The people will be bowed down, and individuals will fall down

Here being low to the ground represents people who are completely humiliated because they realize all they trusted in is worthless, and they can do nothing to help themselves. This can be stated in active form. AT: "God will make the people ashamed, and they will realize that all they trusted in is worthless" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# The people

human beings, as opposed to animals

# individuals

"each person"

# do not raise them up

The words "raise them up" are a metaphor for Yahweh forgiving the people. AT: "do not forgive them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
