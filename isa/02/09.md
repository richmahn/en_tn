* **therefore do not forgive them** - Here Isaiah is talking to Yahweh.
* **Go into the rocky places** - Here Isaiah is again talking to the people of Judah.
* **hide in the ground** - "hide in the holes in the ground"
* **from the terror of Yahweh** - Alternate translations: "to get away from Yahweh's terrifying presence" or "from Yahweh because you will be extremely afraid of him"
* **the glory of his majesty** - Alternate translation: "his awesome power" or "his great power"
* **The lofty gaze of man will be brought low, and the pride of men will be brought down** - Both of these phrases mean basically the same thing and are used for emphasis.
