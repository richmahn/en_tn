## translationNotes

* Isaiah continues to describe what will happen on the day of Yahweh.
* **to the moles and bats** - Moles are small animals that dig and live underground. Bats are small flying animals that sometimes live in caves. Alternate translation: "to the animals." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
* **from the terror of Yahweh and from the glory of his majesty** - See how this was translated in [[en:bible:notes:isa:02:09]].
* **when he rises to terrify the earth** - See how this was translated in [[en:bible:notes:isa:02:17]].
* **whose life-breath is in his nostrils** - breath is in his nostrils** - This means that humans are weak. We rely on breathing, and if we do not breathe, we will die. Alternate translation: "who are mortal and will die." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
* **for what does he amount to** - Isaiah uses a question to remind the people of something they should already know. Alternate translation: "Man amounts to nothing!" or "Man is not worth anything" or "How can people help you?" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
