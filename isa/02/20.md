Isaiah continues to describe what will happen on the day of Yahweh.

## to the moles and bats ##

Moles are small animals that dig and live underground. Bats are small flying animals that sometimes live in caves. Alternate translation: "to the animals." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

## from the terror of Yahweh and from the glory of his majesty ##

See how this was translated in [Isaiah 2:9](./09.md).

## when he rises to terrify the earth ##

See how this was translated in [Isaiah 2:17](./17.md).

## whose life-breath is in his nostrils ##

This means that humans are weak. We rely on breathing, and if we do not breathe, we will die. Alternate translation: "who are mortal and will die." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## for what does he amount to ##

Isaiah uses a question to remind the people of something they should already know. Alternate translation: "Man amounts to nothing!" or "Man is not worth anything" or "How can people help you?" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
