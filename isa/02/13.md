# against all the cedars of Lebanon ... against all the oaks of Bashan

The "day of Yahweh of Hosts" will be against the cedars and oaks. Possible meanings are 1) these trees are a metaphor for the proud people whom God will judge or 2) God will actually destroy these mighty trees. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
