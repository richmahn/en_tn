Isaiah continues to describe what will happen on the day of Yahweh.

## The pride of man will be brought low and the haughtiness of men will fall ##

Both of these phrases mean basically the same thing and are used for emphasis. This could be translated with an active verb:  â€œHe will make every prideful person humble." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## Yahweh alone will be exalted ##

See how you translated this in [Isaiah 2:9](./09.md).

## The idols will completely pass away ##

"All idols will disappear" (UDB) or "There will be no more idols"

## from before the terror of Yahweh, and from the splendor of his majesty ##

See how this was translated in [Isaiah 2:9](./09.md).

## when he rises to terrify the earth ##

This can be translated as "when Yahweh causes the people of the earth  to be terribly afraid of him."
