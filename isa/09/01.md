# The gloom will be dispelled from her who was in anguish

Isaiah speaks of people who are spiritually lost as if they were walking around in total darkness. This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "Yahweh will remove the darkness from her who was in anguish" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# The gloom

This word means "partial or total darkness." Translate as you translated "gloom" in [Isaiah 08:22](../08/22.md).

# her who was in anguish

"her who was suffering great pain and sadness." This is probably a metaphor for the people of Judah. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# In an earlier time he humiliated the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali

"Land" refers to the people who live in an area. Alternate translation: "In the past, the Lord humbled those living in Zebulun and Naphtali" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# but in the later time he will make it glorious, the way to the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations

Here "it" refers to Galilee which represents the people who live there. Alternate translation: "but in the future, the Lord will honor the people of Galilee of the nations, which is on the road between the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan River" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# Galilee of the nations

Here "nations" represents the people from other nations that live in Galilee. Alternate translation: "Galilee, where many foreigners live" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
