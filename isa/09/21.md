# In all these things, his anger does not subside; instead, his hand

"Even though all these things have happened, he is still angry, and his hand." See how you translated this in [Isaiah 5:25](../05/25.md).

# his hand is still stretched out

Isaiah speaks as if Yahweh were a person about to hit another person with his fist. This is a metaphor for Yahweh punishing Israel. See how you translated this in [Isaiah 5:25](../05/25.md). AT: "he will still be ready to punish them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
