## translationNotes

* Isaiah continues to describe the time when God will save the people of Israel. Although these events would happen in the future, Isaiah describes them as if they already happened. This emphasizes that they certainly will happen. (See: [[en:bible:notes:isa:09:01]])
* **For the yoke of his burden, the beam across his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, you have shattered** - The word "his" refers to the people of Israel. Isaiah includes himself as a part of Israel. Isaiah compares the slaves from Israel to oxen wearing yokes.  AT: "You will free the slaves from Israel like a person removing a yoke from an oxen, and you will shatter the rod of the one who oppresses us." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **as on the day of Midian** - AT: "as when you defeated the Midianites."
* **every boot treading in the tumult and the garments rolled in blood will be burned** - AT: "You will burn the boots of the soldiers and their clothes which are covered with blood." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
* **fuel for the fire** - This can be translated as a new sentence: "You will make them fuel for the fire."
