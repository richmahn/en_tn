## For the yoke of his burden, the beam across his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, you have shattered ##

The word "his" refers to the people of Israel. Isaiah includes himself as a part of Israel. Isaiah compares the slaves from Israel to oxen wearing yokes.  AT: "You will free the slaves from Israel like a person removing a yoke from an oxen, and you will shatter the rod of the one who oppresses us." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## as on the day of Midian ##

AT: "as when you defeated the Midianites."

## every boot treading in the tumult and the garments rolled in blood will be burned ##

AT: "You will burn the boots of the soldiers and their clothes which are covered with blood." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## fuel for the fire ##

This can be translated as a new sentence: "You will make them fuel for the fire."
