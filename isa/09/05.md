# every boot treading in the tumult and the garments rolled in blood will be burned

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "you will burn the boots of the soldiers and their clothes, which are covered with blood" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# burned, fuel for the fire

This can be made more explicit by translating it as a new sentence. Alternate translation: "burned. You will make the boots and the garments fuel for the fire" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
