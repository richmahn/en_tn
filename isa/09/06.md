# General Information:

Isaiah continues to describe the time when God will save the people of Israel ([Isaiah 9:1-2](./01.md)). Although these events will happen in Isaiah's future, he describes them as if they have already happened. This emphasizes that they certainly will happen. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture]])

# For to us a child has been born, to us a son has been given

These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The word "us" refers to both the speaker and the hearer and so is inclusive. This can be stated in active form. AT: "For the Lord will give to us a child" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-inclusive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# the rule will be on his shoulder

His authority to rule is spoken of as if it were the robe that is a symbol of his authority. AT: "he will wear his royal robe on his shoulder" or "he will have authority to rule as king." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Counselor

one who advises kings
