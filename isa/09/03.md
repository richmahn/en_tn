# General Information:

Isaiah continues to describe the time when God will save the people of Israel. Although these events will happen in the future ([Isaiah 9:1](./01.md)), Isaiah describes them as if they have already happened. This emphasizes that they certainly will happen. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture]])

# You have multiplied the nation; you have increased their joy

The word "you" refers to Yahweh. The word "their" refers to the people of Israel, but Isaiah includes himself as part of Israel. AT: "Lord, you will greatly increase our people and our joy" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# They rejoice before you like the joy at harvest time, as men rejoice when they divide the plunder

The joy that Yahweh will give Israel is described as the same kind of joy people have when they bring in a harvest or divide valuable plunder. AT: "They will rejoice before you as people rejoice when they gather their crops or when a battle is over and soldiers divide what they took" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
