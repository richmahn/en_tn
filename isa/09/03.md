## You have multiplied the nation, you have increased their joy ##

The word "you" refers to Yahweh. The word "their" refers to the people of Israel, but Isaiah includes himself as part of Israel. AT: "Lord, you will greatly increase our people and our joy."

## they rejoice before you like the joy at harvest time, as men rejoice when they divide the plunder ##

AT: "We will rejoice before you like when people gather their crops or like when a battle is over and soldiers divide what they took."
