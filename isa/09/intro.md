# Isaiah 09 General Notes

#### Structure and formatting

This chapter begins with a prophecy that is a continuation of the prophecy concluding the previous chapter. Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 9:1-21. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]])

#### Special concepts in this chapter

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter

##### Fulfillment of prophecies
