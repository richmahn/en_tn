# To whom then will you compare me, whom do I resemble?

Yahweh uses two similar rhetorical questions to emphasize that there is no one like him. AT: "There is no one to whom you can compare me. There is no one whom I resemble." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# Who has created all these stars?

This is a leading question that anticipates the answer, Yahweh. AT: "Yahweh has created all these stars!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# He leads out their formations

Here the word "formations" refers to military formations. The prophet speaks of the stars as if they were soldiers whom Yahweh commands to appear. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# By the greatness of his might and by the strength of his power

The phrases "the greatness of his might" and "the strength of his power" form a doublet that emphasizes Yahweh's power. AT: "By his great might and powerful strength" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# not one is missing

This negative statement emphasizes the positive. AT: "every one is present" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
