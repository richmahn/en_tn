# To whom then will you compare me, whom do I resemble?

Yahweh uses two similar rhetorical questions to emphasize that there is no one like him. AT: "There is no one to whom you can compare me. There is no one whom I resemble." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
