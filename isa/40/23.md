## He reduces ##

"God reduces"

## they are barely plantedâ€¦they have barely taken root in the earth ##

Isaiah compares the rulers to a seed that is not planted firmly in the ground. This emphasizes they are insignificant before God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## the wind blows them away like straw ##

This emphasizes that God can easily defeat human rulers. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
