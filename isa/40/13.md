Isaiah continues using questions to emphasize God's endless power and wisdom (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## Who has comprehended the mind of Yahweh, or instructed him as his counselor? ##

AT: "No one knows the mind of Yahweh, and no one can give him council."

## From whom did he ever receive instruction? ##

AT: "He has never received instruction from anyone."

## Who taught him the correct way to do things, and taught him knowledge, or showed to him the way of understanding? ##

AT: "No one taught him or gave him knowledge in the correct way to do things, or helped him to understand."
