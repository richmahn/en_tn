# General Information:

Isaiah continues using questions to emphasize Yahweh's uniqueness. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Who has comprehended the mind of Yahweh, or instructed him as his counselor?

This rhetorical question anticipates a negative answer and emphasizes that no one is able to do these things. AT: "No one has comprehended the mind of Yahweh, and no one has instructed him as his counselor." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# comprehended the mind of Yahweh

Here the word "mind" refers not only to Yahweh's thoughts, but also to his desires and motivations.
