# General Information:

Isaiah continues speaking to God's people.

# Have you not known? Have you not heard? Has it not been told you from the beginning? Have you not understood from the foundations of the earth?

Isaiah uses these questions to emphasize that the people should know Yahweh's greatness as the creator. Alternate translation: "You certainly know and have heard! It has been told to you from the beginning; you have understood from the foundations of the earth!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# Has it not been told you from the beginning?

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "Have people not told you from the beginning?" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# from the foundations of the earth

The prophet speaks of Yahweh creating the earth as if the earth were a building for which Yahweh laid the foundation. Alternate translation: "from the time that Yahweh created the earth" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
