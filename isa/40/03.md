# A voice cries out

The word "voice" represents the person who cries out. AT: "Someone cries out" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# In the wilderness prepare the way of Yahweh; make straight in the Arabah a highway for our God

These two lines are parallel and mean basically the same thing. The people preparing themselves for Yahweh's help is spoken of as if they were to prepare roads for Yahweh to travel upon. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Arabah

See how you translated this word in [Isaiah 35:1](../35/01.md).
