## Why do you say, Jacob and declare, Israel ##

This says the same thing twice for emphasis. AT: "Why do you say, O people of Israel." Isaiah uses a question for emphasis. AT: "You should not say, O people of Israel" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## My way is hidden from Yahweh, and my God is not concerned about my vindication ##

"Yahweh does not see us. He is not concerned to clear our blame"

## Have you not known? Have you not heard? ##

See how you translated this in [Isaiah 40:21](./21.md).
