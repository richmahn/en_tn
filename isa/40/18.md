# To whom then will you compare God? To what idol will you liken him?

Isaiah uses two similar questions to emphasize that there is no idol that can compare with God. AT: "There is no one to whom you can compare God. There is no idol to which you can liken him." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# you

This is plural and refers to all of God's people. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
