# They are barely planted ... and they wither

The prophet speaks of rulers being helpless before Yahweh as if they were new plants that wither away when a hot wind blows on them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# They are barely planted, barely sown

These two phrases mean basically the same thing and refer to the point at which the plants or seeds are placed into the ground. They can be stated in active form. AT: "As soon as someone plants them ... as soon as someone sows them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# he blows upon them

The prophet speaks of Yahweh removing the rulers from power as if Yahweh were a scorching wind that blows upon the plants and causes them to wither. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the wind carries them away like straw

This simile extends the metaphor of the rulers as plants and Yahweh as the wind that causes them to wither. The wind of Yahweh's judgement will remove the withered plants as easily as wind blows away straw. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
