# With joy you will draw water from the wells of salvation

Isaiah speaks of people being saved as if they were getting salvation the way people get water out of well. Alternate translation: "you will rejoice when he saves you, as people rejoice when they draw water from a well" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
