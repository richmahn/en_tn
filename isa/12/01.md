Here Isaiah continues to describe what it will be like when the Branch of Jesse comes. (See: [Isaiah 11:1](../11/01.md))

## On that day ##

"On the day when God saves his people and brings them home"

## you will say ##

The word "you" refers to the people of Israel, but Isaiah includes himself as part of Israel. AT: "we will say" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

## I will give thanks to you, Yahweh. For though you were angry with me, your wrath has turned away, and you have comforted me ##

AT: "We praise and thank you, Yahweh. Now your anger is gone and you comfort us."
