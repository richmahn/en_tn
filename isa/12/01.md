# On that day

It can be stated clearly what time is being referred to. Alternate translation: "At that time" or "When the king rules" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# your wrath has turned away

God's wrath is spoken of as if it were a person that could turn away and leave. It means that God has stopped being angry. Alternate translation: "You are no longer angry with me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
