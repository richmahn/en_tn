This may be Yahweh or Isaiah speaking.

## Every one who is found will be killed, and every one who is captured will die by the sword ##

AT: "The enemy will kill everyone they find" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## Their infants also will be dashed in pieces before their eyes ##

AT: "The enemy will throw babies to the ground and kill them while their parents helplessly watch." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## Their houses will be plundered and their wives raped ##

AT: "The enemy will rob the people's houses and violently force the women to have sex with them"
