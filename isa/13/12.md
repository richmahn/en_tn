# I will make men more rare than fine gold

Why there will be so few people can be stated clearly. Alternate translation: "I will cause so many people to die that living people will be more rare than fine gold" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# men more rare than fine gold ... mankind harder to find than the pure gold of Ophir

These two phrases mean basically the same thing. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# pure gold of Ophir

Ophir was the name of a place where there was pure gold. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
