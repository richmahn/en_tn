# Her time is near, and her days will not be delayed

These two phrases mean basically the same thing. "Her time" and "her days" both refer to the time that God has chosen for Babylon to be destroyed. This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "The time that all of this will happen to the people of Babylon is near, and nothing will stop it" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
