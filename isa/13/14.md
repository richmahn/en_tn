# Like a hunted gazelle or like a sheep with no shepherd

Yahweh speaks of the defenseless people of Israel as if they were a gazelle or a sheep that was being chased by hunters or wild animals. Alternate translation: "Like gazelles that run away swiftly when people hunt them, and like sheep that have no shepherd run away from wild animals" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# gazelle

an animal that is similar to a deer. People hunt them, and wild animals sometimes attack and kill them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

# like a sheep with no shepherd

Sheep that have no shepherd have no one to protect them from wild animals that attack and kill them.
