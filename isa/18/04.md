# General Information:

God uses a parable about a farmer in a vineyard in order to describe how he will punish a certain nation. That nation is either Ethiopia or Ethiopia's enemy.

# This is what Yahweh said to me

"Yahweh said to me." Here the word "me" refers to Isaiah.

# I will quietly observe from my home

What God will observe can be stated clearly. Alternate translation: "I will quietly observe that nation from my home" or "From my home, I will quietly watch what the people of that nation do" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# like the simmering heat in sunshine, like a cloud of mist in the heat of harvest

These phrases show how quietly God will watch the nation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
