# They will be left together

God seems to change from telling the parable to speaking more directly about the nation. This can be stated clearly. AT: "Those who are killed will be left together" or "Like branches that are cut off and thrown away, the bodies of those who are killed will be left on the ground" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])

# The birds will summer on them

"The birds will eat them during the summer." The word "birds" refers to birds that eat the flesh of dead bodies.

# all the animals of the earth

"all kinds of wild animals"

# will winter on them

"will eat them in the winter"
