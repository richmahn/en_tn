# They will be left together

God seems to change from telling the parable to speaking more directly about the nation. This can be stated clearly. AT: "Those who are killed will be left together" or "Like branches that are cut off and thrown away, the bodies of those who are killed will be left on the ground" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])

# The birds will summer on them

"The birds will eat them during the summer." The word "birds" refers to birds that eat the flesh of dead bodies.

# all the animals of the earth

"all kinds of wild animals"

# will winter on them

"will eat them in the winter"

# a people tall and smooth ... a people feared far and near ... a nation strong and trampling down, whose land the rivers divide

These phrases all describe the people of one nation. See how you translated these phrases in [Isaiah 18:2](./01.md).

# a people tall and smooth

"a people who are tall and have smooth skin"

# a people feared far and near

The words "far" and "near" are used together to mean "everywhere." AT: "a people who are feared everywhere" or "a people that everyone in the earth fears" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])

# a nation strong and trampling down

Trampling down represents conquering other nations. AT: "a nation that is strong and conquers other nations" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# to the place of the name of Yahweh of hosts, to Mount Zion

The word "name" refers to Yahweh. AT: "to Mount Zion, where Yahweh of hosts dwells" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
