# Connecting Statement:

Verse 3 tells what the messengers in [Isaiah 18:2](../18/02.md) must say to the people of the world.

# All you inhabitants of the world ... you who live on the earth

These two phrases mean basically the same thing. Alternate translation: "All you people on the earth" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# when a signal is lifted up on the mountains, look; and when the trumpet is blown, listen

The signal and trumpet were to call people to battle. The commands to look and listen are commands to pay attention and prepare for battle. Alternate translation: "pay attention when the signal is lifted up on the mountains and the trumpet is blown"

# when a signal is lifted up on the mountains, look
