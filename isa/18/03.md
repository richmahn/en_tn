## All you inhabitants of the world and you dwellers on the earth ##

AT: "All you people on the earth." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## when a signal is lifted up on the mountains, look; and when the trumpet is blown, listen ##

See how you translated "signal" in [Isaiah 5:26](../05/26.md). AT: "pay attention when you see the signal flag on the mountains and when you hear the sound of the trumpet." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
