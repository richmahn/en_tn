# Blessed be Egypt, my people; Assyria, the work of my hands; and Israel, my inheritance

The names of the three nations refer to the people of those nations. This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "I have blessed you, people of Egypt, because you are my people; and I have blessed you, people of Assyria, because I created you; and I have blessed you, people of Israel, because I securely possess you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# the work of my hands
