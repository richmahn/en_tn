# Egyptians will be like women

This emphasizes that the people of Egypt will be afraid and helpless when God punishes them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# because of the upraised hand of Yahweh of hosts that he raises over them

Here "hand" refers to God's power, and raising the hand against them represents punishing them. Alternate translation: "because Yahweh of hosts has raised his powerful hand to punish them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
