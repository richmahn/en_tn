# Where then are your wise men?

Isaiah uses a question to mock the wise men. The word "your" refers to Pharaoh. AT: "You do not have any wise men." or "Your wise men are fools." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Let them tell you and make known what Yahweh of hosts plans concerning Egypt

Isaiah is implying that wise men should be able to understand God's plans, but Isaiah does not really believe they are wise. AT: "If they were really wise, they would be able to tell you what Yahweh of hosts plans concerning Egypt" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])
