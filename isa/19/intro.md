# Isaiah 19 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetry in 19:1-18.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Egypt #####

This chapter prophesied destruction against the nation of Egypt. Their destruction will come from internal division instead of being conquered by another nation. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]])

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter ####

##### Imagery #####

Some of the imagery used in this chapter may be connected to the worship of specific false gods. One important god the people of Canaan worshiped was Baal, the god of rain or storms. One of the important gods the Egyptians worshiped was Ra, the god of the sun. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/falsegod]])

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### "In that day" #####
This changes the reference from the time when Assyria comes to dominate the world and looks to a more distant future day.
