# Isaiah 56 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations indent each line of poetry to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetry in this chapter.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Gentiles #####
Many scholars believe this chapter prophesies that Gentiles will be able to come to a saving faith in Yahweh. At this time, the Israelites believed that only an Israelite could be saved. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/save]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]])

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter ####

##### Beasts #####
The Israelites are compared to beasts and dogs in this chapter. This would have been very offensive to them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
