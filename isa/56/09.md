## translationNotes

* **All you wild beasts of the field, come and devour, all you beasts in the forest** - God is calling armies of other nations to come and attack the people of Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **All their watchmen are blind** - This means Israel's leaders cannot or perhaps do not want to see what is going on in society.
* **they are all dumb dogs** - The leaders are supposed to open their mouths and warn the people, but they do not. Calling someone a dog in this society is a great insult.
* **dreaming, lying down, loving to sleep** - This means the leaders are not bringing God's word of warning to Israel.
