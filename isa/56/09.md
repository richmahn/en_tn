# All you wild beasts of the field, come and devour, all you beasts in the forest

God is calling armies of other nations by comparing them to animals to come and attack the people of Israel. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# All their watchmen are blind

This means Israel's leaders cannot or perhaps do not want to see what is going on in society.

# They are all silent dogs

The leaders are supposed to open their mouths and warn the people, but they do not. Comparing someone to a dog in this society is a great insult. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# They dream, and lying down they love to sleep

This means the leaders are not bringing God's word of warning to Israel but prefer their own comfort.
