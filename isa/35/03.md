# General Information:

Isaiah is speaking to the people of Judah.

# Strengthen the weak hands, and steady the knees that shake.

The words "weak hands" and "knees that shake" represent a person who is fearful. AT: "Strengthen those whose hands are weak and whose knees shake from fear" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# those with a fearful heart

Here people are referred to by their hearts, which emphasize their inner feelings. AT: "to those who are fearful" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# Look

This is used here to draw the listeners' attention to what is said next. AT: "Listen"

# your God will come with vengeance, with the recompense of God

This can be reworded so that the abstract nouns "vengeance" and "recompense" are expressed as the verb "punish." The words "vengeance" and "recompense" mean the same thing and emphasize that God will punish Judah's enemies. AT: "your God will punish your enemies for what they have done" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
