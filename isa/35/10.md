* **everlasting joy will be on their heads** - This uses a person's head to mean the person as a whole. This emphasizes that they will be totally joyful. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
* **gladness and joy will overtake them;  sorrow and sighing will flee away** - Isaiah describes these emotions as if they are persons who can run towards or away from God's people. This means these people will only be happy and never sad. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
