## translationNotes

* Isaiah continues speaking.
* **He saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no one to intervene** - AT: “Yahweh was appaled that no one came to help those who were suffering” or “Yahweh was astonished that no one came to help those who were suffering”
* **Therefore his own arm brought salvation for him** - "Arm" is a metaphor for "power." AT: "Yahweh used his own power to save the people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
* **and his righteousness sustained him** - God's nature is to always do what is just and right. AT: "and he did right as he always would do"
