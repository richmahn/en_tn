Isaiah continues speaking.

## He saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no one to intervene ##

AT: “Yahweh was appaled that no one came to help those who were suffering” or “Yahweh was astonished that no one came to help those who were suffering”

## Therefore his own arm brought salvation for him ##

"Arm" is a metaphor for "power." AT: "Yahweh used his own power to save the people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## and his righteousness sustained him ##

God's nature is to always do what is just and right. AT: "and he did right as he always would do"
