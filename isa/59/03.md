Isaiah continues speaking to the people of Israel.

## For your hands are stained with blood and your fingers with sin ##

Here "hands" and "fingers" refers to their actions. This means they are guilty of doing violent and sinful things. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## they conceive trouble and give birth to sin ##

This emphasizes how carefully they plan to do sinful things. Here "they" still refers to the people of Israel. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
