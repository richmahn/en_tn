# General Information:

Isaiah continues speaking to the people of Israel.

# For your hands are stained with blood and your fingers with sin

Here "hands" and "fingers" refers to their actions. This means they are guilty of doing violent and sinful things. "Your" is plural. AT: "For you have committed violent sins" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# Your lips speak lies and your tongue speaks maliciously

The parts of the body that make speech represent what people say. AT: "You speak lies and malicious things" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# they conceive trouble and give birth to sin

"Conceiving" and "giving birth" emphasize how carefully they plan to do sinful things. Here "they" still refers to the people of Israel. AT: "they work hard to do sinful things" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
