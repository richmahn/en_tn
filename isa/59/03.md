# General Information:

Isaiah continues speaking to the people of Israel.

# For your hands are stained with blood and your fingers with sin

Here "hands" and "fingers" refers to their actions. This means they are guilty of doing violent and sinful things. "Your" is plural. Alternate translation: "For you have committed violent sins" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# Your lips speak lies and your tongue speaks maliciously

The parts of the body that make speech represent what people say. Alternate translation: "You speak lies and malicious things" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
