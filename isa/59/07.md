Isaiah continues speaking to the people of Israel.

## Their feet run to evil ##

This means the wicked people are quick to do evil things. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## are their roads ##

AT: "is all they do" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## there is no justice in their paths ##

AT: "they never do what is just" or "everything they do is unjust"

## They have made crooked paths ##

This refers to people who say and do dishonest things. They are devious.
