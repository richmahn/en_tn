Isaiah continues speaking to the people of Israel.

## far from us ##

Here "us" refers to Isaiah and the people of Israel. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-inclusive]])

## We wait for light, but see darkness; we look for brightness, but we walk in darkness ##

Both of these mean basically the same thing. This means the people are waiting for God's goodness, but it seems like he has abandoned them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## We grope for the wall like the blindâ€¦like dead men ##

This means that because God is not coming to them, they feel helpless, not finding the right path and despairing of the future, with no hope for a vibrant life. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
