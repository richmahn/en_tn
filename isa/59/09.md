# General Information:

Isaiah continues speaking to the people of Israel.

# justice is far from us

Here "us" refers to Isaiah and the people of Israel. "Far" represents that justice is gone and difficult to get. AT: "justice is gone and very difficult to get" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-inclusive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# We wait for light, but see darkness; we look for brightness, but we walk in darkness

Each of these phrases means that the people are waiting for God's goodness, but it seems like he has abandoned them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# We grope for the wall like the blind ... like dead men

This means that because God is not coming to them, they feel helpless, not finding the right path and despairing of the future, with no hope for a vibrant life. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
