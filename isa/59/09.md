## translationNotes

* Isaiah continues speaking to the people of Israel.
* **far from us** - Here "us" refers to Isaiah and the people of Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive]])
* **We wait for light, but see darkness; we look for brightness, but we walk in darkness** - Both of these mean basically the same thing. This means the people are waiting for God's goodness, but it seems like he has abandoned them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **We grope for the wall like the blindâ€¦like dead men** - This means that because God is not coming to them, they feel helpless, not finding the right path and despairing of the future, with no hope for a vibrant life. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
