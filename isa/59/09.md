# General Information:

Isaiah continues speaking to the people of Israel.

# justice is far from us

Here "us" refers to Isaiah and the people of Israel. "Far" represents that justice is gone and difficult to get. AT: "justice is gone and very difficult to get" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-inclusive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# We wait for light, but see darkness; we look for brightness, but we walk in darkness

Each of these phrases means that the people are waiting for God's goodness, but it seems like he has abandoned them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
