# He put on righteousness as a breastplate and a helmet of salvation upon his head. He clothed himself with garments of vengeance and wore zeal as a mantle

"breastplate," "helmet," "garments," and "mantle" are clothing for war and fighting. Isaiah describes Yahweh as putting these on to punish his people. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# mantle

a loose, flowing robe

# He repaid them

Isaiah is describing a future event as if it happened in the past. This means that it will certainly happen.
