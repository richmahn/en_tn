# General Information:

Isaiah continues speaking.

# fear the name of Yahweh

Here "name" refers to Yahweh's reputation and character. AT: "fear Yahweh" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# from the west ... from the sun's rising

Isaiah combines these words to mean people in all places of the world. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])

# for he will come as a rushing stream

Narrow valleys in Judah were dry most of the year until a sudden, heavy rain turned them into fast-moving water. When that happened there was a lot of noise and wind. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# driven by the breath of Yahweh

This can be stated in active form. AT: "which the breath of Yahweh drives" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# this is Yahweh's declaration

Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. Translate as in [Isaiah 30:1](../30/01.md). AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
