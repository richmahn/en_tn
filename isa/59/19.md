Isaiah continues speaking.

## the name of Yahweh ##

Here "name" refers to Yahweh's reputation and character. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## from the westâ€¦from the sun's rising ##

Isaiah combines these words to mean people in all places of the world. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])

## for he will come as a rushing stream ##

Narrow valleys in Judah were dry most of the year until a sudden, heavy rain turned them into fast-moving water. When that happened there was a lot of noise and wind. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

## driven by the breath of Yahweh ##

AT: "which the breath of Yahweh drives" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## declaration of Yahweh ##

See how you translated this in [Isaiah 14:21](../14/21.md).
