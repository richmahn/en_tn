# General Information:

Isaiah continues speaking to the people of Israel about the evil they do using the metaphors of poisonous snakes and spider's webs.

# They hatch eggs of a poisonous snake

Eggs of a poisonous snake hatch into more dangerous snakes. "Poisonous snakes" represents evil the people do that harms more and more. Alternate translation: "They make evil that spreads out to make more evil" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# weave a spider's web

This represents the deeds of the people that are useless. Alternate translation: "produce things and activities that are useless" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Whoever eats of their eggs dies, and if an egg is crushed, it hatches into a poisonous snake

Eating a poisonous egg will kill the one that eats it and represents self-destruction. Breaking the egg allows the young poisonous snake to hatch and represents spreading destruction. Alternate translation: "The activities they do will destroy them and will spread destruction to others" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# if an egg is crushed

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "if someone crushes an egg" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
