## translationNotes

* Isaiah continues speaking to the people of Israel.
* **They hatch eggs of a poisonous snakeâ€¦weave a spider's web** - The people of Judah were so wicked that they made plans to endanger and harm others. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **Whoever eats of their eggs dies, and if an egg is crushed, it hatches into a poisonous snake** - This means the wicked people's sins will always harm other people.
* **if an egg is crushed** - AT: "if someone crushes an egg" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
* **Their webs cannot be used for garments, nor can they cover themselves with their works** - This means their sinful deeds cannot be covered and hidden, just as a web cannot serve as as clothing and cover someone. Their evil deeds will be exposed.
* **Their webs cannot be used for garments** - AT: "They cannot clothe themselves with their webs"
