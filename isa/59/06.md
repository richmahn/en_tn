# Their webs cannot be used for garments, nor can they cover themselves with their works

This means their sinful deeds cannot be covered and hidden, just as a web cannot serve as clothing and cover someone. Alternate translation: "Their evil deeds will be exposed as useless" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Their webs cannot be used for garments

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "They cannot clothe themselves with their webs" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# deeds of violence are in their hands

"Hands" represents the ability and power to do these things and therefore their responsibility. Alternate translation: "they are fully responsible for the violence they do" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
