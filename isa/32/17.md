# The work of righteousness will be peace; and the result of righteousness, quietness and confidence forever

These two phrases are parallel and both give results of righteousness. These can be combined. AT: "The result of people acting righteously is that there will be peace, and quietness, and confidence forever" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
