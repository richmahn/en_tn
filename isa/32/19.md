See how you translated this in [Isaiah 28:2](../28/01.md).

# the forest is destroyed, and the city is completely annihilated

This can be stated in active form. AT: "it destroys the forest and completely destroys the city" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# you who sow beside all the streams will be blessed, you who send out your ox and donkey to graze

This can be stated in active form. This refers to Yahweh blessing all of his people and speaks of the things that are normal for his people to do. AT: "Yahweh will bless you, as you plant your crops in fields alongside the streams and as you send out your ox and donkey to graze in the pasture" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
