Isaiah continues speaking.

## justice will reside...righteousness will live ##

Isaiah describes "justice" and "righteousness" as a person who lives in these places. This means the people who live in these places will do what is just and right. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
