# General Information:

Isaiah continues speaking.

# justice will reside ... righteousness will live

Isaiah describes "justice" and "righteousness" as a person who lives in these places. This means the people who live in these places will do what is just and right. AT: "people will act justly in the wilderness and people will act righteously in the fertile fields (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# The work of righteousness will be peace; and the result of righteousness, quietness and confidence forever

These two phrases are parallel and both give results of righteousness. These can be combined. AT: "The result of people acting righteously is that there will be peace, and quietness, and confidence forever" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
