Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.

## To whom will you compare me? And whom do I resemble, so that we may be compared? ##

Yahweh uses questions to emphasize that there is no one like him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## so that we may be compared ##

AT: "so that you may compare us" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
