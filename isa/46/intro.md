# Isaiah 46 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations set each line of poetry farher to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetry in this chapter.

##### Yahweh and the false gods #####
This chapter is intended to compare Yahweh with various false Gods whom the Israelites worship. There really is no comparison at all because Yahweh alone is God. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/falsegod]])
