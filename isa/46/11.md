# I call a bird of prey from the east

Yahweh speaks of Cyrus as if he were "a bird of prey." As a bird swiftly captures its prey, so Cyrus will swiftly accomplish Yahweh's purpose to conquer the nations. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# I have spoken; I will also accomplish it; I have purposed, I will also do it.

This repeats the same idea for emphasis. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
