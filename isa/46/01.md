# Bel bows down, Nebo stoops; their idols ... for weary animals

Isaiah speaks of people placing the idols of Bel and Nebo into a cart for animals to transport as if these gods were made to "bow down" and "stoop." These are both postures of humiliation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Bel ... Nebo

These were the two primary gods whom the Babylonians worshiped. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# their idols

the idols that represented Bel and Nebo

# they cannot rescue the images

"Bel and Nebo cannot rescue their images"

# they themselves have gone off into captivity

Isaiah speaks of people carrying off these idols as if the false gods whom they represent are being carried off to captivity. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
