# my salvation does not wait

Yahweh speaks of saving his people soon as if his salvation were a person who does not wait to act. The abstract noun "salvation" can be translated with a verb. Alternate translation: "I will not wait to save you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
