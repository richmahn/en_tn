# General Information:

Yahweh continues speaking to his people.

# I announce the end from the beginning, and beforehand what has not yet happened

This basically repeats the same idea for emphasis. The verb from the first phrase may be supplied for the second. AT: "I announce the end from the beginning, and I announce beforehand what has not yet happened" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
