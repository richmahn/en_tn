Yahweh continues speaking to his people.

## I announce the end from the beginning, and beforehand what has not yet happened ##

This basically repeats the same idea for emphasis. AT: “I know all things before they happen.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## I call a bird of prey from the east ##

The "bird of prey" is a reference to Cyrus, King of Persia who is strong and powerful like an eagle. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## I have spoken; I will also accomplish it; I have purposed, I will also do it. ##

This basically repeats the same idea for emphasis.
