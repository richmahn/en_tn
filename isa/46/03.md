## Listen to me ##

Here "me" refers to Yahweh.

## who have been carried...I will carry you to safety ##

In 46:3-4 Yahweh talks to the people of Israel as if they were a single person who is born and grows old. This means God has taken care of them since their people first started and he will always continue to take care of them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## who have been carried by me ##

AT: "whom I have carried" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
