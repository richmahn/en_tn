# General Information:

Yahweh continues speaking to those in Israel who worship idols.

# destine you for the sword

"The sword" represents various weapons of war that Yahweh will use to punish those who do not respond to Yahweh's call. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# when I called, you did not answer; when I spoke, you did not listen

Both clauses mean the same and are repeated for emphasis. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
