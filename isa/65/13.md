# General Information:

Yahweh continues speaking to those in Israel who worship idols.

# Look, my servants

"Take notice and pay attention" Yahweh repeats this for emphasis. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# but you will cry because of the pain of the heart, and will wail because of the crushing of the spirit

These clauses mean the same and the repetition is for emphasis. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# crushing of the spirit

This expression compares the feeling of terrible disappointment and sorrow to something becoming deformed due to high pressure. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
