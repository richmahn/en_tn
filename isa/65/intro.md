# Isaiah 65 General Notes

#### Structure and formatting

Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in this chapter.

This chapter is Yahweh's response to the repentance of the people. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/repent]])

#### Special concepts in this chapter

##### Judgment and hope
This chapter records that Yahweh's judgment on the people must come. Despite this, there is hope that in the end, Yahweh will make all things new and restore them to himself. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/judge]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/hope]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/restore]])
