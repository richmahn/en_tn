Yahweh continues speaking.

## the former things will not be remembered or be brought to mind ##

Both of these phrases mean the same thing and are combined for emphasis. AT: "you will not even think about what happened in the past." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## But you will be glad ##

Here "you" refers to all of God's servants.
