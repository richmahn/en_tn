# General Information:

Yahweh continues speaking.

# For see

"Notice! Pay attention!"

# new heavens and a new earth

Both are extremes that also represent everything between. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])

# the former things will not be remembered or be brought to mind

Both of these clauses mean the same thing and are combined for emphasis. This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "you will not even think about what happened in the past" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
