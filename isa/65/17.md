## translationNotes

* Yahweh continues speaking.
* **the former things will not be remembered or be brought to mind** - Both of these phrases mean the same thing and are combined for emphasis. AT: "you will not even think about what happened in the past." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
* **But you will be glad** - Here "you" refers to all of God's servants.
