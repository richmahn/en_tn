Yahweh continues speaking to those in Israel who worship idols.

## will be blessed by me, the God of truth ##

AT: "I, the God who always speaks the truth, will bless him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## because the former troubles will be forgotten, for they will be hidden from my eyes ##

AT: "because their troubles will be gone, and I will not even think about them again" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
