# General Information:

Yahweh continues speaking about the people of Israel.

# Look, it is written

"Take notice and pay attention"

# into their laps

This means God will punish them to the fullest extent. This expression compares Yahweh punishing the people to dumping on their legs as they are sitting. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
