# They will spread their hands ... his hands to swim

This simile emphasizes how badly Yahweh will humiliate the people of Moab. They will spread their hands in dung like a swimmer spreads his hands in water. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# They will spread their hands in the midst of it

"The people of Moab will push their hands through the dung"

# as a swimmer spreads his hands to swim

"as if they were swimming"

# will bring down their pride

Yahweh humiliating a proud person is spoken of as if pride were something high and Yahweh would cause it to be low. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# in spite of the skill of their hands

Here "hands" represents the power to do or make something. Alternate translation: "in spite of the great things they have built" or "in spite of the great things they have done" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
