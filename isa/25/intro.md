# Isaiah 25 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations set each line of poetry further to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetry in this chapter.

This chapter shifts from being a prophecy against the nations to the personal praises of Isaiah. He praises Yahweh for the deliverance of his people. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/deliverer]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/peopleofgod]])

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Reign of the Messiah #####
This chapter appears to prophesy about a time of restoration when the messiah will reign. This chapter pictures a time of great peace and harmony in the world. The translator should not add explanation, but should try to maintain the tense of the original text, as a future or uncompleted action. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/restore]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/christ]])
