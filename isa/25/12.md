# Your high fortress walls he will bring down to the ground, to the dust

This speaks of Yahweh causing armies to bring down the walls as if he himself were going to bring them down. Alternate translation: "He will send an army to bring your high fortress walls to the ground, to the dust" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# Your high fortress

Here "Your" refers to the people of Moab. It can be stated in third person to be consistent with the previous verse. Alternate translation: "Their high fortress" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
