## Yahweh of Hosts ##

See how you translated this in [Isaiah 1:9](../01/09.md).

## a feast on the lees ##

"the oldest wine." This means the best wine.

## the covering over all peoples, the web woven over all the nations ##

Isaiah compares death, suffering, and sadness to a dark cloud or web that covers everyone on the earth. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
