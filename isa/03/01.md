# See

The word "see" here adds emphasis to what follows. It can also be translated as "Listen" or "Indeed."

# support and staff

Both of these words refer to a walking stick, on which someone leans for support. This idea here stands for the things that people need the most in order to live: food and water. AT: "everything that supports you" or "everything that you depend on" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
