# Connecting Statement:

The prophet begins to comment on this situation.

# Jerusalem has stumbled, and Judah has fallen

Disobeying God is spoken of as if it were stumbling and falling. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the eyes of his glory

Here "the eyes" stands for God himself, who is glorious. AT: "him who is glorious" or "Yahweh who is glorious" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# The look on their faces witnesses against them

Expressions of arrogance on people's faces are spoken of as if the expressions were persons who could testify against the proud people. AT: "The prideful looks on their faces show that they oppose Yahweh" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# they tell of their sin like Sodom; they do not hide it

Here the people of Judah are said to be like the people of Sodom, because they openly boasted about their sins. AT: "like the people of Sodom, they talk about their sins and let everyone know about them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# For they have completed a catastrophe for themselves

The catastrophe is still coming, but the people have finished doing what will cause it to come. The catastrophe's causes are spoken of here as if they were the catastrophe itself. AT: "For they have done everything that will cause a catastrophe to happen" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
