## For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah has fallen ##

Often in prophecy things that will happen in the future are described as something that has already happened. This emphasizes that these things will certainly happen. This can be translated as "For Jerusalem will certainly come to ruin, and Judah will certainly fall" or "God will cause Jerusalem and Judah to be destroyed."

## The look on their faces witnesses against them ##

"The prideful looks on their faces show that they oppose Yahweh."

## they tell of their sin like Sodom; they do not hide it ##

Here God compares the people of Judah with the people of Sodom who were not ashamed of their sin. This could be translated as “like the people of Sodom, they talk about their sins and let everyone see them.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
