# Connecting Statement:

The prophet begins to comment on this situation.

# Jerusalem has stumbled, and Judah has fallen

Disobeying God is spoken of as if it were stumbling and falling. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the eyes of his glory

Here "the eyes" stands for God himself, who is glorious. Alternate translation: "him who is glorious" or "Yahweh who is glorious" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
