# the mighty man ... the warrior ... the judge ... the prophet ... the one who practices divination ... the elder

This is a list of categories of people that others depend on. Since they do not refer to particular individuals, they can all be translated with plural nouns as in the UDB. Alternate translation: "the mighty men ... the warriors ... the judges ... the prophets ... the ones who practices divination ... the elders" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])

# the one who practices divination

This is a person who claims that he can tell the future by looking at things like animal parts and leaves. See how you translated similar words in [Isaiah 2:6](../02/06.md).
