Yahweh continues speaking.

## Tell the righteous that it will be well with him ##

"Tell those who are doing what is right that I will make things good for them"

## for they will eat the fruit of their deeds ##

"for they will receive their reward for their good deeds" or "for they will receive their reward for the good things they have done."

## for what his hands have dealt out he will receive ##

"for what the wicked person has done to others will be done to him."

## children are their oppressors ##

Possible meanings are 1) "Young people have become their leaders and they oppress the people" or 2) "Their leaders are immature like children and oppress the people." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## women rule over them ##

Possible meanings are 1) "women rule over the people" or 2) "their leaders are weak like women."

## your leaders lead you astray and confuse the direction of your path ##

This compares Judah's leaders to shepherds. As shepherds lead the sheep along good paths to safety, leaders should teach the people the truth and help them do what is right. Judah's leaders were not doing this. Alternate translation: "your leaders are like bad shepherds who lead you away from good paths and do not show you where to go."
