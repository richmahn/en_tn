# Isaiah 03 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

This chapter is a continuation of the material in the previous chapter. Some translations set each line of poetry farher to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetry in 3:1-26, which is a vision Isaiah receives. These are the words of Yahweh.

##### Judgment #####
This chapter is structured as a judgment against the Jews. God is acting as a judge reading the list of convictions against them and then he reads the judgment. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/judge]])

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Exile #####
While the previous part of the prophecy in chapter 2 discussed the last days, this part of the prophecy predicts the exile of Judah to Babylon. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lastday]])
