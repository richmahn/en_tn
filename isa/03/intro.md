# Isaiah 03 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

This chapter is a continuation of the material in the previous chapter. Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 2:2-3:26, which is a vision Isaiah receives. These are the words of Yahweh.

##### Judgment #####
This chapter is structured as a judgment against the Jews. God is acting as a judge reading the list of convictions against them and then he reads the judgment. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/judge]])

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Exile #####
While the previous part of the prophecy in chapter 2 discussed the last days, this part of the prophecy predicts the exile of Judah to Babylon. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lastday]])
