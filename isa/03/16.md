# the daughters of Zion

Zion, meaning here the city of Jerusalem, is spoken of as if it were a woman with her daughters. AT: "the women of Zion" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# with their necks extended

"in an arrogant way""

# with flirting eyes

Looking at men in a way that makes the men think the women want sexual relations.

# walking with tiny steps as they go

This is how they would walk to attract men, possibly because the bracelets on their ankles were connected by chains decorated with bells so they could not take normal steps.
