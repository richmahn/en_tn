# Yahweh stands up for an accusation; he is standing to accuse the people

Isaiah speaks of Yahweh's decision to harm the people as if Yahweh were bringing a legal accusation in a courtroom against the people of Israel. The second part of this line means the same thing as the first part, but it says it a little more completely. AT: "It is as though Yahweh had taken his place in a courtroom and were ready to accuse the people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
