# Your men will fall by the sword, and your strong men will fall in war

Falling represents being killed, and the sword represents battle. Alternate translation: "Your men will be killed in battle, and your strong men will be killed in war" or "Enemies will kill your soldiers in battle" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
