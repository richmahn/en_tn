# Connecting Statement:

This continues to speak about the people of Israel as if they were a vineyard (See: [Isaiah 27:2-3](./01.md)).

# I am not angry, Oh, that there were briers and thorns! In battle I would march against them

"I am not angry. If there were briers and thorns I would march against them in battle"

# I am not angry

It is understood that Yahweh is not angry with his people any longer. AT: "I am not angry with my people any longer" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# that there were briers and thorns

The enemies of the people of Israel are spoken of as if they were briers and thorns growing in the vineyard. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# briers and thorns

See how you translated this phrase in [Isaiah 5:6](../05/05.md).

# In battle I would march against them

Yahweh fighting his enemies is spoken of as if he were a warrior in an army. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# I would march against them; I would burn them all together

Here Isaiah combines different images to speak of Yahweh's enemies. He speaks of them as if they are briers and thorns but also as soldiers in an army. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# unless they grasp my protection

This can be reworded so that the abstract noun "protection" is expressed as the verb "protect." AT: "unless they ask me to protect them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# make peace with me; let them make peace with me

"they ask to live peacefully with me; I want them to live peacefully with me"
