Isaiah is speaking. He continues to describe the people of Israel as a vineyard. (See: [Isaiah 27:1](./01.md))

## In the coming day ##

AT: "In the future" or "In a time that is coming"

## Jacob will take root; Israel will blossom and bud ##

"Jacob" and "Israel" here refer to the descendants of Jacob. In the time when God is no longer angry with them he will bless them and cause them to prosper. AT: "the descendants of Israel will prosper like a vine that has taken root and blossomed." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## they will fill the surface of the ground with fruit ##

AT: "and they will fill the earth with their fruit"
