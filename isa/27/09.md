## So in this way ##

AT: "By sending them away into exile"

## the iniquity of Jacob will be atoned for ##

AT: "Yahweh will atone for the sins of the people of Israel" or "Yahweh will provide a payment for the sins of the people of Israel" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## for this will be the full fruit of turning away from his sin ##

AT: "for this is what will happen when Yahweh removes their sin"

## He will make all the the altar stones as chalk and pulverized, and no Asherah poles or incense altars will remain standing ##

AT: "They will completely destroy all the altars to false gods and remove all the Asherah idols."
