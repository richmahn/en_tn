# When the boughs ... not a people of understanding

The people becoming so weak because they disobey Yahweh so that enemies can easily destroy them is spoken of as if they are dry branches that women break off of a tree. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# When the boughs are withered, they will be broken off. Women will come and make fires with them

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "When the branches wither, women will come and break them off and make fires with them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# this is not a people of understanding

This can be made more explicit. Alternate translation: "this is not a people who understands Yahweh or his law" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# a people

Possible meanings are 1) "people" refers to the people of Israel or 2) "people" refers the people of foreign nations who oppress the people of Israel.

# Therefore their Maker will not have compassion on them, and he who made them will not be merciful to them

Both clauses mean the same thing. Alternate translation: "Because they do not understand, Yahweh, the one who made them, will not be merciful to them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
