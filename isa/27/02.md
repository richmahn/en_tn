# A vineyard of wine, sing of it

"Sing about the vineyard of wine." This speaks about the people of Israel as if they were a vineyard that produced fruit. Alternate translation: "Sing about the people of Israel as if they were a vineyard that produced grapes for wine" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
