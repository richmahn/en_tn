## Awake, awake ##

These words are repeated for emphasis and shows urgency, to arouse the people of Israel, not to //literally//  wake them from sleep. It is unclear who is speaking. It could be the people of Israel, Isaiah, or the servant.

## clothe yourself with strength ##

AT: "show your strength" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## arm of Yahweh ##

The speaker appeals to Yahweh's arm, which represents his power. AT: "O powerful Yahweh" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

## Is it not you who crushed the sea monster, you who pierced the dragon? ##

The speaker uses a question to emphasize Yahweh's power to do mighty things. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## the sea monster … the dragon ##

Both of these mean the same thing. They refer to Rahab, a mythological serpent that lives in the sea, which can symbolize the nation of Egypt, or it can symbolize evil and chaos.

## Did you not dry up the sea … for the redeemed to pass through? ##

Again, the speaker uses questions to emphasize Yahweh's power to do mighty things. This refers to Yahweh opening the Red Sea for the Israelites to cross and escape the army of Egypt.
