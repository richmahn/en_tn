Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.

## I will put it into the hand of your tormentors ##

"I will put the cup of staggering into the hands of those who hurt you." This means God will now punish the enemies of Israel. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## you made your back like the ground and like the street for them to walk on ##

AT: "you lay in the streets so your enemies could walk on your backs" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
