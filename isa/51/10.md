# Did you not dry up the sea ... for the redeemed to pass through?

Again, the speaker uses questions to emphasize Yahweh's power to do mighty things. This refers to Yahweh opening the Red Sea for the Israelites to cross and escape the army of Egypt. Alternate translation: "You dried up the sea ... for the redeemed to pass through." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
