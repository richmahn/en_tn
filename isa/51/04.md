# General Information:

Yahweh speaks to the people of Israel.

# Be attentive to me ... listen to me

These two phrases mean the same thing. Together they strengthen the command to listen. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# I will make my justice to be a light for the nations

Here God's justice represents his law, and a light represents knowledge of what is right. This means the people of the nations will understand and obey God's law. Alternate translation: "my law will teach the nations what is right" or "the nations will know my law" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
