Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.

## Be attentive to me, my people; and listen to me, my people ##

These mean the same thing and are combined for emphasis. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## and I will make my justice to be a light for the nations ##

This means the people of the nations will understand and obey God's law. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## My righteousness is near ##

This means God will soon fulfill his promises to the people of Israel.

## my arm ##

Here "arm" refers Yahweh's power. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
