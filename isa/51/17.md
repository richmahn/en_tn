## Awake, awake, stand up, Jerusalem ##

The word "awake" is repeated for emphasis and shows urgency, to arouse the people of Israel, not to //literally//  wake them from sleep. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe]])

## you drank the bowl of Yahweh's anger from his hand ##

This compares the people of Israel who fully experienced God's anger and punishment to a person who drinks all the wine in a bowl.

## the bowl of staggering ##

This compares the people of Israel, who experienced Yahweh's punishment to the full, to a wine drinker who stumbles and falls down. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## There is no one among all the sons â€¦ to take her by the hand ##

These two clauses mean the same thing. Yahweh is describing the city of Jerusalem as if it were a mother and the people were her children. Here there are no children left to help their mother. This emphasizes how helpless the people were after God punished them.
