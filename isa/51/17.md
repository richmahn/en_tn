## Awake, awake, stand up, Jerusalem ##

The word "awake" is repeated for emphasisand shows urgency, to arouse the people of Israel, not to //literally// wake them from sleep. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe]])

## you who drank from the hand of Yahweh the cup of his anger … you drained it ##

This compares a person who drinks all the wine out of a cup and so cannot walk steadily to the people of Israel who fully experienced God's anger and punishment. This emphasizes how completely God punished the people. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## There is no one among all the sons … to take her by the hand ##

These two clauses mean the same thing. Yahweh is describing the city of Jerusalem as if it were a mother and the people were her children. Here there are no children left to help their mother. This emphasizes how helpless the people were after God punished them.
