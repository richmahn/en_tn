# General Information:

Isaiah continues speaking to the people of Israel.

# you oppressed one and drunken one

Yahweh uses the word "one" here to refer to all of the oppressed people. Alternate translation: "you oppressed people and drunken people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# drunken one, but not drunk with wine

This speaks of the people acting drunk because they are suffering as if they have become drunk from being forced to drink the bowl of Yahweh's anger. Alternate translation: "you who are drunk from drinking the wine of the bowl of Yahweh's anger" or "you who act drunk, because you have suffered greatly" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
