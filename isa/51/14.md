Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.

## The one who is bent down ##

This refers to the people of Israel who are prisoners and forced to work for the Babylonians.

## nor will he lack bread ##

AT: "nor will he lack food"

## Yahweh of hosts ##

See how you translated this in [Isaiah 1:9](../01/09.md).
