## Listen to me ##

Here "me" is Yahweh.

## look at the rock from which you were chiseled and to the quarry from which you were cut ##

Both phrases mean basically the same thing. This refers to a person cutting out smaller stones from a large rock to use for building. God compares this to Abraham and Sarah through whom he made the nation of Israel. AT: "Think about your ancestors who are like the rock from which I chiseled you and made you a nation."
