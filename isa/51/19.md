* **desolation and destruction** - "your enemies have left your city empty and ruined"
* **and the famine and the sword** - "and many of you have died from hunger and war"
* **like an antelope in a net** - This means their children are completely helpless like an animal in a trap. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
