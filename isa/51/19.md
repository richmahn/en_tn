# General Information:

Isaiah continues speaking to the people of Israel.

# who will grieve with you? ... Who will comfort you?

Isaiah uses questions to emphasize that now there is no one to weep with them or comfort them. These questions may be written as statements. Alternate translation: "but there is no one to grieve with you ... There is no one to comfort you." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# These two troubles

The two troubles refer to the following two phrases: "desolation and destruction" and "the famine and the sword."

# desolation and destruction

These words have similar meanings and emphasize the destruction of the land caused by the opposing army. Alternate translation: "your enemies have left your city empty and ruined" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# the famine and the sword

The words "famine" and "sword" describe the trouble that will come upon the people. The "sword" refers to "war." Alternate translation: "many of you have died from hunger and war" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
