Isaiah continues speaking to the people of Israel.

## who will grieve with you...who will console you? ##

Isaiah uses questions to emphasize that now there is no one to weep with them or comfort them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## desolation and destruction ##

"your enemies have left your city empty and ruined"

## and the famine and the sword ##

"and many of you have died from hunger and war"

## like an antelope in a net ##

This means their children are completely helpless like an animal in a trap. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

## antelope ##

an animal with horns that runs very fast (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
