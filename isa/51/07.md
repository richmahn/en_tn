Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.

## nor be disheartened by their abuse ##

AT: "and do not lose your courage when they hurt you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## For the moth will eat them up like a garment, and the worm will eat them like wool ##

This means that God will destroy perhaps slowly but surely those who insult his people. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
