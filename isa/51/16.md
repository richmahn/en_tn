## I have placed my words in your mouth ##

Here "I" refers to Yahweh and "your" refers to his servant. AT: "I have told you what to say" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

## and I have covered you in the shadow of my hand ##

AT: "and my power has kept you safe"

## that I may plant the heavens ##

This means the same as "stretch out the heavens." Here it emphasizes God's power to restore the heavens in the future. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Isaiah 40:21](../40/21.md).

## lay the foundations of the earth ##

This emphasizes God's power to restore the earth in the future. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Isaiah 24:17](../24/17.md).
