# Jeremiah 03 General Notes

#### Structure and formatting

Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 3:1-5, 12-17, 19-25.

The prophecy revealed to Jeremiah is recorded in 2:1-3:5. Despite covering more than one chapter, this should be seen as one unit. The same is true for 3:19-4:3. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/reveal]])

#### Special concepts in this chapter

##### Judah told to repent

If Judah repents, God will bring the people back from the captivity into which he is going to send them. In this book, "Israel" serves as another name Judah because the northern kingdom of Israel no longer exists. The people group formed by these ten tribes had been scattered among the other nations by the Assyrians, who had conquered them. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/repent]])

##### Adultery
Judah's faithlessness to God is often pictured as adultery. This is a common image in Scripture. When Judah does not worship God, their nation is spoken of as if it were a woman unfaithful to her husband. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/adultery]])
