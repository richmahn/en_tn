# Acknowledge your iniquity

"Admit how you have sinned." God was speaking to Israel.

# you have shared your ways with strangers under every leafy tree!

The word "strangers" refers to foreign gods. God speaks of Israel worshiping foreign gods as if Israel were a woman who was having sex with strangers. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# under every leafy tree

People would worship idols under trees. The word "every" is a generalization used to show that the people of Israel worshiped many gods under many different trees. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# this is Yahweh's declaration

Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 1:8](../01/08.md). AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
