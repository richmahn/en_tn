* **Is she not completely unclean?** - AT: "She is completely unclean." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **That woman is this the people of this land!** - "This land is like that woman!" That is, Yahweh taking the people of Judah back is like a man taking back the wife he earlier divorced. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
* **You have acted like a prostitute** - "You have given your love and trust to idols the way a prostitute gives her body to men not her husband" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
