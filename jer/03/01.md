Yahweh continues speaking in the previous chapter, Jeremiah 2

## Is she not completely unclean? ##

AT: "She is completely unclean." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## That woman is this the people of this land! ##

"This land is like that woman!" That is, Yahweh taking the people of Judah back is like a man taking back the wife he earlier divorced. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

## You have acted like a prostitute ##

"You have given your love and trust to idols the way a prostitute gives her body to men not her husband" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

## do you want to return to me? ##

AT: "I will not accept you when you try to come back to me." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## This is Yahwehâ€™s declaration ##

See how you translated this idea in [Jeremiah 1:7](../01/07.md).

## Lift up your eyes ##

"Look up" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

## Where have you not been ravished? ##

"You are like a woman who goes everywhere and lets men seize her and sleep with her!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
