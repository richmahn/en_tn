## translationNotes

* **So why  do you accuse me of doing wrong? All of you have sinned against me** - AT: "Israel you claim that I was wrong when I did not rescue you when you called on me,  even though you continue to sin against me." (See:[[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
* **destructive** - capable of causing a very large amount of damage
* **You who belong to this generation! Pay attention to my word, the word of Yahweh! Have I been a wilderness to Israel? Or a land of deep darkness? Why would my people say, “Let us wander around. We will not go to you anymore”?** - AT: "House of Judah, you must pay attention to what I say to you.  I never abandoned you in the desert or left you in very dark land. Why do you say, "We can go where we want to go and not worship Yahweh anymore."?" (See:[[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **wander** - move around or go to different places usually without any particular purpose or direction
