# Jeremiah 02 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations indent each line of poetry to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetry in 2:1-31.

The prophecy revealed to Jeremiah is recorded in 2:1-3:5. Despite covering more than one chapter, this should be seen as one unit. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/reveal]])

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### The people refuse to learn #####

The people worshiped other gods, particularly the fertility gods of Baal and Ashtoreth. Even when the nation was punished, the people did not learn. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/falsegod]])

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter ####

##### Metaphor #####

Israel is compared to a female camel or a wild donkey for being unstable and lustful. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
