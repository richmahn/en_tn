* **What did your fathers find wrong with me, that they went far from following me? That they went after useless idols and became useless themselves?** - AT: "I did nothing wrong to your forefathers, so they have offended me by no longer obeying me and by starting to worship useless idols and becoming useless themselves!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **useless** - "worthless"
* **Where is Yahweh, who brought us ...? Where is Yahweh, who led us ...?** - "We should learn what Yahweh wants us to do. He is the one who brought us ..., and he is the one who led us ...."
