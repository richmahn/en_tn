# For I broke your yoke that you had in ancient days; I tore your fetters off you. Still you said, 'I will not serve!'

Here "broke your yoke" and "tore your fetters off you" are metaphors for setting them free from slavery. The people of Israel had been slaves in Egypt. AT: "Long ago I released you from slavery, but still you refused to worship me!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# fetters

chains used to restrain a person or an animal

# since you bowed down on every high hill and beneath every leafy tree, you adulterer

What they bowed down to can be stated clearly. Here "adulterer" is a metaphor for someone who is unfaithful to God. AT: "You bowed down to idols and worshiped them instead of me, like an adulterous wife who is unfaithful to her husband" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
