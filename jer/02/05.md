# What did your fathers find wrong with me, that they went far from following me? That they went after useless idols and became useless themselves?

Yahweh uses these questions to say that since he has done no wrong, his people should not have rejected him and worshiped idols. AT: "I did nothing wrong to your forefathers, so they should not have gone far from following me, and they should not have gone after useless idols. By doing that they themselves have become useless!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# they went far from following me

This represents rejecting God and refusing to be loyal to him. AT: "they rejected me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# they went after useless idols

This represents choosing to be loyal to idols and worship them. AT: "they worshiped useless idols" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# useless idols

idols that people can use for nothing good. The translation should not make people think that there are some idols that are useful.
