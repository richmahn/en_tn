# The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,

This idiom is used to introduce a special message from God. See how you translated similar words in [Jeremiah 1:4](../01/04.md). Alternate translation: "Yahweh gave me a message. He said," or "Yahweh spoke this message to me:" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
