# I planted you as a choice vine, completely from pure seed

God speaks of making his people into a great nation in Canaan as if they were the seed of a grapevine that he had planted. Alternate translation: "I, Yahweh, started you with a very good beginning, like a farmer who uses excellent seed to plant the best kind of vine" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# a choice vine

"a vine of very good quality"

# completely from pure seed

Here "pure seed" is the best seed that has not been mixed with seed that is not good. Alternate translation: "that grew from excellent seed"

# How then have you have changed yourself into a corrupt, worthless vine?

God uses this question to rebuke his people for changing and becoming like a corrupt worthless vine. Alternate translation: "But you have changed yourself into a corrupt, worthless vine!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
