AT: "You act as though I have been like a wilderness or a land of deep darkness to you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Why would my people say, 'Let us wander around, we will not go to you anymore'?

God uses this question to rebuke his people for saying this. AT: "You my people say 'We can go where we want to go and not worship Yahweh anymore.'" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
