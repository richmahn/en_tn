# These are the ones who say to the tree, 'You are my father,' and to the stone, 'You gave birth to me.'

Here "tree" and "stone" represent idols carved from wood and stone. These words emphasize that the idol was made of ordinary things and is not worthy of worship. Alternate translation: "These people are the ones who say to a carved piece of wood, 'You are my father,' and to a carved stone, 'You gave birth to me.'" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# their back faces me and not their faces

"their backs are toward me; their faces are not toward me." This represents them rejecting God. Alternate translation: "they have turned away from me" or "they have turned their backs toward me and not their faces" or "they have completely rejected me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Arise and save us

It can be made clear that they say this to Yahweh. "Yahweh, come and save us" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
