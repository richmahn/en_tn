# The blood that was the life of innocent, poor people has been found on your clothes

Blood on their clothes was evidence that they had killed people. Alternate translation: "The blood of innocent, poor people on your clothes shows that you are guilty of killing them" or "You are guilty of killing poor and innocent people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# The blood that was the life

"The blood that represents the life"

# These people were not discovered in acts of burglary

If they found people in an act of burglary, this might have been an excuse for killing them. But the people that they murdered were innocent. This can be translated in active form. Alternate translation: "You did not discover these people stealing things" or "But you killed them even though they were not even stealing anything" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
