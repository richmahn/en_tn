# Did you not do this to yourselves when you abandoned Yahweh your God, while he was leading you along the way?

Yahweh uses this question to remind Israel that it is their own fault that their enemies attacked them. Alternate translation: "You caused this yourselves by abandoning Yahweh your God while he was leading you along the way." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
