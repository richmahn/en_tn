# How well you make your way to look for love

God appears to be praising his people for looking for love, but this is irony. He was showing that he was angry with them for being unfaithful to him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])

# to look for love

God speaks of his people worshiping other gods as if they were a woman who is unfaithful to her husband and is looking for other men to love her. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# You have even taught your ways to wicked women

God speaks of how unfaithful his people are to him as though they were even teaching prostitutes how to be unfaithful to their husbands and find other men to be their lovers. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])
