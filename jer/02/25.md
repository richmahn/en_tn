# You must restrain your feet from becoming bare and your throat from being thirsty!

God speaks of Israel wanting to worship other gods as if they were running around in the desert looking for those gods. Alternate translation: "I have told you to stop running here and there chasing after false gods, because all that it does is wear out your sandals and make you very thirsty" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# It is hopeless

"There is no hope for us to restrain ourselves." This implies that they cannot stop themselves from running after other gods. Alternate translation: "We cannot stop ourselves" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# No, I love strangers and go after them!

Here "strangers" represents foreign gods, and "go after them" represents worshiping them. Alternate translation: "We must follow after foreign gods and worship them!'" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
