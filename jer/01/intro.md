# Jeremiah 01 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetry in 1:4-10.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Jeremiah appointed as prophet #####

God chose Jeremiah to be his prophet and although many powerful people would be against him, God promised to protect him. This chapter emphasizes that Jeremiah was chosen by God to be his prophet. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/appoint]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/elect]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/promise]])

##### Northern kingdom #####
This was not a reference to the northern kingdom of Israel; it had already been conquered. It was a reference to a kingdom located north of Judah, that is, to Babylon. The Babylonian armies would attack Judah and conquer it.

##### Opposition #####
The people were supposed to listen to God's prophet. When he prophesied, they should have repented. Instead, they persecuted Jeremiah. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/repent]])
