# Connecting Statement:

Yahweh continues speaking to Jeremiah.

# Do not be shattered ... I will shatter you

Here "be shattered" represents being extremely afraid, and "shatter" represents causing Jeremiah to be extremely afraid. AT: "Do not be terrified ... I will terrify you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Behold!

"Pay attention!"

# Today I have made you a fortified city, an iron pillar, and bronze walls against the whole land

Being strong like these things represents being confident and unchanging in saying what God had told him to say. AT: "I have made you strong against the whole land like a fortified city, an iron pillar, and bronze walls" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# iron ... bronze

These were the strongest materials known at that time. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the whole land

This represents all the people of the land. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# They will fight against you

This refers to the people of Judah.

# this is Yahweh's declaration

Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 1:8](./07.md). AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
