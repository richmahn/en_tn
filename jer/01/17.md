# Connecting Statement:

Yahweh continues speaking to Jeremiah.

# Do not be shattered ... I will shatter you

Here "be shattered" represents being extremely afraid, and "shatter" represents causing Jeremiah to be extremely afraid. AT: "Do not be terrified ... I will terrify you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
