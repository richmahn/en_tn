# Ah, Lord Yahweh

Here "Ah" shows Jeremiah's fear of doing what God has said.

# I do not know how to speak

Jeremiah may have been exaggerating to show his fear of speaking in public. AT: "I do not know how to speak in public" or "I do not know how to make announcements to people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
