# I am watching over my word to carry it out

This represents guaranteeing that he will do what he has said. Alternate translation: "I am remembering my word to carry it out" or "I guarantee that I will do what I have said" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# for I am watching over my word

The Hebrew words for "almond" and "watch over" sound almost the same. God wants Jeremiah to remember that God will make his word succeed.
