##### The Rechabites #####

The actions of the Rechabites contrasted with the actions of the Jews. The Rechabites obeyed the commands their ancestor had give while living in Canaan, but Judah did not obey Yahweh's commands. Because the Rechabites were obedient, Yahweh preserved their clan. The Rechabites' history is found in the book of Judges.
