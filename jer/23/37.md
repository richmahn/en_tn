# General Information:

In verses 33-40 there is a wordplay with the word "burden." Sometimes it means "a message" and other times it means "a heavy load to carry." This wordplay should be retained if possible.

# Connecting Statement:

Yahweh completes his message about the false prophets and priests that he began in [Jeremiah 23:9](../23/09.md).

# This is what you will say

Here "you" is singular and refers to Jeremiah. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
