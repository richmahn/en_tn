# General Information:

In verses 33-40 there is a wordplay with the word "burden." Sometimes it means "a message" and other times it means "a heavy load to carry." This wordplay should be retained if possible.

# Connecting Statement:

Yahweh continues to deliver his message about the false prophets and priests that he began in [Jeremiah 23:9](../23/09.md) and completes in [Jeremiah 23:40](./37.md).

# You continue to say ... 'What did Yahweh declare?'

It may be helpful to reorder this sentence. Alternate translation: "Each person continues to ask his neighbor and his brother, 'What did Yahweh answer?' and 'What did Yahweh declare?'"
