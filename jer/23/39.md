# I am about to pick you up and throw you away from me

Yahweh speaks of sending these priests and false prophets into exile as if they were an object that he was going to throw far away. Alternate translation: "I am about to drive you away from me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

All of these instances of "you" are plural and refer to the priests and false prophets. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
