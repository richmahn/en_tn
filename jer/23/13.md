# Connecting Statement:

Jeremiah continues to deliver Yahweh's message about the false prophets and priests that he began in [Jeremiah 23:9](../23/09.md).

# led my people Israel astray

The deception of the people by the false prophets is spoken of as leading them down the wrong path. Alternate translation: "deceived my people, the Israelites" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
