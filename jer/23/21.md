# Connecting Statement:

Jeremiah continues to deliver Yahweh's message about the false prophets and priests that he began in [Jeremiah 23:9](./09.md).

# General Information:

Yahweh is the speaker in verses 21-40.

# they have still prophesied

It is understood that they are prophesying falsely. This can be made explicit. AT: "they have prophesied falsely anyway" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# if they had stood in my council meeting

Yahweh states what would have happened if the priests and false prophets had participated in Yahweh's council meeting in heaven. This hypothetical situation is impossible. AT: "if they had truly listened to me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])

# my council meeting

In ancient times, God was thought to hold meetings with the angels in heaven. Yahweh is referring to this kind of meeting, which humans could not attend. See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 23:18](./16.md).

# to turn from

This idiom means they would stop doing these things. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
