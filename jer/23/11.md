# Connecting Statement:

Jeremiah continues to deliver Yahweh's message about the false prophets and priests that he began in [Jeremiah 23:9](./09.md).

# the prophets and the priests are polluted

The prophets and priests are defiled by sin in the same way that water can be polluted by filth. AT: "the prophets and the priests are sinful" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
