# Connecting Statement:

Jeremiah continues to deliver Yahweh's message about the false prophets and priests that he began in [Jeremiah 23:9](./09.md).

# the prophets and the priests are polluted

The prophets and priests are defiled by sin in the same way that water can be polluted by filth. AT: "the prophets and the priests are sinful" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# I even found their wickedness in my house!

The abstract noun "wickedness" can be stated as an action. AT: "I know that they have even acted wickedly in my temple!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# in my house

This refers to the temple in Jerusalem.

# this is Yahweh's declaration

Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 1:8](../01/07.md). AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# their way will be like a slippery place in the darkness

The danger of their actions is spoken of as if they were about to fall off the slippery edge of a cliff in the dark and injure themselves. AT: "there actions are unstable and dangerous, like walking on a slippery place in the darkness" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# I will send disaster against them

Yahweh speaks of disaster as an enemy that he will send to attack the priests and false prophets. AT: "I will cause them to experience disaster" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# in the year of their punishment

"when their time for punishment comes" or "when the time comes for me to punish them"
