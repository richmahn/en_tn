# General Information:

Yahweh continues to speak about the people of Israel as if they were his sheep and the leaders of Israel as if they were his shepherds. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# to a grazing place

Yahweh refers to the land of Israel as if it were good pasture for his people. This good pasture is a metonym for provision for their needs. AT: "to good pasture" or "to where all their needs will be supplied" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# they will be fruitful and increase

The word "increase" explains how they will be "fruitful." AT: "they will increase greatly in number" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# I will raise up

"I will appoint"

# they will no longer fear or be shattered

The words "be shattered" mean that someone has caused them to be afraid and mean basically the same thing as "fear." This can be stated in active form. AT: "no one will make them afraid anymore" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# None of them

"None of my people"

# this is Yahweh's declaration

Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 1:8](../01/07.md). AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
