# General Information:

# to a grazing place

Yahweh refers to the land of Israel as if it were good pasture for his people. This good pasture is a metonym for provision for their needs. Alternate translation: "to good pasture" or "to where all their needs will be supplied" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# they will be fruitful and increase

The word "increase" explains how they will be "fruitful." Alternate translation: "they will increase greatly in number" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
