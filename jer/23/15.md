# Yahweh of hosts says this

Jeremiah often uses these words to introduce an important message from Yahweh. See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 6:6](../06/06.md).

# Look

The word "look" here alerts the reader to pay attention to the important information that follows.

# I am about to make them eat wormwood and drink poisonous water

Wormwood is a plant that is very bitter and unpleasant to eat. This phrase describes the punishment that Yahweh was going to bring about on the evil prophets. In the same way wormwood was bitter and the water was poisonous, so would Yaweh's judgment be on the evil prophets. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# I am about to

"I will soon"

# pollution has gone out from the prophets

Here the evil teaching of the priests and false prophets is spoken of as if it were something filthy that ruined the land. Alternate translation: "evil has come from the prophets" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# pollution

dirty and unsafe things that spoil the air, water, or land where they are found
