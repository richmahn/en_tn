# Connecting Statement:

Jeremiah continues to deliver Yahweh's message about the false prophets and priests that he began in [Jeremiah 23:9](../23/09.md).

# there is a storm coming from Yahweh ... His fury is going out ... a tempest is whirling about

These three phrases all refer to a great storm that is a metaphor for Yahweh's anger. This can be stated as a simile. Alternate translation: "Yahweh's anger is coming like a great storm, going out with fury and whirling like a tempest" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# a tempest

a violent windstorm

# It is whirling around the heads of the wicked

Yahweh's anger is spoken of as if it were a windstorm whirling around the wicked. Alternate translation: "It is coming upon the wicked like a windstorm" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
