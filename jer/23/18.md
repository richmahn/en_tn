# Yet who has stood in Yahweh's council meeting? Who sees and hears his word? Who pays attention to his word and listens?

These questions are used to rebuke the priests and false prophets for not obeying Yahweh. Alternate translation: "No one advises Yahweh. No one understands what Yahweh says. No one obeys Yahweh's commands." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# pays attention to his word and listens

These two phrases mean the same thing. They can be combined in one phrase. Alternate translation: "obeys his word at all"
