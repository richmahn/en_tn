# Connecting Statement:

Jeremiah continues to deliver Yahweh's message about the false prophets and priests that he began in [Jeremiah 23:9](./09.md).

# Yahweh of hosts says this

Jeremiah often uses these words to introduce an important message from Yahweh. See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 6:6](../06/06.md).

# They have deluded you!

"The prophets have caused you to believe something that is not true!"

# visions from their own minds

Here "minds" refers to the thoughts of the false prophets. AT: "visions that they imagined" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# not from Yahweh's mouth

Here "mouth" refers to what Yahweh said. AT: "not what Yahweh said" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
