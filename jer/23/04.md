# I will raise up

"I will appoint"

# they will no longer fear or be shattered

The words "be shattered" mean that someone has caused them to be afraid and mean basically the same thing as "fear." This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "no one will make them afraid anymore" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# None of them

"None of my people"

# this is Yahweh's declaration

Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 1:8](../01/08.md). Alternate translation: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
