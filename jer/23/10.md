# the land is full of adulterers

The land is spoken of as if it were a container and the adulterers were objects that filled the container completely. That is, everyone in the land is an adulterer, which in turn is an exaggeration for very many people being adulterers. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# adulterers

This word here probably has two senses. It has the literal meaning that the men in the nation had committed adultery against their own wives, and it also has the figurative meaning that they had abandoned Yahweh in order to worship idols. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the land is dried up

Some modern versions interpret this Hebrew phrase as "the land mourns."

# These prophets' paths are wicked

The wicked actions of the false prophets are spoken of as if they were walking on an evil path. AT: "These prophets are doing things that are wicked" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
