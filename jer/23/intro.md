# Jeremiah 23 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations indent each line of poetry to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetry in 23:5-6, 9-24.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Prophesying lies #####

The false prophets had encouraged people to continue sinning by saying everything will be alright. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]]) 

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### Wordplay #####

In Hebrew, the word for "message" can also mean "burden." In translations that are using footnotes, you may want to explain the wordplay in a footnote. In translations that are not using footnotes or which will primarily be distributed in an oral form, you may need a sentence like "What message has the Lord burdened you with now?" or "You (plural) call God's message a heavy burden on you."
