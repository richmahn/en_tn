# General Information:

In verses 1-4, Yahweh refers to Israel as his pasture, the people of Israel as his sheep, and the leaders of Israel as the shepherds. Shepherds have a duty to protect the sheep, but the leaders were not doing that. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# this is Yahweh's declaration

Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 1:8](../01/07.md). AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# You have scattered my flock and have driven them away

These two phrases have similar meanings. The second one strengthens the thought in the first. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
