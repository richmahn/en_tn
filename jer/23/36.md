Possible meaning are 1) both instances of "burden" mean "message." AT: "You must no longer call your visions the 'burden of Yahweh' because they are really only every man's own words, and" or 2) the first 'burden' means "message" and the second means "heavy load." AT: "You must no longer talk about the 'message of Yahweh' because the words that each of you speak are what is a 'heavy load.' In this way"

# you have perverted the words ... our God

To "pervert" something is to twist or distort it. AT: "you have changed the message of the living God, Yahweh of hosts, our God, to say what you want it to say and not what God said"
