# General Information:

In verses 9-32 Jeremiah delivers Yahweh's message to the false prophets and the priests. Jeremiah is speaking in verse 9, but it is not clear if verse 10 are the words of Jeremiah or of Yahweh.

# Regarding the prophets, my heart is broken in me, and all of my bones tremble

The prophet speaks of his heart being broken and his bones trembling because he is afraid of the judgment that will result from the lies of the false prophets. Alternate translation: "I have great fear for what will happen because of the false prophets" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# my heart is broken in me

This idiom refers to deep sadness. Alternate translation: "I am very sad" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# all of my bones tremble

Here trembling is associated with fear. Alternate translation: "I am very afraid" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# I have become like a drunk man, like a man whom wine has overpowered

People who are drunk are not able to control themselves. Likewise, Jeremiah has lost control of himself out of fear of Yahweh's punishment. Alternate translation: "I am like a drunk man; I cannot control myself" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
