The speaker has changed from Yahweh to Jeremiah.

## Regarding the prophets, my heart is broken in me and all of my bones tremble, ##

AT: "I have great fear for what will happen because of the false prophets" (See : [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## I have become like a drunk man, like a man whom wine has overpowered ##

AT: "I have lost control" (See : [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

## the land is full of adulterers ##

This exaggeration is used to show the level of sinfulness which was present at the time of Jeremiah. (See : [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

## the land mourns ##

The land suffers because of the people's sin. (See : [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
