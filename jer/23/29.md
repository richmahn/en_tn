# Is not my word like fire? ... and like a hammer that shatters a rock into pieces?

Yahweh uses these questions to emphasize that his word is much more powerful than the words of mere men. In that way, his word is like fire or a hammer. AT: "My word is powerful like fire ... and powerful like a hammer that shatters a rock into pieces." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
