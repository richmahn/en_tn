# How long will this go on, prophets who prophesy lies from their minds, and who prophesy from the deceit in their hearts?

Yahweh asks this question to emphasize that this is something that should not continue. Alternate translation: "This should not continue, prophets declaring lies which they themselves have made up." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# prophesy lies from their minds ... prophesy from the deceit in their hearts

These two phrases mean the same thing and emphasize that the false prophets made up their prophesies. Alternate translation: "prophesy things that come only from their own minds" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
