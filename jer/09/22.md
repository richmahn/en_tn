# This is Yahweh's declaration

Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 1:8](../01/08.md). AT: "This is what Yahweh has declared" or "This is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# the corpses of men will fall like dung ... like grain stalks after the reapers

These two phrases mean the same thing and emphasize the large number dead bodies. AT: "dead bodies will fall all over the place" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# corpses of men will fall like dung in the fields

This describes the great number of people who will die, by comparing their bodies to dung that falls in the fields. AT: "dead bodies will drop everywhere like animal dung falls all over the fields" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# like grain stalks after the reapers

This describes the great number of people who will die, by comparing their bodies to cut stalks of grain. AT: "like stalks of grain fall everywhere after the farmers cut them down" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# there will be no one to gather them

"there will be nobody to gather the dead bodies"
