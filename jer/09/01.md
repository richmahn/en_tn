Yahweh and Jeremiah continue talking about the people of Judah.

## If only my head could produce water, and my eyes be a fountain of tears ##

This is Jeremiah speaking. AT: "I wish I could make more tears!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## day and night ##

AT: "all the time." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])

## the daughter of my people ##

See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 4:11](../04/11.md).

## who have been killed  ##

AT: "whom the enemy has killed." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## If only someone would give me ##

This is still Jeremiah speaking. "I wish someone would give me"

## a place for travelers in the wilderness to stay ##

This refers to a building for people traveling in the wilderness, where they can stop and sleep overnight.

## abandon my people ##

"leave my people"

## a band of traitors ##

"a group of people who betray other other people"

## Yahweh declares ##

See you translated this same idea in [Jeremiah 1:7](../01/07.md).

## They say false things with their tongues, which are their deceitful bows ##

This metaphor compares the tongues of the people of Judah to bows that shoot arrows of lies. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

## but they are not great in faithfulness on the earth ##

AT: "but they are not faithful to Yahweh."

## They go out from wicked act to another ##

"They keep doing lots of evil things"
