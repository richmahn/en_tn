# General Information:

Yahweh and Jeremiah continue talking about the people of Judah.

# If only my head could produce water, and my eyes be a fountain of tears

This is Jeremiah speaking. These two phrases mean the same thing and emphasize how much Jeremiah is weeping. AT: "I wish I could make more tears" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# day and night

By mentioning both "day" and "night" this phrase means all the time. AT: "all the time" or "continually" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])

# the daughter of my people

Yahweh shows his love for his people by speaking of them as a daughter. Here Jeremiah uses this same phrase for the people that Yahweh uses. See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 4:11](../04/11.md). AT: "my people, who are like Yahweh's daughter" or "my dear people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# who have been killed

This can be stated in active form. AT: "whom the enemy has killed" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
