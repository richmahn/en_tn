# Yahweh declares

See how you translated "this is Yahweh's declaration" in [Jeremiah 1:8](../01/08.md).

# They tread on their bows of lies with their tongues

Telling lies is spoken of as being done by the tongues of the wicked. Also, since a spoken lie cannot be taken back, telling lies is spoken of as if it were shooting arrows. Men who use bows must step on their bows in order to fasten the bowstrings, so liars are referred to here as if they were stringing their bows using their tongues. AT: "Their lies are like arrows that they shoot with the tongues" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# but it is not because of any faithfulness of theirs that they grow strong on the earth

"They do not grow strong on the earth because they are faithful to Yahweh, as they are wicked" and "This means that the people are not faithful to Yahweh, but rather are wicked and have gained their power through wickedness" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])

# They go from one wicked act to another

Committing one evil action after another is spoken of as if the evildoers were going from one action to another. AT: "They keep doing evil things" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
