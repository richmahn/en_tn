These are the words of Yahweh.

## Do not let the wise man take pride in his wisdom ##

"A wise man should not be proud because he is wise"

## Do not let the wealthy man take pride in his riches ##

"A rich man should not be proud because he is rich"

## that he has insight and knows me ##

"that he understands who I am and lives in a way that is pleasing to me"

## For I am Yahweh ##

AT: "Because people should understand that I am Yahweh." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

## For it is in these that I take pleasure ##

"And it is pleasing to me when people act with covenant loyalty, justice and righteousness"

## This is Yahweh's declaration ##

See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 1:7](../01/07.md).
