These are the words of Yahweh.

## This is Yahweh's declaration ##

See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 1:7](../01/07.md).

## when I will punish all the circumcised who are such only in their body ##

This refers to the people of Israel who have entered into a covenant with Yahweh by getting circumcised physically. However, they have not followed His laws.

## and all the people who cut the hair on their heads ##

AT: This probably refers to people who cut their hair short in order to honor a pagan god. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

## For all these nations are uncircumcised ##

AT: "Because these nations did not enter into a covenant with Yahweh through circumcision."

## and all the house of Israel has an uncircumcised heart ##

An uncircumcised heart represents the character of a person that does not obey Yahweh's laws.  AT: "and all the people of Israel have not kept the covenant with Yahweh by obeying him." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
