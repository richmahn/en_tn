## translationNotes

* These are the words of Yahweh.
* **This is Yahweh's declaration** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:jer:01:07]].
* **when I will punish all the circumcised who are such only in their body** - This refers to the people of Israel who have entered into a covenant with Yahweh by getting circumcised physically. However, they have not followed His laws.
* **and all the people who cut the hair on their heads** - AT: This probably refers to people who cut their hair short in order to honor a pagan god. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
* **For all these nations are uncircumcised** - AT: "Because these nations did not enter into a covenant with Yahweh through circumcision."
* **and all the house of Israel has an uncircumcised heart** - An uncircumcised heart represents the character of a person that does not obey Yahweh's laws.  AT: "and all the people of Israel have not kept the covenant with Yahweh by obeying him." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
