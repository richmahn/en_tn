Yahweh continues speaking about the people of Judah.

## It is because they have abandoned ##

"The land is destroyed because the people of Judah did not obey"

## listen to my voice ##

AT: "pay attention to the things I tell them." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## or walk by it ##

AT: "or live the way I tell them to live."

## they have walked by their stubborn hearts ##

AT: "they have been stubborn and lived the way they want to live."

## and have followed the Baals ##

"and have worshiped the false gods"
