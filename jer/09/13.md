# General Information:

Yahweh continues speaking about the people of Judah.

# It is because

"These things will happen because"

# they have abandoned my law

Yahweh speaks of the people not obeying his law as if it were something that they had walked away from. Alternate translation: "they have rejected my law" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# they do not listen to my voice

Here Yahweh's "voice" represents what he says. Alternate translation: "they do not pay attention to the things I tell them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# or walk by it

Here "walk" is an idiom for "live." Alternate translation: "or live the way I tell them to live" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
