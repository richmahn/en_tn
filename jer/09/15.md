Yahweh continues speaking about the people of Judah.

## wormwood ##

a plant that tastes bitter

## Then I will scatter them among the nations ##

"Then I will force them to leave here and live in many different countries"

## I will send out a sword after them ##

AT: "I will send an army of soldiers to fight against them." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
