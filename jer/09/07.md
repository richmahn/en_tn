Yahweh continues to speak about the people of Judah.

## daughter of my people ##

See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 4:11](../04/11.md).

## Their tongues are sharpened arrows ##

The tongue hurts people with lies in the same way that sharpened arrows hurt people. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## With their mouth they proclaim peace with their neighbors ##

AT: "They say with their words that they want peace with their neighbors." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## but with their hearts they lie in wait for them ##

AT: "but what they really want is to destroy their neighbors." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

## Should I not punish them because of these things? ##

"Surely, I should punish them because of these things!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## Should I not avenge myself on a nation that is like this? ##

AT: "Surely, I should avenge myself on a nation that is like this!"
