# Your dwelling is in the midst of deception

Yahweh speaks of living among people who are liars as living in the middle of deception. AT: "Your dwelling is among the dwellings of liars" or "You dwell in the midst of liars" (See:[[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# in their deceit

"By telling all of these lies"

# this is Yahweh's declaration

Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 1:8](../01/08.md). AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
