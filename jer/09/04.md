Yahweh continues speaking with Jeremiah about the people of Judah.

## Each of you ##

The word "you" refers to the people of Judah.

## be on guard against your neighbor and do not trust in any brother ##

"be careful not to trust your fellow Israelites, and do not even trust your own brother"

## For every brother is a deceiver and every neighbor walks in slander ##

"Do this because your fellow Israelites all deceive people and they all slander people"

## Each man mocks his neighbor and does not speak the truth ##

"All of the people mock each other, and they do not tell the truth"

## Their tongues teach deceitful things ##

AT: "They teach things that are not true." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## They are exhausted from committing iniquity ##

"They are tired from committing so much sin"

## You live in the midst of deception ##

Yahweh is speaking to Jeremiah.

## in their deceit they refuse to acknowledge me ##

"By telling all of these lies, the people of Judah refuse to obey me as God."  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

## This is Yahweh's declaration ##

See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 1:7](../01/07.md).
