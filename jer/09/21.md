# General Information:

Here Yahweh is saying what the people of Judah will say when he destroys the land.

# For death has come through our windows ... young men in the city squares

The people of Judah will compare death to a person who can climb in windows to attack the people inside and attacks people in the palaces, streets, and city squares. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# palaces

fancy houses where kings live. Death will come to rich and poor alike.

# city squares

marketplaces
