## translationNotes

* These are Yahweh's words about the people of Judah.
* **For death has come through our windows** - Yahweh says what the people of Judah will say when he destroys the land. The people of Judah will compare death to a person who can climb in windows to attack the people inside. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
* **palaces** - fancy houses where kings live. Death will come to rich and poor alike.
* **It destroys children from outside** - AT: "Death is killing children in the streets."
* **and young men in the the city squares** - AT: "and death is killing young men in the city squares."
* **city squares** - marketplaces
* **Yahwehâ€™s declaration** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:jer:01:07]].
* **the corpses of men will fall like dung...like grain stalks after the reapers** - AT: "dead bodies will fall all over the place." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
* **corpses of men will fall like dung in the fields** - AT: "dead bodies will drop everywhere like animal poop drops all over the fields." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
* **and like grain stalks after the reapers** - AT: "and like stalks of grain fall everywhere after the farmers cut them down."
* **and there will be no one to gather them** - "and there will be nobody to gather the dead bodies"
