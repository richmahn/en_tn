These are Yahweh's words about the people of Judah.

## For death has come through our windows ##

Yahweh says what the people of Judah will say when he destroys the land. The people of Judah will compare death to a person who can climb in windows to attack the people inside. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

## palaces ##

fancy houses where kings live. Death will come to rich and poor alike.

## It destroys children from outside ##

AT: "Death is killing children in the streets."

## and young men in the the city squares ##

AT: "and death is killing young men in the city squares."

## city squares ##

marketplaces

## Yahwehâ€™s declaration ##

See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 1:7](../01/07.md).

## the corpses of men will fall like dung...like grain stalks after the reapers ##

AT: "dead bodies will fall all over the place." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## corpses of men will fall like dung in the fields ##

AT: "dead bodies will drop everywhere like animal poop drops all over the fields." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

## and like grain stalks after the reapers ##

AT: "and like stalks of grain fall everywhere after the farmers cut them down."

## and there will be no one to gather them ##

"and there will be nobody to gather the dead bodies"
