# who go about slandering others

"and constantly slander other people"

# All of them are bronze and iron

Bronze and iron are hard metals. Yahweh speaks of the people being stubborn as if they were hard like bronze and iron. AT: "All of them are hard like bronze and iron" or "All of them are stubborn, as hard as bronze and iron" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
