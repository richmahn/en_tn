# What does this frankincense going up from Sheba mean to me? Or these sweet smells from a distant land?

God uses these questions to rebuke the people. AT: "Frankincense from Sheba and sweet smelling cane from a distant land mean nothing to me." or "I do not want your burnt offerings of frankincense from Sheba or sweet smelling cane from a distant land." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# these sweet smells

People would burn sweet smelling cane as an offering to God.

# are not acceptable to me

"do not please me" or "do not make me happy"
