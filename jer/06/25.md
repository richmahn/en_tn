This is probably Yahweh speaking to the daughter of Zion who represents all of the people of Jerusalem.

## Daughter of my people ##

See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 4:11](../04/11.md).

## fasten on sackcloth and roll about in the dust of a funeral for an only child. ##

"Be very sad"

## for the destroyer will come suddenly upon us ##

"because the enemy army will suddenly come to attack us." Jeremiah says these words to the people of Jerusalem.
