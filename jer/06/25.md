# for the swords of the enemy and terror are all around

The phrase "swords of the enemy" represents the enemy with their swords ready to attack. The abstract noun "terror" refers to things that cause people to be frightened and can be translated with an adjective. AT: "For the enemy is everywhere with their swords and everyone else is terrified" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# Daughter of my people

Jeremiah shows Yahweh's love for his people by speaking to them as a daughter. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Jeremiah 4:11](../04/11.md). AT: "My people, you who are like a daughter to me" or "My dear people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]]).

People do these things to show that they are extremely sad. AT: "Show how sad you are by wearing sackcloth and rolling in ashes" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])

# mourn with painful sobs as for an only son

Jeremiah compares the people's great sadness to the sadness that a mother feels if her only son dies. AT: "mourn with painful sobs as you would if your only son died" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
