# Hear, earth

Jeremiah is speaking to the people of nations far away from him as if they could hear him. He is speaking as if to the earth itself. Alternate translation: "Listen, everyone who lives on the earth" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# I am about to bring disaster to this people

"soon I will punish these people severely"

# the fruit of their thoughts

Here the word "fruit" represents results or consequences. Alternate translation: "the consequences of their thoughts" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# They paid no attention to my word or law, but they instead rejected it

Here "paid no attention to my word" refers to not listening to what God said, and "rejected it" refers to refusing to obey God's law. Alternate translation: "They did not listen to what I said. Instead they disobeyed my law" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
