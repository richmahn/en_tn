# The bellows are scorched by the fire that is burning them; the lead is consumed in the flames

God speaks of punishing his people as if they were silver and he was boiling the silver in a very hot fire. These phrases emphasize that the one boiling the metal was working very hard. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# The bellows are scorched by the fire that is burning them

The fire is so hot that it burns the bellows. This can be stated in active form. This very hot fire represents God's judgment. AT: "The fire is so hot that it scorches the bellows" or "The punishment is so severe that it is like a fire that even burns the bellows" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# The bellows are scorched

Bellows are a tool used to blow large amounts of air into a burning fire to make the fire hotter. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

# the lead is consumed in the flames

The silver has so many impurities in it that the lead is used up before it can remove them all. This represents the people of Israel being so full of sin, that they continue to sin even after God punishes them. AT: "the silver is so full of impurities, that the lead that is used to remove them is used up" or "they are like silver that is so full of impurities that the lead cannot remove them all" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# The refining continues among them

This can be stated in active form. AT: "You will continue to refine them" or "You will continue to try to purify them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# because the evil is not removed

God speaks of Israel continuing to be evil as if they were silver and the impurities remained in the silver. This can be stated in active form. AT: "because the evil remains" or "the impurities remain" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
