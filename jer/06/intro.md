# Jeremiah 06 General Notes

#### Structure and formatting

Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 6:1-30.

#### Special concepts in this chapter

##### Gods and battle
In the ancient Near East, it was commonly believed that a nation's gods were responsible for military victory. It may have been believed that a god would not defend an evil city. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/falsegod]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/evil]])
