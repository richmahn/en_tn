# Jeremiah 06 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations indent each line of poetry to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetry in 6:1-30.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Gods and battle #####
In the ancient Near East, it was commonly believed that a nation's gods were responsible for military victory. It may have been believed that a god would not defend an evil city. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/falsegod]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/evil]])
