Some translations prefer to set apart quotations. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 6:1-30, which is an extended quotation.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Gods and battle #####
In the ancient Near East, it was commonly believed that a nation's gods were responsible for military victory. It may have been believed that a god would not defend an evil city. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/falsegod]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/evil]])
