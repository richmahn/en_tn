## Stand at the road crossing ##

Yahweh is speaking to the people of Israel.

## Stand at the road crossing…We will not go ##

The paths and roads refer to the way that people live their lives. Yahweh wants the people of Israel to ask what would be a good way to live their lives and for them to live that way. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## ask for the ancient pathways ##

"ask about what your ancestors did" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## and find a resting place for your soul ##

"and you will find rest for yourselves"

## I appointed for you watchmen …will not listen ##

Yahweh describes the prophets as watchmen who were sent to warn the people of danger. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## appointed for you ##

The word "you" refers to the people of Israel.

## to listen for the trumpet ##

"listen to the sound of the trumpet." Yahweh is commanding the people of Israel to pay attention to the warning that he gave them through the prophets.

## Therefore, nations, listen! See, you witnesses, what will happen to them. Hear, earth! See ##

These three sentences all are telling the people of other nations to witness what Yahweh will do to the rebellious people of Judah. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe]]) "You other nations see what I will do to my people"
