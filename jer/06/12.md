# Their houses will be turned over to others

This can be stated in active form. AT: "Their houses will become the possession of other people" or "There people will take their houses" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# both their fields and their wives together

The phrase "will be turned over to others" is understood from the previous phrase. AT: "and their their fields and their women will also be turned over to others" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# this is Yahweh's declaration

Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 1:8](../01/08.md). AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
