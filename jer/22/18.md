# They will not lament for him

In verse 18, Yahweh stops speaking directly to Jehoiakim and begins to speak to other people. Here "lament" refers to grieving at Jehoiakim's death. AT: "They will not lament for Jehoiakim when he dies" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# Woe, my brother! ... Woe, my sister! ... Woe, master! ... Woe, majesty!

Yahweh uses the word "Woe" several times for emphasis. He addresses the various people who would normally show great sadness when someone dies. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
