# He will be buried with a donkey's burial, dragged away and thrown out

The burial of Jehoiakim is spoken of as being the same as the manner in which people would bury a donkey. This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "They will bury his dead body the way they would bury a dead donkey; they will drag it away and throw it out" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
