# It was good then

"Things went well for him"

# Is this not what it means to know me?

Yahweh asks this rhetorical question to rebuke Jehoiakim for not following the example of his father, King Josiah. AT: "This is what it means to know me." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# this is Yahweh's declaration

Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 1:8](../01/08.md). AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
