# Jeremiah 22 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations indent each line of poetry to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetry in 22:6-10, 13-28, 28-30.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Luxury and oppression #####

Because the king lived in luxury and oppressed the poor, God was sending him and his mother into captivity unless he repented. The king lacked justice. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/oppress]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/repent]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/justice]])
