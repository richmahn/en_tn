# The wind will shepherd away all your shepherds

This is a wordplayâ€”Yahweh uses the idea of "shepherd" in two different ways. Here "shepherds" is a metaphor for the leaders of Jerusalem, and the wind "leads" them away. The wind represents Yahweh. AT: "I will take your leaders away as if the wind had blown them away" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# go into captivity

"become captives" or "go into exile"
