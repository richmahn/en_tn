# even if you ... were the signet on my right hand

Yahweh speaks to Jehoiachin as if it were possible for him to be the ring on Yahweh's hand. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])

# the signet on my right hand

A signet ring was used by a king to place his seal of authority on documents. The signet ring therefore represents authority to rule. The right hand also represents authority to rule. AT: "the signet ring on my right hand that represented my authority to be king" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# I would tear you off

"I would tear you off from my hand" or "I would quickly pull you off of my hand"
