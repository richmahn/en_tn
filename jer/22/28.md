# Is this a despised and shattered vessel? ... did not know?

It is not clear who is speaking in verse 28.

# Is this a despised and shattered vessel? Is this man Jehoiachin a pot that pleases no one?

Jehoiachin is spoken of as a pot that was completely worthless and not liked by anyone. The questions emphasize that he has no value or friends. Alternate translation: "Jehoiachin is as useless as a broken vessel and no one is happy with him." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Why have they thrown him and his descendants out, and have poured them out into a land that they did not know?

This rhetorical question explains what will happen to the worthless Jehoiachin. Alternate translation: "Therefore the enemy will remove Jehoiachin and his family from the land and take them to a foreign land." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# have poured them out

Jehoiachin and his descendants are spoke of as if they had been poured out in another country like garbage from a vessel. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
