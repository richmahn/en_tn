# If I answer you, will you not certainly kill me?

Jeremiah uses this question to express his belief that the king will kill him if he answers truthfully. Alternate translation: "If I tell you the truth, you will certainly kill me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# I will not ... give you into the hand of those men

Here the word "hand" refers to the men's control or power. Alternate translation: "I will not ... allow those men to capture you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
