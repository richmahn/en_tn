# deserted

escaped trouble and left people who needed help. See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 37:13](../37/11.md).

# I might be given over into their hand

The word "hand" is a metonym for the power or control that the hand exercises. This can be translated in active form. AT: "the Chaldeans might put me under the control of the people of Judah who have deserted" or "the Chaldeans might allow the people of Judah who have deserted to do whatever they want with me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# for them to treat me badly

Here the word "them" refers to the people of Judah who have deserted.
