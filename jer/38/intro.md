# Jeremiah 38 General Notes #

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Surrender and live #####

If the king obeyed God and surrendered to the Babylonians, he would be allowed to live and the city would not be burned. But if he refused, he would be captured and the city burned. This took faith that Yahweh was using this ungodly, Gentile nation. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/ungodly]])
