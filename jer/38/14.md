# As Yahweh lives, the one who made us

"as surely as Yahweh, the one who made us, is alive." This is a way of making a solemn promise. The king says it to emphasize that what he is about to say next is true.

# I will not ... give you into the hand of those men

Here the word "hand" refers to the men's control or power. AT: "I will not ... allow those men to capture you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# seeking your life

This phrase represents wanting or trying to kill someone. See how this phrase is translated in [Jeremiah 11:21](../11/21.md). AT: "trying to kill you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
