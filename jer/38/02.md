# Anyone staying in this city will be killed by sword, famine, and plague

This can be translated in active form. AT: "Anyone staying in this city will die by sword, famine, and plague" or "I will kill anyone staying in this city with sword, famine, and plague" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# He will escape with his own life

The one who surrenders to the Babylonians will escape alive, even though he will lose all his possessions. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Jeremiah 21:9](../21/09.md).
