The word "hand" is a metonym for the power or control that the hand exercises. This can be translated in active form. See how you translated similar words in [Jeremiah 32:4](../32/04.md). AT: "I will certainly put you under the control of the king of Babylon" or "I will certainly allow the king of Babylon to do whatever he wants with you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
