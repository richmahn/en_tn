# Jeremiah 37 General Notes

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter

##### Ironic situation

Jeremiah was thrown into prison and beaten for prophesying the word of God. Then the king asked him, "Is there any word from Yahweh?" This is a type of irony. The king simply did not agree with God's original word. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/wordofgod]])
