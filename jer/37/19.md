# Where are your prophets, the ones who prophesied ... against this land?

Jeremiah uses this question to emphasize that the other prophets were lying but that he had done nothing wrong because he had told the truth. AT: "Your prophets who prophesied ... against this land were obviously wrong, but now it is clear that I was telling you the truth." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# your prophets

The word "your" refers to King Zedekiah and the other people of the kingdom of Judah.

# will not come against you or against this land

"will not attack you or attack this land"
