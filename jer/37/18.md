## translationNotes

* **How have I sinned against you** - Jeremiah uses this question to emphasize that he has not done anything wrong. AT: "I have not done anything wrong to you..." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **this people** - the people of the kingdom of Judah
* **have placed** - "have put"
* **Where are your prophets, the ones who prophesied...against this land** - Jeremiah uses this question to emphasize that the other prophets were lying but that he had done nothing wrong because he had told the truth. AT: "Your prophets who prophesied...against this land, were obviously wrong, but now it is clear that I was telling you the truth." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
* **your prophets** - The word "your" refers to King Zedekiah and the other people of the kingdom of Judah.
