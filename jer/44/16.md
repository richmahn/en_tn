# About the word that you have told us in Yahweh's nameâ€”we will not listen to you

Here "in Yahweh's name" means "in Yahweh's authority" or "as Yahweh's representative." Alternate translation: "We will not obey this message that you say Yahweh told you to tell us" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
