# they still are not humbled

"the people of Judah are still not humble." Yahweh is still speaking to the people of Judah, so this can be stated in second person. Alternate translation: "you are still not humble" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# nor do they walk in them

Obeying the laws is spoken of as if it were walking in the laws. Alternate translation: "nor do they obey them" or "nor do you obey them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
