# Every person of Judah in the land of Egypt will perish by sword and famine until they are all finished

Here "Every person" is a generalization that means "very many people." Also, "sword" represents enemies carrying weapons. Alternate translation: "Nearly every person of Judah in the land of Egypt will die. Enemies will kill many of them and many of them will starve to death until there is very few of them left" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
