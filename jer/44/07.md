# Why are you doing ... yourselves? Why are you causing ... and babies?

Yahweh uses these questions to rebuke the people for doing things that cause him to punish them. Alternate translation: "You are doing ... yourselves. You are causing ... and babies." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Why are you doing great wickedness against yourselves?

The abstract noun "wickedness" can be stated as "wicked." Alternate translation: "Why are you doing these wicked things that harm yourselves?" or "You are doing wicked things that cause terrible things to happen to you." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# Why are you causing yourselves to be cut off from among Judah ... and babies?

Being separated from the people of Judah is spoken of as if the people are cut off from Judah the way a person may cut off a branch from a vine or cut off a piece of cloth. This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "Why are you causing me to remove you from the people of Judah ... and babies?" or "You are causing me to remove you from the people of Judah ... and babies." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
