# Yahweh of hosts ... says this

Jeremiah often uses these words to introduce an important message from Yahweh. See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 6:6](../06/06.md).

# I am about to set my face against you

This idiom means he "firmly decided." See how you translated a similar phrase in [Jeremiah 21:10](../21/08.md). AT: "I have made up my mind to oppose you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# set my face against

"stare angrily at"

# to bring disaster to you

Causing disaster to happen is spoken of as if disaster were an object that can be brought to someone. AT: "to cause disaster to happen to you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# They will fall by sword and famine

Here "fall" means to die. And "sword" represents the enemies carrying weapons. AT: "Enemies will kill some of them and others will die of hunger" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# From the least to the greatest

This is a way to refer to people from every social status. Here "least" and "greatest" represent those who are least important and those who are most important. AT: "all the people from every social status" or "all the people, including the least important and the most important people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])

# will become an object of swearing, cursing, reproaching, and a horrible thing

"people will be horrified because of what happened to the people of Judah, and people will mock and curse them"
