# Yahweh of hosts ... says this

Jeremiah often uses these words to introduce an important message from Yahweh. See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 6:6](../06/06.md).

# I am about to set my face against you

This idiom means he "firmly decided." See how you translated a similar phrase in [Jeremiah 21:10](../21/10.md). Alternate translation: "I have made up my mind to oppose you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# set my face against

"stare angrily at"

# to bring disaster to you

Causing disaster to happen is spoken of as if disaster were an object that can be brought to someone. Alternate translation: "to cause disaster to happen to you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
