## Have you forgotten ... and in the streets of Jerusalem? ##

Yahweh challenges the people with these two questions that mean almost the same thing for emphasis. AT: "You have forgotten ... and in the streets of Jerusalem!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## and the streets of Jerusalem ##

Jerusalem is referred to by the part of the city where people walk.  This means the people did evil things in public places. AT: "and Jerusalem" or "and the public places of Jerusalem" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
