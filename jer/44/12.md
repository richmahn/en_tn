# They will fall by sword and famine

Here "fall" means to die. And "sword" represents the enemies carrying weapons. Alternate translation: "Enemies will kill some of them and others will die of hunger" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# From the least to the greatest

This is a way to refer to people from every social status. Here "least" and "greatest" represent those who are least important and those who are most important. Alternate translation: "all the people from every social status" or "all the people, including the least important and the most important people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])

# will become an object of swearing, cursing, reproaching, and a horrible thing

"people will be horrified because of what happened to the people of Judah, and people will mock and curse them"
