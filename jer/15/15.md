Jeremiah speaks to Yahweh.

## Call me to mind ##

AT: "Remember me" or "Consider me and my situation" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

## my pursuers ##

"Those who search after me to harm me.".

## In your patience do not take me away. ##

AT: "Please do not continue to be patient with them and do not allow me to die now."

## Your words have been found ##

AT: "I have heard your message." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## and I consumed them ##

"and I understood your message"

## your name is proclaimed on me ##

"people identified me as one who belongs to you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
