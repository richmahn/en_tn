# General Information:

In these verse, Jeremiah speaks to Yahweh about his suffering, and Yahweh answers him.

# Woe to me, my mother

Jeremiah pretends to speak to his mother as a way to emphasize how sad he is. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe]])

# a man of controversy and argument

The words "controversy" and "argument" mean basically the same thing. Together they emphasize how much Jeremiah is arguing. AT: "a man with whom everyone argues all the time" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# I have not lent, nor has anyone lent to me

This refers to lending money to people. Often lending money causes people to fight with one another. AT: "I have not lent money to anyone, nor has anyone lent money to me" or "I have not made anyone angry by lending or borrow money and then quarreling about it" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
