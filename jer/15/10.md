## translationNotes

* Yahweh has just announced his punishment for Israel.
* **Woe to me, my mother** - Jeremiah pretends to speak to his mother as a way to emphasize how sad he is. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_apostrophe]])
* **controversy and argument ** - The words "controversy" and "argument" mean basically the same thing. They are used together for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
* **lent ** - to give a loan to someone
* **Will I not rescue you for good? ** - The implicit answer to this question is "yes". AT: "I will certainly rescue you for good!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **your enemies** - Those are the enemies of Jeremiah who disagreed with his prophecies.
* **calamity and distress** - The words "calamity" and "distress" should be understood as basically similar. The idea is repeated to emphasize how bad things will get. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
* **Can one smash iron?** - The implied answer is "no". Also, the iron represents the firmness of God's judgment. AT: "My judgment cannot be broken, just like iron cannot be smashed" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **Especially iron from the north that is mixed with bronze?** - This second question makes the first even stronger, and uses extra strong iron in the metaphor. AT: "Even more, my judgment is like super strong iron" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
