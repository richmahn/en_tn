# So I will winnow them with a pitchfork at the gates of the land

Here Yahweh speaks of scattering the people and causing them to leave Jersalem as if they were winnowed chaff being blown away on the wind. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# pitchfork

a farm tool with a long handle and sharp metal prongs, used especially for lifting and tossing grain in the air for winnowing

# I will bereave them

"I will cause their children to die" or "I will let their enemies kill their children"
