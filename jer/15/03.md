Yahweh has just told them he will send some of them to death, some to die by the sword, some to die by famine, and some to be captives.

## Yahweh's declaration ##

See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 1:7](../01/07.md).

## I will make of them a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth, on account of Manasseh son of Hezekiah, king of Judah, because of what he did in Jerusalem ##

AT: "And I will make them a frightful thing to all the kingdoms of the earth because of what Manasseh the son of Hezekiah, king of Judah, did in Jerusalem." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

## I will assign them to four groups  ##

AT: "I will appoint four groups over them"
