# I will make of them

Here the word "them" refers to the people of Judah, not to the four groups listed in the previous verse.

# because of what Manasseh ... did in Jerusalem

Manasseh was a very wicked king who did many evil things in Jerusalem. Alternate translation: "because of the wicked things that Manasseh ... did in Jerusalem" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
