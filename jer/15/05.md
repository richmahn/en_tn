# General Information:

Yahweh has just told them he will assign them to four groups to kill themâ€”the sword, dogs, birds, and beasts.

# For who will have compassion for you, Jerusalem? Who will grieve for you?

Yahweh uses this rhetorical question to emphasize that no one should mourn for Jerusalem. This question can be written as a statement. Alternate translation: "No one should have compassion on you, Jerusalem. No one should mourn for your destruction." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# for you, Jerusalem

Here "Jerusalem" refers to the people who live there. Alternate translation: "for you people who live in Jerusalem" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
