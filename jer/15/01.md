# General Information:

Jeremiah has just been praying to Yahweh.

# were standing in front of me, I would still not be in favor of this people

This implies that they are pleading for Yahweh to spare the people. AT: "were standing in front of me pleading for these people, I would still not be in favor of them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# Send them out from before me, for them to go away

Yahweh repeats this idea of sending away his people to add emphasis to it. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
