Jeremiah has just been praying to Yahweh.

## Send them out from before me, for them to go away ##

"Send them away from me! Let them go forth!" He repeats this idea for emphasis. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## Those destined for death ##

AT: "The people whom God said must die" or "the ones certain to die"
