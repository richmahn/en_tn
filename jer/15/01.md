Jeremiah has just been praying to Yahweh.

# were standing in front of me, I would still not be in favor of this people

This implies that they are pleading for Yahweh to spare the people. AT: "were standing in front of me pleading for these people, I would still not be in favor of them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# Send them out from before me, for them to go away

Yahweh repeats this idea of sending away his people to add emphasis to it. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# should go to death

This speaks of dying as if death were a place that people can go to. AT: "should die" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# those destined for the sword should go to the sword

Here the "sword" represents war. To be "destined for the sword" means to be destined to die in war. AT: "those destined to die in wars, should go to war" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
