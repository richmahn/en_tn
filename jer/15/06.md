# You have forsaken me ... you have gone back from me

These two phrases mean basically the same thing and emphasize that the people have, indeed, forsaken Yahweh. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# this is Yahweh's declaration

Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 1:8](../01/08.md). Alternate translation: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# gone back from me

"left me" or "gone away from me"

# I will strike you with my hand

Here "hand" represents power. Alternate translation: "I will use my power to strike you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
