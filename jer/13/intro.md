# Jeremiah 13 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations set each line of poetry farher to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetry in 13:15-27.

===Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ===

##### Symbolism #####

The action of hiding the undergarment was intended to be a symbolic event. It was supposed to get the Jews' attention and be a lesson for them to learn. Jeremiah performed the action, but it was not the action itself that was important. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
