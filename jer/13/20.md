Yahweh is talking to the people of Jerusalem.

## Lift up your eyes ##

"understand what will be happening to you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## Where is the flock he gave to you, the flock that was so beautiful to you? ##

"All the people have been taken away."   [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## What will you say when God places over you those whom you had taught to be your friends? ##

AT: "The people you thought were your friends will conquer you and rule over you." (See:  [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## Are these not the beginnings of the labor pains that will seize you just like a woman in childbirth? ##

Yahweh is telling them that their capture is just the beginning of the pain they will go through.  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
