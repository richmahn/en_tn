# General Information:

Yahweh is talking to the people of Jerusalem.

# Lift up your eyes and look at the ones coming from the north

Here the word "look" is an idiom that means to pay attention and be aware of what is happening. Also, "Lift up your eyes" represents looking at something. Alternate translation: "Pay attention and be aware of the ones coming from the north" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# the ones coming from the north

This refers an enemy army that will come from the north. Alternate translation: "the enemy army coming from the north" or "the enemy army marching from the north" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# Where is the flock he gave to you, the flock that was so beautiful to you?

This rhetorical question is asked to emphasize that the people of Judah will be captured by the enemy armies. This question is asked as if the people of Judah had already been captured even though this has not yet happened. The question can be written as a statement and in future tense. Alternate translation: "I gave you the people of Judah to care for, like a beautiful flock of sheep, but the enemy army will capture them." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture]])

# the flock

This speaks of the people of Judah as a "flock" of sheep to emphasize that the leaders of Judah were supposed to care for them and look after them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
