# I myself will strip your skirts off you, and your private parts will be seen.

This means that Yahweh will make them feel ashamed. It does not in any way mean that he will rape them. This can be stated in active form. AT: "It is as though I myself will strip your skirts off of you so that everyone will see your private parts and you will be ashamed" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
