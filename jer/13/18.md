# General Information:

Yahweh is continuing to talk to Jeremiah. He is telling Jeremiah what to say to the king of Judah and the king's mother.

# queen mother

the mother of the king

# for your splendid crowns have fallen from your heads

A king and queen mother wear crowns to represent their royal positions as the king and queen mother. Also, this event has not happened yet, but it is written here as if it already has. This can be written in future tense. Alternate translation: "for you will no longer be the king and queen mother, for your crowns, your pride and glory, will fall off" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture]])
