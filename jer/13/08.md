# the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,

The idiom "the word of Yahweh came to" is used to introduce a special message from God. See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 1:4](../01/04.md). AT: "Yahweh gave me a message. He said" or "Yahweh spoke this message to me:" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
