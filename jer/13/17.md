# for Yahweh's flock has been taken captive

Here Jeremiah speaks of Yahweh's people as Yahweh's "flock" because he cares for them like a shepherd cares for his sheep. This event has not happened yet, but it is written here as if it already has. This can be written in future tense. AT: "for you who are Yahweh's flock, your enemies will soon capture you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture]])
