# the word of Yahweh came to me a second time, saying,

The idiom "the word of Yahweh came to" is used to introduce a special message from God. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Jeremiah 1:4](../01/04.md), and make any changes as needed. AT: "Yahweh gave me a message a second time. He said" or "Yahweh spoke this second message to me:" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
