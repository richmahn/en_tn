# General Information:

Yahweh continues to talk to Jeremiah. He is telling Jeremiah what to say to the king of Judah and the king's mother.

# that your skirts are raised up and you have been violated

This means that the enemy soldiers will rape the Judean women. This can be stated in active form. AT: "that the enemy soldiers will lift up the skirts of your women and rape them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
