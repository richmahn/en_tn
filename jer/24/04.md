## translationNotes

* **the word of Yahweh came to** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:01]].
* **just like these good figs** - The good figs are those Judean exiles sent to the land of Chaldea. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
* **I will set my eyes on them for good** - AT: "I will bless them." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
* **I will build them up, and not tear them down. I will plant them, and not uproot them** - These two sentences have similar meanings. The second one strengthens the thought in the first. (See" [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]]) AT: "I will help them to prosper in Chaldea."
* **I will build them up, and not tear them down** - This expression compares the exiles to a building which Yahweh will build and not tear down. AT: "I will help them flourish in the land, and not ruin them." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **I will plant them, and not uproot them** - AT: "I will establish them in the land, and not remove them." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **they will turn to me with all their heart** - AT: "they will turn to me with their whole being" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
