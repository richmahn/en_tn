## the word of Yahweh came to ##

See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 1:1](../01/01.md).

The good figs are those Judean exiles sent to the land of Chaldea. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

## I will set my eyes on them for good ##

AT: "I will bless them." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

## I will build them up, and not tear them down. I will plant them, and not uproot them ##

These two sentences have similar meanings. The second one strengthens the thought in the first. (See" [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]]) AT: "I will help them to prosper in Chaldea."

## I will build them up, and not tear them down ##

This expression compares the exiles to a building which Yahweh will build and not tear down. AT: "I will help them flourish in the land, and not ruin them." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## I will plant them, and not uproot them ##

AT: "I will establish them in the land, and not remove them." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

AT: "they will turn to me with their whole being" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
