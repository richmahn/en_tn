# But like the bad figs that are too bad to be eaten

This simile speaks of the evil officials in Jerusalem as if they were bad figs that were too rotten to eat. Just as bad figs are useless, so these people who do not follow Yahweh are also useless. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# I will turn them into a frightening thing, a disaster ... a disgrace and a subject for proverbs, taunts, and curses

These phrases mean the same thing and emphasize how thoroughly Yahweh will judge the people of Jerusalem. They will become something that will frighten other people when they see it. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# I will send out sword, famine, and plague against them
