# Jeremiah 24 General Notes

#### Special concepts in this chapter

##### The exiles are blessed and the others punished

God will bless the people who were taken away into Babylon but punish the people left in the land because they still did not repent and turn to him. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/bless]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/repent]])
