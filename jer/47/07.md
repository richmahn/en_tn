# How can it rest ... along the sea?

Here Jeremiah is speaking. He continues speaking of the sword of Yahweh as if it were a person who could rest. Yahweh punishing the Philistines by sending the army of the north is spoken of as if Yahweh were striking the people with a sword. This can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: "It cannot rest ... along the sea." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# How can it rest when Yahweh has commanded it, when he has ordered ... the sea?

Jeremiah uses a question to mean that the sword cannot stop since Yahweh has commanded it to continue killing. This question can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: "It cannot stop, for Yahweh has commanded it. He has ordered ... the sea." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
