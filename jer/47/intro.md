# Jeremiah 47 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetry in 47:2-7.

Jeremiah's prophesies about other nations continue in this chapter. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]])

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter ####

##### Flood waters #####
This chapter uses the imagery of a flood to describe the enemies who conquer the Philistines. Their destruction will be swift and complete. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
