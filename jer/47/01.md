## floods of water are rising in the north; they will be like an overflowing river ##

The two phrases have similar meaning and are combined for emphasis. The "waters" and "river" both represent the army coming from the north (probably the Babylonians). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
