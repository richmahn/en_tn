# the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah, saying,

This idiom is used to introduce a special message from God. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Jeremiah 1:4](../01/04.md). AT: "Yahweh gave a message to Jeremiah. He said," or "Yahweh spoke this message to Jeremiah:" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# You broke a yoke of wood, but I will make instead a yoke of iron

"You broke a weak yoke but I will replace it with a yoke that you cannot break"

# Yahweh of hosts ... says this

Jeremiah often uses these words to introduce an important message from Yahweh. See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 6:6](../06/06.md).

# I have placed a yoke of iron on the neck of all of these nations to serve Nebuchadnezzar

Yahweh speaks of making nations to be slaves of Nebuchadnezzar as if he were putting yokes on oxen to make them do heavy work. AT: "I have made all of these nations slaves, and they will have to serve Nebuchadnezzar" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
