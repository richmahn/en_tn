# Just like this

"Just as Hananiah has taken the yoke off Jeremiah's neck"

# I will break from off the neck of every nation the yoke imposed by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon

Hananaiah speaks of the people being in slavery as if they were oxen on which the Babylonians had put yokes to make them do heavy work. Alternate translation: "I will make it so all nations are no longer slaves of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon" or "I will set every nation free from slavery to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# every nation

The word "nation" is a metonym for the people of that nation. Alternate translation: "the people of every nation" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

This can be translated in active form. Alternate translation: "the yoke that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has imposed" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# imposed
