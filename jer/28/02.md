# Yahweh of hosts ... says this

Jeremiah often uses these words to introduce an important message from Yahweh. See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 6:6](../06/06.md).

# I have broken the yoke imposed by the king of Babylon

Hananaiah speaks of the people being in slavery as if they were oxen on which the Babylonians had put yokes to make them do heavy work. AT: "I have made it so you are no longer slaves of the king of Babylon" or "I have set you free from slavery to the king of Babylon" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
