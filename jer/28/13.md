# You broke a yoke of wood, but I will make instead a yoke of iron

"You broke a weak yoke but I will replace it with a yoke that you cannot break"

# Yahweh of hosts ... says this

Jeremiah often uses these words to introduce an important message from Yahweh. See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 6:6](../06/06.md).
