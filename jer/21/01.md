# The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh

This idiom is used to introduce a special message from God. See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 7:1](../07/01.md), and make any changes as needed. AT: "Yahweh gave a message to Jeremiah" or "Yahweh spoke a message to Jeremiah" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# Pashhur

This is not the same Pashhur that was mentioned in [Jeremiah 20:1](../20/01.md).

# Pashhur ... Malkijah ... Maaseiah

These are names of men. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# They said to him

"Pashhur and Zephaniah said to Jeremiah"

# Seek advice from Yahweh on our behalf ... making war on us

This was a polite, but urgent request. AT: "Please speak to Yahweh for us ... attacking us"

# as in times past

"as he did in the past"

# will make him withdraw from us

"will make him go away"
