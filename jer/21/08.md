## this people ##

AT: "the people of Jerusalem"

## I am about to place you the way of life and the way of death ##

Yahweh is offering the people of Jerusalem a choice that will determine whether they live or die.

## falling on his knees before ##

AT: "surrendering to"

## closed in against ##

AT: "attacked from all sides"

## I have set my face against ##

AT: "I have determined to oppose" or "I have turned against"

## He will have his own life as his plunder ##

The one who surrenders to the Babylonians will escape with his life, even though he will lose all his possessions.

## this is Yahwehâ€™s declaration  ##

See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 1:7](../01/07.md).
