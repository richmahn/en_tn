# Jeremiah 21 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations set each line of poetry further to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetry in 21:12-14.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Jerusalem doomed #####

God will fight against Jerusalem and will use the nation of Babylon to fight his battle. If the Jews wanted to live, they needed to surrender to Babylon. Most of the Jews would have rather died than to surrender to Babylon. Usually, fighting against a Gentile nation was a sign of trust in Yahweh's power. In this instance, it was a sign of trust in Yahweh to surrender. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sign]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/trust]])
