# You planted them and they took root. They continue to produce fruit

Here Jeremiah speaks of the wicked as if they were fruit trees. Alternate translation: "They are like fruit trees that you planted, that you allow to prosper and to produce lots of fruit" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# You are near to them in their mouths, but far away from their hearts

Here "mouths" represents what a person says. And, "hearts" represents what a person thinks or feels. Also, being loyal is spoken of as if it were being near a person, and being disloyal is spoken of as if it were being far away from a person. Alternate translation: "They always say good things about you, but they do not love or respect you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
