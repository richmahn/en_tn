# Jeremiah 12 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 12:1-13, which is an extended quotation.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Jeremiah complains that evil men prosper #####

Jeremiah complains that evil men prosper. He questions Yahweh's justice. Yahweh's response: if Jeremiah is upset by the people of Anathoth, how will he face enemies in Jerusalem? (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/evil]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/justice]])

##### Yahweh's grace to the other nations #####

Yahweh gives a gracious offer to the Gentile nations. If the other nations who have been against Judah leave their idols and worship God, then God will allow them to return to their lands. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/grace]])
