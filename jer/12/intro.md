# Jeremiah 12 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetry in 12:1-13.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Jeremiah complains that evil men prosper #####

Jeremiah complains that evil men prosper. He questions Yahweh's justice. Yahweh's response: if Jeremiah is upset by the people of Anathoth, how will he face enemies in Jerusalem? (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/evil]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/justice]])

##### Yahweh's grace to the other nations #####

Yahweh gives a gracious offer to the Gentile nations. If the other nations who have been against Judah leave their idols and worship God, then God will allow them to return to their lands. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/grace]])
