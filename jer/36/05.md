# Jeremiah called ... at Jeremiah's dictation ... to him ... Jeremiah gave ... He said

It is not clear why Jeremiah is referring to himself by name here. You may translate using first person, as the UDB does. AT: "I called ... at my dictation ... to me ... I gave ... I said" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
