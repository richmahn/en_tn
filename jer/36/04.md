# Jeremiah called ... at Jeremiah's dictation ... to him ... Jeremiah gave ... He said

It is not clear why Jeremiah is referring to himself by name here. You may translate using first person, as the UDB does. Alternate translation: "I called ... at my dictation ... to me ... I gave ... I said" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# Baruch wrote in a scroll, at Jeremiah's dictation, all the words of Yahweh spoken to him

"while Jeremiah was speaking, Baruch wrote in a scroll all of Yahweh's words that Yahweh had spoken to Jeremiah"
