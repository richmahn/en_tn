# Jerahmeel ... Seraiah ... Azriel ... Shelemiah ... Abdeel

These are the names of men. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# a relative

"a relative of the king"

# Jeremiah the prophet ... hidden them

It is not clear why Jeremiah is referring to himself by name here. You may translate using first person, as the UDB does. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
