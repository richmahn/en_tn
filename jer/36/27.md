# Then the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah after ... dictation, saying,

The idiom "The word of Yahweh came" is used to introduce a special message from God. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Jeremiah 1:4](../01/04.md). Alternate translation: "Then Yahweh gave a message to Jeremiah after ... dictation. He said," or "After ... dictation, Yahweh spoke this message to Jeremiah:" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# to Jeremiah ... Jeremiah's dictation

It is not clear why Jeremiah is referring to himself by name here. You may translate using first person, as the UDB does. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# at Jeremiah's dictation

See how you translated similar words in [Jeremiah 36:4](../36/04.md).
