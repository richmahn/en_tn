# General Information:

Yahweh speaks to Jeremiah about the people of Judah. In these verses, "this people" refers to the people of Judah.

# do not pray for this people, and do not lift up a lamenting wail or say a prayer on their behalf, and do not petition me

These four clauses each mean about the same thing and are repeated for emphasis. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# lift up a lamenting wail

"cry out with sadness"

# on their behalf

"for their benefit" or "for them"

# petition me

"plead with me"
