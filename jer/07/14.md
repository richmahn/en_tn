# this house that is called by my name

This is a metonym for Yahweh's temple. It can be expressed in active form. See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 7:10](./10.md). Alternate translation: "this house that belongs to me" or "this temple where you worship me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
