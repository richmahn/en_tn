# General Information:

In these verses, "you" and "your" refer to the people of Judah.

# Connecting Statement:

Yahweh continues giving Jeremiah his message to the people of Judah.

# Yahweh of hosts ... says this

Jeremiah often uses these words to introduce an important message from Yahweh. See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 6:6](../06/06.md).

# Add your burnt offerings to your sacrifices and the meat from them

This is an ironic statement emphasizing that none of their sacrifices were acceptable to Yahweh. Alternate translation: "Go ahead and eat the burnt offerings along with your sacrifices and meat from them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])
