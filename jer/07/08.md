## translationNotes

* Yahweh continues to speak to the people of Judah through the prophet Jeremiah.
* **Behold!** - The word "Behold!" shows that the following questions are very important.
* **You are trusting in deceitful words that do not help you.** - AT: "You think that I will save Jerusalem because I will protect my temple. But that is a lie!"
* **Do you steal, kill, and commit adultery?** - AT: "You steal, kill, and commit adultery" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **And do you swear deceitfully and offer incense to Baal and walk after other gods whom you have not known?** - AT: "You lie even in your oaths and worship Baal and other new gods."  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **Then do you come and stand before me in this house where my name is proclaimed and say, ‘We are saved,” so you can do all of these abominations?** - AT: "Then you come to my house and say 'Yahweh will save us" so that you can continue to sin greatly." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **Is not this house ... a den of bandits in your eyes?** - AT: "This house is ... a den of bandits in your eyes!" or "You act as though you think my house ... should be a place where bandits can go to hide!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **bandits** - "robbers" or "people who steal things from others"
* **Yahweh’s declaration** - See how you translated this in [:en:bible:notes:jer:01:07]].
