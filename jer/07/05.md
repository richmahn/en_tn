# Connecting Statement:

Yahweh continues giving Jeremiah his message to the people of Judah.

# make your ways and practices good

"improve your ways and practices." See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 7:3](../07/03.md).

# completely execute justice

The abstract noun "justice" can be translated using the verb "judge." Alternate translation: "judge rightly" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
