# Connecting Statement:

Yahweh continues giving Jeremiah his message to the people of Judah.

# Yahweh of hosts ... says this

Jeremiah often uses these words to introduce an important message from Yahweh. See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 6:6](../06/06.md).

# Make your ways and practices good, and I will let you continue

"If you improve your ways and your practices, then I will let you continue"

# in this place

This means in the land of Judah, not in the temple.

# Do not entrust yourself to deceitful words and say

The reflexive pronoun "yourself" emphasizes the personal risk to the Israelites. AT: "Do not trust in deceitful words to protect you, saying" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns]])

# Temple of Yahweh! Temple of Yahweh! Temple of Yahweh!

It is implied that, since the temple belongs to Yahweh and represents his presence, he will protect it and the people of Judah will be safe. Possible meanings for why "Temple of Yahweh" is repeated three times are 1) it was repeated for emphasis or 2) it was repeated as part of a temple liturgy. AT: "This is the temple of Yahweh so it is absolutely certain that no one will destroy it and we are safe." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
