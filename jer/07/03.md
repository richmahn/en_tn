# Connecting Statement:

Yahweh continues giving Jeremiah his message to the people of Judah.

# Yahweh of hosts ... says this

Jeremiah often uses these words to introduce an important message from Yahweh. See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 6:6](../06/06.md).

# Make your ways and practices good, and I will let you continue

"If you improve your ways and your practices, then I will let you continue"

# in this place

This means in the land of Judah, not in the temple.
