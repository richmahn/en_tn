This is the message that Yahweh wants Jeremiah to give to the people of Judah.

## Make your ways and practices good ##

"Lead a good life and do good deeds"

## this place ##

This refers to the land of Israel, which has the temple as its center.

## Do not entrust yourself to deceitful words and say ##

"Do not let yourselves trust in false words by saying"

## Temple of Yahweh! Temple of Yahweh! Temple of Yahweh! ##

The people repeat this phrase three times to emphasize the point. It is implied that, since the temple belongs to Yahweh, he will be able to protect it and the people of Judah will be safe. AT: "This is the temple of Yahweh so it is absolutely certain that no one can destroy it and we are safe." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
