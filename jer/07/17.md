# Do you not see what they are doing in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?

This question expects a positive answer and is asked to bring these things to Jeremiah's attention. They can be expressed as a statement. Alternate translation: "Look at what they are doing in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
