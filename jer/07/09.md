# Do you steal, kill, and commit adultery? Do you swear ... and walk after other gods whom you have not known?

These questions expect a positive answer to make the point that God knows the sins they are committing. This can be translated as a statement. AT: "You steal, kill, and commit adultery. You swear ... and walk after other gods whom you have not known." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# swear deceitfully

"lie even in your oaths"

# walk after other gods

Here walking after is a metonym for following after with the intent to serve and obey. See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 7:6](./06.md). AT: "serve other gods" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
