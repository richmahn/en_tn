# Ever since the day when your ancestors went out from the land of Egypt until this day

This is a generalization that means over this entire period of time, not every day during this period of time. Alternate translation: "From the time your ancestors went out from the land of Egypt until now" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# I persisted in sending them

"I sent them again and again" or "I repeatedly sent them"
