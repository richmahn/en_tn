# General Information:

The words "you" and "your" in these verses refer to the people of Judah. "They" refers to the ancestors of the people of Judah.

# Connecting Statement:

Yahweh continues giving Jeremiah his message to the people of Judah.

# they did not listen or pay attention

These phrases mean about the same thing and are repeated for emphasis. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# by their own stubborn plans of their wicked hearts

"according to their own plans because they were wicked and stubborn"

# they went backwards, not forward

This is a metaphor. Possible meanings are 1) they refused to pay attention to Yahweh, instead of eagerly obeying him. Alternate translation: "they went away from me instead of drawing closer to me" or 2) they got worse and worse instead of improving. Alternate translation: "they got worse instead of better" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
