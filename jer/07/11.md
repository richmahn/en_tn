# Is this house, which carries my name, a den of bandits in your eyes?

This question expects a positive answer to make the point that God knows what they think about Yahweh's temple. This can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: "This house, which carries my name, is a den of bandits in your eyes!" or "You act as though you think this house, which is called by my name, should be a place where bandits can go to hide!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# this house, which carries my name

Yahweh's temple is spoken of as if it was carrying the name of Yahweh. This has a similar meaning to "this house that is called by my name" in the previous verse. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# bandits

violent people who steal and destroy

# But behold, I have seen it

"But I certainly have seen what you are doing"

# this is Yahweh's declaration

Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 1:8](../01/08.md). Alternate translation: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
