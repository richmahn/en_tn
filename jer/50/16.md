# General Information:

Yahweh continues to tell the other nations to attack Babylon.

# the farmer who sows seed and the one who uses a sickle

These people collectively represent all the farmers and harvesters of Babylon.

# the one who uses a sickle at the time of harvest

A "sickle" is a farm tool that people use to harvest grain. Together with the previous phrase, Yahweh is saying that all planting and harvesting will stop in Babylon.

# Let each person turn back to his own people ... let them flee to their own land

These two phrases mean basically the same thing. Together they strengthen the command for foreigners to flee from Babylon back to their own countries. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# from the oppressor's sword

Here the word "sword" refers to the armies that will attack Babylon. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
