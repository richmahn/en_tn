Yahweh tells the enemies of Babylon how to conquer.

## a sickle at the time of harvest ##

This is farm tool used in harvesting grain. Yahweh compares harvesting to destroying Babylon. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## Let each person turn back â€¦  to their own land ##

This is the same idea expressed in two different ways. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
