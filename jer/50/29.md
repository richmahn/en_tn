# General Information:

Yahweh continues telling how to destroy the people of Babylon and Chaldea.

# the archers ... those who bend their bows

These phrases refer to the same people and are repeated for poetic effect. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# her ... her ... she

The words "her" and "she" refer to Babylon.

# let no one escape

This can be stated in positive form. Alternate translation: "capture or kill every person"

# Do to her by the measure she has used

The evil things the Babylonians did to Israel are spoken of as if Babylon measured them. Alternate translation: "Measure out punishment for her with the same amount she used to punish Israel" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
