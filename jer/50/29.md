# General Information:

Yahweh continues telling how to destroy the people of Babylon and Chaldea.

# Summon the archers against Babylon

Yahweh is speaking to the enemies of Babylon. This can be made clear. AT: "You enemies of Babylon, summon the archers against her" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# the archers ... those who bend their bows

These phrases refer to the same people and are repeated for poetic effect. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# her ... her ... she

The words "her" and "she" refer to Babylon.

# let no one escape

This can be stated in positive form. AT: "capture or kill every person"

# Do to her by the measure she has used

The evil things the Babylonians did to Israel are spoken of as if Babylon measured them. AT: "Measure out punishment for her with the same amount she used to punish Israel" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# her young men will fall

"they will kill her young men"

# all her fighting men will be destroyed

This can be stated in active form. AT: "I will destroy all her fighting men" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# this is Yahweh's declaration

Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 1:8](../01/07.md). AT: "this is what Yahweh declares" or "this is what I, Yahweh, declare" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
