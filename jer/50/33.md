# General Information:

Yahweh now speaks through Jeremiah about Israel and Judah.

# Yahweh of hosts says this

Jeremiah often uses these words to introduce an important message from Yahweh. See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 6:6](../06/06.md).

# The people of Israel are oppressed, together with the people of Judah

This can be stated in active form. AT: "The Babylonians are oppressing the people of Israel and Judah" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# captured them

The word "them" refers to the people of Israel and Judah who were captured and taken into exile.

# He will truly plead their case

Yahweh is spoken of as if he were a lawyer who represents the people of Israel in court. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# in order to bring rest to the land

Here "the land" is a metonym for the people who live in the land. AT: "in order that the people who live in Israel might live in peace" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# bring rest ... bring strife

These two terms represent opposite ideas and bring a strong contrast to how Yahweh will treat Israel and Babylon.

# bring rest

"give peace"
