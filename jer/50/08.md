# General Information:

Yahweh is speaking to his people in captivity in Babylon.

# Leave from the midst of Babylon

This command is addressed to the people of Israel who were in exile in Babylon.

# be like male goats that leave

Male goats tend to be more independent than the rest of the flock. Possible meanings are 1) they should be the first to leave Babylon or 2) they should lead the rest of the Israelites away from Babylon. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
