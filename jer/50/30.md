# her young men will fall

"they will kill her young men"

# all her fighting men will be destroyed

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "I will destroy all her fighting men" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# this is Yahweh's declaration

Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 1:8](../01/08.md). Alternate translation: "this is what Yahweh declares" or "this is what I, Yahweh, declare" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
