# Yahweh has opened his armory and is bringing out the weapons for carrying out his anger

Yahweh's anger that causes him to send enemies against Babylon is spoken of as if Yahweh had an armory and weapons. To open an armory is a metonym for preparing for battle. AT: "Yahweh has prepared for war and is sending the nations to attack Babylon in his anger" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
