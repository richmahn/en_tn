# He will truly plead their case

Yahweh is spoken of as if he were a lawyer who represents the people of Israel in court. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# in order to bring rest to the land

Here "the land" is a metonym for the people who live in the land. Alternate translation: "in order that the people who live in Israel might live in peace" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# bring rest ... bring strife

These two terms represent opposite ideas and bring a strong contrast to how Yahweh will treat Israel and Babylon.

# bring rest

"give peace"
