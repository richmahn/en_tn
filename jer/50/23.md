# General Information:

Yahweh speaks to the people of Babylon.

# How the hammer of all the lands has been cut apart and destroyed

The army of Babylon is spoken of as if it were a hammer. The destruction of this army is spoken of as if the hammer was to be cut up and destroyed. This can be stated as a simile. Alternate translation: "The mighty army of Babylon that conquered all the nations is like a hammer that will be broken into pieces and destroyed" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# How Babylon has become a destroyed place among the nations

Babylon was a nation like the other nations, but it will become a complete ruin, totally destroyed.
