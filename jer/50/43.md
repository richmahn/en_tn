# General Information:

This verse is almost identical to [Jeremiah 6:24](../06/23.md). See how you translated that verse.

# his hands fell limp in distress

"his hands were weak because he was anxious"

# Anguish seized him

Feeling great anguish is spoken of as if anguish grabs the king of Babylon. AT: "He felt terrible anguish" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Anguish

"suffering and grief that would bring one to tears"

# like a woman giving birth

The anguish that they feel because the enemy coming to attack them is compared to the anguish that a woman feels when she is about to give birth to a baby. AT: "like a woman who is about to give birth" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
