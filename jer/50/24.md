# I have set a trap for you and you were taken

The destruction of Babylon is spoken of as if Yahweh had caught them in a trap like an animal. Alternate translation: "I set a trap and caught you in it as a hunter catches an animal" or "You people of Babylon, I have set a trap for you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# you were taken ... You were found and captured

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "I have captured you ... I found you and captured you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
