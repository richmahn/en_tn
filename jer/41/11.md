# Johanan ... Kareah

See how you translated these men's names in [Jeremiah 40:13](../40/13.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# Ishmael son of Nethaniah ... found him

Here "Ishmael" represents himself and all of his men. Alternate translation: "Ishmael and his men ... found them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
