# In the past Yahweh called you a leafy olive tree

In the Old Testament people were often compared to trees or plants. Those who were prosperous and healthy were spoken of as leafy, fruitful tree. AT: "In the past Yahweh said that you were like a leafy olive tree" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# will light a fire on it

This expression continues the metaphor of the tree. The fire stands for the destruction of the people. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# that will sound like the roar of a storm

This compares the sound of the raging fire to the sound of a severe storm. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# its branches will be broken

This can be stated in active form. AT: "it will break off your branches" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
