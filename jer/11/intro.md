# Jeremiah 11 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 11:15-17,20-21, which are extended quotations.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### The covenant #####

The covenant Yahweh made with Moses is prominent in this chapter. Because the people disobeyed this covenant, God will not help them. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/covenant]])
