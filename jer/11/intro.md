# Jeremiah 11 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations indent each line of poetry to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetry in 11:15-17, 20.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### The covenant #####

The covenant Yahweh made with Moses is prominent in this chapter. Because the people disobeyed this covenant, God will not help them. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/covenant]])
