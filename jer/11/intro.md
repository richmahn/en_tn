# Jeremiah 11 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 11:15-17, 20.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### The covenant #####

The covenant Yahweh made with Moses is prominent in this chapter. Because the people disobeyed this covenant, God will not help them. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/covenant]])
