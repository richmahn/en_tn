Jeremiah often uses these words to introduce an important message from Yahweh. See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 6:6](../06/06.md).

# See

This word is used here to draw someone's attention to what is said next. AT: "Listen"

# vigorous young men

men at the strongest time of their lives

# will die by the sword

Here the "sword" represents battle. AT: "will die in battle" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
