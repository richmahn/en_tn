# Why is my beloved one, the one who has had so many wicked intentions, in my house?

Yahweh uses this rhetorical question to emphasize that the people Judah no longer have a right to be in his temple. This question can be written as a statement. AT: "My beloved one, the one who has had so many wicked intentions, should not be in my house." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# is my beloved one, the one who has had

The people of Judah are spoken of as if they were a single woman greatly beloved. AT: "are the people whom I love, those who have had" or "are the people of Judah whom I love, who have had" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
