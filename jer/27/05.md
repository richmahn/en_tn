# by my great strength and my raised arm

The phrase "raised arm" refers to great power and intensifies the first phrase. Alternate translation: "by my very great power" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# I give it to anyone who is right in my eyes

Another possible meaning is "I give it to anyone I want to."

# I ... am giving all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar ... servant

The hand is a metonym for the power that the hand exercises, and the word "lands" is a metonym for the people who live in those lands. Alternate translation: "I ... am putting the people who live in all these lands under the power of Nebuchadnezzar ... servant" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
