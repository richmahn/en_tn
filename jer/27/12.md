# General Information:

Yahweh continues to speak through Jeremiah to the king of Judah.

# Place your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon

Being the king's slave is spoken of as being an animal onto the shoulders of which the king puts a yoke so it can do heavy work. See how similar words were translated in [Jeremiah 27:8](../27/08.md).

# Place your necks

The word "your" refers to Zedekiah and the people of Judah and so is plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
