# General Information:

Yahweh continues to speak through Jeremiah to the king of Judah.

# Place your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon

Being the king's slave is spoken of as being an animal onto the shoulders of which the king puts a yoke so it can do heavy work. See how similar words were translated in [Jeremiah 27:8](../28/08.md).

# Place your necks

The word "your" refers to Zedekiah and the people of Judah and so is plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# Why will you die ... king of Babylon?

Jeremiah uses this question to warn the king that his actions will lead to his death. AT: "For if you do not do this, you will surely die ... king." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
