Jeremiah continues to speak the words of Yahweh.

## The objects belonging to Yahweh's house are being returned from Babylon now! ##

AT: "People from Babylon are bringing back all the gold items that they took from Yahweh's temple!"

## Why should this city become a ruin? ##

AT: "This entire city will be destroyed." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## If they are prophets... ##

If what they speak is true, then they should be praying that my words do not come to pass and that the temple objects and leaders remain in Jerusalem.
