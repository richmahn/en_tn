# Then send them out

This seems to mean that Jeremiah was to send a set of fetters and yoke to each king listed. But some versions of the Bible translate this as "Then send out messages."

# Send them by the hand of those kings' ambassadors who ... Judah

The hand is a synecdoche for the person. AT: "Have those kings' ambassadors, who ... Judah, take them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# Yahweh of hosts ... says this

Jeremiah often uses these words to introduce an important message from Yahweh. See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 6:6](../06/06.md).
