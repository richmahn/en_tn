# that does not put its neck under the yoke of the king

Being the king's slave is spoken of as being an animal on to the shoulders of which the king puts a yoke so it can do heavy work. Alternate translation: "and whose people do not willingly become slaves of the king" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# I have destroyed it by his hand

The hand here could be a metonym for Nebuchadnezzar's power, or it could be a metonym for Nebuchadnezzar's armies. Alternate translation: "I have used Nebuchadnezzar's power to destroy it" or "I have enabled Nebuchadnezzar's armies to destroy i" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
