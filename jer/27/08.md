# that does not put its neck under the yoke of the king

Being the king's slave is spoken of as being an animal on to the shoulders of which the king puts a yoke so it can do heavy work. AT: "and whose people do not willingly become slaves of the king" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# this is Yahweh's declaration

Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 1:8](../01/07.md). AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# I have destroyed it by his hand

The hand here could be a metonym for Nebuchadnezzar's power, or it could be a metonym for Nebuchadnezzar's armies. AT: "I have used Nebuchadnezzar's power to destroy it" or "I have enabled Nebuchadnezzar's armies to destroy i" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
