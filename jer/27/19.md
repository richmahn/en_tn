# General Information:

Jeremiah continues to bring the message of Yahweh.

# Yahweh of hosts says this

Jeremiah often uses these words to introduce an important message from Yahweh. See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 6:6](../06/06.md).

# the pillars, the large basin known as "The Sea" and its base

These were objects that were in the temple. "The Sea" was a large bronze bowl.

# Jehoiachin

The Hebrew text has "Jeconiah," which is a variation of the name "Jehoiachin." Many modern versions have "Jehoiachin" in order to make it clear that the same king is being referred to.
