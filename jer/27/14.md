Yahweh continues to speak through Jeremiah to the king and people of Judah.

## Do not listen to the words... ##

Yahweh is warning the people about all the false prophets that He did not send that are lying to them.

## For I have not sent them out" ##

"For I have not sent them"

## in my name ##

This phrase means speaking with Yahweh's power and authority or as his representative. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## I will drive you out  ##

AT: "I will send you away from your home country"
