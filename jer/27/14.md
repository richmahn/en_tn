# General Information:

Yahweh continues to speak through Jeremiah to the king and people of Judah.

# Do not listen to the words

Yahweh is warning the people about all the false prophets that he did not send and that are lying to them.

# For I have not sent them out

"For I have not sent them"

# this is Yahweh's declaration

Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 1:8](../01/07.md). AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# they are prophesying deceit in my name

The phrase "in my name" represents speaking with Yahweh's power and authority or as his representative. Here these prophets claim that they received their message from Yahweh, but that had not. The abstract noun "deceit" can be translated as the verb "deceiving." AT: "they say they are speaking for me when they prophesy, but they are deceiving you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# I will drive you out

"I will force you to leave your home country"
