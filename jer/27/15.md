# they are prophesying deceit in my name

The phrase "in my name" represents speaking with Yahweh's power and authority or as his representative. Here these prophets claim that they received their message from Yahweh, but that had not. The abstract noun "deceit" can be translated as the verb "deceiving." Alternate translation: "they say they are speaking for me when they prophesy, but they are deceiving you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# I will drive you out
