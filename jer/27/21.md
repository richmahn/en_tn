# General Information:

Jeremiah continues to speak the words of Yahweh.

# Yahweh of hosts ... says this

Jeremiah often uses these words to introduce an important message from Yahweh. See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 6:6](../06/06.md).

# the house of the king of Judah

The word "house" has a range of possible meanings. In this case it refers to the royal palace there the king lived. AT: "the palace of the king of Judah"

# They will be brought to Babylon

This can be translated in active form. AT: "People will bring them to Babylon" or "I will bring them to Babylon" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# this is Yahweh's declaration

Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 1:8](../01/07.md). AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# I will bring them up

The reader should understand that Yahweh will have people carry them up.
