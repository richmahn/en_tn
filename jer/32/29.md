Yahweh continues speaking to Jeremiah.

## in order to provoke me ##

"which made me very angry"

## doing evil before my eyes ##

AT: "doing what I consider evil" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## since their youth ##

"from the time that they became a nation" (UDB)

## the practices of their hands ##

AT: "the evil things they have done" (See:[[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
