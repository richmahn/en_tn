Yahweh continues speaking to Jeremiah.

## They turned their backs to me instead of their faces ##

AT: "My people ignored me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

## to receive correction ##

"to learn from me"

## their detestable things ##

"their idols which I hate"

## the house where my name was called ##

AT: "the house that belongs to me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]] [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## Valley of Ben Hinnom ##

See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 7:31](../07/31.md).

## something that never even was thought of in my heart ##

AT: "something that never came up in my mind" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
