# General Information:

Yahweh continues speaking to Jeremiah about what the people of Israel had done.

# They turned their backs to me instead of their faces

One turns one's face to someone to show that one is listening, and one's back to show that one refuses to listen. AT: "Instead of listening carefully to me, they refused to listen at all" or "They refused to listen" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])

# to receive correction

"to learn how to act correctly"

# their abominable idols

"their idols which I hate"

# the house that is called by my name

Here "name" represents Yahweh. This can be translated in active form. AT: "the house that belongs to me" or "the building in which they worship me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# Valley of Ben Hinnom

See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 7:31](../07/31.md).

# It never entered my mind

Here "mind" refers to Yahweh's thoughts. AT: "I never thought at all" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
