# Woe, Lord Yahweh! Look!

The word "woe" here indicates that in this prayer Jeremiah is sad, complaining or lamenting. The word "look" here indicates that the next words are an introduction or background for the most important part of the prayer. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])

# by your great strength and with your raised arm

The phrase "raised arm" is a metonym for the strength of the arm, so the words "your great strength" and "your raised arm" form a doublet. Alternate translation: "by your great power" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
