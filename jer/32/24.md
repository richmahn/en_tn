Jeremiah continues praying to Yahweh.

# The siege mounds have reached up to the city to capture it

The large piles of dirt and rocks that the enemy built around the city so they could stand on them and attack it are spoken of as if they were the attackers themselves reaching out to capture the city. Alternate translation: "The enemy's seige mounds are so close to the city that the enemy will be able to capture the city" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# because of sword

The word "sword" is a metonym for war, where soldiers use swords. Alternate translation: "because soldiers will attack" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# famine, and plague

These abstract nouns can be translated with verbal phrases. Alternate translation: "people have no food to eat, and everyone is weak from being ill" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# the city has been given into the hand of the Chaldeans

Here "hand" means power or control. This can be translated in active form. Alternate translation: "you have given Jerusalem to the Chaldean army" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# happening, and see, you are watching

"happening, as you can see very well"
