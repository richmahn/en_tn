Yahweh continues speaking to Jeremiah.

## For this city has been a provocation of my wrath and fury since the day that they built it. It has been that right up to this present day. ##

The words "wrath" and "fury" mean basically the same thing and are combined for emphasis. AT: "For the people of Jerusalem have made me very angry since the day they built their city until today." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## from before my face ##

AT: "from my presence" or "completely" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
