# The word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah, saying,

This idiom is used to introduce a special message from God. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Jeremiah 1:4](../01/04.md). AT: "Yahweh gave a message to Jeremiah. He said," or "Yahweh spoke this message to Jeremiah:" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# came to Jeremiah

It is not clear why Jeremiah is referring to himself by name here. You may translate using first person, as the UDB does. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# Is anything too difficult for me to do?

Yahweh uses a question to emphasize that he can do anything. This question can be translated as a statement. AT: "Nothing is too difficult for me to do." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# See, I am about to give

"Listen carefully! I am the one who will give"

# give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans

Yahweh speaks of the city as if it were a small object that he could put into a person's hand. The word "hand" is a metonym for the power that the hand puts into action. AT: "put this city under the power of the Chaldeans" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
