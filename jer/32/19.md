# General Information:

Jeremiah continues praying the introduction of his lament to Yahweh.

# for your eyes are open to all the ways of people

Open eyes are a metonym for what the person sees. How a person lives is spoken of as if he were walking on a path. AT: "You see everything that people do" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# to give to each man what his conduct and deeds deserve

The abstract nouns "conduct" and "deeds," which are similar in meaning, can be translated as verbs. AT: "and will reward everyone according to how good or evil the things they do are" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# You did signs and wonders in the land of Egypt

This refers to an event in the past when God used his power to free the people of Israel from slavery in Egypt.

# To this present day

"To this day"

# among all mankind

"among all people"

# you have made your name famous

Here "name" refers to God's reputation. AT: "you have made yourself famous" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# with a strong hand, with a raised arm

The phrase "strong hand" is a metonym for strength, and the phrase "raised arm" is a metonym for the strength of the arm, so the phrases "strong hand" and "raised arm" form a doublet. AT: "by your great strength" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
