# General Information:

Jeremiah continues praying the introduction to his lament to Yahweh.

# for your eyes are open to all the ways of people

Open eyes are a metonym for what the person sees. How a person lives is spoken of as if he were walking on a path. Alternate translation: "You see everything that people do" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# to give to each man what his conduct and deeds deserve

The abstract nouns "conduct" and "deeds," which are similar in meaning, can be translated as verbs. Alternate translation: "and will reward everyone according to how good or evil the things they do are" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
