# he will certainly be given into the hand of the king of Babylon

The word "hand" is a metonym for the power or control that the hand exercises. This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "I will certainly put him under the control of the king of Babylon" or "I will certainly allow the king of Babylon to do whatever he wants with him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# His mouth will speak to the king's mouth, and his eyes will see the king's eyes

Here "mouth" and "eyes" represent the whole person. Alternate translation: "Zedekiah himself will see and directly speak with Nebuchadnezzar" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
