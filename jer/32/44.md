# write in sealed scrolls. They will assemble witnesses

The "sealed scrolls" are the deeds that a person would sign to purchase land. Other people would be witnesses to confirm the purchase.

# this is Yahweh's declaration

Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 1:8](../01/08.md). AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
