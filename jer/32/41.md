# General Information:

Yahweh continues speaking.

# doing good to them

Here "them" refers to the people of Israel.

# I will faithfully plant them in this land

Yahweh speaks of having his people live in the land forever as if he were planting plants in a garden. Alternate translation: "I will permanently settle the Israelites in this land" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# with all my heart and all my life

Together, these two phrases form an idiomatic expression that refers to a person's entire being. Alternate translation: "with all that I am" or "wholeheartedly" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
