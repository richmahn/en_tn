# The word came to Jeremiah from Yahweh

This idiom is used to announce that God gave messages to Jeremiah. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Jeremiah 1:2](../01/01.md) AT: "Yahweh gave messages to Jeremiah" or "Yahweh spoke to Jeremiah" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar

"after Zedekiah had been king of Judah for more than nine years and Nebuchadnezzar had been king for more than seventeen years"

# Jeremiah the prophet was imprisoned

This can be translated in active form. AT: "they were keeping Jeremiah as a prisoner" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# Jeremiah the prophet was imprisoned

It is not clear why Jeremiah is referring to himself by name here. You may translate using first person, as the UDB does. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# the courtyard of the guard at the house of the king of Judah

This was an open area attached to the king's palace that was surrounded by buildings and in which they kept prisoners.
