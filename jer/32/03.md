# Zedekiah king of Judah had imprisoned him

It might be best to translate so that the reader understands that other people helped Zedekiah do this. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# had imprisoned him

Here "him" refers to Jeremiah. It is not clear why Jeremiah is referring to himself by name here. You may translate using first person, as the UDB does. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# Why do you prophesy and say

Zekekiah uses a question to rebuke Jeremiah. Alternate translation: "It is wrong for you to continue prophesying and saying" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# I am about to give over this city into the hand of the king of Babylon

Yahweh speaks of the city as if it were a small object that one person could give to another. The word "hand" is a metonym for the power or control that the hand exercises. Alternate translation: "I am about to put this city under the control of the king of Babylon" or "I am about to allow the king of Babylon to do whatever he wants with this city" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# he will capture it

It might be best to translate so that the reader understands that other people would help the king of Babylon take control of the city.
