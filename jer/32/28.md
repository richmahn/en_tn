# See, I am about to give

"Listen carefully! I am the one who will give"

# give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans

Yahweh speaks of the city as if it were a small object that he could put into a person's hand. The word "hand" is a metonym for the power that the hand puts into action. AT: "put this city under the power of the Chaldeans" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
