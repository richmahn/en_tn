Jeremiah continues praying to Yahweh.

## gave them ##

"gave the people of Israel"

## a land flowing with milk and honey ##

See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 11:3](../11/03.md).

## But they did not obey your voice ##

AT: "But they did not obey what you said" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
