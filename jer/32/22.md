# General Information:

Jeremiah continues praying to Yahweh. He ends the introduction to his lament ("Woe," [Jeremiah 32:17](./16.md)) with the words "took possession of it" and begins the lament with "but they did not obey."

# gave them

"gave the people of Israel"

# land flowing with milk and honey

"land where milk and honey flow." God spoke of the land being good for animals and plants as if the milk and honey from those animals and plants were flowing through the land. See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 11:5](../11/05.md). Alternate translation: "land that is excellent for raising livestock and growing crops" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
