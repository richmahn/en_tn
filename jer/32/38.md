Yahweh continues speaking.

## one heart and one way to honor me ##

This means there will be unity among the people of Israel and they will worship only Yahweh. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## perpetual covenant ##

"everlasting agreement" or "eternal agreement"

## so I will not turn from after them ##

## and place honor for me in their hearts ##

AT: "and so that they will honor me"

## So they will no longer turn away from following me ##
