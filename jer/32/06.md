# Jeremiah said

It is not clear why Jeremiah is referring to himself by name here. You may translate using first person, as the UST does. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,

This idiom is used to introduce a special message from God. See how you translated it in [Jeremiah 1:4](../01/04.md). Alternate translation: "Yahweh gave me a message. He said, 'Look" or "Yahweh spoke this message to me: 'Look" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
