# 'Look, Hanamel son of Shallum your uncle is coming to you and will say, "Buy my field that is in Anathoth for yourself, for the right to buy it belongs to you."'"

The long quotation that begins with the words "The word of Yahweh" in verse 6 ends here. You may translate this as indirect speech. Alternate translation: "Jeremiah said that the word of Yahweh had come to him and told him that Hanamel son of Shallum his uncle was coming to him and would tell him to buy his uncle's field that was in Anathoth for himself, for the right to buy it belonged to Jeremiah."
