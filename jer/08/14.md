Yahweh continues his message by telling us what the people of Judah will say at the time of their punishment.

## Why are we sitting here ##

AT: "We should not stay here." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## Come together; let us go to the fortified cities ##

See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 4:4](../04/04.md).

## fortified cities ##

“the cities with high walls and soldiers to defend it”

## and we will become silent there in death ##

AT: "and we will die there." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])

## For Yahweh our God will silence us ##

AT: "because Yahweh our God will put us to death."

## He will make us drink poison ##

“He will make us drink poison” refers to God's judgment. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

## but see, there will be ##

“but understand, there will be”

## but there will be nothing good ##

"but nothing good will happen"
