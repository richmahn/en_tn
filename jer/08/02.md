# will spread them out

The word "them" refers to the bones of the people listed in the previous verse.

# that they have followed and served, that they have walked after and sought, and that they have worshiped

The word "they" here refers to the people of Judah. These three phrases mean about the same thing and are repeated for emphasis. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# walked after

This is a metaphor for serving or worshiping. See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 2:23](../02/23.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# The bones will not be gathered or buried again

This can be expressed in active form. Alternate translation: "No one will gather their bones or bury them again" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# They will be like dung on the surface of the earth

The bones are compared to dung on the ground both to emphasize that they will be disgusting and because they will not be buried. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# on the surface of the earth

"all over the ground"
