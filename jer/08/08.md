* **Why do you say, “We are wise! And the law of Yahweh is with us”?** - "Why do you say, we are wise! And we have the law of Yahweh?" AT: "You should not say that you are wise and that you have the law of Yahweh." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **Why do you say** - The "you" here refers to the people of Judah.
* **The deceitful pen of the scribes has created deceit** - The pen represents the words that the scribes write. AT: "The false things that the scribes have been writing have given you false ideas about the law of Yahweh." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
* **The wise men will be ashamed** - "These men who think they are wise will feel ashamed" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
* **They are dismayed and trapped** - "Enemies will defeat them and take them away"
* **so what use is their wisdom?** - AT: "so their so called wisdom does not do them any good."
* **those who will possess them** - "the people who will take control of their land"
