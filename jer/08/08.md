These are Yahweh's words about the people of Judah.

## Why do you say, “We are wise! And the law of Yahweh is with us”? ##

"Why do you say, we are wise! And we have the law of Yahweh?" AT: "You should not say that you are wise and that you have the law of Yahweh." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## Why do you say ##

The "you" here refers to the people of Judah.

## The deceitful pen of the scribes has created deceit ##

The pen represents the words that the scribes write. AT: "The false things that the scribes have been writing have given you false ideas about the law of Yahweh." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## The wise men will be ashamed ##

"These men who think they are wise will feel ashamed" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])

## They are dismayed and trapped ##

"Enemies will defeat them and take them away"

## so what use is their wisdom? ##

AT: "so their so called wisdom does not do them any good."

## those who will possess them ##

"the people who will take control of their land"

## for from the youngest...all of them practice deceit ##

See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 6:13](../06/13.md).
