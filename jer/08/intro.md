# Jeremiah 08 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations set each line of poetry farher to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetry in 8:5-22.

The prophecy revealed to Jeremiah is recorded in 8:5-9:12. Despite covering more than one chapter, this should be seen as one unit. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/reveal]])

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter ####

##### Hyperbole #####
The author frequently uses hyperbole in this chapter to describe the complete destruction of Jerusalem. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
