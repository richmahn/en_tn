# Jeremiah 08 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 8:5-22, which are extended quotations.

The prophecy revealed to Jeremiah is recorded in 8:5-9:12. Despite covering more than one chapter, this should be seen as one unit. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/reveal]])

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter ####

##### Hyperbole #####
The author frequently uses hyperbole in this chapter to describe the complete destruction of Jerusalem. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
