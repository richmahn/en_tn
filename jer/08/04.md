## So say ##

Yahweh is speaking to Jeremiah.

## to them ##

"to the people of Judah"

## Does anyone fall and not get up? ##

AT:  "When someone falls, he gets back up." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]]).

## Does anyone get lost and not try to return? ##

AT: "When someone is lost, he tries to return to the right path."

## Why has this people, Jerusalem, turned away in permanent faithlessness? ##

Yahweh uses this question to emphasize that the way that the people of Judah are acting does not make sense. AT: "It does not make sense that this people of Jerusalem have turned away in permanent faithlessness."

## Jerusalem ##

The word "Jerusalem" refers to the people of Judah. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

## hold on to treachery ##

"continue to worship false gods" or "cling to lies"
