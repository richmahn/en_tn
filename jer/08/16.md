# General Information:

The words "his" and "they" in these verses refer to the enemies of Judah.

# Connecting Statement:

Yahweh continues his message about the punishment coming to Judah.

# The snorting of his stallions is heard from Dan

This can be expressed in active form. AT: "The people of Dan hear the snorting of his stallions" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# snorting

a loud sound that a horse makes with its nose

# stallions

adult male horses

# The whole earth shakes

This is an exaggeration that is a metaphor for the people of Judah trembling with fear. AT: "All the people of the land shake with fear" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# at the sound of the neighing of his strong horses

"when they hear the sound of the enemy's strong horses"

# neighing

a sound that a horse makes

# they will come and consume

Here the word "consume" means to eat up. It is an idiom for how the enemies come and destroy the land and its inhabitants. AT: "they will come and destroy" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
