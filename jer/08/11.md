These are Yahweh's words about the people of Judah.

## For they treated the fracture of the daughter of my people...says Yahweh ##

See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 6:13](../06/13.md).

## the leaf will wither ##

"the leaf will dry up"

## and what I have given to them will pass away ##

The meaning of the hebrew is uncertain. Possible meanings are 1) "I gave instructions to my people, but my people disobeyed the instructions" or 2) "therefore, I have given these people over to their enemies, so their enemies can trample over them."
