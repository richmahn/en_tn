# The wise men will be ashamed

This is irony because the wise men are normally honored for their wisdom. AT: "Those men who think they are wise will feel ashamed" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])

# dismayed

terrified or shattered

# Behold!

"Pay attention!"

# so what use is their wisdom?

This question expects a negative answer and is intended to make the hearers think about how little what they consider wisdom is really worth when they reject Yahweh's word. AT: "so what they think is wise does not do them any good." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
