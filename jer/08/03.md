# where I have driven them

The word "them" refers to the people of Judah.

# this is the declaration of Yahweh of hosts

Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how similar words are translated in [Jeremiah 1:8](../01/08.md). Alternate translation: "this is what Yahweh of hosts has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh of hosts, have declared" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
