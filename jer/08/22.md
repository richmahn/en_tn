# Is there no medicine in Gilead? Is there no healer there? Why will the healing of the daughter of my people not happen?

These questions are asked to make the point that the people of Judah have not been saved. Alternate translation: "There is medicine in Gilead, and there are healers there, so tell me why the healing of my dear people will not happen." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
