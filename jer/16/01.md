# They will be like dung on the ground

The sons and daughters born in the land are compared to dung on the ground to emphasize that they will be disgusting and that no one will bury them. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Jeremiah 8:2](../08/01.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
