# who listens to me

"who does what I tell him to do"

# throw you from this land

Yahweh speaks of forcefully removing the people from the land as if he were throwing them from the land. AT: "force you to leave this land and go" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# by day and night

The mention of both "day" and "night" means all the time. AT: "all the time" or "continually" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
