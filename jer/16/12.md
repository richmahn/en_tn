# ancestors, for see, each person

"ancestors. Look at these people and you will see that each person"

# walking by the stubbornness of his wicked heart

Yahweh speaks of a person's actions as if the person were walking along a path. Here the word "heart" represents the mind or will. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Jeremiah 11:8](../11/08.md). Alternate translation: "stubbornly doing the wicked things that he wants to do" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# who listens to me

"who does what I tell him to do"
