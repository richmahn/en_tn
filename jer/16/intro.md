# Jeremiah 16 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations indent each line of poetry to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetry in 16:19-21. This poem also continues in chapter 17, and these should be seen as one section.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Coming punishment #####

The punishment that is prophesied in this chapter will happen quickly. The author gives many illustrations which describe how quickly this punishment will come. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]])

##### Israel restored #####

God will bring his people back from captivity. Even though the punishment of Judah will be great, Yahweh promised a future restoration. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/promise]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/restore]])
