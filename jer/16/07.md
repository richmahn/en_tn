# No one must share any food in mourning to comfort them because of the deaths ... none must give a comforting cup to his father or his mother

These two clauses have a similar meaning. God said basically the same thing twice for emphasis. It was customary to take food or wine to people whose relative had died. Yahweh has removed all comfort from the people because of their sin. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# none must give a comforting cup

Here the word "cup" represents the drink that the cup holds. AT: "none must give a comforting drink" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
