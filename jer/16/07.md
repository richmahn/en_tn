## translationNotes

* **No one must share any food in mourning to comfort them because of the deaths ... none must give a comforting cup to his father or his mother** - These two sentences have a similar meaning.

AT: "Do not comfort people when their relative dies"
* **Yahweh of hosts, God of Israel** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:jer:07:03]].
* **See** - AT: “Listen” or “Pay attention to what I am about to tell you”
* **before your eyes** - Here the word "your" is plural and refers to the people of Israel. AT: "in front of you" or "where you can see" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
* **in your days** - AT: "during your lifetime" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
