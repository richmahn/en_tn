## this is Yahweh's declaration ##

See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 1:7](../01/07.md).

## many fishermen...many hunters ##

Yahweh compares the people who will take the Israelites into captivity to people who are skilled at trapping their prey. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## my eye is on all their ways ##

AT: "I am watching everything they do" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

## they cannot be hidden from before me ##

Here the word "they" may refer either to the people or to their actions. AT: "I see all that they do" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## Their iniquity cannot be concealed from before my eyes ##

AT: "I see all their sins"  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]], [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

## iniquity and sin ##

These two words mean basically the same thing and are combined for emphasis. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

## their filling my inheritance with their disgusting idols ##

This phrase means basically the same thing as the previous phrase and is used for emphasis. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## my inheritance ##

This refers to the land of Israel.
