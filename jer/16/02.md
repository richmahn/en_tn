# the word of Yahweh came to me, saying, "Do not

This idiom is used to introduce a special message from God. See how you translated it in [Jeremiah 1:4](../01/04.md). AT: "Yahweh gave me a message. He said,'Do not" or "Yahweh spoke this message to me:" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
