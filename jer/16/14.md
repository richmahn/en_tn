# behold

The word "behold" here alerts us to pay attention to the surprising information that follows.

# when it will no longer be said

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "when people will no longer say" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# As Yahweh lives

"As surely as Yahweh is alive." The people use this expression to show that what they say next is certainly true. This is a way of making a solemn promise. See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 4:2](../04/02.md). Alternate translation: "I solemnly swear" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
