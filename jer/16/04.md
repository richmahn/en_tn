# They will die diseased deaths

"They will die from deadly diseases"

# They will not be mourned or buried

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "No one will mourn for them or bury them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# They will be like dung on the ground

The sons and daughters born in the land are compared to dung on the ground to emphasize that they will be disgusting and that no one will bury them. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Jeremiah 8:2](../08/02.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# they will come to an end by sword and famine

The phrase "come to an end" is a mild way to say that they will die. The word "sword" represents an army whose soldiers fight with swords. The phrase represents dying in battle. Alternate translation: "they will die in battle or from famine" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
