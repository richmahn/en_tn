# Yahweh of hosts ... says this

Jeremiah often uses these words to introduce an important message from Yahweh. See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 6:6](../06/06.md).

# See

"Look" or "Listen" or "Pay attention to what I am about to tell you"

# before your eyes

Here the word "your" is plural and refers to the people of Israel. The idiom means that Yahweh will do this where they can see. Alternate translation: "in front of you" or "where you can see" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# in your days

This idiom means during their lifetime. Alternate translation: "during your lifetime" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# the sound of joy and the sound of gladness, the sound of the groom and the sound of the bride

See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 7:34](../07/34.md).
