# this is Yahweh's declaration

Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 1:8](../01/07.md). AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# worshiped and bowed down to them

The words "bowed down to" mean basically the same thing as "worshiped" and describe the posture that people used in worship. God said essentially the same thing twice for emphasis. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
