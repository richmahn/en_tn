# But are you hoping for great things for yourself?

Yahweh uses a question to state that he knows Baruch is hoping for others to treat him in a special way. Alternate translation: "I know you hope for great things for yourself." or "I know you hope others will honor you." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# For see

"For understand" or "Be aware"

# your life as your plunder everywhere you will go

Allowing Baruch to escape and remain alive is spoken of as if his life were plunder that he would take after a battle. Alternate translation: "but wherever you go, I will protect you and allow you to live" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# plunder

things stolen from a place by force
