# General Information:

Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.

# See

"Look" or "Listen" or "Pay attention to what I am about to tell you."

# I am about to bring back the fortunes of Jacob's tents and have compassion on his homes

The places where people live are metonyms for the people who live in those places. Alternate translation: "I am about bring back the fortunes of the descendants of Jacob, and I will have compassion on them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# I am about to bring back the fortunes of Jacob's tents

"I will cause things to go well for the people in Jacob's tents again" or "I will cause the people in Jacob's tents to live well again." See how you translated similar words in [Jeremiah 29:14](../29/14.md).

# Then a city will be built on the heap of ruins

This can be translated in active form. You may need to make explicit that the city they will build will be Jerusalem. Alternate translation: "Then they will rebuild Jerusalem on its ruins" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
