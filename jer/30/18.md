# I am about to bring back the fortunes of Jacob's tents and have compassion on his homes

The places where people live are metonyms for the people who live in those places. AT: "I am about bring back the fortunes of the descendants of Jacob, and I will have compassion on them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# I am about to bring back the fortunes of Jacob's tents

"I will cause things to go well for the people in Jacob's tents again" or "I will cause the people in Jacob's tents to live well again." See how you translated similar words in [Jeremiah 29:14](../29/12.md).

# Then a city will be built on the heap of ruins

This can be translated in active form. You may need to make explicit that the city they will build will be Jerusalem. AT: "Then they will rebuild Jerusalem on its ruins" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# Then a song of praise and a sound of merriment will go out from them

"Then they will sing songs of praise and joy"

# for I will increase them and not diminish them

"I will cause them to increase in number, not to become fewer"

# so they will not be humbled

This can be translated in active form. AT: "so that no one will humble them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
