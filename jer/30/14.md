Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.

## All of your lovers ##

Yahweh describes the people of Israel as an unfaithful wife who takes lovers other than her husband. Here "lovers" refers to other nations. The Israelites allied with them and worshiped their gods instead of relying on Yahweh. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## They will not look for you ##

"They no longer want to be your friends"

## I have wounded you with the wound of an enemy ##
