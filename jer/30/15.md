# Why do you call for help for your injury?

Yahweh asks a question here to make the people think about why they are asking him for help now. Alternate translation: "You are calling for help for your injury because you have disobeyed me." or "Do not call for help for your injury." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
