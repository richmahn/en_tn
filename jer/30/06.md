# Ask and see if a man bears a child

"You know that no man has ever given birth to a child"

# Why do I see every young man with his hand on his loins like a woman bearing a child? Why have all their faces become pale?

A woman about to give birth is in great pain and unable to do anything. The young men are so frightened that their bodies hurt, and they are unable to fight. Alternate translation: "The young men are holding their bellies like a woman giving birth; they all look sick because they are so afraid."
