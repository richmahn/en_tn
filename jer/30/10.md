# General Information:

Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.

# my servant Jacob ... Israel

"Jacob" and "Israel" are the two names of the ancestor of the Israelites, and these names are metonyms for the Israelites. AT: "descendants of Jacob ... you Israelite people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# this is Yahweh's declaration

Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 1:8](../01/08.md). AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# do not be dismayed

"do not be discouraged"

# For see, I am

"Listen carefully while I tell you why: I am"

# from the land of captivity

The abstract noun "captivity" can be translated using the noun "captive." AT: "from the place where they were captives" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# Jacob will return ... he will be secure

Jacob's name is a metonym for his descendants. Yahweh speaks to Jacob as if he were speaking to another person. You may need to make explicit to where Jacob will return. AT: "Jacob will return to his own land ... he will be secure" or "The descendants of Jacob will return ... they will be secure" or "You descendants of Jacob will return ... you will be secure" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
