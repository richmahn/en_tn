# this is Yahweh's declaration

Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translates this in [Jeremiah 1:8](../01/08.md). AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
