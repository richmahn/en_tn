## translationNotes

* Jeremiah is speaking Yahweh's message to the people of Israel.
* **Your injury is incurable...for your wound to heal you** - This means that Yahweh has punished them so severely that there is no one that can help them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **There is no one to plead your case** - AT: "There is no one who asks me to show you mercy"
