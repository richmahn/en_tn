# General Information:

Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.

# Your injury is incurable; your wound is infected ... no remedy for your wound

This means that Yahweh has punished them so severely that there is no one who can help them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# There is no one to plead your case

"There is no one who asks me to show you mercy"
