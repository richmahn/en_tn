# Jeremiah 30 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetry in 3:5-24.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### God promises restoration #####

Despite the prophesied punishment in this chapter, Yahweh promises to restore Judah. In addition to this, he also declares that he will ultimately restore Israel. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/promise]], and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/restore]])

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####
The author uses the term "Israel" in two different ways. He uses it in reference to the nation of Israel. He also uses it in reference to the people who used to inhabit the northern kingdom of Israel, namely the people group of Israel.
