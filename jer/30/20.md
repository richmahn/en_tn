# General Information:

Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Israel.

# their assembly will be established before me

This can be translated in active form. AT: "I will establish them as a people before me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# who would dare come close to me?

Yahweh uses a question to emphasize that no one would have the courage to approach him unless Yahweh invited the person. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# this is Yahweh's declaration

Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translates this in [Jeremiah 1:8](../01/07.md). AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
