Yahweh continues speaking.

## their assembly will be established before me ##

AT: "I will establish them as a people before me"

## Their leader will come from among them. He will emerge from their midst ##

These two sentences have similar meanings. The second one strengthens the thought in the first. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]]) AT: "Their leader will be chosen from the people."

## who would dare to come close to me? ##

Yahweh uses a question to emphasize that no one would have the courage to approach him unless Yahweh invited the person. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
