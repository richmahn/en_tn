## translationNotes

* Yahweh continues speaking.
* **their assembly will be established before me** - AT: "I will establish them as a people before me"
* **Their leader will come from among them. He will emerge from their midst** - These two sentences have similar meanings. The second one strengthens the thought in the first. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]]) AT: "Their leader will be chosen from the people."
* **who would dare to come close to me?** - Yahweh uses a question to emphasize that no one would have the courage to approach him unless Yahweh invited the person. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
