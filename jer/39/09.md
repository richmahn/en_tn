# Nebuzaradan

This is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# the king's bodyguards

"Nebuchadnezzar's guards"

# the rest of the people who were left in the city

This is probably a generalization. AT: "the people who were still living in the city" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
