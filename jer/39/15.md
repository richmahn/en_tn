# General Information:

This story happened before the events in the first part of the chapter.

# Now

This word is used here to mark a return to the story line, as the narrator tells what Yahweh had said to Jeremiah after Nebuchadnezzar gave the orders about Jeremiah ([Jeremiah 39:12-14](./11.md)). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-events]])

# the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah while he was ... guard, saying, "Speak

The idiom "the word of Yahweh came to" is used to introduce a special message from God. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Jeremiah 1:4](../01/04.md). AT: "Yahweh gave a message to Jeremiah while he was ... guard. He said, 'Speak" or "while Jeremiah was ... guard, Yahweh spoke this message to him: 'Speak" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# the courtyard of the guard

This was an open area attached to the king's palace that was surrounded by buildings and in which they kept prisoners. See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 32:2](../32/01.md).

# Ebed-Melek the Cushite

See how you translated this man's name in [Jeremiah 38:7](../38/07.md).

# Yahweh of hosts ... says this

Jeremiah often uses these words to introduce an important message from Yahweh. See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 6:6](../06/06.md).

# I am about to carry out my words against this city for disaster and not for good

"I am bringing disaster, not good, against this city, just as I said I would"

# For they will all come true before you on that day

"For you will see it all happen on that day"
