Yahweh continues speaking to Jeremiah.

## that day ##

This refers to the day the Babylonians break through the walls of Jerusalem to destroy the city.

## this is Yahwehâ€™s declaration ##

See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 1:7](../01/07.md).

## you will not be put into the hand of the men whom you fear ##

Here "hand" refers to power or control. AT: "the men you fear will not harm you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## You will not fall by the sword ##

AT: "No one will kill you with their sword" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])

## Your life will be your own plunder, since you trust in me ##

"Your reward for trusting me is not being killed"
