# General Information:

Yahweh continues speaking to Jeremiah.

# you will not be given into the hand of the men whom you fear

Here "hand" refers to power or control. This can be translated in active form. AT: "the men you fear will not harm you" or "I will not allow anyone to put you under the control of the people whom you fear" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
