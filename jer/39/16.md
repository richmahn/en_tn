# Ebed-Melek the Cushite

See how you translated this man's name in [Jeremiah 38:7](../38/07.md).

# Yahweh of hosts ... says this

Jeremiah often uses these words to introduce an important message from Yahweh. See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 6:6](../06/06.md).

# I am about to carry out my words against this city for disaster and not for good

"I am bringing disaster, not good, against this city, just as I said I would"

# For they will all come true before you on that day

"For you will see it all happen on that day"
