# Yahweh of hosts, God of Israel, says this to all the captives

When people wrote letters in that society, they would write their name first, then the name of the person to whom they were writing, and then the main part of the letter. Yahweh speaks of himself by name as if he were writing the letter himself.

# Yahweh of hosts ... says this

Jeremiah often uses these words to introduce an important message from Yahweh. See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 6:6](../06/06.md).

# Build houses and live in them. Plant gardens and eat their fruit

Yahweh is telling them they will be there for a long time. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
