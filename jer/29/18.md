# Connecting Statement:

Yahweh continues speaking about what will happen to Israel.

# a horror, an object of curses and hissing, and a shameful thing

These words all share similar meanings and describe how the people of other nations will react when they see what Yahweh has done to the people of Judah.

# hissing

the sound people make when they disapprove of something

# listen

"obey"

# this is Yahweh's declaration

Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 1:8](../01/07.md). AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
