This finishes the letter by Shemaiah that he sent out to the people in Jerusalem.

# why have you not rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth ... against you?

Shemaiah uses a rhetorical question to scold the people of Jerusalem for not rebuking Jeremiah. This can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: "I want you to rebuke Jeremiah of Anathoth ... against you." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
