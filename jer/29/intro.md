# Jeremiah 29 General Notes

#### Special concepts in this chapter

##### Two letters

Jeremiah sent a letter to Babylon telling the exiles to prepare for a long stay. A false prophet in Babylon wrote back to the chief priest telling him to punish Jeremiah. Even though Jeremiah had prophesied the exile, the Jews still did not believe him. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/believe]])
