# a curse will be spoken about these persons by all the captives of Judah in Babylon

This can be stated in active form. AT: "the captives of Judah in Babylon will say a curse about these persons" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# roasted

This word usually refers to cooking food over an open fire or in a pan, not to burning completely. Possible meanings are 1) this is a euphemism. AT: "burned to death" or 2) the king's men attached them to poles over the fire close enough that the fire would slowly kill them but far enough away that it would not totally consume their bodies. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])

# I am the one who knows; I am the witness

These two clauses mean the same thing, and Yahweh repeats them for emphasis. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# this is Yahweh's declaration

Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 1:8](../01/07.md). AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
