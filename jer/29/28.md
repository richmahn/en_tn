# he has sent to us

You may need to make explicit what it was that Jeremiah sent. AT: "he has sent a message to us" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# Build houses and live in them, and plant gardens and eat their fruit

See how you translated similar words in [Jeremiah 29:5](./05.md).
