Yahweh continues speaking about what will happen to the captives of Israel.

## call to me, and go and pray to me ##

AT: "pray to me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

## I will listen to you ##

This implies that Yahweh will give them what they want. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])

## I will bring back your fortunes ##

AT: "I will cause things to go well for you again"
