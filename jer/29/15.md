# I am about to send sword, famine, and disease on them

The word "sword" is a metonym for war. The sword, famine, and disease are spoken of as people who can obey Yahweh's command to harm the Israelites. AT: "I am going to punish them by having them die in war, from hunger, and from illness" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

Rotten figs are useless because they cannot be eaten, and Yahweh sees no use for the people of Israel. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
