# Give wings to Moab, for she must certainly fly away

Helping the people is spoken of as if they would put wings on the people so that could fly away. Alternate translation: "Help the people of Moab to escape as if you were giving them wings to fly away" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Give wings to Moab, for she must certainly fly away

The translation of the original language is uncertain. Some Bibles translate this as "Set up a tombstone for Moab, for the enemy will certainly destroy it." Other Bibles translate it as "Put salt on the cities of Moab, for the enemy will completely destroy it." Enemies through salt on ruins to keep thing from ever growing there again.
