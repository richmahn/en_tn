# So see, the days are coming

"Listen carefully because there will be a time"

# this is Yahweh's declaration

Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 1:8](../01/08.md). Alternate translation: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# I will send him those who will tip him over and pour out all his pots and shatter his jars

The enemy army defeating the people of Moab and taking them as captives is spoken of as if the people of Moab are wine and someone will come and pour them out and break the wine jars. Alternate translation: "I will send an army that will destroy them as if they were pouring out wine and breaking the jars" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# send him ... tip him over ... his pots ... his jars

Here Yahweh speaks of Moab as if it were a man. Here it represents the people of Moab. All occurrences of "he," "his," and "him" in 48:11-12 can be stated as "they," "their," or "them." Alternate translation: "send them ... tip them over ... their pots ... their jars" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
