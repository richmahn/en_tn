# punishment has come to the hill country, to Holon ... to all the cities

Yahweh punishing the people of the hill country and cities of Moab is spoken of as if punishment were something that could travel and arrive in a place. AT: "Yahweh will punish the people of the hill country, of Holon ... of all the cities" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# Holon, Jahzah, and Mephaath ... Bozrah

These are cities in Moab. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# The horn of Moab has been hacked off; its arm has been broken

Both of these statements mean the same thing. Here "horn" and "arm" represent power. To have these hacked off or broken means to lose one's power. This can be stated in active form. AT: "Moab has become weak; the people are not able to fight anymore" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# this is Yahweh's declaration

Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 1:8](../01/07.md). AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
