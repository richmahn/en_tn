# Jeremiah 48 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 48:1-25, 28-33, 39-47.

Jeremiah's prophesies about other nations continue in this chapter. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]])

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Obeying Yahweh #####

Moab worshiped and served other gods. Despite this, Yahweh expected every nation to worship and serve him and him alone. They were punished because of it. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/falsegod]])
