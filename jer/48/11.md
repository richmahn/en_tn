## He is like his wine that has never been poured from pot to pot ##

The word "he" is the nation of Moab. The nation of Moab is being compared to wine that has not been exiled from its land. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

## Therefore he tastes as good as ever; his flavor remains unchanged  ##

These two phrases mean the same thing. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## So see, the days are coming ##

"Listen carefully because soon"

## this is Yahwehâ€™s declaration  ##

##  tip him over and pour out all his pots and shatter his jars ##
