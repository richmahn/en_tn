# punishment has come to the hill country, to Holon ... to all the cities

Yahweh punishing the people of the hill country and cities of Moab is spoken of as if punishment were something that could travel and arrive in a place. Alternate translation: "Yahweh will punish the people of the hill country, of Holon ... of all the cities" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
