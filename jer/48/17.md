# the strong staff, the honored rod, has been broken

Here the words "staff" and "rod" represent the power and political support that Moab provided to other nations. This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "Moab's enemies have ended her great power" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
