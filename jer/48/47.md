# I will restore the fortunes of Moab

"I will cause things to go well for Moab again" or "I will cause Moab to live well again." See how similar words are translated in [Jeremiah 29:14](../29/14.md).

# this is Yahweh's declaration

Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 1:8](../01/08.md). Alternate translation: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# The judgment on Moab ends here

"That is the end of what Jeremiah prophesied about Moab"
