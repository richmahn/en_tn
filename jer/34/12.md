## the word of Yahweh came to ##

See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 1:1](../01/01.md).

## each man must send away his brother, his fellow Hebrew who had sold himself to you and served you ##

AT: "each of you must free any fellow Hebrews who sold themselves to you and have have been your slaves"

## Send him away in freedom ##

AT: "You must let them be free from serving you"

## did not listen to me and or pay attention ##

Both these phrase are saying basically the same thing and are combined for emphasis. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
