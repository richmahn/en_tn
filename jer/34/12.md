## translationNotes

* **the word of Yahweh came to** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:01]].
* **each man must send away his brother, his fellow Hebrew who had sold himself to you and served you** - AT: "each of you must free any fellow Hebrews who sold themselves to you and have have been your slaves"
* **Send him away in freedom** - AT: "You must let them be free from serving you"
* **did not listen to me and or pay attention** - Both these phrase are saying basically the same thing and are combined for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
