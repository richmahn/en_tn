# The word came to Jeremiah from Yahweh

This idiom is used to introduce a special message from God. However, the actual message does not begin until [Jeremiah 34:12](./12.md). See how you translated a similar phrase in [Jeremiah 7:1](../07/01.md). Alternate translation: "Yahweh gave a message to Jeremiah" or "Yahweh spoke a message to Jeremiah" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# word

message

# after King Zedekiah had made a covenant ... freedom to them

These words begin to provide background information to events that will be described later. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
