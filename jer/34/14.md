# each man must send away his brother, his fellow Hebrew who had sold himself to you and served you

"each of you must free any fellow Hebrews who sold themselves to you and have been your slaves"

# Send him away in freedom

"You must let them be free from serving you"

# did not ... incline their ears to me

To incline the ear, to lean the head toward the speaker so as to hear better, is a metonym for paying attention to what the speaker is saying. Alternate translation: "did not ... pay attention to what I said" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
