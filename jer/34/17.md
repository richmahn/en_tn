"proclaim that you are free"

Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 1:8](../01/07.md). AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

Here "sight" represents judgment or evaluation. The word "kingdom" is a metonym for the people who live in the kingdom. AT: "I am going to make the people in every kingdom on earth think that you are horrible" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
