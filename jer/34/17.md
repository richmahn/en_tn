# So look!

"Listen!" or "Pay attention to the important thing I am going to tell you!"

# I am about to proclaim freedom to you ... freedom for the sword, the plague, and famine

Jeremiah uses irony to say that the "freedom" the people will enjoy will actually be suffering. Alternate translation: "I will proclaim misery to you ... misery from the sword, the plague, and famine" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])

# proclaim freedom to you

"proclaim that you are free"

# this is Yahweh's declaration

Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 1:8](../01/08.md). Alternate translation: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# sword

This is a metonym for soldiers who carry swords. Alternate translation: "enemy soldiers to kill you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# am going to make you a horrible thing in the sight of every kingdom on earth

Here "sight" represents judgment or evaluation. The word "kingdom" is a metonym for the people who live in the kingdom. Alternate translation: "I am going to make the people in every kingdom on earth think that you are horrible" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
