# to give this city

See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 32:28](../32/28.md)

# into the hand of the king of Babylon

Here the word "hand" is a metonym for the control that the hand exercises. Alternate translation: "under the control of the king of Babylon" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
