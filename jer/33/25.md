# If I have not established ... and if I have not fixed ... then I will reject ... and not bring

This is a hypothetical situation that Yahweh never expects to be true. Alternate translation: "I have established ... and I have fixed ... so I will never reject ... and I will bring" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
