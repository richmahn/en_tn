# the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah a second time, while he was ... guard, saying,

The idiom "the word of Yahweh came to" is used to introduce a special message from God. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Jeremiah 1:13](../01/13.md). AT: "Yahweh gave a message to Jeremiah a second time, while Jeremiah was ... guard. He said," or "While Jeremiah was ... guard, Yahweh spoke this second message to Jeremiah:" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# came to Jeremiah

It is not clear why Jeremiah is referring to himself by name here. There is no need to translate using first person. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# who forms in order to establish

who creates things so he can make them exist forever

# he was still shut within

"he was still a prisoner in"

# the courtyard of the guard

This was an open area attached to the king's palace that was surrounded by buildings and in which they kept prisoners. See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 32:2](../32/01.md).
