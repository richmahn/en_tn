## The word of Yahweh came to ##

See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 1:1](../01/01.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

## to sit on his throne  ##

"to rule the kingdom given to him", (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## As the hosts of heaven cannot be counted, and as the sand of the seashores cannot be measured, it is like that I will increase the descendants of David my servant and the Levites who serve me ##

These two statements are saying essentially the same thing and used together for emphasis. AT: "As no one can count the stars in the sky and sand on the seashore, in the same way no one will be able to count the descendants of David and Levi who serve Yahweh"  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
