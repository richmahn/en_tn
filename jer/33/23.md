# The word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah, saying,

This idiom is used to introduce a special message from God. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Jeremiah 1:4](../01/04.md). AT: "Yahweh gave a message to Jeremiah. He said," or "Yahweh spoke this message to Jeremiah:" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# to Jeremiah

It is not clear why Jeremiah is referring to himself by name here. There is no need to translate using first person. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# Have you not considered what this people has declared when they said, 'The ... them'?

Yahweh wants Jeremiah to think deeply about what the people have said. This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement. AT: "You should have noticed what this people are really saying when they said, 'The ... them.'" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# In this way they despise my people, saying ... sight

"What they are really saying is that my people are worthless and that my people will never again be a nation."

# my people ... are no longer a nation in their sight

Sight is a metonym for thinking. AT: "they no longer think of my people as a nation" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
