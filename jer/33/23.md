# The word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah, saying, "Have

This idiom is used to introduce a special message from God. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Jeremiah 1:4](../01/04.md). Alternate translation: "Yahweh gave a message to Jeremiah. He said, 'Have" or "Yahweh spoke this message to Jeremiah: 'Have" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# to Jeremiah

It is not clear why Jeremiah is referring to himself by name here. There is no need to translate using first person. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
