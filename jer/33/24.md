# Have you not considered what this people has declared when they said, 'The ... them'?

Yahweh wants Jeremiah to think deeply about what the people have said. This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: "You should have noticed what this people are really saying when they said, 'The ... them.'" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# In this way they despise my people, saying ... sight

"What they are really saying is that my people are worthless and that my people will never again be a nation."

# my people ... are no longer a nation in their sight

Sight is a metonym for thinking. Alternate translation: "they no longer think of my people as a nation" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
