the temple in Jerusalem

# I will restore the fortunes of the land

The word "land" is a metonym for the people who live on the land. Alternate translation: "I will again cause things to go well for the people who live on the land" or "I will cause the people who live on the land to live well again" See how similar words are translated in [Jeremiah 29:14](../29/14.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# to what they were before

This refers to the time before the exile to Babylon. This can be made explicit. Alternate translation: "to what they were before I sent the Israelites into exile in Babylon" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
