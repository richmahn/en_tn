# If I have not established ... and if I have not fixed ... then I will reject ... and not bring

This is a hypothetical situation that Yahweh never expects to be true. AT: "I have established ... and I have fixed ... so I will never reject ... and I will bring" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])

# I will restore their fortunes

"I will cause things to go well for them again" or "I will cause them to live well again" See how similar words are translated in [Jeremiah 29:14](../29/14.md).

# show mercy to

Translate as "have compassion on" is translated in ([Jeremiah 30:18](../30/18.md)).
