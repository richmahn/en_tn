# Yahweh of hosts says this

Jeremiah often uses these words to introduce an important message from Yahweh. See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 6:6](../06/06.md).

# the flocks will again pass under the hands of the ones counting them

This refers to the practice of a shepherd counting and inspecting his sheep as the sheep walked under his hand. AT: "shepherds will again count their sheep as the sheep walk by" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
