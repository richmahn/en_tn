# The prophets will become wind

Here "prophets" is a metonym that represents what the prophets say, and "wind" is a metaphor for something that does not do anything. Alternate translation: "The prophets words are just noisy wind" or "The prophets make noise like the wind, but what they prophesy will not happen" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the word is not in them

Here "the word" refers to God's message. Alternate translation: "God's message is not in them" or "the messages that they speak are not from God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# so let what they say be done to them

It can be stated clearly what kinds of things the prophets were talking about. Alternate translation: "so let the harm that the prophets talk about come to them" or "since the prophets say that bad things will happen to us, let those bad things happen to the prophets" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
