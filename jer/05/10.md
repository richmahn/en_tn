## translationNotes

* Yahweh continues to speak.
* **Go up onto her vineyards' terraces** - "Get up over her walls." Yahweh is comparing the city of Jerusalem to a vineyard that has a wall around it. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **Go up** - Yahweh is speaking to the enemies of people living in Jerusalem.
* ** do not bring complete destruction to them** - "do not completely destroy them"
* **Trim their vines, since those vines do not come from Yahweh** - Yahweh compares how the enemies of Jerusalem will rid of her people to how people cut branches off of a vine. AT: "Get rid of all of the evil people because they do not come from Yahweh."
* **For the houses of Israel and Judah** - AT: "For the people of Israel and Judah." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
* **this is Yahweh's declaration** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:jer:01:07]].
* **They have denied me** - This could also be translated as, "They have lied about me."
* **He is not real** - "Yahweh does not exist." This could also be translated as "He will not do these things" or "He cannot do these things"
* **Evil will not come on us, nor will we see sword or famine** - These two sentences say the same thing, the second is more specific than the first. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
* **Evil will not come on us** - This expression means "Bad things will not happen to us."
* **nor will we see sword or famine** - AT: "and we will not experience war or famine." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
