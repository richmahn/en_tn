# Connecting Statement:

Yahweh continues to speak. Here he speaks to the enemies of Israel.

# Go up onto her vineyards' terraces

In verses 10-13 Yahweh speaks to Israel's enemies. This can be made clear in the quotation. Alternate translation: "You enemies of Israel, go up onto her vineyards' terraces" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# Go up onto her vineyards' terraces and destroy

Yahweh speaks of Israel and Judah as if they were a vineyard and the people there were vines. Alternate translation: "Go up into Israel and Judah, which are like a vineyard to me, and destroy them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# do not bring complete destruction to them

"do not completely destroy them"

# Trim their vines, since those vines do not come from Yahweh

The word "their" refers to the vineyards. Yahweh speaks of the people of Israel and Judah as if they were vines. Alternate translation: "like farmers who trim the vines of a vineyard, you must remove many of the people of Israel and Judah, because they do not belong to Yahweh" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
