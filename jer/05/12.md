# They have spoken falsely about Yahweh and they said

"They have spoken falsely about Yahweh by saying"

# no harm will come upon us, and we will not see sword or famine

These two sentences say the same thing, the second is more specific than the first. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# no harm will come upon us

The idiom "come upon us" means "happen to us." Alternate translation: "No harm will happen to us" or "no one will harm us" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# we will not see sword or famine

Here "see" is a metaphor for experience, and "sword" is a metonym for war. Alternate translation: "we will not experience war or famine" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
