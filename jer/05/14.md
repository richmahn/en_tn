# Because you

The word "you" refers to the people of Israel and Judah.

# have said this

See what the people said in [Jeremiah 5:12](./12.md).

# see

"look" or "listen" or "pay attention to what I am about to tell you"

# I am about to place my word in your mouth

Here "place my word in your mouth" represents causing Jeremiah to speak God's message. Alternate translation: "I will cause you to speak my message" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# It will be like a fire, and this people will be like wood

Yahweh speaks of his message as if it were a fire, and of his people as if they were wood. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# For it will consume them

"For my message will consume them." Yahweh's message was about how he would punish his people, so he speaks as if his message would destroy them as a fire destroys wood. Alternate translation: "For when you speak my message, it will destroy the people of Israel as fire destroys wood" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
