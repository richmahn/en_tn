# Although they say

The word "they" refers to the people of Jerusalem.

# As Yahweh lives

"as surely as Yahweh is alive." The people use this expression to show that what they say next is certainly true. This is a way of making a solemn promise. See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 4:2](../04/02.md). Alternate translation: "I solemnly swear" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
