# The prophets prophesy with deceit, and the priests rule with their own power

These are the atrocities and horrors that are spoken of in verse 30.

# The prophets prophesy with deceit

"The prophets prophesy lies" or "The prophets tell lies when they prophesy"

# the priests rule with their own power

Possible meanings are 1) the priests do not submit to God's authority. AT: "the priests rule by their own authority" or 2) the priests rule according to the directions of the prophets (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# but what will happen in the end?

"but what will you do at the end of all of this?" Yahweh uses this question to emphasize that the people will regret being wicked when he punishes them for it. AT: "but in the end I will punish you and you will be regret your wicked behavior" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
