# Do you not fear me ... face?

Yahweh uses this question to emphasize that the people are extremely foolish because they do not fear Yahweh. AT: "It is foolish that you do not fear me ... face!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# or tremble before my face

The trembling would be because of fear, and being "before my face" represents being aware of who God is. AT: "or shake with fear because of me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# I have placed a border of sand against the sea

"I placed the sand as the border for the sea"

# an ongoing decree that it does not violate

God speaks of the ocean not going past the border of sand as if the border were a law, and as if the ocean were a person who obeys the law. AT: "an everlasting limit that it cannot cross" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# rises and falls

"moves back and forth"

# it does not violate it

"the ocean does not violate my decree." God speaks of ocean not going past the border of sand as if the border were a law, and as if the ocean were a person who obeys the law. AT: "it does not succeed in going past the border" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
