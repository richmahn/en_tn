# General Information:

Yahweh continues to speak to the people of Israel.

# this people has a stubborn heart. It turns

The people's heart represents their attitude toward God. If Yahweh is speaking to the people, this can also be expressed with the word "you." Alternate translation: "but you people have a stubborn heart. You turn" or "but you people are stubborn. You turn" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# It turns away in rebellion and goes away

The word "it" refers to the people. Here "goes away" represents disobeying God. Alternate translation: "They rebel and disobey me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
