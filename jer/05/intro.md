# Jeremiah 05 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 5:1-31, which is an extended quotation.

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter ####
##### Hyperbole #####
It is possible that Yahweh is using the word "a" (meaning "even one") as hyperbole when he states, "If you can find a man or anyone who is acting justly and trying to act faithfully, then I will forgive Jerusalem." The purpose of this is to show how evil Jerusalem had become. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/justice]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/forgive]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/evil]])

##### Rhetorical questions #####
Yahweh asks several rhetorical questions in this chapter. This is intended to show Jeremiah the justness of his actions. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
