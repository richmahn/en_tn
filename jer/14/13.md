# General Information:

Yahweh has just told Jeremiah not to pray for the people of Judah.

# You will not see the sword

Here "sword" represents war, and to "see" represents experiencing. Alternate translation: "You will not experience any war" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# I will give you true security

Here "security" is spoken of as if it were an object that someone could give to another person. Alternate translation: "I will allow you to live securely" or "I will allow you to live peacefully" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
