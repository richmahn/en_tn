# why will you be like a stranger in the land ... Why are you like someone who is astounded

These two question have similar meanings. They both ask if Yahweh is unconcerned with his people and unable to help them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# Why are you like someone who is astounded, or like a warrior who has no power to rescue

This speaks of the possibility of Yahweh being unable to help his people as if he were a confused warrior who was unable to rescue anyone. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# astounded

unable to understand or to think clearly

# your name is called over us

This can be stated in active form. This speaks of the people being Yahweh's people by saying that his name is over them. AT: "we bear your name" or "we are your people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
