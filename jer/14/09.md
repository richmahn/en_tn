# Why are you like someone who is astounded, or like a warrior who has no power to rescue?

This speaks of the possibility of Yahweh being unable to help his people as if he were a confused warrior who was unable to rescue anyone. This can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: "You do nothing to help us, like someone who is astounded or like a warrior who has no power to rescue us." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# astounded

unable to understand or to think clearly

# your name is called over us

This can be stated in active form. This speaks of the people being Yahweh's people by saying that his name is over them. Alternate translation: "we bear your name" or "we are your people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
