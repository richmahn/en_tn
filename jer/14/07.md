# our iniquities testify against us

# for the sake of your name

Here Yahweh's "name" refers to his reputation. Alternate translation: "for the sake of your reputation" or "in order that everyone can see that you are very great and keep your promises" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
