# Hope of Israel

This is another name for Yahweh. Alternate translation: "You are the hope of Israel" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# why will you be like a stranger in the land ... Why are you like someone who is astounded

These two question have similar meanings. They both ask if Yahweh is unconcerned with his people and unable to help them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# why will you be like a stranger in the land, like a foreign wanderer ... just one night

This question speaks of the possibility of Yahweh being unconcerned with helping his people as if he were a stranger just travelling though a place unconcerned with those living there. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# who stretches out and spends just one night

Both of the phrase have the same meaning and may be combined. Alternate translation: "who stays for only one night" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
