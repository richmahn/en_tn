# General Information:

Jeremiah has just been talking to Yahweh about the things the false prophets have been prophesying.

# in my name

This phrase refers to speaking with Yahweh's power and authority or as his representative. See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 14:14](./13.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# there will be no sword ... and sword

Here the "sword" represents war. AT: "there will be no war ... and war" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# Then the people to whom they prophesied will be thrown out in the streets of Jerusalem because of famine and sword

This can be stated in active form. This means that whole families will die and people will throw their bodies into the streets instead of burying them. AT: "Then the people to whom they prophesied will die by famine and sword and people will throw their bodies into the streets of Jerusalem" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# their wives, their sons, or their daughters

This describes who is referred to by the word "them," that is, everyone who died by famine and sword.

# I will pour out their wickedness on them

Here Yahweh speaks of punishing the people in accordance to their wicknedness as if their own wickedness were a liquid that he would pour upon them. AT: "I will punish them like they deserve to be punished" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
