# General Information:

Jeremiah has just been talking to Yahweh about the things the false prophets have been prophesying.

# in my name

This phrase refers to speaking with Yahweh's power and authority or as his representative. See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 14:14](../14/14.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# there will be no sword ... perish by sword

Here the "sword" represents war. Alternate translation: "there will be no war ... perish by war" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
