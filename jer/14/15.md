Jeremiah has just been talking to Yahweh about the things the false prophets have been prophesying.

## there will be no sword ##

"there will be no war" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## I will pour out their wickedness on them ##

"I will punish them the way the deserve to be punished". (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] )
