# General Information:

Translate many of the words in this verse as in [Jeremiah 10:16](../10/16.md).

# the portion of Jacob

Here "Jacob" represents the people of Israel. God being their "portion" is an idiom that means that they worship him. Alternate translation: "the portion of Israel" or "whom the people of Israel worship" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# the molder of all things

"the creator of all things" or "the one who created all things"

# Israel is the tribe of his inheritance

This speaks of Israel belonging to Yahweh as if it were something that Yahweh gained through inheritance. Alternate translation: "The tribe of Israel belongs to him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
