# her highest fortresses ... to her

The people of Babylon are spoken of as if they were the city itself, and the city is spoken of as if it were a woman. Alternate translation: "their highest fortresses ... to them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# if Babylon went up ... or fortified ... destroyers would come from me

This is a hypothetical situation that Yahweh does not expect to happen. Alternate translation: "Babylon will not go up ... or fortify ... destroyers will surely come from me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
