# Babylon will sink like this

The stone and scroll will disappear in the water, the water will destroy the scroll, and Babylon will no longer look like a city or have buildings for people to live in. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# will not arise

"will never again be a city"

# they will fall

This means the Babylonians will fall because they are exhausted. Many translations do not include these words.
