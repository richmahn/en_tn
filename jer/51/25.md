## mountain ##

Yahweh talks to Babylon as if it were a mountain which he could address as a person. Since mountains were sometimes the homes of bandits, it is possible that Jeremiah had this idea in mind here. See UDB. AT: "strong nation" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## other ##

This refers to all the people Babylon has attacked.
