## translationNotes

* **mountain** - Yahweh talks to Babylon as if it were a mountain which he could address as a person. Since mountains were sometimes the homes of bandits, it is possible that Jeremiah had this idea in mind here. See UDB. AT: "strong nation" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **other** - This refers to all the people Babylon has attacked.
* **cliff** - This is the edge of a mountain.
