# General Information:

Jeremiah often wrote prophecy in the form of poetry. Hebrew poetry uses different kinds of parallelism. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# See

This draws attention to what is said next. AT: "Listen carefully" or "Pay attention"

# a wind of destruction

Possible meanings are 1) "a wind that destroys" or 2) "the spirit of a destroyer." This would mean that Yahweh would cause or inspire the enemy army to go and attack Babylon.

# Leb Kamai

This is code name for Chaldea, a region of Babylonia. It is not clear why Jeremiah uses this name here, so you may want to translate as "Chaldea" or "Babylonia." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# scatter her and devastate her land ... they will come against her

The word "her," a metaphor that refers to Babylon as if it were a woman, is also a metonym for the people who live in Babylon. AT: "separate the people who live there from each other, send them in different directions, and make their land empty ... foreigners will attack the people of Babylon" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# on the day of disaster

The phrase "day of" is a Hebrew idiom for "when." AT: "when I destroy Babylon" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
