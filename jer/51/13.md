# General Information:

Jeremiah continues to speak to the people of Jerusalem as if he were speaking to the people of Babylon, who cannot hear him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe]])

# The thread of your life is now cut short

The people's lives are spoken of as if they were threads that God could cut. This can be stated in active form. AT: "Your lives will be ended quickly" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
