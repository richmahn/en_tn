We never thought that Babylon could become a ruined place, but it has become a ruined place" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# the praise of all the earth is seized

The word "praise" is a metonym for the thing that people praised, and the word "earth" is a metonym for the people living on the earth. This can be translated in active form. Alternate translation: "enemies have seized Babylon, the nation that everyone on earth praised" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
