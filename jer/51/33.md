# is like a threshing floor

People thresh grain by trampling it on a threshing floor, and Yahweh speaks of people punishing the daughter of Babylon as if they were threshing grain. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# It is time to trample her down

Yahweh punishing the daughter of Babylon is spoken of as if he were trampling and threshing grain on a threshing floor. Alternate translation: "It is time to punish her" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the time of harvest will come to her

The harvest is a metaphor for the result of the actions that the people did before. Babylon will experience the result of its people's sins. Alternate translation: "God will punish her for her sins" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
