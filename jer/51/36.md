# General Information:

This begins Yahweh's reply to Jerusalem's request in verses 34 and 35.

# I am about to plead your case and bring about vengeance

Yahweh defending his people is spoken of as if he were a lawyer pleading their case in court. Alternate translation: "I will be like your lawyer to defend you and I will bring about vengeance" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
