# General Information:

Jeremiah is speaking to the people of Jerusalem as if he were speaking to the people of Babylon and their enemies, who cannot hear him, telling them that Yahweh will destroy Babylon before the Babylonians can prepare to defend themselves. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe]])
