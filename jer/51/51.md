words that one person uses to offend another

# reproach has covered our faces

The speakers' reaction to people expressing disapproval of them is spoken of as if it were a cover placed over the speakers' faces. Alternate translation: "our faces show that we are hurt because others disapprove of us" or "we cover our faces in shame because others disapprove of us" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
