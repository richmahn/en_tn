# General Information:

Jeremiah prays for the people of Israel.

# that the way of a man does not come from himself. No person walking directs his own steps

These two phrases mean the same thing. This means that no one has control over the various things that will happen to him during his life. AT: "that no person controls what will happen to him; no one is able to direct the events that he will experience" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
