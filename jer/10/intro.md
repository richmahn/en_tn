# Jeremiah 10 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

The ULT sets the lines in 10:1-25 farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because they are a long quotation.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Yahweh's power #####
This chapter contrasts the great power of Yahweh with the powerlessness of any other false god. It is intended to question why the Jews would worship any other god. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/falsegod]])
