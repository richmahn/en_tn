# Jeremiah 10 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 10:1-25, which is an extended quotation.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Yahweh's power #####
This chapter contrasts the great power of Yahweh with the powerlessness of any other false god. It is intended to question why the Jews would worship any other god. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/falsegod]])
