# They are all the same, they are brutish and stupid, disciples

The words "brutish" and "stupid" mean basically the same thing and emphasize how foolish the people are for worshiping idols. AT: "They are all very stupid, they are disciples" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# disciples of idols that are nothing but wood

"they try to learn from an idol which is only a piece of wood"
