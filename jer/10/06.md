Jeremiah has just been talking about idol worship.

## Who does not fear you, king of the nations? ##

Jeremiah does not expect an answer to this question. It is more like a statement. AT: "Everyone should fear you, king of the nations" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## what you deserve  ##

"what you have earned"
