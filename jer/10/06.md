## translationNotes

* Jeremiah has just been talking about idol worship.
* **Who does not fear you, king of the nations?** - Jeremiah does not expect an answer to this question. It is more like a statement. AT: "Everyone should fear you, king of the nations" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **what you deserve ** - "what you have earned"
