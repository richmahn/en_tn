God is speaking to Jeremiah.

## The maker of earth in his power established dry land in his wisdom and spread the heavens in his understanding. ##

AT: "The Creator is strong and wise. He made  the earth and sky."

## His voice makes the roar of waters in the heavens ##

AT: "He controls the storms in the sky by speaking"

## and he brings up the mists from the ends of the earth ##

AT: "He makes clouds everywhere on earth."
