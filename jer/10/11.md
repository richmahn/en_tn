# General Information:

God is speaking to Jeremiah.

# You will speak to them like this

The word "you" refers to the Israelites and the word "them" refers to the people of the other nations.

# will perish from the earth

This speaks of the idols disappearing and losing their significance as if they were dying. This emphasizes their lack of power. Alternate translation: "will disappear from the earth" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
