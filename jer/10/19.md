Jeremiah is speaking as if he were the whole tribe of Israel. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

## Woe to me! Because of my broken bones, my wound is infected ##

AT: "We are in deep trouble like a person whose bones are broken and infected." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## My tent is devastated, and all of my tent cords are cut in two ##

The enemy has completely destroyed my city" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## They have taken ##

"the enemies have taken"

## There is no longer anyone to spread out my tent or to raise up my tent curtains ##

AT: There is no one to rebuild our city." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
