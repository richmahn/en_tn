# General Information:

Jeremiah often wrote prophecy in the form of poetry. Hebrew poetry uses different kinds of parallelism. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# This is the word of Yahweh that came to Jeremiah

This idiom is used to introduce a special message from God. See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 14:1](../14/01.md), and make any changes as needed. AT: "This is the message that Yahweh gave to Jeremiah" or "This is the message that Yahweh spoke to Jeremiah" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
