## my servant Jacob, do not fear. Do not be dismayed, Israel  ##

These two phrases mean the same thing and are combined for emphasis. Both "Jacob" and "Israel" here represent the nation of Israel.(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## this is Yahweh's declaration ##

See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 1:7](../01/07.md).

## will certainly not leave you unpunished ##

"will certainly punish you." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
