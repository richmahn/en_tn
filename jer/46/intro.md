# Jeremiah 46 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations prefer to set quotations apart. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 46:3-12, 14-24, which comprise extended quotations.

This begins a section where Jeremiah prophesies about other nations. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]])

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####
##### Justice #####
Much of Jeremiah is concerned with Yahweh's punishment of Judah. Yahweh used Egypt to punish Judah. Because Yahweh is just, he is going to punish Egypt for their evil deeds as well. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/justice]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/evil]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/works]])

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### Battle preparations #####
Jeremiah commands the Egyptian army to prepare for battle, even though they will not be able to defend themselves. Their  punishment has already been determined by Yahweh.
