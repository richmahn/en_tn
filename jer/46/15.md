# Why are your mighty ones face-down on the ground? They will not stand

Some Bibles translate this as "Why has Apis fled? Why did your bull not stand?" Apis was an Egyptian god that was represented by the form of a bull. The bull is often a symbol for strength. That is why the ULB and other versions of the Bible translate this as "strong ones" or "mighty ones," which refers to soldiers.

# Why are your mighty ones face-down on the ground? They will not stand

Yahweh uses a question to mock the strength of the Egyptian soldiers. This question can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: "Your soldiers are face-down on the ground and will not stand" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
