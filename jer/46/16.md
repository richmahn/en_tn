# He increases the numbers of those who stumble

"Yahweh causes more and more of your soldiers to stumble"

# Let us leave this sword that is beating us down

Here "sword" represents the enemy soldiers who are carrying weapons. Alternate translation: "Let us run away from our enemies because they are killing us" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
