## translationNotes

* **someone will come who is like Mount Tabor and Mount Carmel by the sea** - This refers to the nation of Babylon who will be as overwhelming to the nation of Egypt as the these two mountains are to the plains that surround them.
* **Get ready for yourselves your baggage** - AT: "prepare to travel"
* **Memphis will become a horror and a ruin** - Both these phrase are saying basically the same thing, that the capital of the nation of Egypt will be completely destroyed. (See: [:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
