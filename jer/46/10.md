Jeremiah's quotation of Yahweh's declaration to the nation of Egypt continues.

## That day ##

This phrase refers to the day the Egyptians lose the battle to the Babylonians.

## his foes ##

This word means enemies of Yahweh.

## sword will devour and be satisfied. It will drink its fill of their blood ##

Here the sword is eating as a person would. Both these phrases are saying similar thing and are combined to emphasize that there will be complete destruction.  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

## sword will devour ##

The word "sword" here represents the army of the nation of Babylon. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## sacrifice to the Lord Yahweh ##

The "sacrifice" here is the nation of Egypt. AT: "Egypt will be a sacrifice to the Lord Yahweh." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
