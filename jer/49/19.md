Yahweh continues speaking about what will happen to Edom.

## See ##

AT: "Look, listen, pay attention".

## like a lion ##

This is another way of saying that the attack will be fierce and unexpected. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

## For who is like me, and who will summon me? ##

Yahweh uses the question to point out the smallness of humans. AT:" No one is like me, no one orders me around". (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## summon ##

"order someone to come"

## What shepherd is able to resist me? ##

Yahweh uses the question to show no one can defeat him. "Shepherd" here is a metaphor for "king," "ruler." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]],  [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
