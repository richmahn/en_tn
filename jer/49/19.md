## translationNotes

* Yahweh continues speaking about what will happen to Edom.
* **See** - AT: "Look, listen, pay attention".
* **like a lion** - This is another way of saying that the attack will be fierce and unexpected. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
* **For who is like me, and who will summon me?** - Yahweh uses the question to point out the smallness of humans. AT:" No one is like me, no one orders me around". (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **summon** - "order someone to come"
* **What shepherd is able to resist me?** - Yahweh uses the question to show no one can defeat him. "Shepherd" here is a metaphor for "king," "ruler." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]],  [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
