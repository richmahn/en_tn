# Is there no longer any wisdom to be found in Teman?

Yahweh uses a question to scold the people of Teman for not acting wisely. This can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: "It seems that there are no longer any wise people in Teman!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Teman

This is the name of a district in Edom. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# Has good advice ... understanding? Has their wisdom become corrupted?

The same idea is expressed in two different ways. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
