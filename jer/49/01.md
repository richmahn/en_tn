# Yahweh says this

Jeremiah often uses these words to introduce an important message from Yahweh. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Jeremiah 6:6](../06/06.md).

# Does Israel have no children? Is there no one to inherit anything in Israel? Why does Molech occupy Gad, and his people live in its cities?

Yahweh uses a question to express that the people of Israel should be living in Gad rather than those who worship Molech. This question can be translated as a statement. AT: "There are plenty of Israelites to inherit the land of Israel. The people who worship the false idol, Molech, should not live in Gad." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Why does Molech

Here "Molech" represents the people who worship Molech. AT: "Why do the people who worship Molech" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
