# a lair of jackals

"a place where jackals live." Jackals are fierce wild dogs. See how you translated "jackals" in [Jeremiah 9:11](../09/11.md).

# No one will live there; no human being will stay there

These two lines mean basically the same thing and emphasize that Hazor will be completely uninhabited. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
