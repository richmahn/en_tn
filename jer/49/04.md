# Why do you brag about your valleys ... daughter?

Yahweh uses a question to scold the people for bragging about the large amount of fruit that grows in their valleys. This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: "Do not be proud of your valleys ... daughter." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Why do you brag about your valleys, your valleys that are so fruitful

Some versions of the Bible read, "Why do you brag about your strength, your strength which is ebbing away"

# faithless daughter

Here, the people of Ammon are spoken of as if they were a daughter. Alternate translation: "faithless people" or "rebellious people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# say, 'Who will come against me?'

The Ammonites use this question to state that they do not believe anyone can defeat them. It can be reworded as an indirect statement. Alternate translation: "falsely think that no one can defeat you." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
