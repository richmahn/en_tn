# Bozrah

Translate the name of this city as you did in [Jeremiah 48:24](../48/24.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# the hearts of Edom's soldiers will become like the heart of a woman in birth labor

Here "hearts" represent a person's emotions. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Jeremiah 48:41](../48/41.md). Alternate translation: "Edom's soldiers will be afraid like a woman about to give birth" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
