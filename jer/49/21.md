# At the sound of their falling the earth shakes

The loud sound of Edom being destroyed is spoken of as if Edom were a large object that shakes the earth when it falls. AT: "When enemies come and destroy Edom, the noise will be extremely loud, with the result that the earth will shake" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# The sound of distressed shouts is heard at the Sea of Reeds
