# Yahweh of hosts says this

Jeremiah often uses these words to introduce an important message from Yahweh. See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 6:6](../06/06.md).

# I am about to break the bowmen of Elam, the main part of their power

"The archers made Elam very powerful, but I will stop them"

# bowmen

men who are skilled with a bow and arrows
