# General Information:

Yahweh continues speaking about what will happen to Edom.

# See

"Look" or "Listen" or "Pay attention to what I am about to tell you"

# must certainly drink some of the cup ... for you will certainly drink

Here "the cup" is a metonym that represents the contents in the cup that the people must drink. The people experiencing Yahweh's punishment is spoken of as if Yahweh's punishment were liquid in a cup and the people must drink it. Alternate translation: "must certainly experience my punishment ... for you will certainly experience my punishment" or "I will certainly still punish ... for I will certainly punish you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Do you yourself think you will go without punishment?

Yahweh uses a question to emphasize the people of Edom have sinned and will certainly be punished. This question can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: "Certainly, you must be aware that you will personally experience my punishment for your sins." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# you yourself

The words "you" and "yourself" refer to Edom, which represents the people of Edom. The word "yourself" is used to draw attention to the people of Edom. Alternate translation: "you yourselves" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns]])
