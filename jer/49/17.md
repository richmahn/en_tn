Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Edom.

## tremble and hiss ##

AT: "shake from fear and speak of their displeasure" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

## Like the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah ##

AT: "in the way Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

## no one will live there; no person will stay there ##

Yahweh says the same thing twice for emphasis. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
