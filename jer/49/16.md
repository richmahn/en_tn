# General Information:

Yahweh continues speaking about what will happen to Edom.

# As for your fearsomeness

Here the abstract noun "fearsomeness" can be translated with either an adjective or a verb. AT: "As for how terrifying you think you are" or "Although you think you scare other people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# your heart's pride has deceived you

Here "heart" represents the whole person. People deceiving themselves is spoken of as if their pride deceived them. AT: "you have become prideful, but you have deceived yourselves" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# so that you may make your nest high like an eagle

It is implied that the people made homes in high places to remain safe from enemies. AT: "live in safety like an eagle in the heights of the mountains" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# eagle

This is a very large, powerful bird of prey. See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 4:13](../04/13.md).

# this is Yahweh's declaration

Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 1:8](../01/08.md). AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
