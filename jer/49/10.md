# But I have stripped Esau bare

Yahweh causing an enemy army to come and take everything is spoken of as if Yahweh stripped all the clothes off of Esau. Alternate translation: "But I have sent an army to take everything away from Esau" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Esau ... his hiding ... he will not ... hide himself ... His children ... he is gone

Here "Esau" represents the people of Edom. Alternate translation: "the people of Edom ... their hiding ... they will not ... hide themselves ... Their children ... they are gone" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# I have revealed his hiding places

"I have made known to the enemy soldiers where the people of Edom hide"
