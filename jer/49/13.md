# this is Yahweh's declaration

Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 1:8](../01/08.md). Alternate translation: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# Bozrah will become a horror, a disgrace, a devastation, and an object for cursing

The abstract nouns "a horror," "a disgrace," and "a devastation" can be translated as verbs. Alternate translation: "People will be horrified when they see that the city of Bozrah is devastated. And they will mock the city and use its name when they curse others" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# Bozrah

This is the name of a city in Edom. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# All of its cities

"All of Edom's cities"
