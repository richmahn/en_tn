# days are coming ... when the city will be rebuilt

Future time is spoken of as if the "days are coming." See how you translated this metaphor in [Jeremiah 7:32](../07/32.md). Alternate translation: "in the future ... the city will be rebuilt" or "there will be a time ... when the city will be rebuilt" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# this is Yahweh's declaration

Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 1:8](../01/08.md). Alternate translation: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# the city will be rebuilt for me

This can be translated in active form. Alternate translation: "they will rebuild the city for me" or "I will have them rebuild the city" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# Tower of Hananel ... Corner Gate

These are the names of places. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
