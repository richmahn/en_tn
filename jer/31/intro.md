# Jeremiah 31 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations indent each line of poetry to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetry in 31:1-6, 8-22, 35-37.

The ULB indents 31:29 because it is an important quotation.

This chapter begins with a transition from the previous chapter. "At that time" is a reference to the day of restoration mentioned in [Jeremiah 30:24](../30/23.md). (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/restore]])
#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### The New Covenant #####

This chapter is an important teaching regarding the New Covenant. God will make a new covenant that will bring forgiveness of sins and a desire to obey God. Scholars disagree about whether this new covenant has begun. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/newcovenant]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/forgive]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### Israel #####
In this chapter, Jeremiah uses the term "Israel" in reference to the nation of Israel as a whole. He also uses it in reference to the northern kingdom of Israel and their people group.
