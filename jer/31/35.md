# Only if these permanent things vanish ... will Israel's descendants ever stop from forever being a nation

This is a hypothetical situation that Yahweh never expects to truly happen. AT: "These permanent things will never vanish ... and Israel's descendants will never stop from forever being a nation" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])

# this is Yahweh's declaration

Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 1:8](../01/07.md). AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
