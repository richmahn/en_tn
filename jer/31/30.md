# For each man will die in his own iniquity

"For each man will die because of his own sins"

# everyone who eats sour grapes, his teeth will be dulled

Jeremiah restates the proverb so that it now means people will suffer as a consequence of their own behaviors. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-proverbs]])
