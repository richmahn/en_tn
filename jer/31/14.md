# I will saturate the lives of the priests in abundance

The abstract noun "abundance" can be translated as "many good things." The lives of the priests are spoken of as if they were a field that would become completely wet when much rain falls on it. Life is a metonym for the person. AT: "I will give the priests all the good things they would like" or "I will satisfy the priests with good things" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# this is Yahweh's declaration

Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 1:8](../01/08.md). AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
