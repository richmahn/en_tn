# Yahweh of hosts ... says this

Jeremiah often uses these words to introduce an important message from Yahweh. See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 6:6](../06/06.md).

# the people

Here this refers to the people of Judah. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# May Yahweh bless you, you righteous place where he lives, you holy mountain

Jerusalem is on the top of a hill, and the temple was built at the highest point in Jerusalem. AT; "May Yahweh bless those who live in Jerusalem with Yahweh, where his temple is" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# you holy mountain

Mount Zion, where the temple had stood

# Judah and all its cities will live together there

The name of the man Judah is a metonym for the land on which his descendants, the people of the tribe of Judah, live, and the cities of Judah are spoken of as if they were the family of the man Judah, all of them living "there," in the land of Judah. AT: "it will be as if the land were a house in which Judah lived with his family" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# as will farmers and those who set out with flocks

"and farmers and those who set out with flocks will also live there"

# those who set out with flocks

people who take care of sheep and goats

# had been refreshing

"had refreshed me"
