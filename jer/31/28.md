# I kept them under surveillance in order to uproot them

"looked for ways to uproot them"

# uproot ... tear them down ... overthrow ... destroy

See how you translated these ideas in [Jeremiah 1:9](../01/09.md).

# in order to build them up and to plant them

Yahweh speaks of the Israelites as if they were a house or a food crop. AT: "in order to make them strong and many" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
