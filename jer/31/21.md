God continues to speak from verse 7.

## Place road signs ... Set up guideposts ... Set your mind ... Come back ##

These commands are given to "virgin Israel."

## Set your mind on the right path, the way you should take. ##

AT: "Try hard to remember the way you came when you were taken into captivity."(See [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## Come back, virgin Israel! ##

God is referring to a changed Israel. (See [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## How long will you continue to waver, faithless daughter? ##

God is asking how long His people will disobey Him.  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]]) AT: "Do not hesitate to start obeying me"
