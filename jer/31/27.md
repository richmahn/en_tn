## I will sow the houses of Israel and Judah with the descendants of man and beast ##

AT: "I will increase man and beast like a farmer plants crops" or "I will increase the populations of both people and animals in the kingdoms of Israel and Judah."  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## I kept them under surveillance in order to uproot them ##

AT: "looked for ways to uproot them"

## uproot ... tear ... down ... destroy ... overthrow ##

See how you translated these ideas in [Jeremiah 1:9](../01/09.md).
