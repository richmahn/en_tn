# Hold your voice back from weeping and your eyes from tears

The voice and eyes are spoken of as if they were people whom Rachel needed to keep from moving. Alternate translation: "Stop weeping aloud and stop crying tears" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# Hold your voice ... your eyes ... your work ... your children

Yahweh is speaking to the Israelites as if he were speaking to Rachel ([Jeremiah 31:15](../31/15.md)), so all instances of "your" and the commands are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe]])

# this is Yahweh's declaration

In both instances of this phrase, Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 1:8](../01/08.md). Alternate translation: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
