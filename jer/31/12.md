# on the heights of Zion

"on Zion, the high place" or "on Mount Zion." Being on top of a hill is a metaphor for being happy. If your language associates mountain tops with sadness, it would be best to leave out the metaphor. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# like a watered garden

This means they will be strong and healthy, and they will prosper. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# they will never again feel any more sorrow

The world "never" is a generalization. The Israelites will almost always feel joy. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
