# Fathers have eaten sour grapes, but the children's teeth are dulled

These words are a proverb that Jeremiah heard people say when they were complaining that Yahweh was punishing children for the sins of their fathers. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-proverbs]])

# sour grapes

Possible meanings are 1) grapes with too much acid in them or 2) grapes that are not ripe. If grapes are not part of your culture, you may want to use a general word for fruit.

# teeth are dulled

Use the common words in your language for how people's mouths feel when they eat sour or unripe fruit.

# For each man will die in his own iniquity

"For each man will die because of his own sins"

# everyone who eats sour grapes, his teeth will be dulled

Jeremiah restates the proverb so that it now means people will suffer as a consequence of their own behaviors. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-proverbs]])
