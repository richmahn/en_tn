# At that time

This refers to the time when God punishes the wicked.

# this is Yahweh's declaration

Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 1:8](../01/07.md). AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# The people who have survived the sword have found favor in the wilderness

The phrase "found favor" is an idiom. AT: "While the people who have survived the sword have been in the wilderness, I have had grace on them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# who have survived the sword

The word "sword" is a metonym for war. AT: "who have survived the war" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# wilderness; I will go out to give rest to Israel

Another possible meaning is "wilderness, where Israel went out to find rest."

# Yahweh appeared to me

Jeremiah speaks of himself as if he were the people of Israel. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# I have drawn you toward myself with covenant faithfulness

The abstract noun "faithfulness" can be stated as "faithful" or "faithfully." AT: "I have been faithful to my covenant and brought you near to me" or "I have faithfully loved you and brought you near to me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
