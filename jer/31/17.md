# Hold your voice ... your eyes ... your work ... your children ... your future ... your descendants

Yahweh is speaking to the Israelites as if he were speaking to Rachel ([Jeremiah 31:15](./15.md)), so all instances of "your" and the commands are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe]])
