# Shout ... Shout ... Let praise be heard ... Say

Yahweh is speaking in an apostrophe to all people of the world, so these verbs are plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pronouns]])

# the chief people of the nations

"the most important people group of all the nations" or "the people group that is more important than any other"

# Let praise be heard

This can be translated in active form. Alternate translation: "Cause everyone to hear your praise" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
