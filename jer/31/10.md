# General Information:

Yahweh continues speaking about how he will bring the Israelite people back from being captives in Babylon.

# Hear ... Report

Yahweh is speaking to the nations, so these verbs are plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pronouns]])

# The one who scattered Israel is gathering her up and keeping her

Yahweh speaks of himself as if he were someone else, and he speaks of the people of Israel as if they were a helpless woman. AT: "I caused my people Israel to be scattered among the nations, but now I am bringing them home and keeping them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pronouns]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# as a shepherd keeps his sheep

A shepherd cares for and protects his sheep, and Yahweh is promising to care for and protect the Israelites. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# For Yahweh has ransomed Jacob and has redeemed him from the hand that was too strong for him

These two phrases mean basically the same thing and emphasize that it is Yahweh who has rescued the people of Israel. AT: "For Yahweh has rescued the people of Israel from their enemy who was too strong for them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
