* **as a shepherd keeps his sheep** - This means God cares for and protects his people as a shepherd does his sheep. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
* **For Yahweh has ransomed Jacob and has redeemed him from the hand that was too strong for him** - Here "ransomed" and "redeemed" mean basically the same thing.
