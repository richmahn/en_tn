# General Information:

Because of the words "Jeremiah's words end here" in [Jeremiah 51:64](../51/63.md) and because the words here appear in other books of the Bible, many scholars believe that this chapter was written by someone other than Jeremiah and attached to the scroll that Jeremiah and Baruch wrote.
