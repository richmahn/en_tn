# to all the people from the least to the greatest

This is a way to refer to people from every social status. Here "least" and "greatest" represent those who are least important and those who are most important. See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 42:1](./01.md). AT: "to all the people from every social status" or "to all the people, including the least important and the most important people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])

# to all the people

Most likely not every individual in the town went. The word "all" is a generalization that means very many people went. AT: "to many other people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
