# Now

The word "now" does not mean "at this moment," but is used to draw attention to the important point that follows.

# to this word of Yahweh

"to Yahweh's message"

# Yahweh of hosts ... says this

Jeremiah often uses these words to introduce an important message from Yahweh. See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 6:6](../06/06.md).

# set out to go to

"depart for" or "leave for"
