# all the people from the least to the greatest

This is a way to refer to people from every social status. Here "least" and "greatest" represent those who are least important and those who are most important. AT: "all the people from every social status" or "all the people, including the least important and the most important people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])

"Let us present our urgent request to you." The abstract noun "pleas" can be stated as a verb. AT: "Listen as we plead with you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
