# I will build you and not tear you down

Yahweh refers to the people of Israel like a wall that can be built or torn down. AT: "I will cause you to prosper and I will not destroy you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# I will plant you and not pull you up

Yahweh uses another example to express how he will cause the people of Israel to prosper and not be destroyed. He refers to them like a plant in the same way he referred to them as a wall. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# I will turn back the disaster that I have brought on you

A disaster is here spoken of as something that a person can put onto someone else. AT: "I will prevent the disaster that I have caused to happen to you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
