# this is Yahweh's declaration

Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 1:8](../01/07.md). AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# to save you and rescue you

The words "save" and "rescue" mean the same thing and emphasize that Yahweh will, indeed, save. AT: "to save you completely" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# rescue you from his hand

Here the word "hand" refers to power and authority. AT: "rescue you from his power" or "rescue you from him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
