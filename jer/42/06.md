# Whether it is good or if it is bad

The people mention both extremes to emphasize that they will obey no matter what Yahweh's answer is. Alternate translation: "Whatever he answers" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])

# the voice of Yahweh our God

Here "voice" represents what Yahweh says. Alternate translation: "what Yahweh our God says" or "we will obey Yahweh our God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
