#### Special concepts in this chapter

##### Life in Babylon
The remaining army commanders, who scattered after the Babylonian victory, asked Jeremiah to ask Yahweh about where they should go. Yahweh encouraged them to go to Babylon because they would soon return to the Promised Land. They would be punished if they went to Egypt or anywhere else.
