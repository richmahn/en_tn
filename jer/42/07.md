See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 42:1](./01.md).

## I might lay your pleas before him ##

"I would present your urgent request to him"

## I will build you and not tear you down ##

Yahweh refers to the people of Israel like a wall that can be built or torn down. AT: "I will cause you to prosper and no be destroyed" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## I will plant you and not pull you up ##

Yahweh uses another example to express how he will cause the people of Israel to prosper and not be destroyed.  He refers to them like a plant in the same way he referred to them as a wall. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## I will turn back the disaster that I have brought on you ##

A disaster is here spoken of as something that a person can put onto someone else. AT: "I will prevent the disaster that I have caused to happen to you"
