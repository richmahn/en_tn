# he will be like a tree planted by water

The person who trusts in Yahweh will always prosper, just like a tree does when it is planted by a river. It is not affected when there is no rain. This can be stated in active form. AT: "he will be like a tree that someone has planted by water" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# It will not fear the heat when it comes ... It is not anxious in a year of drought

Yahweh speaks of a tree that draws its water from a stream being unaffected by heat and drought as if the tree were unafraid of these things. AT: "The heat will not affect it when it comes ... No harm is caused to it in a year of drought" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
