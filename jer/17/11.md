# A partridge hatches an egg ... become rich unjustly

This analogy of a bird that hatches another bird's eggs is meant to illustrate a rich man who makes his money by robbing others.

# when half his days are over

Here the word "days" stands for someone's entire life. Alternate translation: "when he has lived only half of his life" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# those riches will abandon him

The riches are spoken of as if they were servants who would abandon their owner. Alternate translation: "he will lose his wealth" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# in the end

"at the end of his life"
