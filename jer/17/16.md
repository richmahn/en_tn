# I did not run from being a shepherd following you

Jeremiah speaks of leading and caring for the people as if he were a shepherd caring for sheep. He speaks of his abandoning that work as if he were running away from it. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# I did not long for

"I did not desire"

# the proclamations that came from my lips

Here the word "lips" represents Jeremiah who spoke. The word "proclamations" can be translated with a verbal phrase. AT: "the proclamations that I spoke" or "the things that I proclaimed" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# They were made

This can be stated in active form. AT: "I made them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
