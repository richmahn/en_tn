# Jeremiah 17 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 17:1-18, which is an extended quotation. This quotation is a continuation of chapter 16:19-21 and these should be seen as one section.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Trusting God or humans #####

Trust is an important part of this chapter. Those who trust in human wisdom will not prosper. Those who trust in God will have all of their needs met. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/trust]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/wise]])

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter ####

##### Simile #####

The person who depends on the power of other people is compared to a bush in the desert which always has to struggle for life. But the person who trusts in God is like a tree growing by a stream and has all his needs supplied. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
