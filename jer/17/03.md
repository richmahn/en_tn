## They remember their altars on the mountains in the countryside ##

This phrase is a continuation from [Jeremiah 17:1](./01.md). Some ancient manuscripts read instead that "the mountains in the countryside" are part of the plunder that Yahweh will give to others. (See UDB) (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-manuscripts]])

## altars on the mountains ##

These are alters where false gods are worshipped. AT: "your heathen alters"

## your wealth and all your treasures ##

The words "wealth" and "treasures" mean the same thing and are combined for emphasis. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

## plunder ##

This refers to things that people steal or take by force.

## your sin is everywhere ##

AT: "you have sinned everywhere"

## the inheritance ##

This refers to the land of Israel.

## you have ignited a fire in my wrath, which will burn ##

Yahweh compares his judgment to a fire that destroys. AT: “by making me angry, it is as if you have started a fire that will burn you up” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
