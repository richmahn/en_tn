## translationNotes

* **They remember their altars on the mountains in the countryside** - This phrase is a continuation from [[en:bible:notes:jer:17:01]]. Some ancient manuscripts read instead that "the mountains in the countryside" are part of the plunder that Yahweh will give to others. (See UDB) (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_manuscripts]])
* **altars on the mountains** - These are alters where false gods are worshipped. AT: "your heathen alters"
* **your wealth and all your treasures** - The words "wealth" and "treasures" mean the same thing and are combined for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
* **plunder** - This refers to things that people steal or take by force.
* **your sin is everywhere** - AT: "you have sinned everywhere"
* **the inheritance** - This refers to the land of Israel.
* **you have ignited a fire in my wrath, which will burn** - Yahweh compares his judgment to a fire that destroys. AT: “by making me angry, it is as if you have started a fire that will burn you up” (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
