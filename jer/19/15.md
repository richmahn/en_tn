# Yahweh of hosts ... says this

Jeremiah often uses these words to introduce an important message from Yahweh. See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 6:6](../06/06.md).

# See

"Look" or "Listen" or "Pay attention to what I am about to tell you"

# stiffened their neck and refused to listen

These two phrases both speak of the people being stubborn. In the first phrase, Yahweh speaks of the people being stubborn as if they had made their necks stiff. Alternate translation: "stubbornly refused to listen" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
