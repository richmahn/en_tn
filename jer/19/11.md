# Yahweh of hosts says this

Jeremiah often uses these words to introduce an important message from Yahweh. See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 6:6](../06/06.md).

# it could not be repaired again

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "no one can repair it again" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
