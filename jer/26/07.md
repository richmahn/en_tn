## Yahweh's house ##

"the temple"

## all the people seized him and said, â€œYou will certainly die! ##

Possible meanings are 1) The people chose to believe the lie of false peace and did not want to be confronted with the truth or 2) the people believed the other prophets proclaiming peace and saw Jeremiah as a false prophet who should be stoned for leading the people astray.

## Why have you prophesied in Yahweh's name and said that this house will become like Shiloh and this city will become desolate, with no inhabitant? ##

This is a rebuke.  AT: "You should not have prophesied in Yahweh's name that his temple would be destroyed." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
