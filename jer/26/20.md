# Connecting Statement:

Jeremiah stops telling about his own life and begins telling about what happened to another prophet.

# Meanwhile there was

"While what I was just telling you about was happening, there was"

# prophesied against this city and this land

The words "city" and "land" are metonyms for the people who live there. AT: "prophesied that bad things would happen to the people who lived in this city and this land" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
