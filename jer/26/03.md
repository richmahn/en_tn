# each man will turn from his wicked ways

Yahweh speaks of a person's lifestyle as if it were a "way" or path along which the person walks. AT: "each man will stop his wicked way of living" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# so I will relent concerning the disaster

This is conditional destruction. If Judah repents, God will not destroy but heal them.

# the wickedness of their practices

"the wicked way that they live" or "the wicked things that they do"
