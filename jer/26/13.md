# your ways ... your practices

These two phrases mean almost the same thing. AT: "the things you do" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# listen to the voice of Yahweh

The voice is a synecdoche for the person, and the same word can be translated "listen" or "obey." AT: "obey Yahweh" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
