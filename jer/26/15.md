# you are bringing innocent blood on yourselves and on this city and its inhabitants

Blood is a metonym for violent death, and to bring blood on someone is to make them guilty of violent death. Alternate translation: "you are making yourselves and this city and its inhabitants guilty of the violent death of an innocent person" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# this city and its inhabitants

These are two ways of speaking of the same people, perhaps first as a group and then as individuals. The city is a metonym for the people in the city. Alternate translation: "all the people in the city and every one of the people who live here" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# for your ears

The ear is a metonym for what the ear hears. Alternate translation: "for you to hear" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
