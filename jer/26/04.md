# If you do not listen to me so as to walk in my law that I have placed before you

Yahweh speaks of a person's lifestyle as if it were a path along which the person walks. AT: "If you do not obey me and the law that I have given you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# then I will make this house like Shiloh

Yahweh had destroyed a place of worship at Shiloh, and he was threatening to destroy this place of worship. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# I will turn this city into a curse
