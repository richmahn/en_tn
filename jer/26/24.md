# the hand of Ahikam ... was with Jeremiah

The hand is a metonym for the power that the hand exercises. Ahikam was not a soldier, so he probably was able to talk to people and change their minds. Alternate translation: "Ahikam ... was able to help Jeremiah" or "Ahikam ... was able to keep the people from harming Jeremiah" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# Ahikam ... Shaphan

The hand is a metonym for the power that the hand exercises. This can be translated in active form. Alternate translation: "Ahikam did not allow the people to have the power to put Jeremiah to death" or "the people could not kill Jeremiah because Ahikam did not give them the power to" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
