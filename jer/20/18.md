# Why is it that I came out from the womb to see troubles and agony ... shame?

Jeremiah uses this rhetorical question to complain that there was no good reason for him to be born. It can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: "There was no reason for me to be born only to see troubles and agony ... shame." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# to see troubles and agony

The words "troubles" and "agony" mean basically the same thing and emphasize the amount and severity of suffering. Alternate translation: "to experience so much suffering" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# my days are filled with shame

Here the word "days" represents all the days of Jeremiah's life. Alternate translation: "my life is filled with shame" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
