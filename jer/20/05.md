# I will give him

Here the word "him" refers to the king of Babylon.

# all the wealth ... all of its riches, all of its precious items and all the treasures

Yahweh repeats the same basic idea four times for emphasis. Babylon will take away all the wealth of Israel, including the king's possessions. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# I will place these things in the hand of your enemies

Placing things in people's hands represents  giving thing to the people or allowing the people to take the things. Alternate translation: "I will give these things to your enemies" or "I will allow your enemies to take possession of these things"  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
