## I will give him ##

Here the word "him" refers to the king of Babylon.

## all the wealth...all of its riches, all of its precious items and all the treasures ##

Yahweh repeats the same basic idea four times for emphasis. That is Babylon will take away all the wealth of Israel, including the King's possessions. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## I will place these things in the hand of your enemies ##

Here the word "hand" refers to possession. AT: "I will allow your enemies to take possession of these things" or "I will give these things to your enemies" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

## You and all of your loved ones to whom you prophesied ##

AT: "There, people will bury you and all of your loved ones to whom you prophesied deceitful things" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
