# it is like a fire in my heart, held within my bones

Here the words "heart" and "bones" represent Jeremiah's innermost being. Jeremiah speaks of being unable to not speak Yahweh's message as if Yahweh's message were a fire that burns within him. AT: "Yahweh's word is like a fire that burns deep within me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
