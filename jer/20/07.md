Jeremiah speaks to Yahweh.

# Yahweh, you deceived me, and I was deceived

# I was deceived

This can be stated in active form. AT: "you deceived me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# I have become a laughingstock all day long; everyone mocks me

These two phrases mean basically the same thing and emphasize the way others mock him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
