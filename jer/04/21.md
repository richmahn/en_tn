# How long will I see the standard? Will I hear the sound of the horn?

Jeremiah uses these questions to show his distress about seeing the battle flag and hearing the sound of the horn for such a long time. He wishes that the battle would end soon. It can be stated as an exclamation. AT: "Oh, how I wish that the battle would end, and the flag would be lowered, and the sound of the army's horn would stop" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# the standard

"the battle flag"

# the sound of the horn

Someone would blow the horn as a signal for battle.

# For the foolishness of my people ... do not know to do good.

It can be stated clearly that Yahweh says this. This is probably his reply to Jeremiah, telling why the battle is still happening. AT: "Yahweh replied, 'It is because of the foolishness of my people ... do not know to do good.'" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
