# General Information:

Jeremiah describes a vision that God gave him about things that would happen later.

# Behold

The word "behold" here alerts us to pay attention to the surprising information that follows.

# formless and empty

This vision is a prophecy of what the land of Israel would be like after the people were all taken into captivity.

# there was no light for the heavens

"there were no lights in the sky"

# all the cities had been pulled down

"all the cities had been destroyed" or "all the cities were a heap of ruins"

# before Yahweh, before the fury of his wrath

This indicates that all these things would happen because Yahweh was so angry with the people of Judah.
