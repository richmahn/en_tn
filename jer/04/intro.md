# Jeremiah 04 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations indent each line of poetry to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetry in 4:1-9.

The prophecy revealed to Jeremiah is recorded in 3:19-4:3. Despite covering more than one chapter, this should be seen as one unit. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/reveal]])

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Yahweh's punishment #####
This chapter prophecies Yahweh's punishment on Judah. This should bring Judah to repentance, but it does not. It is also intended to make the nations fear the power of Yahweh and make them desire to worship him. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/repent]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/fear]])
