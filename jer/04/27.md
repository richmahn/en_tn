# I will not hold back

"I will not change my mind"

# I will not turn from carrying them out

Here "turn" represents deciding not to do what he said he would do. AT: "I will not change my mind about doing what I said I would do" or "I will not refuse to do what I planned to do" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

Here "city" represents the people living in the city. AT: "The people of every city" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

a group of soldiers riding horses

# they will run into the forests

They will run away to the forests for safety.

# The cities will be abandoned, for there will be no one to inhabit them

These two clauses have similar meanings. The second one strengthens the thought in the first. AT: "The cities will be empty. There will be no one left to live in them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
