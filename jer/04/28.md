# the land will mourn, and the heavens above will darken

Jeremiah emphasizes Yahweh's judgment by saying that the earth itself expresses great sorrow. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# I will not hold back

"I will not change my mind"

# I will not turn from carrying them out

Here "turn" represents deciding not to do what he said he would do. AT: "I will not change my mind about doing what I said I would do" or "I will not refuse to do what I planned to do" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
