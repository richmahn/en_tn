This can be translated in active form. AT: "everything that Jeremiah has written in this book" or "everything that one has written in this book" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# I will repay them for their deeds and the works of their hands

Yahweh speaks of punishing the people of the nations for what they have done as if he were paying them back. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# their deeds and the works of their hands

These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The idiom "the works of their hands" refers to the actions of a person, with the word "hands" being a synecdoche that represents the person who does those actions. AT: "everything that they have done" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
