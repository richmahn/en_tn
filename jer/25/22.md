# Connecting Statement:

# the sea

This is a reference to the Mediterranean Sea.

# Dedan, Tema, and Buz

These are the names of places. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# all the ones who cut the hair on the sides of their heads

This probably refers to people who cut their hair short in order to honor a pagan god. Some modern versions interpret this Hebrew expression as "all the people who live on the edge of the wilderness." See how you translated a similar phrase in [Jeremiah 9:26](../09/25.md).

# they also had to drink it

"they also had to drink the wine from the cup"
