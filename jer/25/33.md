# those killed by Yahweh

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "those whom Yahweh killed" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# will on that day extend from one end of the earth to the other

By mentioning both ends of the earth, this phrase represents everywhere in between those ends. Alternate translation: "will on that day cover the entire earth" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])

# they will not be mourned, gathered, or buried

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "no one will mourn them, gather them, or bury them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# They will be like dung on the ground

The bodies are compared to dung on the ground to emphasize that they will be disgusting and that no one will bury them. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Jeremiah 16:4](../16/04.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
