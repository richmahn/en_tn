# all the ones who cut the hair on the sides of their heads

This probably refers to people who cut their hair short in order to honor a pagan god. Some modern versions interpret this Hebrew expression as "all the people who live on the edge of the wilderness." See how you translated a similar phrase in [Jeremiah 9:26](../09/26.md).
