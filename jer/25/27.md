The vision that God gave to the prophet Jeremiah continues.

## Drink and become drunk, then vomit, fall down, and do not rise before the sword that I am sending among you. ##

This shows the inevitability of the coming punishment and the futility of trying to avoid it.

## the cup from your hand to drink ##

AT: "their punishment"

## "You must certainly drink it ##

This is not a cup that nations can refuse to drink. Nations can not refuse God's Judgments of war and natural disasters.

## drink it ##

AT: be punished" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## the city that is called by my name ##

AT: "the people of Jerusalem" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## should you yourselves be free from punishment?  ##

AT: "you are to be punished." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## I am calling a sword against all the inhabitants of the land ##

AT: "I am punishing those who live in the land"
