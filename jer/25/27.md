## translationNotes

* The vision that God gave to the prophet Jeremiah continues.
* **Drink and become drunk, then vomit, fall down, and do not rise before the sword that I am sending among you.** - This shows the inevitability of the coming punishment and the futility of trying to avoid it.
* **the cup from your hand to drink** - AT: "their punishment"
* **"You must certainly drink it** - This is not a cup that nations can refuse to drink. Nations can not refuse God's Judgments of war and natural disasters.
* **drink it** - AT: be punished" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **the city that is called by my name** - AT: "the people of Jerusalem" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
* **should you yourselves be free from punishment? ** - AT: "you are to be punished." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **I am calling a sword against all the inhabitants of the land** - AT: "I am punishing those who live in the land"
