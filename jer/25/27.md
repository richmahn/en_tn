# Connecting Statement:

This passage continues the metaphor of Yahweh's extreme anger as wine that he causes the people of the nations to drink from a cup. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Yahweh of hosts ... says this

Jeremiah often uses these words to introduce an important message from Yahweh. See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 6:6](../06/06.md).

# before the sword that I am sending among you

Here the word "sword" represents war. Alternate translation: "before the wars that I am causing to happen among you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
