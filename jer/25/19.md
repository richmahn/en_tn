# Connecting Statement:

This passage continues the metaphor of Yahweh's extreme anger as wine that he causes the people of the nations to drink from a cup. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Other nations also had to drink it

The word "nations" represents the people of the nations. Alternate translation: "People from other nations also had to drink the wine from the cup" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
