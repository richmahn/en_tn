## translationNotes

* This passage continues the metaphor of Yahweh's wrath as a drink to be poured out.
* **I made all the nations to which Yahweh had sent me drink it** - The action of drinking from the cup of wine symbolized God's judgment.
* **to turn them into ruins and something terrifying** - AT: "to destroy them"
* **for hissing and cursing** - AT: "to be despised or cursed"
* **they are at this present day** - There was apparently a period of time between when this was written and when it actually happened.
