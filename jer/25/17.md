This passage continues the metaphor of Yahweh's wrath as a drink to be poured out.

## I made all the nations to which Yahweh had sent me drink it ##

The action of drinking from the cup of wine symbolized God's judgment.

## to turn them into ruins and something terrifying ##

AT: "to destroy them"

## for hissing and cursing ##

AT: "to be despised or cursed"

## they are at this present day ##

There was apparently a period of time between when this was written and when it actually happened.
