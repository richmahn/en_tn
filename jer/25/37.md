# So the peaceful pastures will be devastated

Yahweh continues to speak of the leaders of Israel as if they were shepherds. Here he speaks of the nation as the "pastures" in which they think they live peacefully. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the peaceful pastures will be devastated because of Yahweh's fierce anger

This can be put into active form. Alternate translation: "Yahweh will devastate the peaceful pastures because of he extremely angry" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
