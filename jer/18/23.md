# Do not wipe their sins away from you

Jeremiah speaks of Yahweh forgiving his enemies' sins as if someone had written their sins down and Yahweh would erase them. This phrase means the same thing as the previous phrase. Alternate translation: "Do not pardon their sins" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# let them be overthrown before you

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "let people overthrow them in your presence" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# in the time of your wrath

The word "wrath" can be translated with a verb. Alternate translation: "when you are still angry with them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
