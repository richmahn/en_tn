# tear it down, or destroy it

These two expressions basically mean the same thing. In the first expression, Yahweh speaks of destroying a kingdom as if the kingdom were a plant or a building that he tears down. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
