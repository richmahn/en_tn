# the pot he was making from the clay was spoiled in the potter's hand

The word "spoiled" means that something about the pot made the potter unhappy. This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "the pot that the potter was making with his hands was not good" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# was making

"was forming" or "was shaping"

# he returned the clay and formed it into another pot

He stopped making the pot, crushed the clay back into a lump, and then used that lump of clay to make another pot.

# that was pleasing in his eyes

Here the word "eyes" represents sight and sight represents one's opinion. Alternate translation: "that he thought was good" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
