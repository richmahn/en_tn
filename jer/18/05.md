## the word of Yahweh came to ##

See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 1:1](../01/01.md).

## Should I not be able to act like this potter with you, house of Israel? ##

With this question, Yahweh emphasizes his authority to do as he pleases with Israel. AT: "I am allowed to act toward you, house of Israel, like the potter acts toward the clay" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## this is Yahweh’s declaration ##

See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 1:7](../01/07.md).

## See! ##

The word “see” here adds emphasis to what follows. AT: “Indeed!”

## Like clay in a potter's hand—that is how you are in my hand ##

This phrase repeats what was implicit in the previous phrase in the form of a simile. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

## I may proclaim something ##

AT: "perhaps I proclaim something" or "for example, I proclaim something"

## tear it down, or destroy it ##

These two expressions basically mean the same thing and are repeated to emphasize how destructive God's judgment will be. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

## relent from ##

"withhold" AT: "not bring"
