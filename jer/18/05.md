## translationNotes

* **the word of Yahweh came to** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jer:01:01]].
* **Should I not be able to act like this potter with you, house of Israel?** - With this question, Yahweh emphasizes his authority to do as he pleases with Israel. AT: "I am allowed to act toward you, house of Israel, like the potter acts toward the clay" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **this is Yahweh’s declaration** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:jer:01:07]].
* **See!** - The word “see” here adds emphasis to what follows. AT: “Indeed!”
* **Like clay in a potter's hand—that is how you are in my hand** - This phrase repeats what was implicit in the previous phrase in the form of a simile. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
* **I may proclaim something** - AT: "perhaps I proclaim something" or "for example, I proclaim something"
* **tear it down, or destroy it** - These two expressions basically mean the same thing and are repeated to emphasize how destructive God's judgment will be. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
* **relent from** - "withhold" AT: "not bring"
