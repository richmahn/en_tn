# I will scatter them before their enemies like an eastern wind

Yahweh speaks of causing the people to flee before their enemies as if he were an eastern wind that scatters dust and debris. Alternate translation: "I will be like an eastern wind and scatter them before their enemies" or "I will scatter them before their enemies like an eastern wind scatters dust and debris" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# will scatter them

Here the word "them" refers to "my people."

# I will show them my back, and not my face

"I will turn my back toward them, and not my face." Turning one's back towards someone is a symbolic action that represents rejection and turning one's face towards someone is a symbolic action that represents favor. Alternate translation: "I will reject them and not act favorably towards them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
