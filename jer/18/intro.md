#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations indent each line of poetry to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetry in 18:13-17, 19-23.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####
##### Attacking Jeremiah #####
Things were so bad in Judah, they even attacked Jeremiah. To attack Yahweh's prophet was to attack Yahweh himself. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]])

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter ####

##### Simile #####

Like a potter can change what he is making from one type of pot to another, God can change his plans and not punish people if they repent. The image of God as a potter and mankind as clay is an important one in Scripture. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/repent]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
