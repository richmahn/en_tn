# Jeremiah 18 General Notes

#### Structure and formatting

Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 18:13-17, 19-23.

#### Special concepts in this chapter
##### Attacking Jeremiah
Things were so bad in Judah, they even attacked Jeremiah. To attack Yahweh's prophet was to attack Yahweh himself. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]])

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter

##### Simile

Like a potter can change what he is making from one type of pot to another, God can change his plans and not punish people if they repent. The image of God as a potter and mankind as clay is an important one in Scripture. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/repent]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
