# Jeremiah 43 General Notes #

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### They did not believe Jeremiah #####
After Jeremiah prophesied the destruction of Judah, the people did not believe him. Judah was conquered and destroyed. Even after this, the people did not believe they would be safe in Babylon as Jeremiah prophesied. This is shocking. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/believe]])

##### Babylon invades Egypt #####
Babylon is described as invading part of Egypt. This would have been unthinkable for the people. It would have gotten their attention. 

#### Other possible translation issues in this chapter ####

##### Symbolic actions #####
Jeremiah's burial of the stones was intended to be a symbolic action for the people. This was supposed to teach the people a lesson. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
