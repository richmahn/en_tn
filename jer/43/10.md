# Yahweh of hosts ... says this

Jeremiah often uses these words to introduce an important message from Yahweh. See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 6:6](../06/06.md).

# I will place his throne over these stones that you, Jeremiah, have buried. Nebuchadnezzar will place his pavilion over them

Both the king's "throne" and "pavilion" are used to refer to his royal authority. AT: "I will cause him to rule as king over the people of Egypt. He will place his throne and pavilion over these stones you have buried" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# pavilion

a very large tent
