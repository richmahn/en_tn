# all the people

This probably did not include every individual there. The word "all" is a generalization that means many people. Alternate translation: "many of the people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# refused to listen to Yahweh's voice

Here "voice" represents commands. And here "to listen" means "to obey." Alternate translation: "would not obey Yahweh's command" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
