The idiom "the word of Yahweh came to" is used to introduce a special message from God. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Jeremiah 1:4](../01/04.md). Alternate translation: "Yahweh gave a message to Jeremiah in Tahpanhes. He said, 'Take" or "Yahweh spoke this message to Jeremiah in Tahpanehs: 'Take" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# in the sight of the people of Judah

The abstract noun "sight" can be expressed with the verb "watching." Alternate translation: "while the people of Judah are watching" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

Jeremiah often uses these words to introduce an important message from Yahweh. See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 6:6](../06/06.md).
