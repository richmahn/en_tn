# Gedaliah ... Ahikam ... Shaphan

These are the names of men. See how you translated this in [Jeremiah 39:14](../39/14.md).

# among the people

"among the Judeans"

# it is good in your eyes

"Eyes" here is a metonym for what the person thinks. AT: "it is what you consider to be right" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
