History of the judges of Israel (1:1–16:31)\n    * Introduction (1:1–3:6)\n    * Othniel, Ehud, and Shamgar (3:7–31)\n    * Deborah and Barak (4:1–5:31)\n    * Gideon (6:1–8:35)\n    * Abimelech, Tola, and Jair (9:1–10:5)\n    * Jephthah (10:6–12:7)\n    * Ibzan, Elon, and Abdon (12:8–15)\n    * Samson (13:1–16:31)\n1. The account of Micah and his idols (17:1–18:31)\n1. The account of Gibeah; the other Israelites take revenge (19:1–21:25)\n\n### What is the Book of Judges about?\n\nThe Book of Judges tells of events that occurred after the Israelites settled in the Promised Land. The events in this book happened over a period of about 150 years.\n\nThis book describes how the Israelites repeatedly sinned against Yahweh during this time. They worshiped false gods and did the same wicked things as the peoples who lived around them. Therefore, God would allow enemies to defeat and oppress the Israelites. Eventually, the Israelites would call to Yahweh for help. Yahweh would then cause someone to help the Israelites defeat their enemies. This person was called a “judge.” The Israelites would live in peace until the judge died.\n\nAfter that judge died, the Israelites would start sinning again. So this pattern of events would repeat.\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nThis book traditionally has the title “Judges” because it gives accounts of some of the main leaders or judges in Israel before there were any kings over the people. Unless there are good reasons for following the title in other Bible versions, the translator should probably use the title “Judges” or a title such as “The Book about the Leaders in Israel.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### What kind of leaders were the judges?\n\nThese were men and women whom God chose to help the Israelites defeat their enemies. After defeating their enemies, these leaders usually continued to help the people by deciding disputes among them. They also helped them make important decisions. Many of these leaders served all the people of Israel, but some of these leaders may have served only certain tribes.\n\n### What kind of society was Israel during the time of the judges?\n\nDuring this time, the twelve tribes of Israel were independent of one another. They were not a unified nation with one ruler. The tribes would sometimes help each other when enemies were threatening them.\n\nThese tribes were descended from the same ancestors: Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. They shared in the same covenant with Yahweh.\n\n### What spiritual struggles did Israel experience during the time of the judges?\n\nDuring this time, Israel struggled to remain faithful to Yahweh. The best judges encouraged Israel to be faithful to him, but some of the judges failed to do so. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/faithful]])
1:intro	a4am				0	# Judges 1 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n- Verses 1–10: Judah conquers its assigned territory\n- Verses 11–16: Caleb and Othniel conquer Debir (Kiriath Sepher)\n- Verses 12–21: Judah and Simeon conquer territory but leave some hostile nations\n- Verses 22–29: Ephraim and Manasseh conquer territory but leave some hostile nations\n- Verses 30–36: Zebulin, Asher, Naphtali, and Dan conquer territory but leave some hostile nations\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Cutting off the thumbs and big toes of captured enemies\n\nIn [1:7](../01/07.md), Adoni-Bezek describes how he had his soldiers cut off the thumbs and big toes of the kings he had defeated. This prevented a captured enemy from running away or from ever using a weapon again. However, as the context shows, it was also a way of humiliating a captured king. When the Israelites did this to Adoni-Bezek, he acknowledged that he was getting what he deserved for having done this to others. This is an example of irony in the book of Judges, in which the punishment fits the crime. (See the discussion in the General Introduction.)\n\n### Complete destruction of a city and its people\n\nIn [1:17](../01/17.md), the armies of Judah and Simeon completely destroy a Canaanite city and kill all of its people. They call the place “Hormah,” which means “destruction.” [Deuteronomy 7:1–4](../deu/07/01.md) describes how, when Yahweh was preparing the Israelites to enter the Promised Land, he commanded them to destroy completely the Canaanite people who lived there. They were not to make any treaties with them or to intermarry with them. This was to prevent the Israelites from joining them in worshiping their false gods, which would have led them to develop a culture and society very different from the kind that Yahweh wanted. The book of Joshua describes how the Israelites completely destroyed the major Canaanite cities and their people. In this chapter, [1:17](../01/17.md) describes a further instance of that. However, the Israelites left many of the Canaanite people in the land, and they did intermarry with them and worship their gods. This led the Israelites into many evil practices that made Yahweh very angry with them.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Names of people groups, cities, and Israelite tribes meaning their people or armies\n\nIn this chapter, the author and characters often use the names of people groups or cities by association to mean the people or armies of those groups or cities. For example, when the author says in [1:1](../01/01.md) that the Israelites “fought against Jerusalem,” he means that they fought against the people who lived in that city. The author and characters sometimes also speak of the Israelite tribes as if they were individual people who could talk to one another, go places together, and so forth. For example, the author says in [1:1](../01/01.md), “Then Judah said to Simeon, his brother, ‘Go up with me into my allotment.’” If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. For example, instead of saying “Judah,” you could say “the people of the tribe of Judah.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])\n\n### Generic nouns\n\nIn this chapter, the author and characters use expressions such as “the Canaanite,” “the Perizzite,” “the Amorite,” and so forth. They are not referring to specific individuals. Rather, they mean in general the people of the nation mentioned. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using plural forms, for example, “the Canaanites.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])
1:1	j001		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	וַ⁠יְהִ֗י	1	The author is using the phrase **And it happened** to introduce a new event in the story of the people of Israel, which continues here in the book of Judges at the point where it left off at the end of the book of Joshua. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event.
1:1	j002		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	בְּנֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל	1	See the discussion of the phrase **the sons of Israel** in the Introduction to Judges. Alternate translation: “the people of Israel”
1:1	j003		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	מִ֣י יַעֲלֶה	1	The Israelites are asking Yahweh which of their tribes should be the first to go into its allotment and fight against the Canaanites living there. They are speaking of that tribe as if it were an individual person. (The verb in this phrase is singular, indicating that **Who** is also singular.) See the discussion of this issue, which occurs several times in this chapter, in the General Notes to this chapter. Alternate translation: “What tribe will go up”
1:1	c92j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	לָּ֧⁠נוּ	1	By **us**, the Israelites mean themselves but not Yahweh, to whom they are speaking, so use the exclusive form of that word in your translation if your language marks that distinction.
1:1	j231   		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	הַֽ⁠כְּנַעֲנִ֛י & בּֽ⁠וֹ	1	As the General Notes to this chapter discuss, here and in similar instances throughout the chapter, this is not a reference to a specific **Canaanite**. Rather, it refers to the Canaanites or the Canaanite nations in general. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using plural forms. Alternate translation: “the Canaanites … against them” or “the Canaanite nations … against them”
1:2	c4zw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	יְהוּדָ֣ה	1	Yahweh is using the name **Judah** by association to mean the army that belongs to the tribe of Judah. Alternate translation: “the army of the tribe of Judah”
1:2	j004		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הִנֵּ֛ה	1	Yahweh is using the term **Behold**, which literally means “Look,” to focus his listeners’ attention on what he is about to say. In this context, since Yahweh is the speaker, there is also the implication that what follows is something that Yahweh has determined and so is certain to happen. Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation. Alternate translation: “Indeed”
1:2	j005		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	נָתַ֥תִּי אֶת־הָ⁠אָ֖רֶץ בְּ⁠יָדֽ⁠וֹ	1	Here, having something in one’s **hand** represents possessing it. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I have given them possession of the land”
1:3	j006		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר יְהוּדָה֩ לְ⁠שִׁמְע֨וֹן & וַ⁠יֵּ֥לֶךְ אִתּ֖⁠וֹ שִׁמְעֽוֹן	1	The author is speaking of the tribes of Judah and Simeon as if they were individual people who could speak with each another. Alternate translation: “Then the people of Judah said to the people of Simeon … So the people of Simeon went with them” or “Then the commanders of the Judean army said to the commanders of the Simeonite army … So the Simeonite army went with the Judean army”
1:3	k7aq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אָחִ֜י⁠ו	1	The author is using the term **brother** to describe people who are descended from the same ancestor. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “their kinsmen” or “their fellow Israelites”
1:3	j007		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	עֲלֵ֧ה אִתִּ֣⁠י	1	In a context such as this, your language might say “Come” instead of **Go**. Alternate translation: “Come with me”
1:3	j008		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	בַּֽ⁠כְּנַעֲנִ֔י	1	See how you translated this same expression in [1:1](../01/01.md). Alternate translation: “against the Canaanites who live there”
1:3	j009		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠הָלַכְתִּ֧י גַם־אֲנִ֛י אִתְּ⁠ךָ֖ בְּ⁠גוֹרָלֶ֑⁠ךָ	1	The Judeans are leaving some information implicit. You could state this information explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “If you do, we will also go with you into your allotment and fight against the Canaanites who live there”
1:4	ku4h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	וַ⁠יַּ֣עַל יְהוּדָ֔ה	1	The author is using the name of one of the tribes whose soldiers were in this army to mean the entire army, which included soldiers from both tribes. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “And the army of the tribe of Judah went up with the army of the tribe of Simeon”
1:4	j010		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וַ⁠יִּתֵּ֧ן יְהוָ֛ה אֶת־הַ⁠כְּנַעֲנִ֥י וְ⁠הַ⁠פְּרִזִּ֖י בְּ⁠יָדָ֑⁠ם	1	Here, **hand** represents the power or capability of a person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and Yahweh gave them the power to conquer the Canaanites and the Perizzites”
1:4	j011		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וַ⁠יַּכּ֣וּ⁠ם	1	As the General Notes to this chapter discuss, when the author says that the armies of Judah and Simeon **struck** or hit the Canaanite and Perizzite soldiers who opposed them, he means that they killed them. Alternate translation: “And … they killed”
1:4	c9xq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	בְּ⁠בֶ֔זֶק	1	**Bezek** is the name of a city in the territory in Canaan that was allotted to the tribe of Judah.
1:4	n19d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers	עֲשֶׂ֥רֶת אֲלָפִ֖ים	1	The author may be using the number **10,000** as an approximation or as a customary way of saying “very many.” Alternate translation: “a large number of”
1:5	j012		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַֽ֠⁠יִּמְצְאוּ	1	The word **found** does not mean that the armies of Judah and Simeon were intentionally searching for this man. It means that they encountered him when they reached the city of Bezek. Alternate translation: “and they encountered”
1:5	w88l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	אֶת־אֲדֹנִ֥י בֶ֨זֶק֙	1	The word **Adoni-Bezek** is the name or title of a man. It means “the lord of Bezek,” and so it may be the title for the king who reigned in the city of Bezek.
1:5	i3pn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	וַ⁠יִּֽלָּחֲמ֖וּ בּ֑⁠וֹ	1	The author is using Adoni-Bezek to represent both this king himself and his entire army. Alternate translation: “and they fought against him and his army”
1:5	j013		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וַ⁠יַּכּ֕וּ אֶת־הַֽ⁠כְּנַעֲנִ֖י וְ⁠אֶת־הַ⁠פְּרִזִּֽי	1	See how you translated the word **struck** in the previous verse. Alternate translation: “And they killed many Canaanite and Perizzite soldiers”
1:6	j014		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	אֶת־בְּהֹנ֥וֹת יָדָ֖י⁠ו וְ⁠רַגְלָֽי⁠ו	1	Some languages use the same word for the largest finger and the largest toe, as the biblical text does here. If your language has different words for these, you can use both words in your translation. If the phrase might then seem to contain extra information that would be unnatural to express in your language, you could shorten it, as the UST does. Alternate translation: “the thumbs of his hands and the big toes of his feet” or “his thumbs and his big toes”
1:7	es2p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers	שִׁבְעִ֣ים ׀ מְלָכִ֡ים	1	This could be an approximate number, chosen for its symbolic significance. Alternate translation: “dozens of kings”
1:7	j015		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	מְלָכִ֡ים	1	In Canaan at this time, each city and town had a ruler who had the same title as someone who ruled over a large territory. So, for example, Pharaoh is called the “the king of Egypt” in Exodus 1:5, while the book of Joshua refers to the “king” of cities such as Libnah (Joshua 10:30) and Hebron (Joshua 10:37). If your language uses a different word for people who rule over one community than for people who rule over extensive areas, you could use that term here. Alternate translation: “chieftains”
1:7	t5fd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	בְּֽהֹנוֹת֩ יְדֵי⁠הֶ֨ם וְ⁠רַגְלֵי⁠הֶ֜ם מְקֻצָּצִ֗ים	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. See the General Notes to this chapter for an explanation of the practice described here. It is unlikely that Adoni-Bezek was the agent who did this personally. Alternate translation: “whose thumbs and big toes I ordered my soldiers to cut off”
1:7	g0oe		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	הָי֤וּ מְלַקְּטִים֙ תַּ֣חַת שֻׁלְחָנִ֔⁠י	1	Adoni-Bezek is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “were gathering scraps of food beneath my table”
1:7	p5cw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הָי֤וּ מְלַקְּטִים֙ תַּ֣חַת שֻׁלְחָנִ֔⁠י	1	Dozens of **kings** would not have fit under the **table** where Adoni-Bezek ate his meals, so he probably does not mean this literally. Instead, he seems to be speaking of these defeated chieftains as if they were dogs that had to scrounge for food from the scraps that fell from his table. This indicates that he had reduced them to a state of servile dependence. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “had to survive on what little I gave them” or “were my helpless prisoners”
1:8	j016		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	בְנֵֽי־יְהוּדָה֙	1	Here, **sons** means “descendants.” The author is describing the people of the tribe of Judah as descendants of their ancestor Judah. In context, the reference is specifically to the army of the tribe of Judah. Alternate translation: “the Judeans” or “the Judean army”
1:8	j017		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	בְנֵֽי־יְהוּדָה֙	1	As in [1:4](../01/04.md), the author is using the name **Judah** to represent the entire combined army. Alternate translation: “the armies of the tribes of Judah and Simeon”
1:8	hh58		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בִּ⁠יר֣וּשָׁלִַ֔ם וַ⁠יִּלְכְּד֣וּ אוֹתָ֔⁠הּ	1	Here, **Jerusalem** represents the people of that city. Alternate translation: “against the people who lived in Jerusalem and captured that city”
1:8	j018		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	 וַ⁠יַּכּ֖וּ⁠הָ לְ⁠פִי־חָ֑רֶב	1	The author is speaking of the people who lived in the city of Jerusalem by association with the city itself, represented by the pronoun **it**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “And they struck the people who lived there with the mouth of the sword”
1:8	j019		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	 וַ⁠יַּכּ֖וּ⁠הָ לְ⁠פִי־חָ֑רֶב	1	The author is speaking of **the sword** as if it were a living thing that had a **mouth** and could eat. This is probably a reference to the way a sword cuts into a person as if it were an animal biting him. (The **mouth** of a **sword** could be its point or its edge.) If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “And with their swords they killed the people who lived there”
1:8	j020		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	 וַ⁠יַּכּ֖וּ⁠הָ לְ⁠פִי־חָ֑רֶב	1	The author is may be using one kind of weapon, the **sword**, to mean all of the weapons that the soliders used. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “And with their weapons they killed the people who lived there”
1:8	j021		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠אֶת־הָ⁠עִ֖יר שִׁלְּח֥וּ בָ⁠אֵֽשׁ	1	The author is speaking as if the Israelites had literally **sent** or thrown the **city** of Jerusalem into a large **fire** that was burning nearby. (This same expression occurs in Judges 20:48.) If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and they set the city on fire”
1:9	cs3t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	בְּנֵ֣י יְהוּדָ֔ה	1	See how you translated this expression in the previous verse. Alternate translation: “the armies of the tribes of Judah and Simeon”
1:9	x4ew		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	וְ⁠הַ⁠שְּׁפֵלָֽה	1	The word **Shephelah** is the name of a region with the territory that was assigned to the tribe of Judah. It consists of hills that are lower than the central ridge where Jerusalem is located. Alternate translation: “and the foothills”
1:10	j022		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	יְהוּדָ֗ה	1	See how you translated the term “Judah” in [1:4](../01/04.md) and the expression “the sons of Judah” in [1:8](../01/08.md). Alternate translation: “the combined army”
1:10	ax37		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	וְ⁠שֵׁם־חֶבְר֥וֹן לְ⁠פָנִ֖ים קִרְיַ֣ת אַרְבַּ֑ע	1	Here the author is providing background information to help readers understand what is happening in the story. The author probably wrote this because his readers knew this city as **Hebron**. But at the time when Israel attacked it, it was called **Kiriath Arba**. In your translation, introduce this information in a way that would be natural in your own language and culture. You may also wish to mark it in some way as background information, such as by putting it in parentheses as the ULT does. Alternate translation: “Hebron used to be called Kiriath Arba”
1:10	j023		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	וַ⁠יַּכּ֛וּ אֶת־שֵׁשַׁ֥י וְ⁠אֶת־אֲחִימַ֖ן וְ⁠אֶת־תַּלְמָֽי	1	**Sheshai**, **Ahiman**, and **Talmai** are the names of three clans that lived in and around the city of Hebron.
1:10	edk7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	וַ⁠יַּכּ֛וּ אֶת־שֵׁשַׁ֥י וְ⁠אֶת־אֲחִימַ֖ן וְ⁠אֶת־תַּלְמָֽי	1	The author is using the names of these clans to refer by association to their armies. Alternate translation: “And they defeated the armies of the clans of Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai”
1:11	j024		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יֵּ֣לֶךְ	1	The pronoun **he** refers to “Judah” in the previous verse. That name represented the army of the tribe of Judah and implicitly the accompanying army of the tribe of Simeon. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “And these armies went”
1:11	lh59		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	וְ⁠שֵׁם־דְּבִ֥יר לְ⁠פָנִ֖ים קִרְיַת־סֵֽפֶר	1	See how you translated the similar sentence in the previous verse.
1:11	j025		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	דְּבִ֑יר	1	The word **Debir** is the name of a city in the territory that Joshua assigned to the tribe of Judah.
1:12	j026		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר כָּלֵ֔ב	1	The author assumes that readers will know that a man named **Caleb** was commanding the armies of Judah and Simeon at this point. (The full story is told in Joshua 15:13–19.) You could indicate this explicitly if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “And Caleb, the man who was commanding these armies, said”
1:12	e7kf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אֲשֶׁר־יַכֶּ֥ה אֶת־קִרְיַת־סֵ֖פֶר וּ⁠לְכָדָ֑⁠הּ	1	Caleb is using the name **Kiriath Sepher** to refer by association to the people who live in that city. Alternate translation: “Whoever defeats the people of Kiriath Sepher and captures their city”
1:12	n39v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	אֶת־עַכְסָ֥ה	1	The word **Aksah** is the name of a woman.
1:13	xa4b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	עָתְנִיאֵ֣ל בֶּן־קְנַ֔ז	1	The words **Othniel** and **Kenaz** are the names of men.
1:14	j027		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	וַ⁠יְהִ֣י	1	The author is using this phrase to introduce background information that is not part of the main narrative. In your translation, introduce this information in a way that would be natural in your own language and culture.
1:14	j028		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	בְּ⁠בוֹאָ֗⁠הּ	1	The author assumes that his readers will understand what he means by this phrase. This could mean: (1) that Aksah came to Kiriath Sepher in order to marry Othniel and that she made this **request** when she arrived and saw the land that Caleb had given to him. Alternate translation: “when Aksah arrived at Kiriath Sepher” (2) that the author is using this expression to describe Aksah entering Othniel’s household as his wife. Alternate translation: “once Aksah had married Othniel”
1:14	u3cc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠תְּסִיתֵ֨⁠הוּ֙ לִ⁠שְׁא֤וֹל & הַ⁠שָּׂדֶ֔ה\n	1	The author is leaving implicit who was to make this request. The meaning does not seem to be that Aksah persuaded Othniel that he should **request** this **field** from Caleb, since he is not the one who asks; she is. In this culture, a young man such as Othniel may not have had the standing to make this kind of request from a leader such as Caleb. So the meaning seems to be that Aksah persuaded Othniel that she should ask for the field. In this culture, a daughter may have been able to make such a request of her father. Alternate translation: “that she persuaded him to allow her to request the field”
1:14	j029		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	מֵֽ⁠אֵת־אָבִ֨י⁠הָ֙ הַ⁠שָּׂדֶ֔ה	1	The author has a particular **field** in view. The narrative suggests implicitly that Caleb had given some land to Othniel but that it was arid territory. It suggests further that near this land, there was some ground that was suitable for cultivation because it was watered by springs. You could state this information explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “from her father some land that was nearby the land that he had already given to Othniel and that was watered by springs and so could be cultivated”
1:14	j030		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	מַה־לָּֽ⁠ךְ	1	Caleb is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “What would you like me to do for you?”
1:15	j031		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	הָֽבָ⁠ה	1	This is an imperative, but it communicates a polite request rather than a command. Use a form in your language that communicates a polite request. It may be helpful to add an expression such as “please” to make this clear. Alternate translation: “Please give”
1:15	j032		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	בְרָכָ֗ה	1	In this context, the word **blessing** is an abstract noun. It does not refer to something that someone would say to cause good and beneficial things to happen to a person. Instead, it refers to a good and beneficial thing itself. If your language does not use abstract nouns in this way, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “something that will benefit me”
1:15	j033		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense	וְ⁠נָתַתָּ֥ה לִ֖⁠י	1	Aksah is using a verb form that could either indicate what a person ought to do or what a person is going to do. This could mean: (1) that since the land Caleb gave Aksah and Othniel was dry, he also ought to give them some land with springs of water. Alternate translation: “you should also give me” (2) that Aksah is answering Caleb’s question and this is implicitly her request. Alternate translation: “my request is that you will also give me”

Alternate translation: “some land that has springs of waters … some land in that area where there were upper springs and lower springs”
1:15	j035		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	גֻּלֹּ֣ת מָ֑יִם	1	It might seem that this expression contains extra information that would be unnatural to express in your language. If so, you can shorten it. Alternate translation: “springs” or “land on which there are springs”
1:16	j036		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	 וּ⁠בְנֵ֣י קֵינִי֩	1	The author is introducing some further background information that is not part of the main narrative. In your translation, introduce this information in a way that would be natural in your own language and culture.
1:16	j037		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וּ⁠בְנֵ֣י	1	Since the actual sons of the man whom the author is describing here would have been in the same generation as Moses, the term **sons** could be intended literally. However, since those sons would have had three or even four generations of descendants by this time, the term may also be meant to include them. Alternate translation: “Now the descendants of”
1:16	fqe9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	קֵינִי֩	1	The word **Kenite** is the name of a people group. Since the author has a specific **Kenite** in mind, your language might use a demonstrative pronoun here. Alternate translation: “that Kenite” or “that man from the Kenite people group”
1:16	x6ei		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship	חֹתֵ֨ן מֹשֶׁ֜ה	1	Your language may have its own term or expression for this relationship. Alternate translation: “the father of Moses’ wife”
1:16	a29w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	מֵ⁠עִ֤יר הַ⁠תְּמָרִים֙	1	The author is using the expression **the City of Palms** to refer to settlements in the area of the city of Jericho, which the Israelites had destroyed several years before this. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use the name “Jericho” here. Alternate translation: “from Jericho” or “from Jericho, the city of palm trees”
1:16	j038		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אֶת־בְּנֵ֣י יְהוּדָ֔ה	1	Here, the term **sons** means “descendants.” The author is identifying the Judeans as descendants of their ancestor Judah. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. See how you translated the similar expression “the sons of Israel” in [1:1](../01/01.md). Alternate translation: “the people of Judah”
1:16	u7t8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	עֲרָ֑ד	1	The word **Arad** is the name of a city.
1:16	j039		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יֵּ֖לֶךְ וַ⁠יֵּ֥שֶׁב	1	The pronoun **he** seems to refer to **the Kenite**, that is, the man who was the father-in-law of Moses. The author is using him to represent his descendants. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “And they went and they dwelled”
1:16	j040		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אֶת־הָ⁠עָֽם	1	The author implicitly means **the people** from the tribe of Judah who also settled in this region.

1:17	iy2d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	חָרְמָֽה	1	The word **Hormah** is the name of a city. The Israelites changed the name of Zephath to Hormah, which means “destruction,” after they destroyed it completely. See the General Notes to this chapter for a further discussion.
1:18	j042		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	יְהוּדָה֙	1	The author is using the name of one of the tribes whose soldiers were in this army to mean the entire army. Alternate translation: “the combined army of Judah and Simeon”

1:19	j044		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	וַ⁠יְהִ֤י	1	The author is using this expression to introduce information about what was happening behind the scenes in this story and also to introduce an overall theme for [1:19–36](../01/19.md). In a way that was not visible, Yahweh was helping the Israelites to defeat the Canaanites. Nevertheless, the Israelite tribes did not drive the Canaanite nations completely out of their assigned territories. In your translation, introduce this information in a way that would be natural in your own language and culture.
1:19	vtq2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	יְהוָה֙ אֶתּ־יְהוּדָ֔ה	1	The author is speaking as if Yahweh had literally been present **with** the army of Judah as it fought to conquer its assigned territory. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Yahweh helped Judah”
1:19	j045		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אֶתּ־יְהוּדָ֔ה וַ⁠יֹּ֖רֶשׁ	1	The author is using the name **Judah** by association to mean the army that belonged to the tribe of Judah. See how you translated the same expression in [1:2](../01/02.md). Alternate translation: “the army of the tribe of Judah and it possessed”
1:19	j046		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	רֶ֥כֶב בַּרְזֶ֖ל	1	The metal **iron** was barely used during this time period, so this is not a reference to chariots entirely made of **iron**. Those would have been too heavy for any practical use in warfare anyway. It is probably a reference by association to chariots whose wheels or floor were strengthened with iron or that had iron studs or points to make them more destructive when used in ramming. Alternate translation: “chariots fitted out with iron”
1:20	ys79		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יִּתְּנ֤וּ	1	The pronoun **they** refers to the people of the tribe of Judah and most likely to their leaders. While Moses had originally promised **Hebron** to **Caleb** in [Numbers 14:24](../num/14/24.md) and Joshua had confirmed this in [Joshua 14:6–15](../jos/14/06.md), the leaders of Judah confirmed this again when they conquered their assigned territory. Alternate translation: “But the leaders of the tribe of Judah gave”
1:20	eml1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אֶת־שְׁלֹשָׁ֖ה בְּנֵ֥י הָ⁠עֲנָֽק	1	The author is speaking of the three clans that lived in and around the city of Hebron as if they were the literal **sons** of their ancestor Anak. (These clans are named in [1:10](../01/10.md).) If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the three clans descended from Anak”
1:20	tyj7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	הָ⁠עֲנָֽק	1	The word **Anak** is the name of a man. The author seems to be using the definite article **the** to indicate that he has a specific **Anak** in mind, the man who was the ancestor of these clans. Your language might naturally use a demonstrative pronoun for this purpose. Alternate translation: “the well-known Anak”

1:21	j048		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	בְּנֵ֣י בִנְיָמִ֑ן & אֶת־בְּנֵ֤י בִנְיָמִן֙	1	Here, **sons** means “descendants.” The author is describing the people of the tribe of Benjamin as descendants of their ancestor Benjamin. The reference in the first instance is specifically to the army of this tribe; it seems to be generally to the people of the tribe in the second instance. Alternate translation: “the army of the tribe of Benjamin … with the people of the tribe of Benjamin”
1:21	l6aj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	עַ֖ד הַ⁠יּ֥וֹם הַ⁠זֶּֽה	1	The author is using the term **day** to refer to a specific time, the time when he was writing this book.

1:22	da33		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	בֵית־יוֹסֵ֛ף	1	Here the term **house** means all the people descended from a particular person. It envisions them as if they were one household living together. So **the house of Joseph** means all the people descended from the patriarch Joseph. By this time, those descendants had become the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh. Alternate translation: “the descendants of Joseph” or “the armies of the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh”
1:22	j049		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וַֽ⁠יהוָ֖ה עִמָּֽ⁠ם	1	See how you translated the same expression in [1:19](../01/19.md). Alternate translation: “and Yahweh helped them”

1:23	vx3f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	וְ⁠שֵׁם־הָ⁠עִ֥יר לְ⁠פָנִ֖ים לֽוּז	1	Here the author is providing background information to help readers understand what is happening in the story. The author probably wrote this because his readers knew this city as **Bethel**. But at the time when Israel attacked it, it was called **Luz**. In your translation, introduce this information in a way that would be natural in your own language and culture. You may also wish to mark it in some way as background information, such as by putting it in parentheses as the ULT does. Alternate translation: “Bethel used to be called Luz”
1:23	j051		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	לֽוּז	1	The word **Luz** is the name of a city.

1:25	dj1j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וַ⁠יַּכּ֥וּ אֶת־הָ⁠עִ֖יר לְ⁠פִי־חָ֑רֶב	1	The author is saying **the city** by association to mean the people who lived in the city. Alternate translation: “and they struck the people of the city with the mouth of the sword”

1:29	ek8n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וְ⁠אֶפְרַ֨יִם֙	1	As the General Notes to this chapter discuss,  the author is using the name of the tribe of **Ephraim** by association to mean the people and especially the army of that tribe. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly, here and in the similar instances in the rest of the chapter. Alternate translation: “And the people of Ephraim” or “And the army of Ephraim”

1:34	j058		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אֶת־בְּנֵי־דָ֖ן	1	See how you translated the expression “the sons of Judah” in [1:16](../01/16.md). Alternate translation: “the people of Dan”
1:34	j059		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	לֹ֥א נְתָנ֖⁠וֹ	1	The pronoun **he** refers to **the Amorite**, and the pronoun **him** refers to **the sons of Dan** (as if they were a single individual, their ancestor Dan).

Alternate translation: “And the Amorites resolved to dwell at Mount Heres, in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim, and so the Israelites were not able to dispossess them”
1:35	qwt2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	בְּ⁠הַר־חֶ֔רֶס	1	**Mount Heres** is the name of a large hill on which the city of Aijalon was built.

The word means “scorpions” in Hebrew, and here it is the name of a place. The word translated as **ascent** may be part of this name.

2:intro	mf6a				0	# Judges 2 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n- Verses 1–5: The angel of Yahweh appears to the Israelites at Bokim\n- Verses 6–10: Review: the Israelites worshiped and obeyed Yahweh during the lifetimes of Joshua and the elders\n- Verses 11–23: The Israelites disobeyed Yahweh and worshiped other gods afterwards, so Yahweh let other nations conquer them\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Joshua reappears in the story after it tells how he died\n\nIn Judges 2:6–9, the author repeats Joshua 24:28-31 to remind readers how the people of Israel served Yahweh faithfully when they first arrived in the land of Canaan. This is background information. After these verses, the main story of the book of Judges begins. It is about how the Israelites then worshiped other gods, but Yahweh repeatedly brought them back to himself and delivered them from their enemies when they repented. It may seem strange for the book to speak of Joshua doing something, since it begins “after the death of Joshua.” So you can translate this in a way that shows that the author is providing background information by describing something that happened in the past. See the note at 2:6 for a specific suggestion.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Metaphor\n\nIn this chapter, the author uses the word “fathers” several times to mean “ancestors.” He is not speaking of the immediate male parents of the Israelites, but of the generations who lived before them. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n### Symbolic action\n\nIn this chapter, the author speaks of the Israelites bowing down to idols that represented foreign gods. This was a symbolic action that constituted a public act of worship, so it represented a definitive expression of allegiance to those gods. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action. When the book says that the Israelites bowed down to foreign gods, you could say, for example, that they “worshiped them by bowing down to them.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-symaction]])
2:1	tt9y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	מַלְאַךְ־יְהוָ֛ה	1	The phrase **the angel of Yahweh** could mean: (1) “an angel who represented Yahweh” or “a messenger who served Yahweh.” (2) Yahweh himself, who looked like an angel as he talked to the Israelites. Either one of these meanings would explain the angel’s use of “I” as if Yahweh himself was talking. In your translation, use the words you have already been using for “angel” and “Yahweh” in the phrase **the angel of Yahweh**. This will allow for different interpretations of that phrase. Alternate translation: “And an angel from Yahweh” or “And an angel sent by Yahweh” or “And Yahweh, who looked like an angel,”
2:1	x66i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	הַ⁠בֹּכִ֑ים	1	The word **Bokim** is the name of a place. The Israelites actually give the place this name at the end of this episode, in [2:5](../02/05.md), but the author is using it here because his readers knew the place by that name. See the UST for one way to handle this issue.
2:1	te37		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יֹּאמֶר֩	1	The author is leaving some information implicit that he assumes readers will understand. You could state this information explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “and said to the Israelites, who had gathered there,”
2:1	im2i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense	אַעֲלֶ֨ה אֶתְ⁠כֶ֜ם	1	The angel, speaking on behalf of Yahweh, is using the present tense to describe a past event. He may be doing that because delivering the Israelites from slavery in Egypt and settling them in the land of Canaan together constitute a single work on their behalf that was still ongoing at this point. However, if it would not be natural for a speaker of your language to use the present tense in such a context, you could use the past tense in your translation. Alternate translation: “I brought you up from Egypt”
2:1	ha9u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	לַ⁠אֲבֹ֣תֵי⁠כֶ֔ם	1	As the General Notes to this chapter discuss, the angel is using the term **fathers** to mean “ancestors.” If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “to your ancestors”
2:1	j062		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	וָ⁠אֹמַ֕ר לֹֽא־אָפֵ֧ר בְּרִיתִ֛⁠י אִתְּ⁠כֶ֖ם לְ⁠עוֹלָֽם	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “And I have said that I would not break my covenant with you, to eternity”
2:2	j063		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	וְ⁠אַתֶּ֗ם לֹֽא־תִכְרְת֤וּ בְרִית֙ לְ⁠יֽוֹשְׁבֵי֙ הָ⁠אָ֣רֶץ הַ⁠זֹּ֔את מִזְבְּחוֹתֵי⁠הֶ֖ם תִּתֹּצ֑וּ⁠ן	1	If you decided in the previous verse to translate this quotation in such a way that there would not be a quotation within a quotation, you can continue doing that here. Alternate translation: “But I also said that you were not to cut a covenant with the dwellers of this land. You were to demolish their altars”
2:2	gob6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠לֹֽא־שְׁמַעְתֶּ֥ם בְּ⁠קֹלִ֖⁠י	1	As the General Introduction to Judges discusses, here the word **heard** has the specific sense of “obeyed.” Alternate translation: “But you have not obeyed my voice”
2:2	syq4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וְ⁠לֹֽא־שְׁמַעְתֶּ֥ם בְּ⁠קֹלִ֖⁠י	1	The angel, speaking on behalf of Yahweh, is using the word **voice** by association to mean what he said by using his voice. Alternate translation: “But you have disobeyed what I commanded”
2:2	w8ys		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	מַה־זֹּ֥את עֲשִׂיתֶֽם	1	The angel is using the question form for emphasis. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “You should not have done this!”
2:3	kdq3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	וְ⁠גַ֣ם אָמַ֔רְתִּי לֹֽא־אֲגָרֵ֥שׁ אוֹתָ֖⁠ם מִ⁠פְּנֵי⁠כֶ֑ם וְ⁠הָי֤וּ לָ⁠כֶם֙ לְ⁠צִדִּ֔ים וֵ⁠אלֹ֣הֵי⁠הֶ֔ם יִהְי֥וּ לָ⁠כֶ֖ם לְ⁠מוֹקֵֽשׁ	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. (See the next note for another way to do this.) Alternate translation: “And I have also said that I would not expel them from before you, but they would be to you like thorns in your sides, and their gods would be a snare to you”
2:3	j064		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠גַ֣ם אָמַ֔רְתִּי	1	The angel, speaking on behalf of Yahweh, assumes that the Israelites will know when he **also said** this. In [Numbers 33:55](../num/33/55.md), Yahweh told the Israelites that if they did not drive out the Canaanites, the ones who remained would be thorns in their sides. In [Joshua 23:12–13](../jos/23/12.md), Joshua warned the Israelites that if they made treaties with the Canaanite nations and intermarried with them, then Yahweh would no longer dispossess those nations and they would be thorns and a snare to the Israelites. So the angel seems to be indicating that Joshua was speaking on behalf of Yahweh when Joshua said that Yahweh would no longer drive out the Canaanites. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “And as I said through Joshua, I will not expel them from the face of you, but they will be to you in the sides, and their gods will be to you for a snare”
2:3	j065		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	וְ⁠הָי֤וּ לָ⁠כֶם֙ לְ⁠צִדִּ֔ים	1	The angel is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete.

If you need to say who did the action, the context suggests that it was Yahweh. Alternate translation: “And Yahweh also gathered all of that generation to its fathers”
2:10	r6cs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	 וְ⁠גַם֙ & נֶאֶסְפ֖וּ אֶל־אֲבוֹתָ֑י⁠ו	1	The author is using the term **fathers** to mean “ancestors.” If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “And … also joined its ancestors in death”

You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “who did not know Yahweh and also did not know the deed that he had done for Israel”
2:10	j074		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	הַֽ⁠מַּעֲשֶׂ֔ה	1	Since the author is referring to all of the things that **Yahweh … had done for Israel**, it might be more natural in your language to use the plural form of **deed** as in [2:7](../02/07.md). Alternate translation: “the deeds”
2:11	j075		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	אֶת־הָ⁠רַ֖ע	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **evil**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “what was evil” or “things that were evil”
2:11	yhh4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בְּ⁠עֵינֵ֣י יְהוָ֑ה	1	The author is using the term **eyes** by association to mean sight.

2:11	gx61		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	אֶת־הַ⁠בְּעָלִֽים	1	The word **Baals** is the plural of the name Baal.

Your language and culture may also associate anger with a particular part of the body. If so, you could use an expression involving that part of the body in your translation. You could also use plain language. Alternate translation: “in his anger”

(Here, **hand** represents possession, by association with the way that people may hold something that they own in their hands. It was as if the hostile nations owned the Israelites as their slaves.) He means that the Israelites became subject to those nations. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “And he made them subjects of the enemies that surrounded them”

3:intro	k35h				0	# Judges 3 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n- Verses 1–8: The Israelites lived with other nations and worshiped their gods\n- Verses 9–11: God sent Othniel to rescue Israel from Aram\n- Verses 12–30: God sent Ehud to rescue Israel from Moab\n- Verse 31: God sent Shamgar to rescue Israel from the Philistines\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Yahweh allowed other nations to conquer Israel\n\nAs [3:5–8](../03/05.md) explains, Israel worshiped idols and false gods. Because of this, Yahweh allowed the nations of Aram and Moab to rule over them. In the period of Judges, when Israel sinned, they were often placed under the rule of a foreign power. However, when the people repented, Yahweh sent judges to deliver them. This chapter describes how Yahweh sent Othniel, Ehud, and Shamgar to rescue Israel from foreign control. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/falsegod]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])\n\n### The carved images at Gilgal\n\nBiblical scholars are not entirely sure what the “carved images” mentioned in [3:19](../03/19.md) were. They could have been some kind of boundary marker. Some interpreters associate them with the twelve large stones that Joshua set up at Gilgal in Joshua [4:20](../jos/04/20.md). They seem to have been a recognizable landmark of some kind. Once Ehud and the porters reached them, Ehud knew that the porters were back in Israelite territory and could find their way safely back home from there without him. In your translation, you might refer to these as “carved stones” or, as in the UST, “boundary stones.”\n\n### Irony and divine judgment\n\nIn [3:22](../03/22.md), the author uses an expression that could mean that when Ehud stabbed King Eglon in the stomach, Eglon’s bowels discharged from the force and shock of the sword thrust. In [3:24](../03/24.md), Eglon’s servants wait a long time before checking on him, because they think Eglon is relieving himself. This gives Ehud the opportunity to escape. This would be a further instance of irony in the book of Judges, in which the punishment in some way fits the crime.

He means the members of those people groups in general. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using a plural form. Alternate translation: “the Canaanites and Sidonians and Hivites”
3:3	upq5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	מֵ⁠הַר֙ בַּ֣עַל חֶרְמ֔וֹן	1	**Mount Baal Hermon** seems to be another name for the mountain that was also known as Mount Hermon. This is the tallest mountain in Israel. It is at the southern tip of the Lebanon mountain range.

3:12	l914		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בְּ⁠עֵינֵ֣י יְהוָ֑ה	1	See how you translated the same expression in [2:11](../02/11.md) and [3:7](../03/07.md). Alternate translation: “what was evil in Yahweh’s judgment”

Alternate translation: “So because the Israelites did evil in his eyes, Yahweh strengthened Eglon, the king of Moab, against them”
3:12	s1wn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	וַ⁠יְחַזֵּ֨ק יְהוָ֜ה אֶת־עֶגְל֤וֹן מֶֽלֶךְ־מוֹאָב֙ עַל־יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל	1	The author is speaking of **Eglon** to mean that king and his army. Alternate translation: “So Yahweh enabled Eglon to build a strong army to attack Israel”
3:12	z23q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	אֶת־עֶגְל֤וֹן	1	The word **Eglon** is the name of a man.

Alternate translation: “And he made a military alliance with the Ammonites and Amalekites” or “And he joined forces with the Ammonite and Amalekite armies”
3:13	rp3h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	אֶת־עִ֥יר הַ⁠תְּמָרִֽים	1	See how you translated this name in [1:16](../01/16.md). Alternate translation: “Jericho”

3:15	jja5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	אֶת־אֵה֤וּד בֶּן־גֵּרָא֙	1	The words **Ehud** and **Gera** are the names of men.
3:15	w4sk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אִ֥ישׁ אִטֵּ֖ר יַד־יְמִינ֑⁠וֹ	1	The author is speaking as if the Ehud literally had some limitation in the use of his **right hand**. In the context of this culture, the phrase probably indicates that he could use his left hand better than he could use his right hand but that he actually had no restriction in the use of either hand. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “a left-handed man”
3:15	j102		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	וַ⁠יִּשְׁלְח֨וּ בְנֵי־יִשְׂרָאֵ֤ל בְּ⁠יָד⁠וֹ֙ מִנְחָ֔ה	1	The author is using the **hand** of Ehud to represent Ehud himself in the act of bringing **tribute** to Israel. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “And the sons of Israel sent tribute with Ehud”
3:16	j103		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	וְ⁠לָ֛⁠הּ שְׁנֵ֥י פֵי֖וֹת	1	The author is speaking of Ehud’s **sword** as if it had been a living thing that had a **mouth** and could eat. This is probably a reference to the way a sword cuts into a person as if it were an animal biting him. Since the author speaks of the sword having **two** mouths, in this context the word **mouths** probably refers to the edges of the sword. Alternate translation: “it was double-edged”
3:16	fm5l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-bdistance	גֹּ֣מֶד אָרְכָּ֑⁠הּ	1	The word translated as **cubit** describes the distance from a typical person’s elbow to the knuckles of his clenched fist. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express this distance in terms of modern measurements. Alternate translation: “it was about half a meter long” or “it was about eighteen inches long”
3:17	k42d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	וְ⁠עֶגְל֕וֹן\n	1	The author is introducing background information that will help readers understand what happens next in the story. In your translation, introduce this information in a way that would be natural in your own language and culture.
3:18	j104		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יְשַׁלַּח֙ אֶת־הָ⁠עָ֔ם	1	The pronoun **he** refers to Ehud, not Eglon, in both instances in this verse. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “that Ehud sent away the people”
3:18	jss1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	וַֽ⁠יְהִי֙	1	The author is using this phrase to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event.
3:19	j105		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וְ⁠ה֣וּא שָׁ֗ב	1	For emphasis, the author is stating the pronoun **he**, whose meaning is already present in the verb translated as **turned**. If your language can state implied pronouns explicitly for emphasis, you may want to use that construction here in your translation. Other languages may have other ways of bringing out this emphasis. The ULT does so by using the intensive pronoun **himself**. Alternate translation: “But as for him, he turned back”
3:19	q56y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	הַ⁠פְּסִילִים֙	1	See the General Notes to this chapter for a discussion of what these **carved images** might have been and for some suggestions of how to describe them in your translation.
3:19	j106		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יֹּ֕אמֶר	1	The author is leaving some information implicit that he assumes readers will understand. You could state this information explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “and he returned to King Eglon. Ehud said to him”
3:19	j107		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	דְּבַר־סֵ֥תֶר לִ֛⁠י אֵלֶ֖י⁠ךָ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **secrecy**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation, as in the UST: “I have something secret to tell you”
3:19	j108		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר הָ֔ס	1	The pronoun **he** refers to Eglon. This could mean: (1) that he wanted silence in his court, and he specifically wanted everyone except him and Ehud to leave the room so that the court would be silent. Alternate translation: “And King Eglon told his servants, ‘Leave us here alone!’” (2) that he was telling Ehud not to say anything further, since his message was secret, until everyone else left. Alternate translation: “And King Eglon told Ehud, ‘Keep quiet for a moment.’”
3:20	j109		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠אֵה֣וּד ׀ בָּ֣א אֵלָ֗י⁠ו  וְ⁠הֽוּא־יֹ֠שֵׁב בַּ⁠עֲלִיַּ֨ת הַ⁠מְּקֵרָ֤ה אֲשֶׁר־ל⁠וֹ֙	1	The author is leaving some information implicit that he assumes readers will understand. You could state this information explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. The word **came** could indicate: (1) that Ehud walked up close to Eglon and stood in front of him. Alternate translation: “Then Ehud approached him. Now he was sitting in his upper room of coolness” (2) that Ehud came into the **upper room** where Eglon was sitting. If so, this could mean that Ehud actually sent word to Eglon through his servants that he had a message for him, and Eglon summoned Ehud to come into his room where the two of them could speak privately once all the servants had left. Alternate translation: “Then Ehud entered the upper room of coolness in which the king was sitting”
3:20	j110		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	וְ⁠הֽוּא־יֹ֠שֵׁב	1	The author is introducing background information that will help readers understand what happens next in the story. In your translation, introduce this information in a way that would be natural in your own language and culture.
3:20	f67g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	בַּ⁠עֲלִיַּ֨ת הַ⁠מְּקֵרָ֤ה אֲשֶׁר־ל⁠וֹ֙	1	The phrase **upper room of coolness** describes a room in a palace that was designed to give rulers a place to go to escape the heat of summer, which was intense in this climate. Sometimes these were interior rooms on whose walls the sun did not shine, and sometimes they were rooms in a garden within the palace complex. In this case, it seems to have been a room on the roof that was exposed to currents of air, since the author describes it with the term **upper room**. Your language and culture may have an expression to describe such a room. Alternate translation: “in his summer parlor” or “in his cool roof chamber”
3:20	p7ft		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	וַ⁠יָּ֖קָם	1	King Eglon **arose** as a symbolic action to show respect for **God** and the message he thought God was sending to him through Ehud. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action. Alternate translation: “And he stood up respectfully”
3:21	j111		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יִּתְקָעֶ֖⁠הָ בְּ⁠בִטְנֽ⁠וֹ	1	The pronoun **he** refers to Ehud, and the pronoun **his** refers to Eglon. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “and Ehud thrust the sword into Eglon’s belly”
3:22	j112		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	וַ⁠יִּסְגֹּ֤ר הַ⁠חֵ֨לֶב֙ בְּעַ֣ד הַ⁠לַּ֔הַב כִּ֣י לֹ֥א שָׁלַ֛ף הַ⁠חֶ֖רֶב מִ⁠בִּטְנ֑⁠וֹ	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “and since Ehud did not pull the sword from Eglon’s belly, the fat enclosed around the handle”
3:22	k49p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	וַ⁠יֵּצֵ֖א הַֽ⁠פַּרְשְׁדֹֽנָ⁠ה	1	The word translated as **excrement** occurs only here in the Old Testament, so its meaning is not entirely certain. This could mean: (1) that Eglon’s bowels discharged from the force and shock of the sword thrust. (See the General Notes to this chapter for a further discussion of this possibility.) Your language may have a way of referring to this discreetly. Alternate translation: “and he soiled himself” (2) that the point of the sword came out the other side of Eglon’s body. Alternate translation: “and the point came out the other side” (3) that Ehud went out to a chamber within this room before leaving the room itself. Alternate translation: “and he went out to the vestibule”
3:23	djg4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	הַֽ⁠מִּסְדְּר֑וֹנָ⁠ה	1	The word translated as **porch** occurs only here in the Old Testament, so its meaning is not entirely certain. Most interpreters understand it to mean a covered entrance area just outside the room Ehud had been in. Your language and culture may have an expression to describe such an area. Alternate translation: “to the vestibule”
3:24	j113		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וְ⁠ה֤וּא יָצָא֙ וַ⁠עֲבָדָ֣י⁠ו בָּ֔אוּ	1	The pronoun **he** refers to Ehud, and the pronoun **his** refers to Eglon. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “And Ehud went out, and Eglon’s servants came”
3:24	j114		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וַ⁠יִּרְא֕וּ וְ⁠הִנֵּ֛ה דַּלְת֥וֹת הָ⁠עֲלִיָּ֖ה נְעֻל֑וֹת	1	The author is using the term **behold** to indicate that what the servants found when they **looked** was unexpected. Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation. You could also state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and they discovered that the doors of the upper room were bolted”
3:24	j115		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	דַּלְת֥וֹת הָ⁠עֲלִיָּ֖ה נְעֻל֑וֹת	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “someone had bolted the doors of the upper room”
3:24	z2qt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	מֵסִ֥יךְ ה֛וּא אֶת־רַגְלָ֖י⁠ו	1	The servants are using the phrase **covering his feet** as a polite way of referring to an activity that is done in private. Your language may have a similar expression that you can use in your translation. Alternate translation: “he is relieving himself”
3:24	j116		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	בַּ⁠חֲדַ֥ר הַ⁠מְּקֵרָֽה	1	See how you translated the expression “the upper room of coolness” in [3:20](../03/20.md). The word **chamber** here is different from the word “upper chamber” there, but the author is referring to the same room, so you can use the same expression here as you did there.
3:25	d7zv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	עַד־בּ֔וֹשׁ	1	The author implicitly means that the servants **felt ashamed** because they were supposed to stay in the king’s presence and remain available to fulfill any request of his. (The author describes these servants in [3:19](../03/19.md) as those who were usually “standing around” him.) You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “until they felt they were neglecting their duty”
3:25	e1jf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	אֶת־הַ⁠מַּפְתֵּ֨חַ֙	1	The word translated as **opener** refers to a device that people in this culture used to release the inside bolt of a door from the outside. It was a bar of wood, hooked on one end, that people would pass through a hole in a door in order to catch and lift the bolt inside. If the word **opener** would be unclear and it would be difficult or complicated to explain what it was, you could use a general expression in your translation. Alternate translation, as in the UST: “the key”
3:25	j117		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ⁠הִנֵּה֙ אֲדֹ֣נֵי⁠הֶ֔ם נֹפֵ֥ל אַ֖רְצָ⁠ה מֵֽת	1	While Eglon did fall **to the ground** when Ehud stabbed him, since he had stood up to receive the message from God, the phrase **fallen dead** actually means that he became dead, as the author’s use of the same phrase in 4:22 indicates. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this without using the verb “fall.” Alternate translation: “and they found their lord on the floor, dead”
3:26	r2ig		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	וְ⁠אֵה֥וּד נִמְלַ֖ט עַ֣ד הִֽתְמַהְמְהָ֑⁠ם	1	Since Ehud escaping is new information, it may be more natural in your language to present it after the information that readers already have, about Eglon’s servants **delaying**. Alternate translation: “Now while they were delaying, Ehud escaped”
3:26	j118		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	אֶת־הַ⁠פְּסִילִ֔ים	1	See how you translated the same expression in [3:19](../03/19.md).
3:26	x36q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate	הַ⁠שְּׂעִירָֽתָ⁠ה	1	The word **Seirah** is the name of a city.
3:27	j119		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יִּתְקַ֥ע בַּ⁠שּׁוֹפָ֖ר	1	The author means implicitly that Ehud **blew on the shofar** to summon the Israelites to battle. The UST models one way to indicate this explicitly.
3:27	j120		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	בַּ⁠שּׁוֹפָ֖ר	1	A **shofar** is the horn of a ram (a male sheep) that has been made into a musical instrument. If your readers would not be familiar with this, in your translation you could use the name of a similar object that your readers would recognize, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “a loud horn”
3:28	i3vy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	וַ⁠יֹּ֤אמֶר אֲלֵ⁠הֶם֙ רִדְפ֣וּ אַחֲרַ֔⁠י כִּֽי־נָתַ֨ן יְהוָ֧ה אֶת־אֹיְבֵי⁠כֶ֛ם אֶת־מוֹאָ֖ב בְּ⁠יֶדְ⁠כֶ֑ם	1	The author is providing background information that will help readers understand what is happening in the story. In the previous verse, the author described how “the sons of Israel went down with” Ehud “from the hill country.” This sentence explains that they had the courage to do that because Ehud had announced that Yahweh had promised them victory. In your translation, introduce this information in a way that would be natural in your own language and culture.
3:28	k9q1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge		1	You could also create a verse bridge and combine verses 27 and 28 so that the background information comes within the flow of the narrative. It might say something like this: “Now it happened at his coming that he blew on the shofar in the hill country of Ephraim. And he said to them, ‘Follow after me, for Yahweh has given your enemies, Moab, into your hand.’  Then the sons of Israel went down with him from the hill country, and he {was} to the face of them. They captured the fords of the Jordan opposite Moab, and they did not allow anyone to cross over.”
3:28	j121		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	אֶת־אֹיְבֵי⁠כֶ֛ם & בְּ⁠יֶדְ⁠כֶ֑ם	1	The word **your** is plural in these instances because Ehud is addressing the Israelites, so use the plural form in your translation if your language marks that distinction.

4:intro	pjw5				0	# Judges 4 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nTo this point, after giving an introduction to the stories of the judges (1:1–3:6), the author has briefly described the work of three judges: Othniel (3:7–11), Ehud (3:12–30), and Shamgar (3:31). In this chapter and the next chapter, he describes at more length the work of another judge, Deborah, and the man she called and helped to lead an Israelite army, Barak.\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### How had Yahweh already begun to fight Sisera before the Israelites attacked?\n\nIn [4:14](../04/14.md), Deborah tells Barak that it is time to attack Sisera’s forces because Yahweh has already begun to fight against them. It is not clear from this chapter entirely what this means. But readers learn in the next chapter that there was a great storm on the day of this battle. Deborah says in her song (in [5:4](../05/04.md)) that when Yahweh marched out, “dark clouds dripped down water” and “the earth shook” (perhaps a reference to thunder). She speaks in [5:21](../05/21.md) of the Kishon River flooding. The historian Josephus writes of this battle that “as soon as the armies were engaged, there arose a prodigious tempest of hail and rain, which drove in the faces of the Canaanites, and occasioned a total rout of them.” With the rain, hail, and flooding, Sisera’s forces were not able to make use of their chariots. Barak was able to lead his troops down from the relative safety of Mount Tabor onto the plain and destroy Sisera’s army and its chariots.\n\n### “Yahweh will sell Sisera into the hand of a woman”\n\nWhen Deborah tells Barak to raise an army to oppose Sisera, he replies, “If you will go with me, then I will go, but if you will not go with me, I will not go” ([4:8](../04/08.md)). Deborah agrees to go with him, but she also tells him that the credit and honor for killing Sisera will not go to him but to a woman. Interpreters have many different ideas about what this means. One possibility is that Barak was insisting on having visible, tangible assurance of God’s presence and help in the person of Deborah, who was a prophetess. Deborah graciously agreed to accompany Barak and provide this assurance, but at the same time she indicated to him that God’s power was so great that Barak should not have put this condition on his obedience. God would use a woman, who in this culture would not have been a warrior, to kill Sisera. At this time, great honor came from killing an enemy commander, and this honor would not go to Barak but to this woman and ultimately to God, who would arrange the circumstances for it. However, it is not necessary to resolve the meaning of this exchange in order to translate this passage. You can report the conversation between Deborah and Barak naturally in your translation without adding any interpretation.

4:18	k8b1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	סוּרָ֧⁠ה	1	Jael means implicitly that Sisera does not need to continue running away from the Israelites. He can **Turn aside** from the road he is on and come into her tent. Alternate translation: “Come in here”
4:18	u5k9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	בַּ⁠שְּׂמִיכָֽה	1	The word translated as **blanket** occurs only here in the Old Testament, so its meaning is not entirely certain. The word could refer to: (1) something that people use to keep warm in bed. Alternate translation: “with a coverlet” (2) something that people put on the floor for warmth and decorative purposes. Alternate translation: “with a carpet” (3) an outer garment. Alternate translation: “with a cloak”

The UST models one way to do this.
4:19	j151		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	אֶת־נֹ֧אוד הֶ⁠חָלָ֛ב	1	The word translated as **skin** refers to a bag made out of animal skin that was used for holding liquids. If your readers would not be familiar with this object, in your translation you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “a leather bag of milk”

Alternate translation: “and asks you whether there is anyone here, then tell him that there is not”
4:20	j153		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	וּ⁠שְׁאֵלֵ֗⁠ךְ וְ⁠אָמַ֛ר	1	This phrase expresses a single idea by using two words connected with **and**. The word **asks** indicates that what this person **says** will be a question. If it would be clearer in your language, you can express the same meaning with only one of these words. Alternate translation: “asks you” or “says to you”
4:21	ctd6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	אֶת־יְתַ֨ד הָ⁠אֹ֜הֶל & אֶת־הַ⁠מַּקֶּ֣בֶת	1	The phrase **a peg of the tent** describes a pointed piece of wood or metal that people drive into the ground to hold down a corner of a tent. A **hammer** in this context refers to a heavy tool made of wood that people use to hit objects with force, for example, in order to drive a tent peg into the ground. If your readers would not be familiar with these objects, in your translation you could use the name of similar things that your readers would recognize, or you could use general expressions. Alternate translation: “a spike … a mallet” or “a sharp piece of wood … a heavy tool”
4:21	j154		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	וְ⁠הֽוּא־נִרְדָּ֥ם וַ⁠יָּ֖עַף	1	Here the author is providing background information to help readers understand what is happening in the story.

It may be helpful to put this information at the beginning of the verse, as the UST does.
4:21	j155		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	וְ⁠הֽוּא־נִרְדָּ֥ם וַ⁠יָּ֖עַף	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes.

4:23	j158		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בַּ⁠יּ֣וֹם הַ⁠ה֔וּא	1	While the battle against Sisera did take place on a specific day, the author may be using the term **day** to refer generally to the whole time when the Israelites gathered an army to oppose the rule of Jabin and fought against his forces. Alternate translation: “at that time”

Your language may have its own way of presenting such a summary at the end of a story.
4:23	xzh1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	וַ⁠יַּכְנַ֤ע אֱלֹהִים֙ & אֵ֖ת יָבִ֣ין מֶֽלֶךְ־כְּנָ֑עַן לִ⁠פְנֵ֖י בְּנֵ֥י יִשְׂרָאֵֽל	1	In one sense, this battle was a direct contest between the power of **God** and the power of **Jabin.** (The next chapter describes how God sent a hailstorm to thwart Sisera’s chariots.) In another sense, the author is speaking of **God** to represent all of the forces on the side of **Israel**, including God, and he is using **Jabin** to represent that king and his army. The UST models one way to represent this second sense.
4:24	j159		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠תֵּ֜לֶךְ יַ֤ד בְּנֵֽי־יִשְׂרָאֵל֙ הָל֣וֹךְ וְ⁠קָשָׁ֔ה	1	This combination of **going** and **went** is a common expression that the author is using to mean that a process continued to a certain point.

4:24	zcb9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	הִכְרִ֔יתוּ אֵ֖ת יָבִ֥ין	1	The author is using the name **Jabin** by association to mean the army of this king, which the Israelites **destroyed**. (The book does not say specifically that the Israelites killed Jabin himself.) Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation. Alternate translation: “they broke the power of Jabin”
5:intro	jgd9				0	# Judges 5 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThe author continues to tell the story of Deborah and Barak in this chapter.\n\nSome translations prefer to set apart quotations, prayers, and songs with special formatting. The ULT and many other English translations set the lines of chapter 5, which is a song, farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text.\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### How were the Israelites able to fight against Sisera if they had no weapons?\n\nIn [5:8](../05/08.md), this song describes how Jabin’s occupying soldiers took away the weapons that the Israelites had. So how were the Israelites able to fight a battle against Sisera’s forces? As a note to [4:2](../04/02.md) explains, the name Harosheth Haggoyim may describe a place where Jabin forced captive peoples to cut wood for him. It has been suggested that the conscripted Israelites who joined Barak’s army took their axes and hatchets with them and used them as weapons. This would be another example of irony in the book of Judges: Jabin supplied the people he had conquered with the weapons that they needed to defeat him and regain their freedom.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Hebrew poetry\n\nExcept for a brief introduction and conclusion, this chapter is poetry that consists of pairs of phrases that repeat the same meaning. The second phrase advances the idea of the first by affirming, contrasting, or supplementing it in different words. (Sometimes there is a third line with similar meaning.) Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both (or all three) phrases in your translation. It may be clearer in your language to connect the phrases with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the idea the first one, not saying something different. For example, in [5:2](../05/02.md) you might say, “For the loosening of long hair in Israel, yes, for the volunteering of the people.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])\n\n### Deborah and Barak singing this song together\n\nWhile the author says in [5:1](../05/01.md) that both “Deborah and Barak” sang this song, the first-person verbs and pronouns in it are singular. It was common for the Israelites to sing in responsive parts, so it may be that Deborah and Barak each sang parts of this song individually, responding to one another. For example, it seems probable that in [5:12](../05/12.md) Barak sang “awake, Deborah” and Deborah responded “Arise, Barak.”\n\nHebrew does not mark first-person pronouns or verbs for gender, so it is not clear in many cases which of them sang which parts, although in some cases the text does give us a fair idea. For the sake of languages that do mark first-person singular pronouns or verbs for gender, here are some suggestions as to who might be singing when the song says “I” or “my.” This is, however, largely a matter of interpretation, so use your own best judgment in your translation. Since Deborah and Barak are, in a sense, speaking for each other, another alternative would be to use plural first-person pronouns. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]] and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd]])\n- In [5:3](../05/03.md), you could consider using masculine forms for “I … {even} I, let me sing” and feminine forms for “I will make music.” The verb translated as “make music” refers to singing with an instrumental accompaniment. Deborah was a prophetess, and the Old Testament prophets appear to have sung at least some of their prophecies to instrumental accompaniment. (See, for example, [Ezekiel 33:32](../ezk/33/32.md).) So it is perhaps more likely that Deborah sang “I will make music” and Barak sang “let me sing.”\n- Deborah is speaking of herself as “I” in [5:7](../05/07.md), so it would be appropriate to use feminine forms there.\n- It has been suggested that [5:9](../05/09.md), it would be more appropriate for Deborah to thank the leaders, who would have included Barak, and for Barak to thank those who volunteered in response to his summons. So you may wish to mark “My” as feminine.\n- Barak is probably referring to himself as “me” in [5:13](../05/13.md), since he was the one who led the Israelite army “against the warriors” of Sisera.\n- Barak seems to be speaking in [5:15](../05/05.md), “my princes in Issachar were with Deborah,” because otherwise Deborah would be speaking of herself in the third person, which she does not seem to do in this song.\n- It has been suggested that in [5:21](../05/21.md), Barak may have described the Kishon River flooding, since he saw this first-hand in the battle, and then said, “March on, my soul, in strength,” recalling how the Israelite soldiers pursued the attack against Sisera vigorously when they saw how the flooding had put them and their chariots at a disadvantage.
5:1	w7ex		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	בַּ⁠יּ֥וֹם הַ⁠ה֖וּא	1	The author is referring to the same phrase in [4:23](../04/23.md). He may not mean that Deborah and Barak sang this song on the actual day on which the Israelites defeated the forces of King Jabin. The word **day** may refer to a more general time. Alternate translation: “at the time when the Israelites defeated the forces of King Jabin”
5:1	j161		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	לֵ⁠אמֹֽר	1	The author is using the term **saying** to introduce a direct quotation of the song that Deborah and Barak **sang**. In your translation, use a natural way of introducing direct quotations in your language. Alternate translation: “the following song”
5:2	j162		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks	בִּ⁠פְרֹ֤עַ פְּרָעוֹת֙ בְּ⁠יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל בְּ⁠הִתְנַדֵּ֖ב עָ֑ם	1	This is the beginning of the song that Deborah and Barak sang. You may wish to indicate this with an opening first-level quotation mark or with some other punctuation or convention that your language uses to indicate the start of a first-level quotation. You may also be able to use special formatting to set off the song as poetry, as the ULT does.
5:2	j163		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	בִּ⁠פְרֹ֤עַ פְּרָעוֹת֙ בְּ⁠יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל בְּ⁠הִתְנַדֵּ֖ב עָ֑ם	1	As the following notes explain, these two phrases mean similar things. See the General Notes to this chapter for a discussion of how to translate such similar phrases throughout this song.
5:2	j164		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	בִּ⁠פְרֹ֤עַ פְּרָעוֹת֙ בְּ⁠יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל	1	While scholars disagree about how to translate and understand this phrase, it seems to be describing the practice of taking a vow not to cut one’s hair until a certain objective is achieved, in this case the defeat of Sisera’s army. Growing long hair was thus a symbolic action that expressed the determination to achieve this objective. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action. Alternate translation: “For the Israelites who vowed to defeat Sisera’s army”
5:2	j165		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry	בִּ⁠פְרֹ֤עַ פְּרָעוֹת֙ בְּ⁠יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל	1	For emphasis and poetic effect, Deborah and Barak are using a construction in which a verb and its object come from the same root. That is, the word translated as **long hair** describes hair that is flowing freely or loosely, and the word translated as **loosening** describes not braiding that hair or binding it with a turban. Your language may have terms available that will allow you to use the same construction in your translation to express the meaning here. Alternatively, your language may have another way of expressing the emphasis and poetic effect, if you do not express the meaning in plain language. Alternate translation: “For freely flowing hair in Israel”
5:2	s181		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	בְּ⁠הִתְנַדֵּ֖ב עָ֑ם	1	Deborah and Barak are referring implicitly to people **volunteering** to fight against Israel’s enemies. You could state this information explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “for the people who volunteered to fight”
5:2	j166		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	בָּרֲכ֖וּ	1	The imperative verb **bless** is plural here because Deborah and Barak are addressing an audience of many people, so use the plural form in your translation if your language marks that distinction.
5:3	hs8j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe	שִׁמְע֣וּ מְלָכִ֔ים הַאֲזִ֖ינוּ רֹֽזְנִ֑ים	1	Deborah and Barak are speaking to two groups that they know cannot hear them. They are doing this to show in a strong way how they feel about the story they are telling in their song. They feel that it is worth the attention of the most important people in the world. They are actually speaking to all the people who can hear them or who will hear them. ([5:10–11](../05/10.md) indicates that this includes people from throughout Israelite society.) If your readers might not understand what Deborah and Barak are doing, you could translate their words as if they were speaking directly to people who were present. Alternate translation: “This story deserves to be heard by kings and rulers!”
5:3	j167		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	אָֽנֹכִ֗י לַֽ⁠יהוָה֙ אָנֹכִ֣י אָשִׁ֔ירָה אֲזַמֵּ֕ר	1	If your language marks first-person singular pronouns or verbs for gender, see the discussion in the General Notes to this chapter for a suggestion of how to mark the instances of **I** here.
5:3	j168		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-sentencetypes 	אָשִׁ֔ירָה	1	The speaker here is not asking permission. He is using a particular type of sentence to encourage himself to do something. If your language does not use this type of sentence, in your translation you can use an equivalent form. Alternate translation: “I certainly should sing”
5:4	f5pu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	יְהוָ֗ה בְּ⁠צֵאתְ⁠ךָ֤ מִ⁠שֵּׂעִיר֙ בְּ⁠צַעְדְּ⁠ךָ֙ מִ⁠שְּׂדֵ֣ה אֱד֔וֹם	1	The song is speaking as if Yahweh had literally traveled from or across the land of **Seir**, that is, **Edom**, in order to lead the Israelites into battle against Sisera. This could mean: (1) that the song is envisioning Mount Sinai as Yahweh’s dwelling place on earth and describing the route that Yahweh would have taken from there to the battlefield. Alternate translation: “Yahweh, when you came across Seir to fight against Sisera, when you marched across the fields of Edom” (2) that the song is referring to the time when the Israelites left Edom to start conquering the people in Canaan and speaking of Yahweh as if he had been a warrior leading the Israelite army at that time. Alternate translation: “Yahweh, it was just like the time when you first led our armies into Canaan from Seir. It was as if you marched ahead of us across the fields of Edom”
5:4	vj7e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	מִ⁠שְּׂדֵ֣ה אֱד֔וֹם	1	The song is not referring to a specific **field** in **Edom**. It means the cultivated land in Edom in general. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using a plural form. Alternate translation: “from the fields of Edom”
5:4	hw54		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אֶ֣רֶץ רָעָ֔שָׁה גַּם־שָׁמַ֖יִם נָטָ֑פוּ גַּם־עָבִ֖ים נָ֥טְפוּ מָֽיִם	1	The song seems to be referring implicitly to the great storm that rendered Sisera’s chariots useless for the battle. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “the earth trembled from the thunder and there was a heavy downpour”
5:5	p4qp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הָרִ֥ים נָזְל֖וּ	1	The song is speaking as if the **mountains** above the battlefield had literally **flowed** down onto it. This seems to be a reference to the way the downpour made the mountain streams overflow. (Ultimately they fed into the Kishon River and it flooded the battlefield, [5:21](../05/21.md).) This might also be an allusion to the way that the overflowing streams would have carried dirt, branches, rocks, etc. down from the mountains, as if the mountains themselves were coming down onto the plain. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “The mountain streams overflowed”
5:5	wuf5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	זֶ֣ה סִינַ֔י מִ⁠פְּנֵ֕י יְהוָ֖ה	1	The song is saying that what happened to the mountains above the battlefield was just like what happened when Yahweh appeared to the Israelites at Mount Sinai. When he did, according to [Exodus 19:16–18](../exo/01/01.md), there was also a thunderstorm and the mountain shook. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “just as Mount Sinai trembled when Yahweh appeared there in a storm”
5:6	rw34		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	בִּ⁠ימֵ֞י שַׁמְגַּ֤ר בֶּן־עֲנָת֙ בִּ⁠ימֵ֣י יָעֵ֔ל	1	The song is speaking of two time periods in order to mean the time in between them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “Between the time when Shamgar son of Anath defeated the Philistines and the time when Jael killed Sisera”
5:6	ki5e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	חָדְל֖וּ אֳרָח֑וֹת	1	The song is speaking as if the **roads** in Israel had literally **ceased** to exist. It means that people stopped using the main roads because it had become too dangerous to travel on them. Jabin’s forces were apparently occupying Israel, and his soldiers would plunder the goods that anyone was transporting. (This means that, in a sense, the roads literally did cease to exist, since they were dirt roads and grass would have grown back over them. One translation option would be to say this and let readers realize the implications.) Alternate translation: “people stopped using the main roads” or “grass grew back over the roads”
5:6	i6j5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠הֹלְכֵ֣י נְתִיב֔וֹת יֵלְכ֕וּ אֳרָח֖וֹת עֲקַלְקַלּֽוֹת	1	The song means implicitly that because people needed to stay off the main roads for safety, they took back roads that wound through the countryside. You could indicate this in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “and travelers had to take roundabout back routes”
5:7	j170		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-reduplication	חָדְל֧וּ פְרָז֛וֹן בְּ⁠יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל חָדֵ֑לּוּ עַ֤ד שַׁ⁠קַּ֨מְתִּי֙ דְּבוֹרָ֔ה שַׁ⁠קַּ֥מְתִּי אֵ֖ם בְּ⁠יִשְׂרָאֵֽל	1	Deborah is repeating the verbs **ceased** and **arose** in order to intensify the ideas that they express. If your language can repeat words for intensification, it would be appropriate to do that here in your translation. If not, your language may have another way of expressing the emphasis. Alternate translation: “The peasantry completely ceased in Israel until when I, Deborah, arose triumphantly as a mother in Israel”
5:7	j169		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	חָדְל֧וּ פְרָז֛וֹן בְּ⁠יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל חָדֵ֑לּוּ	1	The song is speaking as if the rural population of Israel had literally **ceased** to exist. The meaning is that no one was living in the countryside anymore because the rural people hid in the mountains or moved into fortified cities for safety. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Everyone had to move from the countryside into the cities where it was safer”
5:7	j171		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	בְּ⁠יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל & בְּ⁠יִשְׂרָאֵֽל	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could use another term to refer to **Israel** in the second instance, rather than repeating the name. Alternate translation: “in Israel … there”
5:7	j172		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	עַ֤ד שַׁ⁠קַּ֨מְתִּי֙ דְּבוֹרָ֔ה שַׁ⁠קַּ֥מְתִּי אֵ֖ם בְּ⁠יִשְׂרָאֵֽל	1	Deborah is using the expression **arose** to mean that she took on a particular role. She is not referring to getting up from sitting beneath her palm tree to accompany Barak. The role she is describing included settling the Israelites’ disputes there. Alternate translation: “but then I, Deborah, became a mother in Israel”
5:7	n27x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	שַׁ⁠קַּ֨מְתִּי֙ דְּבוֹרָ֔ה שַׁ⁠קַּ֥מְתִּי אֵ֖ם בְּ⁠יִשְׂרָאֵֽל	1	Deborah is speaking of herself as if she had literally become the **mother** of the Israelites. She means that she became a leader who cared for the Israelites the way a mother takes care of her children. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning as a comparison. Alternate translation: “when I, Deborah, became a leader who took care of the Israelites the way a mother takes care of her children”
5:8	mxk4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	יִבְחַר֙ אֱלֹהִ֣ים חֲדָשִׁ֔ים	1	The pronoun **He** refers back to “Israel” in the previous verse, meaning the people of Israel. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “The people of Israel chose new gods”
5:8	duj5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	אָ֖ז לָחֶ֣ם שְׁעָרִ֑ים	1	The song is using one part of cities, their **gates**, to mean entire cities. The gates are chosen to represent the cities because that is where enemies would attack to try to get into the city and conquer it. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “then enemy armies besieged the cities”
5:8	j173		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	מָגֵ֤ן אִם־יֵֽרָאֶה֙ וָ⁠רֹ֔מַח בְּ⁠אַרְבָּעִ֥ים אֶ֖לֶף בְּ⁠יִשְׂרָאֵֽל	1	The song is using the question form for emphasis. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “a shield or spear was not seen among 40,000 in Israel!”
5:8	dl2n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers	מָגֵ֤ן אִם־יֵֽרָאֶה֙ וָ⁠רֹ֔מַח בְּ⁠אַרְבָּעִ֥ים אֶ֖לֶף בְּ⁠יִשְׂרָאֵֽל	1	The song is using the number **40,000** as a customary way of saying “very many.” Alternate translation: “one could hardly find a single shield or spear among a large number of Israelites”
5:8	v83h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	מָגֵ֤ן אִם־יֵֽרָאֶה֙ וָ⁠רֹ֔מַח	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “did anyone see a shield or a spear”
5:8	j174		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	מָגֵ֤ן אִם־יֵֽרָאֶה֙ וָ⁠רֹ֔מַח	1	The song is using the fact that no shield or spear could be **seen** by association to mean that no Israelites had these weapons. (Jabin’s occupying forces has apparently confiscated all of the weapons that the Israelites had.) Alternate translation: “was there a single shield or spear”
5:8	j175		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	מָגֵ֤ן אִם־יֵֽרָאֶה֙ וָ⁠רֹ֔מַח	1	The author is using two weapons, a **shield** and a **spear**, to mean weapons of all kinds. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “were there any weapons”
5:9	u5zy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	לִבִּ⁠י֙ לְ⁠חוֹקְקֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל	1	In this culture, people regarded the **heart** as the location of human feelings. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I am so happy about what the commanders of Israel did”
5:9	j176		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	בָּרֲכ֖וּ	1	As in [5:2](../05/02.md), the imperative verb **bless** is plural here, so use the plural form in your translation if your language marks that distinction.
5:10	j177		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	רֹכְבֵי֩ אֲתֹנ֨וֹת צְחֹר֜וֹת יֹשְׁבֵ֧י עַל־מִדִּ֛ין וְ⁠הֹלְכֵ֥י עַל־דֶּ֖רֶךְ	1	See the discussion in the General Notes to this chapter of the apparent change of setting in [5:10–11](../05/10.md), from the original performance of the song at a victory celebration to its repeated recitation at places where travelers stopped along the road for water.
5:10	dt2p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	רֹכְבֵי֩ אֲתֹנ֨וֹת צְחֹר֜וֹת יֹשְׁבֵ֧י עַל־מִדִּ֛ין וְ⁠הֹלְכֵ֥י עַל־דֶּ֖רֶךְ	1	The song is speaking of two kinds of people, rich and poor, in order to mean all kinds of people. (Wealthier people would have animals to ride and carpet to sit on as they traveled; poorer people would walk on foot.) If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “All of you who pass by this place”
5:10	vf24		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	מִדִּ֛ין	1	The word translated as **carpet** describes something that people would put on the back of a riding animal to make the rider more comfortable. If your readers would not be familiar with such an object, you could use a general expression in your translation. Alternate translation: “saddle blankets”
5:11	j178		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	מִ⁠קּ֣וֹל מְחַֽצְצִ֗ים בֵּ֚ין מַשְׁאַבִּ֔ים שָׁ֤ם יְתַנּוּ֙ צִדְק֣וֹת יְהוָ֔ה צִדְקֹ֥ת פִּרְזֹנ֖⁠וֹ בְּ⁠יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל	1	In some languages, the meaning here may be clearer with a passive verb than with the indefinite pronoun **they**. Alternate translation: “The righteousness of Yahweh and the righteousness of his peasantry in Israel will be celebrated at the watering places by the voice of the singers”
5:11	j179		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	מִ⁠קּ֣וֹל מְחַֽצְצִ֗ים	1	The song is using the **voice** of these **singers** to represent the song they are singing with their voices. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “From the song of the singers”
5:11	v4bj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	מִ⁠קּ֣וֹל מְחַֽצְצִ֗ים	1	Since the song is referring to a group of people, it might be more natural in your language to use the plural form of **voice**. Alternate translation: “From the voices of the singers”
5:11	j180		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	צִדְק֣וֹת יְהוָ֔ה צִדְקֹ֥ת פִּרְזֹנ֖⁠וֹ בְּ⁠יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל	1	The song is using the term **righteous** to describe the victory that **Yahweh** and his **peasantry** (the volunteer soldiers) won over Sisera. This is by association with the fact that it was wrong for Jabin to oppress the Israelites, and so by defeating him, the victors restored a situation that was right or righteous. Alternate translation: “what Yahweh and his peasantry in Israel did to restore a right situation”
5:11	f6il		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	יָרְד֥וּ לַ⁠שְּׁעָרִ֖ים	1	The song is using one part of cities, their **gates**, to mean entire cities. See how you translated the same expression in [5:8](../05/08.md). Alternate translation: “returned to live in the cities that their enemies had conquered”
5:12	de7e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	עוּרִ֤י עוּרִי֙ דְּבוֹרָ֔ה ע֥וּרִי ע֖וּרִי דַּבְּרִי־שִׁ֑יר	1	The song is addressing Deborah as if she were literally asleep and needed to wake up. (Baruk may be singing this part; see the discussion in the General Notes to this chapter.) This is actually a call for Deborah to apply vitality and creativity to the task of celebrating Yahweh’s victory through this song. Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation. Alternate translation: “Come on, Deborah, sing in a lively way!”
5:12	j181		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-reduplication	עוּרִ֤י עוּרִי֙ דְּבוֹרָ֔ה ע֥וּרִי ע֖וּרִי דַּבְּרִי־שִׁ֑יר	1	The song is repeating the word **Awake** in order to intensify the idea that it expresses. If your language can repeat words for intensification, it would be appropriate to do that here in your translation. If not, your language may have another way of expressing the emphasis. Alternate translation: “You certainly must not be drowsy as you sing, Deborah!”
5:12	j182		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry	דַּבְּרִי־שִׁ֑יר	1	This does not mean that Deborah should stop singing and only speak the words of the song. It is actually play on words in Hebrew: the word translated as **speak** has the same three root letters as Deborah’s name, D-B-R. Your language may have an expression that you could use in your translation to bring out the meaning here. Alternate translation: “make the song your own”
5:12	j183		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ק֥וּם	1	The expression **Arise** does not mean that Barak should get out of bed or stand up from a seated position. Rather, it means that Barak should take action. Deborah could be the one singing this line (see the discussion in the General Notes to this chapter), and it could be intentionally reminiscent of [4:14](../04/14.md), where she used the same expression to tell him that it was time to attack Sisera. See how you translated the expression there.
5:12	j184		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry	וּֽ⁠שֲׁבֵ֥ה שֶׁבְיְ⁠ךָ֖	1	For emphasis, the song is using a construction in which a verb and its object come from the same root. You may be able to use the same construction in your language to express the meaning here. Alternatively, your language may have another way of showing the emphasis. Alternate translation: “and lead away all of your prisoners”
5:12	j185		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	וּֽ⁠שֲׁבֵ֥ה שֶׁבְיְ⁠ךָ֖	1	The song is using this possessive form to speak to Barak about the group of people that he and his army have taken prisoner. It is not saying that Barak himself is in **captivity**. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “and lead away all the prisoners you have captured”
5:12	j186		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וּֽ⁠שֲׁבֵ֥ה שֶׁבְיְ⁠ךָ֖	1	The song is leaving some information implicit that listeners are expected to understand. It is possible that the original occasion of this song was a victory celebration through which captured enemy soldiers were paraded in order to dramatize the victory. Barak, as the army commander, would have led this procession. You could suggest this in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “and parade the captured enemy soldiers in a victory procession”
5:13	j187		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	יְרַ֣ד שָׂרִ֔יד לְ⁠אַדִּירִ֖ים עָ֑ם יְהוָ֕ה יְרַד־לִ֖⁠י	1	While the expression **came down** in both instances is probably a literal reference to travel down from higher elevations to a plain, the implicit meaning is that the **remnant** and **people** were gathering on a level place as troops for battle under the command of the **nobles** and Barak. You could indicate this in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “the remnant gathered to the nobles, the people of Yahweh gathered to me”
5:13	j188		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	יְרַ֣ד שָׂרִ֔יד לְ⁠אַדִּירִ֖ים	1	The phrase translated as **to the nobles** could also be a possessive form and mean “of the nobles.” There would not be a significant difference in meaning. Alternate translation: “the remnant of the nobles came down”
5:13	tle3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	לִ֖⁠י	1	The pronoun **me** probably refers to Barak, since he was the one who led the Israelite army **against the warriors** of Sisera. Even if your language does not need to mark first-person pronouns for gender, it may be helpful to clarify the reference for your readers. Otherwise, they might take it to be Deborah, since she clearly spoke in the first person in [5:7](../05/05.md) and probably did in [5:9](../05/09.md) as well. Alternate translation, as in the UST: “to me, Barak”
5:14	j189		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	מִנִּ֣י אֶפְרַ֗יִם שָׁרְשָׁ⁠ם֙ בַּ⁠עֲמָלֵ֔ק אַחֲרֶ֥י⁠ךָ בִנְיָמִ֖ין בַּֽ⁠עֲמָמֶ֑י⁠ךָ & וּ⁠מִ֨⁠זְּבוּלֻ֔ן מֹשְׁכִ֖ים בְּ⁠שֵׁ֥בֶט סֹפֵֽר	1	In these phrases, the song is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “Some from Ephraim, whose root is in Amalek, came down; they came after you, Benjamin, with your peoples … and from Zebulun, the ones holding onto the scepter of a scribe also came down”
5:14	e478		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	מִנִּ֣י אֶפְרַ֗יִם שָׁרְשָׁ⁠ם֙ בַּ⁠עֲמָלֵ֔ק	1	The song is speaking as if the people of the tribe of Ephraim were literally a plant whose **root** was in the territory that formerly belonged to the Amalek people group. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “People from the tribe of Ephraim, which defeated the Amalekites and took their territory”
5:14	k3ph		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe	אַחֲרֶ֥י⁠ךָ בִנְיָמִ֖ין בַּֽ⁠עֲמָמֶ֑י⁠ךָ	1	Here the song could be speaking to a group of people who are not there to hear it, the people of the tribe of **Benjamin**, in order to express strong approval of the way the soldiers from that tribe came and fought for Israel. The song would actually be speaking to the people who could hear it, initially the soldiers and others who gathered for the victory celebration at which it was first performed. However, some people from the tribe of Benjamin probably were present at the celebration, so the direct address with **you** and **your** could be literal. On the other hand, as [5:9–10](../05/09.md) shows, this song was later sung in other contexts where people from Benjamin were not necessarily present. So it may be clearer in some languages to translate this without using second-person pronouns and to express the emphasis in some other way. Alternate translation: “they followed the brave soldiers from the tribe of Benjamin”
5:14	j190		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	מִנִּ֣י מָכִ֗יר יָֽרְדוּ֙ מְחֹ֣קְקִ֔ים	1	The song is using these **commanders** to men them and the troops they commanded. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the military leaders from Machir brought their soldiers”
5:14	yna1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	מִנִּ֣י מָכִ֗יר	1	The word **Machir** is the name of a man, the son of Manasseh.
5:14	j191		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	מִנִּ֣י מָכִ֗יר	1	The name **Machir** could mean: (1) by association, the tribe of Manasseh. Alternate translation: “from the tribe of Manasseh” (2) the descendants of Machir, who formed one part of the tribe of Manasseh. Alternate translation: “from the clan of Machir”
5:14	rl91		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	וּ⁠מִ֨⁠זְּבוּלֻ֔ן מֹשְׁכִ֖ים בְּ⁠שֵׁ֥בֶט סֹפֵֽר	1	The military leaders of the tribe of **Zebulun** each carried a **scepter** as a symbolic action to indicate their rank and position. Each leader is called a **scribe** because one of his duties was to record the names of soldiers who enlisted and keep a total of the number of soldiers in the army. But the focus here is not on that duty but on the fact that these were military leaders, like the **commanders** mentioned in the previous phrase. Alternate translation: “and the military commanders of the tribe of Zebulun also brought their soldiers”
5:15	ruv4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	וְ⁠שָׂרַ֤⁠י בְּ⁠יִשָּׂשכָר֙ עִם־דְּבֹרָ֔ה\n	1	Here again the song is using part of an army, its **princes** or commanders, to mean all of the army. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “And the soldiers and officers I commanded who were from Issachar also supported Deborah”
5:15	j192		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ⁠יִשָּׂשכָר֙ כֵּ֣ן בָּרָ֔ק	1	This expression means that the first person or group mentioned was willing to do whatever the second person mentioned wanted to do. (See, for example, [1 Kings 22:4](../1ki/22/04.md).) If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and the soldiers from Issachar were willing to do whatever Barak ordered”
5:15	z2wa		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	בָּ⁠עֵ֖מֶק שֻׁלַּ֣ח בְּ⁠רַגְלָ֑י⁠ו	1	This could mean: (1) that the pronoun **he** refers to Issachar, that is, the soldiers from the tribe of Issachar, and the pronoun **his** refers to Barak. In that case, the phrase **at his feet** would mean the same thing as in [4:10](../04/10.md). Alternate translation: “those soldiers were sent into a valley under Barak’s command” (2) that both the pronoun **he** and the pronoun **his** refer to Barak. In that case, the last phrase would be translated “on his feet,” and it would be a reference to the courage of Barak and his soldiers, who fought against chariots on foot. Alternate translation: “he was sent into a valley to fight against chariots on foot”
5:15	j193		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	בָּ⁠עֵ֖מֶק שֻׁלַּ֣ח בְּ⁠רַגְלָ֑י⁠ו	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. While it was Deborah who told Barak in [4:14](../04/14.md) to go down and attack Sisera, she did this as a prophetess speaking for Yahweh, so it would be appropriate to describe Yahweh as the one who **sent**. Alternate translation: “Yahweh sent these soldiers into a valley under Barak’s command” or “Yahweh sent Barak into a valley to fight against chariots on foot”
5:15	j194		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	בִּ⁠פְלַגּ֣וֹת רְאוּבֵ֔ן	1	The word translated as **divisions** is a rare word whose meaning is not entirely clear in this context. It could mean: (1) divisions of the people of the tribe of Reuben. Alternate translation: “Among the clans of Reuben” (2) divisions of the territory of the tribe of Reuben. Alternate translation: “Throughout the districts of Reuben”
5:15	sdi1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	גְּדֹלִ֖ים חִקְקֵי־לֵֽב	1	Here the **heart** represents the thoughts and intentions. The song is speaking as if the people of Reuben needed to look around inside their hearts to find out what they should do. The word translated as **resolutions** is also a rare word whose meaning is not entirely clear in this context. This could mean: (1) that the people of Reuben could not decide whether to help fight. Your language may have a comparable expression for this meaning that you can use in your translation. Alternate translation: “people had second thoughts about whether to fight” (2) that the people of Reuben publicly expressed a resolve to help fight Sisera but, as the next verse shows, they did not follow through. Alternate translation: “great were the promises to help”
5:16	j195		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	לָ֣⁠מָּה יָשַׁ֗בְתָּ בֵּ֚ין הַֽ⁠מִּשְׁפְּתַ֔יִם לִ⁠שְׁמֹ֖עַ שְׁרִק֣וֹת עֲדָרִ֑ים	1	The song is using the question form for emphasis. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “You should not have stayed among the sheepfolds, as if it was more important to listen to the piping for the flocks!”
5:16	j196		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe	לָ֣⁠מָּה יָשַׁ֗בְתָּ בֵּ֚ין הַֽ⁠מִּשְׁפְּתַ֔יִם לִ⁠שְׁמֹ֖עַ שְׁרִק֣וֹת עֲדָרִ֑ים	1	The song is speaking to someone who is not present. It is doing this to express a strong feeling about that person to the people who are present. If a speaker of your language would not address someone who was not present, you could translate this as if the song were directly addressing those who are present. Alternate translation: “Reuben should not have stayed among the sheepfolds, as if it was more important to listen to the piping for the flocks”
5:16	j197		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	לָ֣⁠מָּה יָשַׁ֗בְתָּ בֵּ֚ין הַֽ⁠מִּשְׁפְּתַ֔יִם	1	The word **you** is singular here because the song is addressing this tribe as if it were a single person, its ancestor Reuben. It may be more natural in some languages to use a plural form of “you,” since a group of people is actually being addressed.
5:16	j198		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	לִ⁠שְׁמֹ֖עַ שְׁרִק֣וֹת עֲדָרִ֑ים	1	The song is implicitly making a comparison that it expects listeners to recognize. When Barak summoned the Israelites in [4:10](../04/10.md), it is likely that he blew a shofar (ram’s horn), as Ehud did in [3:27](../03/27.md). The song is suggesting that the men of Reuben so much enjoyed listening to shepherds play their pipes to summon their flocks that they did not pay attention to the war trumpet. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “Was it because you would rather listen to shepherd’s pipes than respond to the call of the war trumpet?”
5:16	jg14		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	לִ⁠פְלַגּ֣וֹת רְאוּבֵ֔ן גְּדוֹלִ֖ים חִקְרֵי־לֵֽב	1	See how you translated the similar expression in the previous verse.
5:17	pg1n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	גִּלְעָ֗ד	1	The song is using the name **Gildead** by association to mean the soldiers from the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh, which settled in the region of Gilead on the east side of the Jordan River. Alternate translation: “The soldiers of Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh”
5:17	wy1c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense	וְ⁠דָ֕ן לָ֥⁠מָּה יָג֖וּר אֳנִיּ֑וֹת	1	The song is using the present tense to describe habitual action. During the battle against Sisera, the people of the tribe of Dan continued to do what they usually did. Their territory included the harbor of Joppa, and so they were devoted to the pursuits of fishing and maritime trading. But since the song is referring specifically to what the people of Dan did on a specific occasion, you could use the past tense in your translation. Alternate translation: “and Dan, why did he sojourn {on} ships?”
5:17	l6vz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	וְ⁠דָ֕ן לָ֥⁠מָּה יָג֖וּר אֳנִיּ֑וֹת	1	The song is using the question form for emphasis. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “and Dan should not have sojourned on ships!”
5:17	q466		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense	אָשֵׁ֗ר יָשַׁב֙ לְ⁠ח֣וֹף יַמִּ֔ים וְ⁠עַ֥ל מִפְרָצָ֖י⁠ו יִשְׁכּֽוֹן	1	Here the song is first using the past tense to describe action in the past (**abode**) and then the present tense to describe habitual action (**stays**). Like the tribe of Dan, the tribe of Asher was devoted to maritime pursuits, and its men did not leave them to join in the battle against Sisera. In your translation, you could use the past tense in both clauses, or you could indicate that the habitual action was the reason for the past action. Alternate translation: “Asher abode at the coast of the seas, yes, he stayed among his harbors” or “Asher abode at the coast of the seas, for he stays among his harbors”
5:18	j199		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	 זְבֻל֗וּן עַ֣ם חֵרֵ֥ף נַפְשׁ֛⁠וֹ לָ⁠מ֖וּת	1	Since the song is referring to a group of people, it might be more natural in your language to use the plural form of **soul**. Alternate translation: “The people of Zebulun were reproaching their souls unto death”
5:18	j200		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	 זְבֻל֗וּן עַ֣ם חֵרֵ֥ף נַפְשׁ֛⁠וֹ לָ⁠מ֖וּת	1	The song is speaking as if the people of the tribe of Zebulun had literally been **reproaching** their souls during the battle, that is, as if they had been taunting or shaming them for wanting to stay alive. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “The people of Zebulun told themselves not to be afraid to die”
5:18	j201		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	וְ⁠נַפְתָּלִ֑י עַ֖ל מְרוֹמֵ֥י שָׂדֶֽה	1	The song is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “and the people of Naphtali were also not afraid to die on the heights on the battlefield”
5:19	j202		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	בָּ֤אוּ מְלָכִים֙ נִלְחָ֔מוּ אָ֤ז נִלְחֲמוּ֙ מַלְכֵ֣י כְנַ֔עַן	1	Chapter 4 describes only Jabin oppressing the Israelites and only his army attacking Barak and his forces. However, it also describes Jabin as the “king of Canaan” ([4:2](../04/02.md)), suggesting that other Canaanite kings were his subjects or allies. The song may be referring to such kings implicitly here. Alternate translation: “Then the armies of Jabin and his Canaanite allies came and fought”
5:19	klr4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	בָּ֤אוּ מְלָכִים֙ & מַלְכֵ֣י כְנַ֔עַן	1	The song is using these **Kings** to mean them and their armies. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Kings came with their armies … the armies of the kings of Canaan”
5:19	qh9s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	נִלְחָ֔מוּ & נִלְחֲמוּ֙ מַלְכֵ֣י כְנַ֔עַן	1	The song is leaving some information implicit that it assumes readers will understand. The meaning is not that these kings **fought** with each other, but that they fought against the Israelites. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “they fought against us Israelites … the kings of Canaan fought against us”
5:19	bwx4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	בְּ⁠תַעְנַ֖ךְ & מְגִדּ֑וֹ	1	See how you translated the names of the cities of **Taanach** and **Megiddo** in [1:27](../01/27.md).
5:19	j203		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-metonymy	מֵ֣י מְגִדּ֑וֹ	1	Here the song is referring to the Kishon River as **the waters of Megiddo** by association with the fact that the river flows past the city of Megiddo, or with the fact that the river flows through the plain of Megiddo, also known as the valley of Jezreel, where the battle against Sisera was fought. You could use the name Kishon River here if that would help your readers to recognize that the song is describing the same **waters** as in [5:21](../05/21.md). Alternate translation: “the Kishon River”
5:19	jn5l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	בֶּ֥צַע כֶּ֖סֶף לֹ֥א לָקָֽחוּ	1	The song is using **silver**, one thing that armies might take as **plunder**, to mean plunder of all kinds. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “But they did not take any plunder”
5:19	j204		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בֶּ֥צַע כֶּ֖סֶף לֹ֥א לָקָֽחוּ	1	The song is using taking plunder to mean winning the battle, by association with the way that victorious armies take plunder. Alternate translation: “But they did not win the battle”
5:20	uwf8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	מִן־שָׁמַ֖יִם נִלְחָ֑מוּ הַ⁠כּֽוֹכָבִים֙ מִ⁠מְּסִלּוֹתָ֔⁠ם נִלְחֲמ֖וּ עִם־סִיסְרָֽא	1	The song is speaking of the **stars** as if they were living things that could have **fought against Sisera**. It is using the stars to represent the forces of nature, particularly those in the sky, and celebrating the way Yahweh used those forces to defeat Sisera. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Yahweh used the forces of nature to defeat Sisera; he sent a great storm from the sky”
5:21	yn1b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	גְּרָפָ֔⁠ם	1	The pronoun **them** refers to the soldiers in Sisera’s army. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “swept away Sisera’s soldiers”
5:21	j205		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	נַ֥חַל קְדוּמִ֖ים	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **antiquity**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “that ancient river”
5:21	j206		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	נַ֥חַל קְדוּמִ֖ים	1	The implicit idea behind this phrase may be that the Kishon is a natural river, part of the original creation, rather than a manmade canal or irrigation channel. Therefore, like the storm, it was a natural force that Yahweh used to defeat Sisera. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “a river that God created”
5:21	je12		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	תִּדְרְכִ֥י נַפְשִׁ֖⁠י עֹֽז	1	The singer, who is probably Barak at this point (see the General Notes to this chapter), is using one part of himself, his **soul**, to mean all of himself. He is putting himself back in the time of the battle and encouraging himself to fight vigorously since Yahweh is already defeating Sisera with natural forces. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly, and you could express it from the time perspective of the victory celebration, that is, as a past event, as in the first sentence of the verse. Alternate translation: “When I saw this, it encouraged me to fight vigorously”
5:22	wx9v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	אָ֥ז הָלְמ֖וּ עִקְּבֵי־ס֑וּס מִֽ⁠דַּהֲר֖וֹת דַּהֲר֥וֹת אַבִּירָֽי⁠ו	1	The pronoun **his** refers to Sisera. This is a description of the sound of Sisera’s horses fleeing from the battle. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “Then there was the sound of horses’ hooves beating, as Sisera’s mighty steeds galloped away from the battlefield”
5:22	j207		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	הָלְמ֖וּ עִקְּבֵי־ס֑וּס	1	Since the song is referring to all of Sisera’s horses, it might be more natural in your language to use the plural form of **horse**. Alternate translation: “the hooves of horses beat”
5:22	n754		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-reduplication	מִֽ⁠דַּהֲר֖וֹת דַּהֲר֥וֹת אַבִּירָֽי⁠ו	1	The author is repeating the verb **galloping** in order to intensify the idea that it expresses and perhaps to imitate the repetitive sound of horses’ hooves beating against the ground. If your language can repeat words for intensification and poetic effect, it would be appropriate to do that here in your translation. If not, your language may have another way of expressing the emphasis. Alternate translation: “as Sisera’s mighty steeds galloped wildly away”
5:22	j208		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	אַבִּירָֽי⁠ו	1	The song is using the adjective **mighty** as a noun to mean a certain kind of horse. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this adjective with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “his mighty steeds”
5:23	j209		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	א֣וֹרוּ מֵר֗וֹז אָמַר֙ מַלְאַ֣ךְ יְהוָ֔ה אֹ֥רוּ אָר֖וֹר יֹשְׁבֶ֑י⁠הָ כִּ֤י לֹֽא־בָ֨אוּ֙ לְ⁠עֶזְרַ֣ת יְהוָ֔ה לְ⁠עֶזְרַ֥ת יְהוָ֖ה בַּ⁠גִּבּוֹרִֽים	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “The angel of Yahweh said that we must certainly curse the people who lived in Meroz, because they did not come to the aid of Yahweh against the warriors”
5:23	cdl6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	מֵר֗וֹז	1	The word **Meroz** is the name of a city. It was probably along the route that Sisera’s army took when fleeing from the battlefield, and the people of the city could have blocked their way so that the Israelites could have kept many more of the enemy soldiers from escaping.
5:23	j211		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	אֹ֥רוּ אָר֖וֹר יֹשְׁבֶ֑י⁠הָ כִּ֤י לֹֽא־בָ֨אוּ֙ לְ⁠עֶזְרַ֣ת יְהוָ֔ה לְ⁠עֶזְרַ֥ת יְהוָ֖ה בַּ⁠גִּבּוֹרִֽים	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “Because they did not come to the aid of Yahweh, to the aid of Yahweh against the warriors, cursing, you shall curse the dwellers of it”
5:23	j210		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-reduplication	אֹ֥רוּ אָר֖וֹר	1	The song is repeating the verb **curse** in order to intensify the idea that it expresses. If your language can repeat words for intensification, it would be appropriate to do that here in your translation. If not, your language may have another way of expressing the emphasis. Alternate translation: “You must certainly curse”
5:23	j212		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	לְ⁠עֶזְרַ֣ת יְהוָ֔ה לְ⁠עֶזְרַ֥ת יְהוָ֖ה בַּ⁠גִּבּוֹרִֽים	1	These two phrases are saying the same thing. The second phrase emphasizes the meaning of the first by being more specific. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and you could show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation. However, if it would be clearer in your language, you could combine the phrases and express the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “they did not help Yahweh at all against the warriors”
5:24	j213		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	תְּבֹרַךְ֙ מִ⁠נָּשִׁ֔ים יָעֵ֕ל אֵ֖שֶׁת חֶ֣בֶר הַ⁠קֵּינִ֑י מִ⁠נָּשִׁ֥ים בָּ⁠אֹ֖הֶל תְּבֹרָֽךְ	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “May Yahweh bless Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, who lives in a tent, more than any other woman”
5:24	j214		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	תְּבֹרַךְ֙ מִ⁠נָּשִׁ֔ים & מִ⁠נָּשִׁ֥ים בָּ⁠אֹ֖הֶל תְּבֹרָֽךְ	1	This is a common expression that means that Jael is the most **blessed** woman, that is, she is more blessed than any other woman. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “is more blessed than any other woman, yes, she is the most blessed of all the women who live in a tent”
5:24	j215		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	תְּבֹרַךְ֙ מִ⁠נָּשִׁ֔ים & מִ⁠נָּשִׁ֥ים בָּ⁠אֹ֖הֶל תְּבֹרָֽךְ	1	These two phrases are saying the same thing. The second phrase emphasizes the meaning of the first by being more specific. (It is not qualifying the first phrase by specifying that this statement about Jael actually applies only to women who live in tents.) You could include both phrases in your translation. However, if it would be clearer in your language, you could combine the phrases and express the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “who lives in a tent, is the most blessed of all women”
5:25	j216		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	מַ֥יִם שָׁאַ֖ל חָלָ֣ב נָתָ֑נָה	1	The pronoun **he** refers to Sisera, and the pronoun **she** refers to Jael. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “Sisera requested water, Jael gave him milk”
5:25	j217		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	בְּ⁠סֵ֥פֶל אַדִּירִ֖ים הִקְרִ֥יבָה חֶמְאָֽה	1	Bringing more than Sisera asked for and bringing it in an elegant bowl was a symbolic action that suggested that Jael respected Sisera and wanted to honor him. This would have made Sisera less cautious and encouraged him to think that he could safely go to sleep. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action. Alternate translation: “to suggest that she respected and honored him, she brought curdled milk in an elegant bowl”
5:25	viu5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	בְּ⁠סֵ֥פֶל אַדִּירִ֖ים	1	The song is using this possessive form to describe the kind of elegant **bowl** that wealthy **nobles** would have. This does not mean a bowl that contained nobles or a bowl that actually belonged to nobles. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “in a bowl fit for nobles” or “in an elegant bowl”
5:26	k8d2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	תִּשְׁלַ֔חְנָה	1	The pronoun **they** refers to Jael’s hands. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “Her hands reached out”
5:26	j232		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	תִּשְׁלַ֔חְנָה	1	The song is speaking of Jael’s hands as if they were living things that could have **reached out** by themselves. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “She reached out with her hands”
5:26	j235		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	יָדָ⁠הּ֙	1	The context indicates that the word **hand** here means Jael’s left hand. Alternate translation: “her left hand”
5:26	j218		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	מָחֲקָ֣ה רֹאשׁ֔⁠וֹ וּ⁠מָחֲצָ֥ה וְ⁠חָלְפָ֖ה רַקָּתֽ⁠וֹ	1	These two phrases are saying the same thing. The second phrase emphasizes the meaning of the first by being more specific. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine the phrases and express the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “she drove the peg right through his temple and smashed his head”
5:27	j219		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	בֵּ֣ין רַגְלֶ֔י⁠הָ כָּרַ֥ע	1	Since Sisera was lying down asleep when Jael pounded the tent peg through his head, it does not seem that he literally **bowed** down to her from a standing position. Rather, the song seems to be saying that when Jael stood astride his dead body, it was as if Sisera had prostrated himself before her, the way people in this culture did to show great honor to someone. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “It was as if Sisera had been prostrating himself before Jael”
5:27	j220		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	נָפַ֖ל שָׁכָ֑ב	1	Since Sisera was lying down, it also does not seem that he **fell** or **lay down** from a standing position. The song seems to be using the word **fell** to mean “died,” as in [4:16](../04/16.md), and the expression **lay down** to mean “died” as well. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “he died, he surely died”
5:27	j221		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	בֵּ֤ין רַגְלֶ֨י⁠הָ֙ כָּרַ֣ע נָפָ֔ל בַּ⁠אֲשֶׁ֣ר כָּרַ֔ע שָׁ֖ם נָפַ֥ל שָׁדֽוּד	1	For emphasis, these two clauses repeat the idea of the first clause and last clause adds some specific information. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine these clauses and express the emphasis in another way. The UST models one way to do this.
5:27	ezv3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	שָׁדֽוּד	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “She had destroyed him”
5:28	j222		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	מַדּ֗וּעַ בֹּשֵׁ֤שׁ רִכְבּ⁠וֹ֙ לָ⁠ב֔וֹא מַדּ֣וּעַ אֶֽחֱר֔וּ פַּעֲמֵ֖י מַרְכְּבוֹתָֽי⁠ו	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “She asked why his chariot had delayed to come and why the hoofbeats of his chariots were tarrying”
5:28	k2dy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	מַדּ֗וּעַ בֹּשֵׁ֤שׁ רִכְבּ⁠וֹ֙ לָ⁠ב֔וֹא מַדּ֣וּעַ אֶֽחֱר֔וּ פַּעֲמֵ֖י מַרְכְּבוֹתָֽי⁠ו	1	Sisera’s mother is using his **chariot** and these **hoofbeats** by association to mean Sisera himself. Alternate translation: “Why has he delayed to come back in his chariot? Why do I not hear the sound of the hoofbeats of his chariot horses indicating his arrival?”
5:28	mw4d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	מַדּ֗וּעַ בֹּשֵׁ֤שׁ רִכְבּ⁠וֹ֙ לָ⁠ב֔וֹא מַדּ֣וּעַ אֶֽחֱר֔וּ פַּעֲמֵ֖י מַרְכְּבוֹתָֽי⁠ו	1	These two phrases mean basically the same thing. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine them. Alternate translation: “Why is it taking so long for him to come back with his chariots?”
5:28	j223		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	מַדּ֣וּעַ אֶֽחֱר֔וּ פַּעֲמֵ֖י מַרְכְּבוֹתָֽי⁠ו	1	Sisera’s mother is using the phrase **the hoofbeats of his chariots** by association to mean the sound of the hoofbeats of the horses that pull Sisera’s chariots. Alternate translation: “Why do I not yet hear the sound of the hoofbeats of the horses that pull his chariots?”
5:29	xa2n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	חַכְמ֥וֹת שָׂרוֹתֶ֖י⁠הָ	1	The song is using the adjective **wise** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “Her wisest princesses”
5:29	mw32		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אַף־הִ֕יא תָּשִׁ֥יב אֲמָרֶ֖י⁠הָ לָֽ⁠הּ	1	This is a common expression that means that Sisera’s mother answered her own question. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “she also answered her own question”

It may be helpful to make this more than one sentence. Alternate translation: “She told herself that Sisera and his soldiers must be searching the battlefield for plunder and dividing it up. Each soldier, she thought, must be claiming a woman or two as concubines. She also thought that the soldiers must each be finding one or two dyed, embroidered robes that they could wear”
5:30	l98i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֲ⁠לֹ֨א יִמְצְא֜וּ יְחַלְּק֣וּ שָׁלָ֗ל	1	Sisera’s mother is using the question form for emphasis. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “Certainly they are finding and dividing spoil”
5:30	j225		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	לְ⁠רֹ֣אשׁ גֶּ֔בֶר	1	This expression uses one part of a **warrior**, his **head**, to mean the warrior himself. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “for each warrior”
5:30	j226		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לְ⁠סִ֣יסְרָ֔א	1	Sisera’s mother is probably using the name **Sisera** by association to mean the soldiers in his army. She is probably not saying that only one or two expensive robes will be found among all the plunder and that Sisera personally will get those. Alternate translation: “for Sisera’s soldiers”
5:30	p9nz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	צְבָעִ֖ים רִקְמָ֑ה	1	This phrase expresses a single idea by using two words implicitly connected with **and**. The word **embroidery** indicates how these **dyed fabrics** have been made even more luxurious. Alternate translation: “embroidered dyed fabrics”
5:30	j227		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לְ⁠צַוְּארֵ֥י שָׁלָֽל	1	Sisera’s mother is using the term **spoil** by association to mean the soldiers who are collecting this plunder after the battle. Alternate translation: “for the necks of the soldiers collecting this plunder”

If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “for the soldiers to wear who are collecting this plunder”
5:31	j229		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	וְ⁠אֹ֣הֲבָ֔י⁠ו	1	The song is speaking about Yahweh in the third person after addressing him in the second person. It may be more natural in your language to translate this phrase in the second person as well. Alternate translation: “But may those who love you be”
5:31	bi4x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	כְּ⁠צֵ֥את הַ⁠שֶּׁ֖מֶשׁ בִּ⁠גְבֻרָת֑⁠וֹ	1	The **strength** of the sun could be its brightness or its heat. So the point of this comparison may be that just as the sun, once it rises, is too bright to look at or so hot that people must get out of its rays into the shade, so no one will be able to resist those who love Yahweh. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “irresistibly strong, like the unbearable brightness of the risen sun” or “irresistibly strong, like the unbearable heat of the risen sun”
5:31	j230		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks	כְּ⁠צֵ֥את הַ⁠שֶּׁ֖מֶשׁ בִּ⁠גְבֻרָת֑⁠וֹ	1	This is the end of the song that Deborah and Barak sang. (In the next sentence, the author resumes the story.) If you began the song with an opening first-level quotation mark or similar opening convention, indicate its ending here with a closing first-level quotation mark or similar closing convention. If you have been using special formatting to set off the song as poetry, resume regular formatting with the next sentence.

This is why they refused to help Gideon. By allying themselves with the Midianites, they aligned themselves against Yahweh. Because of this, Gideon treated them like he treated the Midianites. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])\n\n### Gideon refuses to be king\n\nGideon said to them, “I will not rule over you, neither will my son rule over you. Yahweh will rule over you.” Although the book of Deuteronomy anticipates a king in Israel, it was sinful for Israel to desire to have a king. He did though take a share of everyone’s plunder as a king would have done through taxes. This may serve as a warning to Israel about their desire to have a king.
