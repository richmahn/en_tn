# Take the silver plunder ... Nineveh's beautiful things

# Take the silver plunder, take the gold plunder

The word "plunder" means things stolen by force, usually in war. AT: "Take the silver as plunder, take the gold as plunder" or "Take the silver, take the gold"

# there is no end to it

The words "no end" are an exaggeration to express that there is a great amount of something. AT: "there is so much of it" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

This phrase refers to the silver, gold, and other treasures in Nineveh. The verb may be supplied from the previous phrase. AT: "there is no end to the splendor of all Nineveh's beautiful treasures" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
