This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "The attackers make ready the large shield to protect themselves" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# The large shield

This refers to a large cover that those who besieged a city would set up over themselves and their battering rams to protect themselves against the arrows and other projectiles with which the people in the city would attack them.
