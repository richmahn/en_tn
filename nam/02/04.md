# The chariots speed through the streets

"The soldiers drive the chariots wildly through the streets"

# They look like torches

Nahum compares the way that the light from the sun reflects upon the chariots with torches whose fire gives light. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# they run like lightning

Nahum compares the way that the light from the sun reflects upon the chariots, and the quickness with which the chariots move, with lightning that flashes quickly in the sky. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
