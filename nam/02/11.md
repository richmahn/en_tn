## lion's den ##

Nineveh is being compared to a lion's den because it is a place where killers live and a place where they bring back what they have stolen from the people they have killed. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## strangled ##

"choked." Lions bite their victims' throats to prevent them from breathing.

## filled his cave with victims and his dens with his prey ##

These two phrases are saying the same thing in different ways. A lion's den would be in a cave and the prey are the animal victims the lion has killed. "filled his home with those he has killed" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
