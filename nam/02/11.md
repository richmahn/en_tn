## translationNotes

* **lion's den** - Nineveh is being compared to a lion's den because it is a place where killers live and a place where they bring back what they have stolen from the people they have killed. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **strangled** - "choked." Lions bite their victims' throats to prevent them from breathing.
* **filled his cave with victims and his dens with his prey** - These two phrases are saying the same thing in different ways. A lion's den would be in a cave and the prey are the animal victims the lion has killed. "filled his home with those he has killed" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
