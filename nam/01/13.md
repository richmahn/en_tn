# Now will I break that people's yoke from off you; I will break your chains

Yahweh speaks of freeing Judah from Assyrian oppression as if he were breaking the yoke and chains that the Assyrians had placed on them. AT: "Now I will free you from that people and they will no longer oppress you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
