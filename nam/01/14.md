# I will cut off the carved figures and the cast metal figures from the houses of your gods

Yahweh speaks of destroying the Assyrian idols as if he were cutting them off, like a person would cut a branch from a tree. The word "house" is a metonym for the temples in which the people worshiped these idols. Alternate translation: "I will destroy the carved figures and the cast metal figures that are in the temples of your gods" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# I will dig your graves

It is implied that Yahweh will also bury them in the graves that he digs for them. Alternate translation: "I will dig your graves and bury you in them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
