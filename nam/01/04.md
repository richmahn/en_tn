# General Information:

Nahum continues to describe Yahweh coming to judge his enemies and to save his people.

# Bashan is weak, and Carmel also; the flowers of Lebanon are weak

The word translated as "weak" can also mean "wither" or "dry out." Bashan was known for its good pastureland where people tended sheep and cattle, "Carmel" refers to Mount Carmel, which was known for its tree orchards, and the snow from the mountains in Lebanon kept that place fertile. Since Yahweh dries up all the rivers and causes drought, these fertile places will no longer be fertile. AT: "The fields of Bashan wither, the trees of Mount Carmel die, and the flowers of Lebanon fade" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
