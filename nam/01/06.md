# General Information:

Nahum continues to describe Yahweh coming to judge his enemies and to save his people.

# Who can stand before his wrath? Who can resist the fierceness of his anger?

These two rhetorical questions mean basically the same thing. They can be translated with statements. Alternate translation: "No one can stand before his wrath! No one can resist the fierceness of his anger!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# fierceness of his anger

"intensity of his anger" or "amount of his anger"

# His wrath is poured out like fire

Nahum speaks of Yahweh's anger as if it were a liquid that he pours out and which burns like fire. This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "He pours out his wrath like fire" or "He expresses his fierce anger" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the rocks are broken apart by him

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "he breaks apart the rocks" or "he causes the rocks to break apart" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
