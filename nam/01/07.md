# a stronghold ... those who take refuge in him

Nahum speaks of Yahweh as if he were a place where people can be safe from those who wish to harm them, and of those who trust Yahweh to protect them as if they were taking refuge inside that safe place. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# in the day of trouble

"in times of trouble" or "when troubles happen." The word "day" here refers to a general period of time.
