# No healing is possible for your wounds. Your wounds are severe

Nahum speaks of the certainty of the destruction of Nineveh and the defeat of its king as if the king had suffered an incurable wound. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# No healing is possible for your wounds

The word "healing" can be translated with a verbal phrase. Alternate translation: "No one is able to heal your wounds" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# Who has escaped your constant wickedness?

This rhetorical question emphasizes the negative answer that it anticipates. All of the nations that were near Assyria had suffered because of Assyria's constant wickedness. Alternate translation: "No one has escaped your constant wickedness." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
