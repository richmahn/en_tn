* **corpses** - bodies of people who have died
* **There is no end of the bodies** - "There are many bodies" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
* **beautiful prostitute...expert in witchcraft** - As prostitutes sell physical pleasure and witches sell knowledge and power gained through magic, the people of Nineveh sell people they have taken in war and take profit from their sin. (See:[[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
