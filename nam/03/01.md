# General Information:

Nahum often wrote prophecy in the form of poetry. Hebrew poetry uses different kinds of parallelism. Here he continues to describe the destruction of Nineveh. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# the city full of blood

Here the word "blood" represents bloodshed and refers to the people who have committed murder. Alternate translation: "the city full of murderers" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# It is all full of lies

Here the word "lies" is a metonym for those who tell lies. Alternate translation: "It is full of liars" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
