# I will raise up your skirt over your face and show your private parts to the nations

This refers to the practice of publicly humiliating prostitutes by stripping them naked in front of the community. This continues the metaphor of Yahweh speaking of the city of Nineveh as if it were a prostitute. AT: "I will publicly humiliate you, as one would humiliate a prostitute by raising up her skirt over her face and showing her private parts to all the people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# your shame to the kingdoms

This phrase explains the purpose of lifting up Nineveh's skirt. The verb may be supplied from the previous phrase. AT: "I will show your shame to the kingdoms" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
