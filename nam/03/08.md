Nahum speaks to the people of Nineveh as though they were the city itself. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe]])

## are you better than Thebes...? ##

AT: "you are not better than Thebes...." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## Thebes ##

the former capital of Egypt, which the Assyrians had conquered

## whose defense was the ocean, whose wall was the sea itself ##

The Nile River surrounded Thebes and made attacking it difficult. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## defense...wall ##

Ancient cities had a main "wall" to keep attackers out, and an outer line of "defense" to keep attackers from the wall.

## ocean...sea ##

If these words are the same in your language, use a general term for a large body of water for "sea."
