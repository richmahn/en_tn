## translationNotes

* Nahum speaks to the people of Nineveh as though they were the city itself. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_apostrophe]])
* **It will devour you like the locusts** - there will be nothing left. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
* **It** - the "fire" and "sword"
* **Multiply yourselves like locusts, like grasshoppers** - "Multiply yourself like locusts! Multiply yourself like grasshoppers!" These words seem to go more with [[:en:bible:notes:nam:03:16]] than with 3:15.
* **Multiply...like locusts** - This means they would become a very large city with many people and destroy many lands. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
