Nahum speaks to the people of Nineveh as though they were the city itself. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe]])

## It will devour you like the locusts ##

there will be nothing left. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

## It ##

the "fire" and "sword"

## Multiply yourselves like locusts, like grasshoppers ##

"Multiply yourself like locusts! Multiply yourself like grasshoppers!" These words seem to go more with [Nahum 3:16](./16.md) than with 3:15.

## Multiply...like locusts ##

This means they would become a very large city with many people and destroy many lands. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
