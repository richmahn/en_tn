Conquest of the land of Canaan (1:1–12:24)\n    * Preparation for conquest; spies; crossing the Jordan River (1:1–5:1)\n    * Ceremonies at Gilgal; conquest of Jericho and Ai (5:2–8:29)\n    * The covenant affirmed at Shechem (8:30–35)\n    * Southern and central campaigns; northern campaigns (9:1–12:24)\n1. Settlement in the Promised Land; division of the land (13:1–22:34)\n1. Joshua’s final days (23:1–24:33)\n\n### What is the Book of Joshua about?\n\nThe Book of Joshua is about the Israelites entering and occupying the Promised Land. Joshua was the leader that replaced Moses. He led the Israelites as they fought the people living in the Promised Land. This book also tells how the Israelites divided the land among the twelve tribes. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/promisedland]])\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nThis book traditionally has the title “Joshua” because Joshua leads the people of Israel after Moses dies. Translators may create a title such as “The Book About When Joshua Led Israel.” Translators should avoid a title that suggests Joshua as the writer of the book.\n\n### Who wrote the Book of Joshua?\n\nThe book does not tell who wrote it. However, some verses in the book indicate that Joshua may have written at least part of it. Since ancient times, Jews have thought that Joshua wrote most of the book.\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### How does the Book of Joshua present the cause of historical events?\n\nIn the ancient Near East, people assumed that gods caused world events to happen in a certain way. The Book of Joshua has some similarities with this view, but there are important differences. The events in the Book of Joshua occurred because Yahweh promised the Israelites that he would give them the Promised Land. What happened also depended on whether or not the Israelites obeyed Yahweh.\n\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\n\n### What does the phrase “to this day” mean?\n\nThis phrase was used by the writer to refer to the time when he was writing. The translator should be aware that “to this day” refers to a time already passed. He must avoid giving the impression to readers that “to this day” means “to the present day.” The translator might decide to say “to this day, at the time when this was being written,” or “to this day, at the time of writing.” This Hebrew phrase occurs in Joshua 4:9; 6:25; 7:26; 8:28, 29; 10:27; 13:13; 14:14; 15:63; 16:10.\n\n### What does the phrase “all Israel” mean?\n\nThis phrase appears many times in the Book of Joshua, but it does not always mean every person in the nation of Israel. At times it means the Israelite army. At other times it means the representatives of the twelve tribes of Israel. In still other passages, it probably means a large number of the people in the nation of Israel.\n\n### When should Joshua be translated?\n\nThe Book of Joshua should probably not be translated before Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. This is because the historical events of Joshua will not be understood without the information in these previous books.
1:intro	r7gc				0	# Joshua 1 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter appears to be a natural continuation of the book of Deuteronomy.\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Be strong and Courageous\n\nJoshua is often told, “Be strong and courageous.” This repeated encouragement is on purpose and may indicate Joshua will need help in the future.\n\n### Crossing the Jordan River\n\nIn this chapter the words **crossing over** refer to going to the opposite bank of the Jordan River.\n\n### The settling of the the Promised Land by the people of Israel\n\nJoshua [1:12-15](../01/12.md) records that the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and half of the tribe of Manasseh settled on the east side of the Jordan River but that God required the fighting men from these three tribes to accompany the rest of the Israelites to the west side of the Jordan River and help them fight against the people who lived in the land.
1:1	s8u5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	וַ⁠יְהִ֗י	1	The author is using this phrase to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event.
1:1	eka2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	נ֔וּן	1	The word **Nun** is the name of a man, Joshua’s father.
1:2	le23		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	וְ⁠עַתָּה֩	1	The phrase translated as **And now** is an expression that people of this time used to introduce the main business of a message. If your language has a comparable expression that it uses for this same purpose, you can use it in your translation. Alternate translation: “So here is what I want you to do:”
1:2	xugz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ק֨וּם	1	Yahweh is using the expression **arise** to tell Joshua to take action and lead the Israelites across the Jordan River to begin the conquest of Canaan. He is not telling him to get out of bed or stand up from a seated position. Alternate translation: “get going”
1:2	o0hj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	לִ⁠בְנֵ֥י יִשְׂרָאֵֽל	1	As the General Introduction to Joshua discusses, here and in many places throughout the book, **sons** means “descendants,” so the phrase **sons of** is describing a people group. Alternate translation: “to the people of Israel”
1:2	ragw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	לָ⁠הֶ֖ם לִ⁠בְנֵ֥י יִשְׂרָאֵֽל	1	Since Joshua is one of the **sons of Israel**, Yahweh is referring to him in the third person when he says **them**. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could have Yahweh refer to him in the second person. This would indicate explicitly that Joshua is included in this promise. Alternate translation: “to you and the rest of the sons of Israel” or “to you and all of the other people of Israel”
1:3	t94e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	כָּל־מָק֗וֹם אֲשֶׁ֨ר תִּדְרֹ֧ךְ כַּֽף־רַגְלְ⁠כֶ֛ם בּ֖⁠וֹ	1	Yahweh is using part of each of the Israelites, **the sole of your foot**, to represent the people of Israel themselves. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your culture or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Every place that you will tread upon”
1:3	xjc9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	רַגְלְ⁠כֶ֛ם…לָ⁠כֶ֣ם	1	Here, the words **your** and **you** are plural and refer to Joshua and all the other Israelite people. It may be more natural in your language to use a plural form of **foot** and to indicate specifically that **you** is plural. Alternate translation: “your feet … to all of you”
1:3	v1l7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture	לָ⁠כֶ֣ם נְתַתִּ֑י⁠ו	1	Yahweh is using the past tense in order to refer to something that he will do in the future. He is doing this to show that the event will certainly happen. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use the future tense. Alternate translation: “I will give it to you” or “I will certainly give it to you”
1:4	xqnb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	הַ⁠נָּהָ֧ר הַ⁠גָּד֣וֹל נְהַר־ פְּרָ֗ת	1	The phrase **the Great River** is another name for **the Euphrates River**. Alternate translation: “the Great River, that is, the Euphrates River”
1:4	nffx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הַ⁠יָּ֥ם הַ⁠גָּד֖וֹל	1	The phrase **the Great Sea** is another name for the Mediterranean Sea. You could clarify that for your readers if that would be helpful. Alternate translation: “the Great Sea, that is, the Mediterranean Sea”
1:4	pust		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	מְב֣וֹא הַ⁠שָּׁ֑מֶשׁ	1	Yahweh is using **the going of the sun**, that is, the sunset, by association to mean the west, since the sun sets in the west. Alternate translation: “in the west”
1:4	nbe3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	גְּבוּלְ⁠כֶֽם	1	Here, the word **your** is plural and refers to the tribes of Israel and includes Joshua. Alternate translation: “the territory of you Israelites”
1:5	l58e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	לֹֽא & אִישׁ֙	1	Since the book of Joshua describes how the kings of cities and kingdoms led their soldiers into battle to oppose Joshua, the phrase **No man** seems implicitly to mean “No king and his army” or more broadly “No people group.” If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “No king and his army” or “No people group.”
1:5	rk2g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	יִתְיַצֵּ֥ב & לְ⁠פָנֶ֔י⁠ךָ	1	In this context, the word **stand** means “resist” or “withstand.” The phrase **to your face** either means “in front of you,” with **face** meaning by association the area in front of Joshua, or “against you,” with part of Joshua, his **face**, representing all of him. You could indicate this overall meaning explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “will be able to resist you”
1:5	w48w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	לְ⁠פָנֶ֔י⁠ךָ & חַיֶּ֑י⁠ךָ & עִמָּ֔⁠ךְ & אַרְפְּ⁠ךָ֖ & אֶעֶזְבֶֽ⁠ךָּ	1	As the General Notes to this chapter discuss,  the words **you** and **your** are singular in this verse and through verse 9, since they refer to Joshua. So use singular forms in your translation if your language marks that distinction.
1:5	iq2e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	לֹ֥א אַרְפְּ⁠ךָ֖ וְ⁠לֹ֥א אֶעֶזְבֶֽ⁠ךָּ	1	The words **abandon** and **leave** mean basically the same thing. Yahweh combines them to emphasize that he will not do these things. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. It may be more natural in your language to use a positive statement to do that. Alternate translation: “I will not ever abandon you” or “I will certainly stay with you always”
1:6	a5yc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	חֲזַ֖ק וֶ⁠אֱמָ֑ץ	1	The phrases **Be strong** and **be courageous** mean similar things. Yahweh is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “Be very courageous”
1:6	gn34		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	לַ⁠אֲבוֹתָ֖⁠ם	1	Here, **fathers** means “ancestors” and refers specifically to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “to their forefathers” or “to their forefathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob”
1:7	xle4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	חֲזַ֨ק וֶֽ⁠אֱמַ֜ץ מְאֹ֗ד	1	These are the same two phrases that occurred in the previous verse, except the word **very** is added here for increased emphasis. See how you translated the phrase “Be strong and be courageous” in the previous verse and consider how you might add even more emphasis here. Alternate translation: “Be entirely courageous”
1:7	fi6s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אַל־תָּס֥וּר מִמֶּ֖⁠נּוּ	1	Yahweh is speaking as if **the law that Moses … commanded** were literally a road that Joshua was walking on and as if Joshua might **turn aside from** it and walk on a different path. He means that Joshua must not stop living in the manner in which God commanded in the law. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Do not stop obeying it”
1:7	db9m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	יָמִ֣ין וּ⁠שְׂמֹ֑אול	1	Yahweh is speaking of two things in order to mean them and everything in between. Continuing the image of the road, he means that Joshua should not go off the road in any direction. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “in any way”
1:8	g4qg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לֹֽא־יָמ֡וּשׁ סֵפֶר֩ הַ⁠תּוֹרָ֨ה הַ⁠זֶּ֜ה מִ⁠פִּ֗י⁠ךָ	1	Yahweh is using the phrase **shall not depart from your mouth** by association to mean that Joshua must continually read the **book of the law**, since people at this time read out loud, even when reading alone, so Joshua would use his mouth to form the words as he read. (However, this is not a command to read only alone. It envisions that Joshua might at times read the law aloud to the people of Israel.) Alternate translation: “You shall not stop reading this book of the law”
1:8	vu2t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	יוֹמָ֣ם וָ⁠לַ֔יְלָה	1	Yahweh is referring to the two main components of time, **day** and **night**, to mean “all the time.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “continually”
1:8	lcs7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	תַּצְלִ֥יחַ אֶת־דְּרָכֶ֖⁠ךָ וְ⁠אָ֥ז תַּשְׂכִּֽיל	1	The phrases **you will make your ways prosperous** and **you will succeed** mean similar things. Yahweh is using the two phrases together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “you will assuredly be successful”
1:8	k618		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	תַּצְלִ֥יחַ אֶת־ דְּרָכֶ֖⁠ךָ	1	Yahweh is speaking of Joshua’s **ways** as if they were a living thing that Joshua could **make … prosperous**. Yahweh is speaking of Joshua’s actions as if they were **ways** or roads that he was walking on. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “you will prosper in what you do”
1:9	vt4l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֲ⁠ל֤וֹא צִוִּיתִ֨י⁠ךָ֙	1	Yahweh is using the question form for emphasis. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “ “Surely I have commanded you!”
1:9	fnz8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	חֲזַ֣ק וֶ⁠אֱמָ֔ץ	1	See how you translated these same phrases in [1:6](../01/06.md). Alternate translation: “Be very courageous”
1:9	vwe1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	אַֽל־ תַּעֲרֹ֖ץ וְ⁠אַל־ תֵּחָ֑ת כִּ֤י עִמְּ⁠ךָ֙ יְהוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֔י⁠ךָ בְּ⁠כֹ֖ל אֲשֶׁ֥ר תֵּלֵֽךְ	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “Since Yahweh your God is with you in every place where you go, do not be terrified and do not be dismayed”
1:9	u820		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	אַֽל־תַּעֲרֹ֖ץ וְ⁠אַל־תֵּחָ֑ת	1	The phrases **Do not be terrified** and **do not be dismayed** mean similar things. Yahweh combines them to emphasize that Joshua must not be afraid. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “Make sure that you are not terrified” or “There is absolutely no reason for you to be terrified”
1:9	f8qm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	עִמְּ⁠ךָ֙ יְהוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֔י⁠ךָ	1	Here Yahweh speaks about himself in the third person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this with the first person. Alternate translation: “I, Yahweh your God, am with you”
1:11	f3rg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	וְ⁠צַוּ֤וּ אֶת־ הָ⁠עָם֙ לֵ⁠אמֹ֔ר הָכִ֥ינוּ לָ⁠כֶ֖ם צֵידָ֑ה כִּ֞י בְּ⁠ע֣וֹד ׀ שְׁלֹ֣שֶׁת יָמִ֗ים אַתֶּם֙ עֹֽבְרִים֙ אֶת־ הַ⁠יַּרְדֵּ֣ן הַ⁠זֶּ֔ה לָ⁠בוֹא֙ לָ⁠רֶ֣שֶׁת אֶת־ הָ⁠אָ֔רֶץ אֲשֶׁר֙ יְהוָ֣ה אֱלֹֽהֵי⁠כֶ֔ם נֹתֵ֥ן לָ⁠כֶ֖ם לְ⁠רִשְׁתָּֽ⁠הּ	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “command the people to prepare provisions for themselves because within three days they will be crossing over this Jordan to enter to possess the land that Yahweh their God is giving to them to possess it”   If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “command the people to pepare provisions for themselves because within three days they will be crossing over this Jordan to enter to possess the land that Yahweh their God is giving to them to possess it”
1:11	ck8h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	בְּ⁠ע֣וֹד׀ שְׁלֹ֣שֶׁת יָמִ֗ים	1	Here Joshua was counting the current day as day one. This was the way that Jewish people counted days. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “in two days from now” or “on the day after tomorrow”
1:13	dgxd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	זָכוֹר֙ אֶת־הַ⁠דָּבָ֔ר אֲשֶׁ֨ר	1	Joshua did not think that the people from these three tribes had forgotten what Moses had instructed them. Rather, he is using the word **Remember** to cause them to pay attention to what he is going to say next. If you would not use the word **Remember** for this purpose you could use an equivalent expression or indicate the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “You know the word that” or “You remember the word that” or “Keep in mind the word that”
1:13	ylv8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אֶת־הַ⁠דָּבָ֔ר	1	Here, **word** represents what Moses had said to Joshua using words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your language or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the instructions” or “the words”
1:13	jquc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	אֶתְ⁠כֶ֛ם…אֱלֹהֵי⁠כֶם֙…לָ⁠כֶ֔ם…לָ⁠כֶ֖ם	1	Every occurrence of the words **your** and **you** in this verse are plural and refer to Joshua and the Israelites.
1:13	l5qn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	מֵנִ֣יחַ לָ⁠כֶ֔ם	1	The phrase **give rest** is an idiom that refers to living peacefully and settling down in the land after Israel defeated its enemies. If your readers would not understand this, you could use an equivalent idiom or use plain language. Alternate translation: “cause you to live peacefully”
1:14	vefn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וּ⁠מִקְנֵי⁠כֶם֒	1	Here, the word translated as **livestock** refers to cows, sheep, and goats. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “and your cows and sheep and goats”
1:14	d575		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אֲחֵי⁠כֶ֗ם	1	Here, the word **brothers** means “fellow Israelites” and refers to the Israelites from the other tribes of Israel. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “your fellow Israelites”
1:14	rk3h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	גִּבּוֹרֵ֣י הַ⁠חַ֔יִל	1	The phrase **the mighty men of valor** refers to the men who were fighting age, over 20 years old. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “the men of fighting age”
1:14	u212		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	גִּבּוֹרֵ֣י הַ⁠חַ֔יִל	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **valor**, you could express the same idea with an adjective or in some other way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “the mighty men who are valiant” 
1:15	b5yt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אֲשֶׁר־יָנִ֨יחַ & לַֽ⁠אֲחֵי⁠כֶם֮	1	The phrase **gives rest** refers to living peacefully and settling down in the land after Israel defeated its enemies. It has the same meaning as the phrase **give rest** in [1:13](../01/13.md). See how you translated that phrase there.
1:15	f85b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	 לַֽ⁠אֲחֵי⁠כֶם֮ 	1	See how you translated the word **brothers** in the previous verse where it is used with the same meaning.
1:18	zhz1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	כָּל־אִ֞ישׁ	1	Although the term **man** is masculine, the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh are using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a phrase that makes this clear. Alternate translation: “Every person”
1:18	rel4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	כָּל־אִ֞ישׁ אֲשֶׁר־יַמְרֶ֣ה אֶת־פִּ֗י⁠ךָ וְ⁠לֹֽא־יִשְׁמַ֧ע אֶת־דְּבָרֶ֛י⁠ךָ לְ⁠כֹ֥ל אֲשֶׁר־תְּצַוֶּ֖⁠נּוּ יוּמָ֑ת	1	These two phrases mean basically the same thing and emphasize that any form of disobedience will be punished. The phrase **rebels against your mouth** and the phrase **will not hear your words** mean basically the same thing. The Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh are the same thing twice, in slightly different ways, to emphasize that they will **put to death** anyone who rebels against what Joshua commands. If saying the same thing twice might be confusing for your readers, you can combine the phrases into one and show the emphasis in a way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “We will surely put to death every man who rebels against what you instruct us to do”
1:18	mxi0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	יַמְרֶ֣ה אֶת־פִּ֗י⁠ךָ וְ⁠לֹֽא־יִשְׁמַ֧ע אֶת־דְּבָרֶ֛י⁠ךָ	1	The speakers are using the words **mouth** and **words** and associating them with the instructions or commands that Joshua would speak with his **mouth** using **words**.

1:18	lbc3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	יוּמָ֑ת	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, the context implies indicates that the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh will do it. Alternate translation: “we will put to death”
1:18	m66s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	יוּמָ֑ת	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **death**, you could express the same idea with an active verb or in some other way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “we will kill”

In your translation, you may wish to relate these events in the order in which they happened and put the information in this verse after the quotation from Rahab in [2:21](../02/21.md). Alternatively, you could indicate that what the author says here anticipates what happens a little later in the story.

4:intro	eh7p				0	# Joshua 4 General Notes\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### God’s war\nThe conquering of the Promised Land was a special war. It was God’s war against the people of Canaan and Joshua recognized that they would only be victorious through Yahweh’s power. This is why their first act after crossing the Jordan River was to build an altar. This war was a witness to Yahweh’s power. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/promisedland]])\n\n### Crossing the Jordan River\n\nIn this chapter the words **crossing over** refer to going to the opposite bank of the Jordan River.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Chiasm\n\nHebrew poetry sometimes uses a literary a device called a “chiasm” (sometimes called “chiasmus”). A chiasm is when words or phrases are ordered in a AB-BA sequence. In [Joshua 4:7](../04/07.md) Joshua uses a chiasm. The ULT follows the Hebrew order and translates the part of this verse that contains a chiasm as “Because **the waters of the Jordan were cut off from the face of the Box of the Covenant of Yahweh** when **it crossed over in the Jordan**, **the waters of the Jordan were cut off**. (The repeated phrases are highlighted for the purpose of illustration). Notice that the identical phrase “the waters of the Jordan were cut off” is repeated and the phrase “it crossed over in the Jordan” refers to the same thing as the phrase “from the face of the Box of the Covenant of Yahweh” because the word “it” refers to “the Box of the Covenant of Yahweh.” These phrase are repeated in an AB-BA sequence: “the waters of the Jordan were cut off-from the face of the Box of the Covenant of Yahweh...it crossed over in the Jordan-the waters of the Jordan were cut off.”

You could convert the Hebrew day and month into an approximate date on the calendar that your culture uses. However, the Jews used a lunar calendar, so if you use a solar calendar, the date will be different every year and the translation will not be entirely accurate. So you may just want to give the number of the day and the name of the month on the Hebrew calendar. You say approximately what time of year that is on your calendar in a footnote, for example, “The ‘first month’ was the month of Aviv, which is in the spring of the year, in March and April on Western calendars.” Alternate translation: “on the tenth day of the month of Aviv”

5:intro	dv8f				0	# Joshua 5 General Notes\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Circumcision\n\nIt would have been very unusual to be circumcised in a time of war. When men are circumcised they are unable to move without pain or to defend themselves in battle for several days. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/circumcise]])\n\n### Manna\n\nYahweh stops providing manna in this chapter and will no longer provide them with their daily allotment of food. This does not mean Yahweh’s care and provision will stop.
5:1	wpev		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-endofstory	וַ⁠יְהִ֣י	1	The author is using this phrase to introduce what happened at the end of the story of the Israelites crossing the Jordan River. Your language may have its own way of presenting such information.

5:1	iokv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠יִּמַּ֣ס לְבָבָ֗⁠ם וְ⁠לֹא־הָ֨יָה בָ֥⁠ם עוֹד֙ ר֔וּחַ	1	See how you translated the similar expressions in [2:11](../02/11.md). Alternate translation: “then they became very afraid in their hearts and they were not able to resist”
5:2	uwpn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	בָּ⁠עֵ֣ת הַ⁠הִ֗יא	1	The author is using this phrase to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event.
5:2	nc87		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	חַֽרְב֣וֹת צֻרִ֑ים	1	The word **flint** describes a type of hard stone. If your readers would not be familiar with this type of stone, you could use the name of something similar in your area or you could use a more general term. Alternate translation: “knives of sharpened stone” or “knives with blades made of stone”
5:2	j017		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	וְ⁠שׁ֛וּב מֹ֥ל	1	Yahweh is expressing a single idea by using two verbs together. The verb **return** tells in what way he wants Joshua to **circumcise** the Israelite men. Alternate translation: “again circumcise”
5:2	glk7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠שׁ֛וּב מֹ֥ל אֶת־ בְּנֵֽי־ יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל שֵׁנִֽית	1	This does not mean that these men had already been circumcised once and that Yahweh wanted Joshua to circumcise each of them for a **second time**. Rather, as [5:4](../05/04.md) explains, the previous generation of male Israelites had been circumcised, but they had died in the wilderness; the current generation of Israelite males had not yet been circumcised. Alternate translation: “and do a second general circumcision of all Israelite males, for this generation”
5:2	d7tg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal	שֵׁנִֽית	1	If your language does not use ordinal numbers, you can use a cardinal number here or an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “for time number two”
5:3	m1u7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	 וַ⁠יָּ֨מָל֙	1	There were over 600,000 males, so the author is using **Joshua**, who was in charge of this task, to represent the many people who were necessarily involved. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “And he and other Israelite leaders circumcised”
5:3	jin6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate	גִּבְעַ֖ת הָ⁠עֲרָלֽוֹת	1	**Gibeath Haaraloth** is the name that the Israelites gave to the place where they held this second general circumcision ceremony. The name commemorates the Israelites rededicating themselves to Yahweh. In your translation you could spell it the way it sounds in your language, or you could use a word or phrase from your language that expresses the meaning of this name. Alternate translation: “the Hill of the Foreskins”
5:4	i17c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	הַ⁠יֹּצֵא֩ & בְּ⁠צֵאתָ֖⁠ם	1	In a context such as this, your language may say “having gone” and “in their going out” rather than **having come** and **in their coming out**. Use whichever is more natural, here and in the next two verses.

If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a connecting word or phrase on the first clause rather than on the second one. Alternate translation: “while all of the people having come out were circumcised, all the people born”
5:5	b06g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	מֻלִ֣ים הָי֔וּ כָּל־ הָ⁠עָ֖ם הַ⁠יֹּֽצְאִ֑ים	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “someone had circumcised all the people who came out”
5:5	mqv5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הָ⁠עָ֖ם & הָ֠⁠עָם	1	In this verse, the expression **the people** means “the males.” If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “the males … the males”
5:5	mhgs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/ writing-pronouns	לֹא־ מָֽלוּ	1	Here, **they** is an indefinite pronoun that does not have a specific referent in the immediate context. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this with a different expression that does not use an indefinite pronoun. Alternate translation: “had not been circumcised” or “no one had circumcised”
5:6	jre1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	אַרְבָּעִ֣ים שָׁנָ֗ה הָלְכ֣וּ בְנֵֽי־ יִשְׂרָאֵל֮ בַּ⁠מִּדְבָּר֒ עַד־ תֹּ֨ם כָּל־ הַ⁠גּ֜וֹי אַנְשֵׁ֤י הַ⁠מִּלְחָמָה֙ הַ⁠יֹּצְאִ֣ים מִ⁠מִּצְרַ֔יִם אֲשֶׁ֥ר לֹֽא־ שָׁמְע֖וּ בְּ⁠ק֣וֹל יְהוָ֑ה	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “because they had not listened to the voice of Yahweh, the sons of Israel had walked in the wilderness 40 years, until the finishing of all of the nation of the men of war having come out from Egypt”
5:6	qbbd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הַ⁠גּ֜וֹי אַנְשֵׁ֤י הַ⁠מִּלְחָמָה֙ 	1	The author seems to be speaking as if these **men of war** were a **nation** of their own. In this language and culture, people sometimes used the term “nation” to mean “army,” as in [Joel 1:6](../jol/01/06.md), for example. Alternate translation: “the men of war in the army”
5:6	u9iz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	לֹֽא־שָׁמְע֖וּ בְּ⁠ק֣וֹל יְהוָ֑ה	1	Here, the word **listened** means “obeyed.” If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “they had not obeyed the voice of Yahweh”
5:6	k8wl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לֹֽא־שָׁמְע֖וּ בְּ⁠ק֣וֹל יְהוָ֑ה	1	The author is using the **voice** of Yahweh by association to mean the things that Yahweh commanded by using his voice. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “had not obeyed what Yahweh commanded them” or “had not done what Yahweh told them to do”
5:6	mu8b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	לַֽ⁠אֲבוֹתָ⁠ם֙	1	The author is using the term **fathers** to mean “ancestors.” If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “to their ancestors”
5:6	o55f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	לָ֔⁠נוּ	1	The author is addressing his listeners directly by saying **us**. Since the original listeners were Israelites, **us** would have been inclusive if he had marked that form. However, unless your readers are Israelites, they would not be included in the promises described here, which Yahweh made to Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their descendants. So it might be more natural in your language to use the exclusive form if your language marks that distinction. Decide as a team how to translate this.
5:6	jrp7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אֶ֛רֶץ זָבַ֥ת חָלָ֖ב וּ⁠דְבָֽשׁ	1	Yahweh spoke of the land being good for animals and plants as if the **milk** and **honey** from those animals and plants were actually **flowing** through the land. If this metaphor makes sense in your language, you may translate it. If your language has metaphors that mean a land is good for producing healthy livestock and good crops, you may consider using those. If neither is the case, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “a fertile land that produces many good things”
5:7	p9pz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	אֹתָ֖⁠ם מָ֣ל יְהוֹשֻׁ֑עַ כִּי־ עֲרֵלִ֣ים הָי֔וּ כִּ֛י לֹא־ מָ֥לוּ אוֹתָ֖⁠ם בַּ⁠דָּֽרֶךְ	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could rearrange these three phrases so that each phrase gives the reason for the result that the next phrase describes. Alternate translation: “Because they had not circumcised them on the way, they were uncircumcised. So Joshua circumcised them.”
5:7	j004		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	עֲרֵלִ֣ים הָי֔וּ כִּ֛י לֹא־ מָ֥לוּ אוֹתָ֖⁠ם	1	See how you translated the similar expressions in [5:5](../05/05.md). Alternate translation: “no one had circumcised them yet; no one had done this` on the way”
5:8	gl0s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit 	תַּ֥מּוּ כָל־ הַ⁠גּ֖וֹי לְ⁠הִמּ֑וֹל	1	The author is using the term * nation** as in [5:6](../05/06.md), to refer specifically to the Israelite males. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “all of the Israelite males had finished being circumcised”
5:8	j005		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	תַּ֥מּוּ כָל־ הַ⁠גּ֖וֹי לְ⁠הִמּ֑וֹל	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “when the leaders had finished circumcising all of the Israelite males”
5:9	x1q8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	גַּלּ֛וֹתִי אֶת־ חֶרְפַּ֥ת מִצְרַ֖יִם מֵ⁠עֲלֵי⁠כֶ֑ם	1	Yahweh is speaking as if he had actually **rolled away** the **disgrace of Egypt** from the Israelites. If it would be clearer in your language, you could use an equivalent idiom or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I have removed the disgrace of Egypt from you”
5:9	sgya		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	גַּלּ֛וֹתִי אֶת־ חֶרְפַּ֥ת מִצְרַ֖יִם מֵ⁠עֲלֵי⁠כֶ֑ם	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **disgrace**, you could express the same idea in another way. See the discussion of this phrase in the General Notes to this chapter. Alternate translation: “I have taken you out of the disgraceful situation you were in as former slaves of the Egyptians”
5:9	j001		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	וַ⁠יִּקְרָ֞א שֵׁ֣ם הַ⁠מָּק֤וֹם הַ⁠הוּא֙ גִּלְגָּ֔ל	1	It might seem that the expression **calls the name** contains extra information that would be unnatural to express in your language. If so, you can shorten it. Alternate translation: “people call that place Gilgal” or “the name of that place has been Gilgal”
5:9	bb23		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	עַ֖ד הַ⁠יּ֥וֹם הַ⁠זֶּֽה	1	See how you translated the idiom **unto this day** in [4:9](../04/09.md). Alternate translation: “right up to this time”

(The expression **the month** refers implicitly to the “first month” or the Hebrew month Aviv, as in [4:19](../04/19.md). Alternate translation: “on the fourteenth day of the month of Aviv”
5:11	g1ks		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וְ⁠קָל֑וּי	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “and grain that they had roasted”
5:13	ced7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	 וַ⁠יְהִ֗י	1	The author is using this phrase to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event.
5:13	hegq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠יִּשָּׂ֤א עֵינָי⁠ו֙ וַ⁠יַּ֔רְא	1	The author is using a common expression to mean that Joshua looked some distance away, since he **lifted up his eyes** in order to do this and he had to walk over to the man whom he saw. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “that he looked off into the distance”
5:13	x26s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	וְ⁠הִנֵּה	1	The author is using the term **behold** to focus attention on what happens next in this story. Your language may have a comparable expression that you could use in your translation.

In that culture, this action was a way that a person showed great respect and reverence for someone else. If there is a gesture with similar meaning in your culture, you could consider using it here in your translation. You could also explain the significance of the gesture; the UST models one way to do that.
5:14	j018		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	מָ֥ה אֲדֹנִ֖⁠י מְדַבֵּ֥ר אֶל־ עַבְדּֽ⁠וֹ	1	As a way of showing respect, Joshua is speaking to the prince of Yahweh’s army and about himself in the third person.

Alternate translation: “Because the place that you are standing on is holy, slip off your sandal from upon your foot”
5:15	ge5y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	שַׁל־נַֽעַלְ⁠ךָ֙ מֵ⁠עַ֣ל רַגְלֶ֔⁠ךָ	1	Joshua removing his **sandal** was a symbolic action by which he showed great respect and reverence towards someone superior and acknowledged his willingness to obey him.

5:15	j006		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	 נַֽעַלְ⁠ךָ֙	1	The prince of Yahweh’s is not referring to one particular **sandal** that Joshua was wearing. He means both of Joshua’s sandals. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using a plural form. Alternate translation: “your sandals”
6:intro	uie9				0	# Joshua 6 General Notes\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Yahweh conquers\n\nIt was God, not the army, who gave them victory. It is said, “Shout! For Yahweh has given you the city.” The circumstances of Israel’s victory in the battle for Jericho were very unusual. It was never common to march around a city or to shout in order to win a military battle. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

The author is using them together for emphasis. See the further discussion in the General Notes to this chapter. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine them. Alternate translation: “The rulers of Jericho were so afraid of the Israelites that they had shut the city gates so that no one could enter, and they had shut up the people inside so that no one could leave”
6:1	jq71		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וּ⁠מְסֻגֶּ֔רֶת	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “And the rulers had also shut up the people inside”
6:2	qfoa		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	רְאֵה֙	1	Yahweh is speaking as if he wants Joshua to **See** or look at something.

Alternate translation: “Pay attention”
6:2	j65i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture	נָתַ֣תִּי 	1	Yahweh is using the past tense in order to refer to something that he will do in the future. He is doing this to show that the event will certainly happen. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use the future tense. Alternate translation: “I am about to give” or “I will certainly give”
6:2	v4hu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	 נָתַ֣תִּי בְ⁠יָֽדְ⁠ךָ֔ אֶת־יְרִיח֖וֹ	1	Here, **hand** represents by association the control or power that a person would have over something.

Alternate translation: “I have delivered Jericho to your control” or “I have allowed you to conquer Jericho”
6:2	djup		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	גִּבּוֹרֵ֖י הֶ⁠חָֽיִל	1	Yahweh is leaving out a word that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could supply the word from the context. Alternate translation: “and the mighty men of valor” or “along with the mighty men of valor”
6:2	km13		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	גִּבּוֹרֵ֖י הֶ⁠חָֽיִל	1	See how you translated the phrase **mighty men of valor** in [1:14](../01/14.md). Alternate translation: “the valiant warriors”
6:3	fu9e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	פַּ֣עַם אֶחָ֑ת 	1	The context implies that they were to walk around the city **one time** each day. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “one time each day”
6:5	j007		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	בִּ⁠מְשֹׁ֣ךְ ׀ בְּ⁠קֶ֣רֶן הַ⁠יּוֹבֵ֗ל 	1	Yahweh is using this possessive form to mean the **horn** that makes a **blast**.

6:5	oe7s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הָ⁠עָ֖ם & הָ⁠עָ֖ם	1	In this context, the phrase **the people** refers to the Israelite soldiers. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “the soldiers … the soldiers”
6:5	zdc7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠עָל֥וּ הָ⁠עָ֖ם	1	Here, the phrase **go up** refers to climbing up over the collapsed pieces of the walls to get into the city.

6:5	ukux		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אִ֥ישׁ נֶגְדּֽ⁠וֹ	1	Yahweh is using a common expression to mean that each of the soldiers in the army that is encircling the city should rush into the part of it that is directly in front of him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “each soldier going into the part of the city that is in front of him”
6:7	jf9o		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	עִבְר֖וּ & יַעֲבֹ֕ר	1	The phrase **pass over** is a common expression that indicates walking or moving forward. If it would be clearer in your language, you could use an equivalent idiom or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Start walking & will walk”
6:7	g18m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	 וְ⁠הֶ֣⁠חָל֔וּץ	1	To translate this term here and in verse 9, see how you translated the similar expression in [4:12](../04/12.md). Alternate translation: “and the soldiers with their weapons”

6:8	l35d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לִ⁠פְנֵ֣י יְהוָ֔ה	1	As the last sentence in this verse makes clear, the author is using the name **Yahweh** by association to mean **the Box of the Covenant of Yahweh**, since it represents Yahweh’s presence with the people of Israel. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “in front of the Box of the Covenant of Yahweh”
6:8	ayf9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַֽ⁠אֲרוֹן֙ בְּרִ֣ית יְהוָ֔ה הֹלֵ֖ךְ אַחֲרֵי⁠הֶֽם	1	The author does not mean that **the Box of the Covenant of Yahweh** was **going** by itself. Priests were carrying it. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “And the priests carrying the Box of the Covenant of Yahweh went behind them”
6:9	gch6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אַחֲרֵ֣י הָ⁠אָר֔וֹן	1	Here again, it is implied that priests were carrying **the Box**. Alternate translation: “behind the Box, which priests were carrying”
6:9	i5vh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	הָל֖וֹךְ וְ⁠תָק֥וֹעַ בַּ⁠שּׁוֹפָרֽוֹת	1	The author is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete.

6:10	v7ib		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הָ⁠עָם֩	1	As in [6:5](../06/05.md), the phrase **the people** refers to the Israelite soldiers. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “the Israelite soldiers”

Joshua says the same thing three times, in slightly different ways, to emphasize to the Israelite soldiers and priests that they must remain completely silent until he gives them the command, **Shout!** If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine the phrases into one and show the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “ “You must remain completely silent” or “You must remain absolutely quiet”
6:10	tc4f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	י֣וֹם	1	Joshua is using the term **day** to refer to a specific time. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the time when”
6:11	hf4m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יַּסֵּ֤ב אֲרוֹן־יְהוָה֙ אֶת־הָ⁠עִ֔יר	1	Here, the word **he** refers to Joshua. It is implied that Joshua did not carry the **Box of Yahweh** around Jericho himself but rather instructed the priests do it. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “And the priests brought the box of Yahweh around the city”
6:13	lxf4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-reduplication	הֹלְכִ֣ים הָל֔וֹךְ	1	The author is repeating the verb **walking** in order to intensify the idea that it expresses. If your language can repeat words for intensification, it would be appropriate to do that here in your translation. If not, your language may have another way of expressing the emphasis. Alternate translation: “were walking continually”
6:13	wjy6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	הָל֖וֹךְ וְ⁠תָק֥וֹעַ בַּ⁠שּׁוֹפָרֽוֹת	1	The author is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete.

6:13	qp0v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys 	הָל֖וֹךְ וְ⁠תָק֥וֹעַ בַּ⁠שּׁוֹפָרֽוֹת	1	The author may be expressing a single idea by using two words connected with **and**. While the priests actually were **walking** and **blowing on the shofars** at the same time, the word **walking** might be describing in what way the priests were **blowing**, that is, continually. Alternate translation: “blowing continually on the shofars”
6:14	j232		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal	בַּ⁠יּ֤וֹם הַ⁠שֵּׁנִי֙	1	If your language does not use ordinal numbers, you could use cardinal numbers here. Alternate translation: “on day two”

6:15	bgwj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	כַּ⁠עֲל֣וֹת הַ⁠שַּׁ֔חַר	1	The author is using the word **dawn** by association to mean the sun.

6:16	sc3s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	 הָ⁠עָם֙ 	1	As in [6:5](../06/05.md) and [6:10](../06/10.md), the phrase **the people** refers to the Israelite soldiers. Alternate translation: “the Israelite soldiers”
6:16	fj73		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture	נָתַ֧ן יְהוָ֛ה לָ⁠כֶ֖ם אֶת־הָ⁠עִֽיר	1	Joshua is using the past tense in order to refer to something that Yahweh will do in the future. He is doing this to show that the event will certainly happen. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use the future tense. See how you translated the similar expression in [6:2](../06/02.md). Alternate translation: “Yahweh is about to give the city to you” or “Yahweh will certainly give the city to you”
6:17	a98e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הַ⁠חֵ֔רֶם	1	To decide how to translate the term **devoted** here, in the next verse, and in verse 21, see the discussion in the General Introduction to Joshua. Also see how you translated the term in [2:10](../02/10.md). Alternate translation: “something that we must destroy completely”

Alternate translation: “Because she hid the messengers whom we sent, only Rahab the prostitute will live, she and all who are with her in the house”

So use plural forms in your translation if your language marks that distinction.
6:19	j019		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	קֹ֥דֶשׁ ה֖וּא	1	Since Joshua has just described a list of things, it may be more natural in your language to use the pronoun “they” rather than **it**. Alternate translation: “they are holy things”
6:20	fm69		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַֽ⁠יִּתְקְע֖וּ & וַֽ⁠יִּלְכְּד֖וּ	1	In its first instance, the pronoun **they** refers to the priests.

If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “including all the people who lived there, regardless of their age or sex”
6:21	hmkk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	מִ⁠נַּ֖עַר וְ⁠עַד־זָקֵ֑ן	1	The author is using the adjectives **young** and **old** as nouns in order to describe groups of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate these words with noun phrases. Alternate translation: “from young people to old people”
6:21	cf5x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	לְ⁠פִי־חָֽרֶב	1	The author is speaking of **the sword** as if it were a living thing that had a **mouth** and could eat. This is probably a reference to the way a sword cuts into a person as if it were an animal biting him. An idea implicit in this personification is that when a sword eats, it devours everything. So this expression means “to the degree that the sword devours,” in other words, “completely.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “destroying it completely”

In your translation, you may wish to relate these events in the order in which they happened. Alternate translation: “Since you swore to the woman, the prostitute, that you would do this, enter her house and bring out from there the woman and all who are to her”
6:22	d0fw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	הָ⁠אִשָּׁ֣ה הַ⁠זּוֹנָ֑ה	1	Joshua is using the phrase **the woman, the prostitute** to reintroduce Rahab as a participant in the story. If your language has its own way of reintroducing participants, you can use it here in your translation.
6:22	krqs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual	נִשְׁבַּעְתֶּ֖ם	1	Since Joshua is speaking to two men, **you** would be dual if your language uses that form. Otherwise, it would be plural.

He means that these sons will die at the beginning and ending of the rebuilding. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers.

7:1	v6rb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry	וַ⁠יִּמְעֲל֧וּ בְנֵֽי־ יִשְׂרָאֵ֛ל מַ֖עַל	1	For emphasis, the author is using a construction in which a verb and its object come from the same root. You may be able to use the same construction in your language to express the meaning here. Alternatively, your language may have another way of showing the emphasis. The idea is that one Israelite did something secret and deceptive that was a betrayal of the trust that Yahweh had placed in all of the Israelites. Alternate translation: “But the sons of Israel deceptively betrayed Yahweh”
7:1	mtm4			בַּ⁠חֵ֑רֶם & הַ⁠חֵ֔רֶם	1	To decide how to translate the term **devoted** in its two instances here and throughout this chapter, see the discussion in the General Introduction to Joshua.

You could also use plain language. Alternate translation: “the anger of Yahweh”
7:1	j020		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וַ⁠יִּֽחַר	1	The author is speaking as if the **nose** of Yahweh, representing his anger, had actually **burned**. He mans that it became very intense.

7:2	si6l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	עֲל֖וּ & וַֽ⁠יַּעֲלוּ֙ הָ⁠אֲנָשִׁ֔ים	1	As the General Notes to this chapter discuss,  the expressions **Go up** and **went up** indicate that the Israelite spies had to move upward in elevation in order to spy out Ai.

There may be an equivalent word or expression in your language that you can use in your translation to convey this strong feeling. If not, you could specify that Gideon said this because he was feeling fear. Alternate translation: “Oh, no! My Lord Yahweh!” or “I am afraid, my Lord Yahweh!”

If you must state who did the action, the previous verse indicates that Yahweh is the one who will “take” or catch the person who stole the devoted things, and the context implies that the Israelites are the ones who are supposed burn the one who took the banned things. Alternate translation: “you shall burn with fire the one Yahweh catches with the devoted thing”

Alternate translation: “and about 5 pounds of silver and one wedge of gold whose weight was a little over a pound” or “and 200 pieces of silver weighing over two kilograms and a wedge of gold that weighed about half a kilogram”

7:21	u41u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	תַּחְתֶּֽי⁠הָ	1	Since Achan is saying that the **silver** is beneath the **coat** and the **gold**, it may be more natural in your language to use a plural pronoun here. Alternate translation: “under them”

7:23	s59g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	לִ⁠פְנֵ֥י יְהוָֽה	1	This could mean: (1) “where Yahweh could see them.” The idea is not that Yahweh did not know before where they were; he told Joshua in [7:11](../07/11.md) that an Israelite had stolen some of the devoted things and hidden them. Rather, the idea is that this was public evidence that the Israelites had found the wrongdoer and would punish him as Yahweh had told them to. Alternate translation: “where Yahweh could see them” (2) “in front of the tent of meeting.” The phrase could be a description of where the Israelites **poured … out** the silver coins, coat, and gold wedge. The author would be using the name **Yahweh** by association to mean the place where his presence was. But this would also indicate that these things were serving as conclusive evidence against Achan. Alternate translation: “in front of the tent of meeting”
7:24	j009		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠כָל־ יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל עִמּ֑⁠וֹ	1	This phrase does not mean that Joshua also brought **all Israel** to the Valley of Achor when he brought Achan there. It means that Joshua and **all Israel with him** brought Achan and his family and possessions to the Valley of Achor. Be sure that this is clear in your translation. The UST models one way to do that.
7:24	ta3l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate	עֵ֥מֶק עָכֽוֹר	1	The word **Achor** is the name of a valley. In your translation, you could spell it the way it sounds in your language, or you could use a word or phrase from your language that expresses the meaning of this name. As the next two verses explain, the word means “trouble,” and the Israelites gave that name to the valley on this occasion. Alternate translation: “to the Valley of Trouble”
7:25	vd6n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	מֶ֣ה עֲכַרְתָּ֔⁠נוּ	1	Joshua is using the question form to rebuke Achan.

8:intro	f3jc				0	# Joshua 8 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Sin brought defeat\n\nIt was great sin to take what was to be destroyed. Because of their sin, Yahweh withheld victory from the Israelites. Sin resulted in defeat in battle. Because they repented, Yahweh brought victory to Israel in Ai. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/repent]])\n\n### Built an altar\n\nAltars were commonly built in the Ancient Near East to commemorate important events. Several altars were built in the Book of Joshua.

Yahweh is using them together to emphasize that Joshua and the Israelite soldiers must not be afraid. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase.

He is doing this to show that the event will certainly happen. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use the future tense. Alternate translation: “I am about to give into your hand” or “I will certainly give into your hand”

8:5	zlt5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	בָּ⁠רִֽאשֹׁנָ֔ה	1	Joshua is using the adjective **first** as a noun. Your language may use adjectives in the same way.

For a discussion of why [8:3](../08/03.md) says that Joshua sent 30,000 men to lie in ambush while this verse says that he sent **about 5,000 men**, see the General Notes to this chapter. 
8:13	x0cl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/ writing-endofstory	Quote	1	The first sentence in this verse is a summary statement for 8:3–12. Use a natural form in your language for a summary statement at the end of one section of a story. Be sure that it is clear that this is a summary and not a description of a further action.
8:14	a0rv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	כִּ⁠רְא֣וֹת מֶֽלֶךְ־ הָ⁠עַ֗י	1	The author does not say specifically what the king of Ai **saw**. This could mean: (1) that the king saw Joshua. The author has just said that Joshua went and spent the night in the valley near Ai, and the king may have seen him in the morning and concluded that this was the main force of the Israelite army and that he could attack and destroy it. Alternate translation: “as soon as the king of Ai saw Joshua” (2) that the king saw that the Israelite army north of the city. This could be a more general reference to the king seeing that the Israelites had set up their main camp to the north of the city. Alternate translation: “as soon as the king saw the Israelite army”
8:14	kov9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	וַֽ⁠יְמַהֲר֡וּ וַ⁠יַּשְׁכִּ֡ימוּ	1	This phrase expresses a single idea by using two words connected with **and**. The word **hurried** tells in what way the men of the city **got up early**. Alternate translation: “Then … quickly got up early”

8:16	lcb5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וַ⁠יִּזָּעֲק֗וּ כָּל־הָ⁠עָם֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר ב⁠עיר	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “And the king summoned all of the people who were in the city”
8:16	k8ff		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	כָּל־הָ⁠עָם֙	1	In this context, the phrase **the people** refers to the men who were able to fight. It is clear from [8:24](../08/24.md) that other people remained in the city. Alternate translation: “all of the fighting men”
8:16	yt5n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וַ⁠יִּנָּתְק֖וּ	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “and this drew them away”

Alternate translation: “And every man in Ai and Bethel went out after Israel”
8:17	zip6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אִ֗ישׁ	1	Here, the term **man** refers specifically to the men who were able to fight. They left these two cities to pursue the Israelite army. Older men and those unable to fight because of some physical disability probably did not leave these cities. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “a man of fighting age” or “a man who could fight”
8:17	gnnz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וּ⁠בֵ֣ית אֵ֔ל	1	The statement that the fighting men of **Bethel** also pursued the Israelites implicitly suggests that Bethel and Ai were allied cities. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly.  Alternate translation: “or in its allied city of Bethel”

You should retain this action in your translation. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate its meaning in footnote.
8:19	cyya		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	וְ⁠הָ⁠אוֹרֵ֡ב קָם֩ מְהֵרָ֨ה מִ⁠מְּקוֹמ֤⁠וֹ וַ⁠יָּר֨וּצוּ֙	1	The word **ambush** is a singular noun that refers to a group of people acting together. That is why the pronoun **they** is plural. If your language does not use singular nouns in this way, you could describe this **ambush** as a group. Alternate translation: “And the Israelite soldiers who were hiding themselves rose quickly from their place, and they ran”
8:19	brnr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	וַֽ⁠יְמַהֲר֔וּ וַ⁠יַּצִּ֥יתוּ	1	This phrase expresses a single idea by using two words connected with **and**.

8:20	lcmy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	וְ⁠הִנֵּ֨ה	1	The author is using the term **behold** to focus attention on what happens next in this story. Your language may have a comparable expression that you could use in your translation.
8:20	vvzs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וְ⁠לֹא־הָיָ֨ה בָ⁠הֶ֥ם יָדַ֛יִם לָ⁠נ֖וּס הֵ֣נָּה וָ⁠הֵ֑נָּה	1	Here, **hand** represents the capability of a person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or state the meaning plainly. This statement seems to introduce the action that the author describes in the rest of this verse and in the next two verses, in which the soldiers from Ai and Bethel become surrounded by the Israelite soldiers. Alternate translation: “and it was not possible for them to flee here or there”
8:20	d2dq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	הֵ֣נָּה וָ⁠הֵ֑נָּה	1	The author is speaking of two things in order to mean them and everything in between. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “anywhere”
8:22	mxej		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	 וְ⁠אֵ֨לֶּה יָצְא֤וּ מִן־הָ⁠עִיר֙ לִ⁠קְרָאתָ֔⁠ם וַ⁠יִּֽהְי֤וּ לְ⁠יִשְׂרָאֵל֙ בַּ⁠תָּ֔וֶךְ	1	The pronoun **these** refers to the Israelite soldiers who had been hiding and who had just set the city of Ai on fire. The pronoun **them** refers to the Israelite soldiers who had openly attacked Ai and then pretended to flee, who had just turned around to attack their enemies. The pronoun **they** refers to the soldiers who had come out of the cities of Ai and Bethel. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “And the Israelite soldiers who had been hiding and who had just set the city of Ai on fire came out from the city to meet the Israelite soldiers who had just turned around to attack, so the soldiers who had come out of the cities of Ai and Bethel were in the midst of Israel”
8:22	dlr1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וַ⁠יִּֽהְי֤וּ לְ⁠יִשְׂרָאֵל֙ בַּ⁠תָּ֔וֶךְ אֵ֥לֶּה מִ⁠זֶּ֖ה וְ⁠אֵ֣לֶּה מִ⁠זֶּ֑ה	1	The author is using the term **Israel** by association to the Israelite army. It is not significant which instance of **here** refers to which body of Israelite soldiers, the one coming from the city or the one coming back from the wilderness. Alternate translation: “so they were in the midst of Israelite soldiers, some coming at them from one direction and others coming at them from the other direction”
8:22	s1lu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יַּכּ֣וּ אוֹתָ֔⁠ם עַד־ בִּלְתִּ֥י הִשְׁאִֽיר־ ל֖⁠וֹ	1	After referring to the Israelite soldiers as **they** and the soldiers from Ai and Bethel as **them**, the author then refers to the Israelites as **he** and to their enemies as **him**. This probably reflects the use earlier in the verse of the singular term **Israel** to represent the Israelite soldiers. It may be more natural in your language to use plural pronouns throughout this sentence. Alternate translation: “And they struck them until they left to them no survivor or fugitive”
8:24	dura		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish	בַּ⁠שָּׂדֶ֗ה בַּ⁠מִּדְבָּר֙	1	By using the terms **field** and **wilderness** together, the author could be: (1) giving further information about where **the field** was located. Alternate translation:  “in the field that was in the wilderness” (2) naming two locations where the Israelite army killed the soldiers from Ai and Bethel. Alternate translation: “in the field and in the wilderness”
8:24	xg2z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	 וַֽ⁠יִּפְּל֥וּ כֻלָּ֛⁠ם לְ⁠פִי־חֶ֖רֶב עַד־תֻּמָּ֑⁠ם וַ⁠יָּשֻׁ֤בוּ כָל־יִשְׂרָאֵל֙ הָ⁠עַ֔י וַ⁠יַּכּ֥וּ אֹתָ֖⁠הּ לְ⁠פִי־חָֽרֶב	1	See how you translated the phrase “to the mouth of the sword” in [6:21](../06/21.md). Alternate translation: “once they had killed every one of those soldiers and none were left, that all of Israel returned to Ai and killed everyone who was there”
8:24	uhnh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וַֽ⁠יִּפְּל֥וּ כֻלָּ֛⁠ם	1	The author is describing dying in battle by association with the word the word **fallen**, since soldiers who die in battle fall to the ground and die. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “and all of them had been killed” or “and all of them had died”

8:25	s6hq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	כֹּ֖ל אַנְשֵׁ֥י הָ⁠עָֽי	1	While the terms **man** and **woman** earlier in the verse have a specific sense, the masculine term **men** here has a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use language in your translation here that is clearly inclusive of both men and women. Alternate translation: “the entire population of the city”
8:26	gcgu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes	וִ⁠יהוֹשֻׁ֨עַ֙ לֹֽא־ הֵשִׁ֣יב יָד֔⁠וֹ	1	The author is expressing a positive meaning by using a negative word together with a term that is the opposite of the action he wishes to emphasize. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “And Joshua continued holding out his hand”

What follows the word **However** is in contrast to what the Israelites did to the inhabitants of Ai in the previous verse. Use a natural form in your language for introducing a contrast. Alternate translation: “By contrast, Israel did plunder for themselves the livestock and the spoil of that city”
8:27	agn1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	כִּ⁠דְבַ֣ר יְהוָ֔ה	1	The author is using the term **word** to represent what Yahweh commanded by using words.

8:28	nq1b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	שְׁמָמָ֔ה	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **desolation**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “a desolate place”

8:29	yq50		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	עַ֖ד הַ⁠יּ֥וֹם הַ⁠זֶּֽה	1	The author is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete. If it would be clearer in your language, you could supply these words from the context. Alternate translation: “that remains until this day” or “that is still there at the present time”
8:30	isui		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential	אָ֣ז	1	The word **Then** indicates that the event the story will now relate came after the event it has just described. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could show this relationship by using a fuller phrase. Alternate translation: “After that” or “After raising a great pile of stones over the corpse of the king of Ai”
8:31	td7f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	כַּ⁠כָּתוּב֙ בְּ⁠סֵ֨פֶר֙ תּוֹרַ֣ת מֹשֶׁ֔ה	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “as the book of the law of Moses says” or “as Moses wrote in his book of the law”
8:31	ihwd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	אֲשֶׁ֛ר לֹֽא־ הֵנִ֥יף עֲלֵי⁠הֶ֖ן בַּרְזֶ֑ל 	1	The law is using the first part of a process to mean that entire process.

8:33	wd9u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	בָּ⁠רִאשֹׁנָֽה	1	The author is using the adjective **first** as a noun. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this adjective with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “when he first delivered the law”
8:34	vf71		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	הַ⁠כָּת֖וּב	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “that Moses had written”

8:35	ozlo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠הַ⁠נָּשִׁ֣ים וְ⁠הַ⁠טַּ֔ף וְ⁠הַ⁠גֵּ֖ר	1	The author is making clear that on this occasion, the **assembly of Israel** did not consist only of male representatives of tribes or clans or extended families, but that it also included **women** and **children** and **sojourners**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could indicate this explicitly in your translation. Alternate translation: “including all of the women and children and all of the sojourners”
9:intro	w1cx				0	# Joshua 9 General Notes\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Israel’s mistake\n\nIsrael was deceived because “they did not consult with Yahweh for guidance.” Instead of consulting Yahweh, they attempted to achieve victory under their own power. This was sinful. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])\n\n## Important Translation Issues\n\n### The Hivites\n\nIn [3:10](../03/10.md) the Israelites are given a list of the nations that they are told to “dispossess” from the land. This list includes the Hivites. In [9:1-2](../09/01.md) the author of Joshua records that when the kings on the west side of the Jordan River heard what the Israelites had done to Ai that they made an agreement to fight against the Israelites. The list in [9:2](../09/02.md) of kings that agreed to fight against the Israelites includes “the Hivite.” The author records in [9:3-4](../09/03.md) that when “those who dwelled in Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and to the Ai … they … acted with cunning.” The author then records in [9:7](../09/07.md) that those who dwelled in Gibeon were “Hivite.” The Hivite nation consisted of multiple people groups of whom the Gibeonites were just one. This is why the author could say in [9:1-2](../09/01.md) that among the kings who gathered to fight the Israelites were Hivites and also say that the Gibeonites were Hivites.
9:1	j010		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	וַ⁠יְהִ֣י	1	The author is using this phrase to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event.
9:1	j011		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	בְּ⁠עֵ֨בֶר הַ⁠יַּרְדֵּ֜ן	1	The description that follows indicates that by **the other side of the Jordan**, the author means the side opposite to the one from which the Israelites approached the land of Canaan. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “the west side of the Jordan River”
9:1	j022		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	הַֽ⁠חִתִּי֙ וְ⁠הָ֣⁠אֱמֹרִ֔י הַֽ⁠כְּנַעֲנִי֙ הַ⁠פְּרִזִּ֔י הַ⁠חִוִּ֖י וְ⁠הַ⁠יְבוּסִֽי	1	The author is not referring to specific individuals. He is describing the people groups that these **kings** ruled. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using plural forms. Alternate translation: “that is, the kings of the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites”
9:2	uj94		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	פֶּ֖ה אֶחָֽד	1	The author is using a common expression of his culture, **as one mouth**, to mean “by unanimous agreement.” (All the kings said the same thing, that they would fight the Israelites, so it was as if together they only had one mouth.) If it would be clearer in your language, you could use an equivalent idiom or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “by unanimous agreement”  
9:4	r5yb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	וַ⁠יַּעֲשׂ֤וּ גַם־ הֵ֨מָּה֙ בְּ⁠עָרְמָ֔ה 	1	The word **also** does not indicate that the other kings had acted **with cunning** and the people of Gibeon did the same. Rather, the idea is that the other kings acted by joining forces to fight the Israelites, and the people of Gibeon **also** acted, but **with cunning** rather than by fighting. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. “And they also took action, but unlike the other kings, they did not prepare to fight; they used cunning”
9:4	aktq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	בְּ⁠עָרְמָ֔ה	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **cunning**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “craftily” 
9:5	q9v6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	נִקֻּדִֽים	1	This word could mean (1) **moldy**, as in the ULT, here and in [9:12](../09/12.md). (2) **crumbs**. Alternate translation: “crumbs”
9:6	rz8e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	אִ֣ישׁ יִשְׂרָאֵ֗ל	1	The author is not referring to a specific **man**. He means the men **of Israel** in general and, as verses 15 and 18–21 indicate, most likely the leaders of Israel. Alternate translation: “the leaders of Israel”
9:6	uh11		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ⁠עַתָּ֖ה	1	See how you translated in [1:2](../01/02.md) this expression that people of this time used to introduce the main business of a message.
9:6	mo5f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	כִּרְתוּ־לָ֥⁠נוּ בְרִֽית	1	See the discussion of this phrase in the General Notes to this chapter. Alternate translation: “make a covenant with us”
9:7	m0h0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-genericnoun	אִֽישׁ־יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל	1	See how you translated the same expression in the previous verse. Alternate translation: “the leaders of Israel”
9:7	ojg7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-genericnoun	הַ⁠חִוִּ֑י	1	The author is not referring to a specific **Hivites**. He means the Gibeonite messengers, who were Hivites. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using a plural form. Alternate translation: “these Hivites”
9:7	t1r4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	וְ⁠אֵ֖יךְ אֶֽכְרָת־ לְ⁠ךָ֥ בְרִֽית 	1	The Israelite leaders are using the question form for emphasis. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “In that case, we could not cut a covenant with you!”
9:8	ki9n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	עֲבָדֶ֣י⁠ךָ אֲנָ֑חְנוּ	1	By saying **We are your servants**, the Gibeonites do not mean that they are willing to become slaves, such as they eventually do become in this episode. Rather, they are agreeing to let Joshua be their ruler. They mean implicitly that they will accept the terms he specifies, such as paying tribute. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “We are willing to serve you as our ruler”
9:9	mrhs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	מֵ⁠אֶ֨רֶץ רְחוֹקָ֤ה מְאֹד֙ בָּ֣אוּ עֲבָדֶ֔י⁠ךָ לְ⁠שֵׁ֖ם יְהוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֑י⁠ךָ	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “Because of the name of Yahweh your God, your servants have come from a very distant land”  
9:9	kvs5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	עֲבָדֶ֔י⁠ךָ	1	To show respect to Joshua, the Gibeonites are speaking about themselves in the third person. They are not assuming that he has already agreed to let them serve him as their ruler. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this in the first person. Alternate translation: “We, your servants”
9:9	yve3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לְ⁠שֵׁ֖ם יְהוָ֣ה	1	Here, as in [7:9](../07/09.md), Yahweh’s **name** represents his reputation. Alternate translation: “because of the reputation of Yahweh”
9:10	p9ed		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	בְּ⁠עַשְׁתָּרֽוֹת	1	The word **Ashtaroth** is the name of the capital city of **Bashan**. If you have already translated the book of Deuteronomy, see how you translated this name in [Deuteronomy 1:4](../01/04.md).
9:11	xd47		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	לֵ⁠אמֹ֗ר קְח֨וּ בְ⁠יֶדְ⁠כֶ֤ם צֵידָה֙ לַ⁠דֶּ֔רֶךְ וּ⁠לְכ֖וּ לִ⁠קְרָאתָ֑⁠ם וַ⁠אֲמַרְתֶּ֤ם אֲלֵי⁠הֶם֙	1	If your language would not use a direct quotation inside of a direct quotation, you could translate the second direct quotation as an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: “and told us to take provisions in our hand for the road and go to meet you and say to you”
9:11	hq3m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	בְ⁠יֶדְ⁠כֶ֤ם	1	The Gibeonites and their leaders were using one part of a person, his **hand**, to represent all of him in the act of bringing something with them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your culture or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “with you”
9:11	z823		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לַ⁠דֶּ֔רֶךְ	1	The people of Gibeon are speaking of the men’s journey by association with **the road** on which they would walk. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “for your journey”
9:11	i2n7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	קְח֨וּ בְ⁠יֶדְ⁠כֶ֤ם צֵידָה֙ לַ⁠דֶּ֔רֶךְ וּ⁠לְכ֖וּ לִ⁠קְרָאתָ֑⁠ם וַ⁠אֲמַרְתֶּ֤ם אֲלֵי⁠הֶם֙ עַבְדֵי⁠כֶ֣ם אֲנַ֔חְנוּ וְ⁠עַתָּ֖ה כִּרְתוּ־לָ֥⁠נוּ בְרִֽית	1	If your language would not use a third-level direct quotation (a quotation inside a quotation inside a quotation), you could translate this as an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: “that we were your servants and that we wanted you to cut a covenant with us”
9:12	bwk2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	הִנֵּ֣ה	1	In this context, the Gibeonites are using the term **behold** to mean that they want the Israelites to look at their bread. Alternate translation: “look at it”  
9:13	yyy2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	וְ⁠הִנֵּ֖ה	1	The Gibeonites are using the word **behold** here in the same way as in the previous verse. Alternate translation: “look at it”
9:13	np0h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	הַ⁠דֶּ֖רֶךְ	1	See how you translated the same expression in [9:11](../09/11.md). Alternate translation: “our journey”
9:14	c4ao		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יִּקְח֥וּ הָֽ⁠אֲנָשִׁ֖ים מִ⁠צֵּידָ֑⁠ם	1	This could mean: (1) that the Israelite leaders tasted the provisions of the Gibeonites to see whether they were old. Alternate translation: “And the Israelite leaders tasted their provisions” (2) that they **took** some of these provisions out of the Gibeonites’ baggage to examine them. Alternate translation: “And the Israelite leaders examined their provisions”  
9:14	o4z2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	פִּ֥י יְהוָ֖ה	1	The author is using Yahweh’s **mouth** to represent Yahweh himself in the act of guiding or giving counsel. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your culture or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Yahweh to guide them” or “Yahweh to counsel them”
9:15	v90y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	וַ⁠יַּ֨עַשׂ לָ⁠הֶ֤ם יְהוֹשֻׁ֨עַ֙ שָׁל֔וֹם	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **peace**, you could express the same idea with an adjective or in some other way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “And Joshua agreed that the Israelite people would have a peaceful relationship with the Gibeonite people”
9:16	kr1s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	וַ⁠יְהִ֗י	1	The author is using this phrase to introduce a new development in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new development.
9:16	t8q2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	מִ⁠קְצֵה֙ שְׁלֹ֣שֶׁת יָמִ֔ים	1	See how you translated the similar expression in [1:11](../01/11.md). Translate this in the way your own culture reckons time. Alternate translation: “a couple of days later”
9:16	hvn0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	וַֽ⁠יִּשְׁמְע֗וּ כִּי־ קְרֹבִ֥ים הֵם֙ אֵלָ֔י⁠ו וּ⁠בְ⁠קִרְבּ֖⁠וֹ הֵ֥ם יֹשְׁבִֽים	1	The phrases **they were near to them** and **they were dwelling among them** mean basically the same thing. The author says the same thing twice, in slightly different ways, to emphasize that the Gibeonites lived close to the Israelites. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine the phrases into one and show the emphasis in a way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “that they actually lived close to them!”  
9:17	s1u5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal	בַּ⁠יּ֣וֹם הַ⁠שְּׁלִישִׁ֑י	1	If your language does not use ordinal numbers, but your culture reckons the present day as day one, you could use a cardinal number here. Otherwise, see how you translated the similar expressions in [1:11](../01/11.md) and [9:16](../09/16.md).  Alternate translation: “on day three” or “after traveling for two days”
9:17	q18q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	וְ⁠הַ⁠כְּפִירָ֔ה וּ⁠בְאֵר֖וֹת וְ⁠קִרְיַ֥ת יְעָרִֽים	1	**Kephirah**, **Beeroth**, and **Kiriath Jearim** are the names of cities that were subject to the king of the city of Gibeon.

Alternate translation: “And because the leaders of the congregation had sworn to them by Yahweh the God of Israel, the sons of Israel did not strike them”
9:19	vrwa		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns	אֲנַ֨חְנוּ֙ נִשְׁבַּ֣עְנוּ	1	For emphasis, the **leaders** are stating a pronoun whose meaning is already present in the verb translated as **sworn**. If your language can state implied pronouns explicitly for emphasis, you may want to use that construction here in your translation. Other languages may have other ways of bringing out this emphasis. The ULT does so by using the intensive pronoun **ourselves**.
9:19	z1k2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	לֹ֥א נוּכַ֖ל לִ⁠נְגֹּ֥עַ בָּ⁠הֶֽם	1	In context such as this, the word translated as **touch** has the sense of “harm” or “kill.” In some languages, this may sound like an understatement for emphasis, and you could express the meaning that way. Alternate translation: “we cannot do the slightest thing to harm them”
9:20	ak2u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠לֹֽא־יִֽהְיֶ֤ה עָלֵ֨י⁠נוּ֙ קֶ֔צֶף	1	The leaders mean implicitly that they do not want the **wrath** of Yahweh to be **upon** them, that is, they do not want Yahweh to be angry with them and punish them for breaking their **oath**. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “so Yahweh will not be angry with us and punish us”
9:21	wg7n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	וַ֠⁠יִּֽהְיוּ חֹטְבֵ֨י עֵצִ֤ים וְ⁠שֹֽׁאֲבֵי־ מַ֨יִם֙ לְ⁠כָל־ הָ֣⁠עֵדָ֔ה 	1	Some versions treat this phrase as a continuation of what the leaders said to the congregation. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to make this part of the quotation from the leaders if it does. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to end the quotation before this phrase, as the ULT does.
9:22	ylp8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	לֵ⁠אמֹ֗ר רְחוֹקִ֨ים אֲנַ֤חְנוּ מִ⁠כֶּם֙ מְאֹ֔ד	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “saying that you are very far from us”
9:23	kam4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ⁠עַתָּ֖ה	1	See how you translated this expression, which introduces the main business of a communication, in [1:2](../01/02.md) and its other occurrences.
9:23	b8vf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	אֲרוּרִ֣ים אַתֶּ֑ם	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation, as in the UST: “Yahweh has cursed you”
9:23	f0kc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	וְ⁠לֹֽא־ יִכָּרֵ֨ת מִ⁠כֶּ֜ם עֶ֗בֶד וְ⁠חֹטְבֵ֥י עֵצִ֛ים וְ⁠שֹֽׁאֲבֵי־ מַ֖יִם 	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a positive expression to translate this double negative that consists of the negative particle **not** and the negative verb **cut off**, which in this context means “cease to be.” Alternate translation: “and each of you shall always be a slave who hews wood and draws water”
9:23	ozk4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וְ⁠לֹֽא־יִכָּרֵ֨ת מִ⁠כֶּ֜ם עֶ֗בֶד	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “And we will not cut off any of you from being a slave”
9:24	s17h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-reduplication	הֻגֵּ֨ד הֻגַּ֤ד לַ⁠עֲבָדֶ֨י⁠ךָ֙	1	The Gibeonites are repeating the verb **declared** in order to intensify the idea that it expresses. If your language can repeat words for intensification, it would be appropriate to do that here in your translation. If not, your language may have another way of expressing the emphasis. Alternate translation: “it was clearly declared to your servants”
9:24	wq4j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	כִּי֩ הֻגֵּ֨ד הֻגַּ֤ד לַ⁠עֲבָדֶ֨י⁠ךָ֙	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “people clearly declared to your servants”
9:24	mjzr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	לַ⁠עֲבָדֶ֨י⁠ךָ֙	1	To show respect to Joshua, the Gibeonites are speaking humbly about themselves in the third person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this in the first person. Alternate translation: “to us, your servants”
9:24	wuz9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	לָ⁠כֶם֙ & מִ⁠פְּנֵי⁠כֶ֑ם & מִ⁠פְּנֵי⁠כֶ֔ם	1	The first two instances of **your** are singular because the Gibeonites are addressing Joshua. The other two instances of **your** and the word **you** are plural because the Gibeonites are referring to the Israelites as a group. Use the corresponding forms in your translation if your language marks this distinction.
9:24	kbti		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	מִ⁠פְּנֵי⁠כֶ֔ם	1	The Gibeonites are using one part of the Israelite people, their **faces**, to represent all of them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your culture or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “because of you”
9:25	h9nz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ⁠עַתָּ֖ה	1	See how you translated the same expression in [9:23](../09/23.md).

9:25	im6m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בְ⁠יָדֶ֑⁠ךָ 	1	Here, the **hand** represents the power or control that a person has over someone or something. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “in your control” or “under your control”
9:25	a5un		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	כַּ⁠טּ֨וֹב וְ⁠כַ⁠יָּשָׁ֧ר	1	The terms **good** and **right** mean similar things. The author is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “as is most appropriate”
9:25	octw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בְּ⁠עֵינֶ֛י⁠ךָ	1	The Gibeonites are using the term **eyes** by association to mean sight. Sight, in turn, represents judgment and perspective. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “in your perspective” or “in your judgment”
9:26	zymn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	וַ⁠יַּצֵּ֥ל אוֹתָ֛⁠ם מִ⁠יַּ֥ד בְּנֵֽי־ יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל	1	The author is using one part of the **sons of Israel**, their **hand**, to represent all of them in the potential act of killing the Gibeonites. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “And he delivered them so that the sons of Israel did not kill them”
9:27	p81s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	עַד־הַ⁠יּ֣וֹם הַ⁠זֶּ֔ה	1	See how you translated the phrase **until this day** in [4:9](../04/09.md), where it occurs with the same meaning. Alternate translation: “right up to this time”

Specifically to help readers understand why [10:2](../10/02.md) says “The people of Jerusalem became very afraid” and why in [10:3-4](../10/03.md) King Adoni-Zedek sent a message to other kings requesting that they help him fight against the Israelites. Use the natural form in your language for expressing background information.

20:intro	vg5f				0	# Joshua 20 General Notes\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Cities of Refuge\n\nIf a person was killed, it was the duty of his relatives to kill the killer. If the death was an accident, this would be unfair. Therefore, God told the Israelites to make cities of refuge for a person who killed someone accidentally. In the city where he sought refuge, his case would be solved legally: “Do this so that one who unintentionally kills a person can go there. These cities will be a place of refuge from anyone who seeks to avenge the blood of a person who was killed.” (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/refuge]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/avenge]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/blood]])
