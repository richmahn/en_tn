Conquest of the land of Canaan (1:1–12:24)\n    * Preparation for conquest; spies; crossing the Jordan River (1:1–5:1)\n    * Ceremonies at Gilgal; conquest of Jericho and Ai (5:2–8:29)\n    * The covenant affirmed at Shechem (8:30–35)\n    * Southern and central campaigns; northern campaigns (9:1–12:24)\n1. Settlement in the Promised Land; division of the land (13:1–22:34)\n1. Joshua’s final days (23:1–24:33)\n\n### What is the Book of Joshua about?\n\nThe Book of Joshua is about the Israelites entering and occupying the Promised Land. Joshua was the leader that replaced Moses. He led the Israelites as they fought the people living in the Promised Land. This book also tells how the Israelites divided the land among the twelve tribes. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/promisedland]])\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nThis book traditionally has the title “Joshua” because Joshua leads the people of Israel after Moses dies. Translators may create a title such as “The Book About When Joshua Led Israel.” Translators should avoid a title that suggests Joshua as the writer of the book.\n\n### Who wrote the Book of Joshua?\n\nThe book does not tell who wrote it. However, some verses in the book indicate that Joshua may have written at least part of it. Since ancient times, Jews have thought that Joshua wrote most of the book.\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### How does the Book of Joshua present the cause of historical events?\n\nIn the ancient Near East, people assumed that gods caused world events to happen in a certain way. The Book of Joshua has some similarities with this view, but there are important differences. The events in the Book of Joshua occurred because Yahweh promised the Israelites that he would give them the Promised Land. What happened also depended on whether or not the Israelites obeyed Yahweh.\n\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\n\n### What does the phrase “to this day” mean?\n\nThis phrase was used by the writer to refer to the time when he was writing. The translator should be aware that “to this day” refers to a time already passed. He must avoid giving the impression to readers that “to this day” means “to the present day.” The translator might decide to say “to this day, at the time when this was being written,” or “to this day, at the time of writing.” This Hebrew phrase occurs in Joshua 4:9; 6:25; 7:26; 8:28, 29; 10:27; 13:13; 14:14; 15:63; 16:10.\n\n### What does the phrase “all Israel” mean?\n\nThis phrase appears many times in the Book of Joshua, but it does not always mean every person in the nation of Israel. At times it means the Israelite army. At other times it means the representatives of the twelve tribes of Israel. In still other passages, it probably means a large number of the people in the nation of Israel.\n\n### When should Joshua be translated?\n\nThe Book of Joshua should probably not be translated before Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. This is because the historical events of Joshua will not be understood without the information in these previous books.
1:intro	r7gc				0	# Joshua 1 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter appears to be a natural continuation of the book of Deuteronomy.\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Be strong and Courageous\n\nJoshua is often told, “Be strong and courageous.” This repeated encouragement is on purpose and may indicate Joshua will need help in the future.\n\n### Crossing the Jordan River\n\nIn this chapter the words **crossing over** refer to going to the opposite bank of the Jordan River.\n\n### The settling of the the Promised Land by the people of Israel\n\nJoshua [1:12-15](../01/12.md) records that the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and half of the tribe of Manasseh settled on the east side of the Jordan River but that God required the fighting men from these three tribes to accompany the rest of the Israelites to the west side of the Jordan River and help them fight against the people who lived in the land.
1:1	s8u5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	וַ⁠יְהִ֗י	1	The author is using this phrase to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event.
1:1	eka2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	נ֔וּן	1	The word **Nun** is the name of a man, Joshua’s father.
1:2	le23		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	וְ⁠עַתָּה֩	1	As the General Introduction to Joshua discusses, the phrase translated as **And now** is an expression that people of this time used to introduce the main business of a message. If your language has a comparable expression that it uses for this same purpose, you can use it in your translation, here and for the other instances of this expression in the book. Alternate translation: “So here is what I want you to do:”
1:2	xugz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ק֨וּם	1	Yahweh is using the expression **arise** to tell Joshua to take action and lead the Israelites across the Jordan River to begin the conquest of Canaan. He is not telling him to get out of bed or stand up from a seated position. Alternate translation: “get going”
1:2	o0hj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	לִ⁠בְנֵ֥י יִשְׂרָאֵֽל	1	As the General Introduction to Joshua discusses, here and in many places throughout the book, **sons** means “descendants,” so the phrase **sons of** is describing a people group. Alternate translation: “to the people of Israel”
1:2	ragw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	לָ⁠הֶ֖ם לִ⁠בְנֵ֥י יִשְׂרָאֵֽל	1	Since Joshua is one of the **sons of Israel**, Yahweh is referring to him in the third person when he says **them**. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could have Yahweh refer to him in the second person. This would indicate explicitly that Joshua is included in this promise. Alternate translation: “to you and the rest of the sons of Israel” or “to you and all of the other people of Israel”
1:3	t94e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	כָּל־מָק֗וֹם אֲשֶׁ֨ר תִּדְרֹ֧ךְ כַּֽף־רַגְלְ⁠כֶ֛ם בּ֖⁠וֹ	1	Yahweh is using part of each of the Israelites, **the sole of your foot**, to represent the people of Israel themselves. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your culture or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Every place that you will tread upon”
1:3	xjc9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	רַגְלְ⁠כֶ֛ם…לָ⁠כֶ֣ם	1	Here, the words **your** and **you** are plural and refer to Joshua and all the other Israelite people. It may be more natural in your language to use a plural form of **foot** and to indicate specifically that **you** is plural. Alternate translation: “your feet … to all of you”
1:3	v1l7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture	לָ⁠כֶ֣ם נְתַתִּ֑י⁠ו	1	Yahweh is using the past tense in order to refer to something that he will do in the future. He is doing this to show that the event will certainly happen. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use the future tense. Alternate translation: “I will give it to you” or “I will certainly give it to you”
1:4	xqnb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	הַ⁠נָּהָ֧ר הַ⁠גָּד֣וֹל נְהַר־ פְּרָ֗ת	1	The phrase **the Great River** is another name for **the Euphrates River**. Alternate translation: “the Great River, that is, the Euphrates River”
1:4	nffx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הַ⁠יָּ֥ם הַ⁠גָּד֖וֹל	1	The phrase **the Great Sea** is another name for the Mediterranean Sea. You could clarify that for your readers if that would be helpful. Alternate translation: “the Great Sea, that is, the Mediterranean Sea”
1:4	pust		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	מְב֣וֹא הַ⁠שָּׁ֑מֶשׁ	1	Yahweh is using **the going of the sun**, that is, the sunset, by association to mean the west, since the sun sets in the west. Alternate translation: “in the west”
1:4	nbe3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	גְּבוּלְ⁠כֶֽם	1	Here, the word **your** is plural and refers to the tribes of Israel and includes Joshua. Alternate translation: “the territory of you Israelites”
1:5	l58e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	לֹֽא & אִישׁ֙	1	Since the book of Joshua describes how the kings of cities and kingdoms led their soldiers into battle to oppose Joshua, the phrase **No man** seems implicitly to mean “No king and his army” or more broadly “No people group.” If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “No king and his army” or “No people group.”
1:5	rk2g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	יִתְיַצֵּ֥ב & לְ⁠פָנֶ֔י⁠ךָ	1	In this context, the word **stand** means “resist” or “withstand.” The phrase **to your face** either means “in front of you,” with **face** meaning by association the area in front of Joshua, or “against you,” with part of Joshua, his **face**, representing all of him. You could indicate this overall meaning explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “will be able to resist you”
1:5	w48w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	לְ⁠פָנֶ֔י⁠ךָ & חַיֶּ֑י⁠ךָ & עִמָּ֔⁠ךְ & אַרְפְּ⁠ךָ֖ & אֶעֶזְבֶֽ⁠ךָּ	1	As the General Notes to this chapter discuss,  the words **you** and **your** are singular in this verse and through verse 9, since they refer to Joshua. So use singular forms in your translation if your language marks that distinction.
1:5	iq2e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	לֹ֥א אַרְפְּ⁠ךָ֖ וְ⁠לֹ֥א אֶעֶזְבֶֽ⁠ךָּ	1	The words **abandon** and **leave** mean basically the same thing. Yahweh combines them to emphasize that he will not do these things. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. It may be more natural in your language to use a positive statement to do that. Alternate translation: “I will not ever abandon you” or “I will certainly stay with you always”
1:6	a5yc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	חֲזַ֖ק וֶ⁠אֱמָ֑ץ	1	The phrases **Be strong** and **be courageous** mean similar things. Yahweh is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “Be very courageous”
1:6	gn34		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	לַ⁠אֲבוֹתָ֖⁠ם	1	Here, **fathers** means “ancestors” and refers specifically to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “to their forefathers” or “to their forefathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob”
1:7	xle4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	חֲזַ֨ק וֶֽ⁠אֱמַ֜ץ מְאֹ֗ד	1	These are the same two phrases that occurred in the previous verse, except the word **very** is added here for increased emphasis. See how you translated the phrase “Be strong and be courageous” in the previous verse and consider how you might add even more emphasis here. Alternate translation: “Be entirely courageous”
1:7	fi6s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אַל־תָּס֥וּר מִמֶּ֖⁠נּוּ	1	Yahweh is speaking as if **the law that Moses … commanded** were literally a road that Joshua was walking on and as if Joshua might **turn aside from** it and walk on a different path. He means that Joshua must not stop living in the manner in which God commanded in the law. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Do not stop obeying it”
1:7	db9m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	יָמִ֣ין וּ⁠שְׂמֹ֑אול	1	Yahweh is speaking of two things in order to mean them and everything in between. Continuing the image of the road, he means that Joshua should not go off the road in any direction. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “in any way”
1:8	g4qg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לֹֽא־יָמ֡וּשׁ סֵפֶר֩ הַ⁠תּוֹרָ֨ה הַ⁠זֶּ֜ה מִ⁠פִּ֗י⁠ךָ	1	Yahweh is using the phrase **shall not depart from your mouth** by association to mean that Joshua must continually read the **book of the law**, since people at this time read out loud, even when reading alone, so Joshua would use his mouth to form the words as he read. (However, this is not a command to read only alone. It envisions that Joshua might at times read the law aloud to the people of Israel.) Alternate translation: “You shall not stop reading this book of the law”
1:8	vu2t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	יוֹמָ֣ם וָ⁠לַ֔יְלָה	1	Yahweh is referring to the two main components of time, **day** and **night**, to mean “all the time.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “continually”
1:8	lcs7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	תַּצְלִ֥יחַ אֶת־דְּרָכֶ֖⁠ךָ וְ⁠אָ֥ז תַּשְׂכִּֽיל	1	The phrases **you will make your ways prosperous** and **you will succeed** mean similar things. Yahweh is using the two phrases together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “you will assuredly be successful”
1:8	k618		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	תַּצְלִ֥יחַ אֶת־ דְּרָכֶ֖⁠ךָ	1	Yahweh is speaking of Joshua’s **ways** as if they were a living thing that Joshua could **make … prosperous**. Yahweh is speaking of Joshua’s actions as if they were **ways** or roads that he was walking on. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “you will prosper in what you do”
1:9	vt4l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֲ⁠ל֤וֹא צִוִּיתִ֨י⁠ךָ֙	1	Yahweh is using the question form for emphasis. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “ “Surely I have commanded you!”
1:9	fnz8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	חֲזַ֣ק וֶ⁠אֱמָ֔ץ	1	See how you translated these same phrases in [1:6](../01/06.md). Alternate translation: “Be very courageous”
1:9	vwe1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	אַֽל־ תַּעֲרֹ֖ץ וְ⁠אַל־ תֵּחָ֑ת כִּ֤י עִמְּ⁠ךָ֙ יְהוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֔י⁠ךָ בְּ⁠כֹ֖ל אֲשֶׁ֥ר תֵּלֵֽךְ	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “Since Yahweh your God is with you in every place where you go, do not be terrified and do not be dismayed”
1:9	u820		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	אַֽל־תַּעֲרֹ֖ץ וְ⁠אַל־תֵּחָ֑ת	1	The phrases **Do not be terrified** and **do not be dismayed** mean similar things. Yahweh combines them to emphasize that Joshua must not be afraid. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “Make sure that you are not terrified” or “There is absolutely no reason for you to be terrified”
1:9	f8qm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	עִמְּ⁠ךָ֙ יְהוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֔י⁠ךָ	1	Here Yahweh speaks about himself in the third person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this with the first person. Alternate translation: “I, Yahweh your God, am with you”
1:11	f3rg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	וְ⁠צַוּ֤וּ אֶת־ הָ⁠עָם֙ לֵ⁠אמֹ֔ר הָכִ֥ינוּ לָ⁠כֶ֖ם צֵידָ֑ה כִּ֞י בְּ⁠ע֣וֹד ׀ שְׁלֹ֣שֶׁת יָמִ֗ים אַתֶּם֙ עֹֽבְרִים֙ אֶת־ הַ⁠יַּרְדֵּ֣ן הַ⁠זֶּ֔ה לָ⁠בוֹא֙ לָ⁠רֶ֣שֶׁת אֶת־ הָ⁠אָ֔רֶץ אֲשֶׁר֙ יְהוָ֣ה אֱלֹֽהֵי⁠כֶ֔ם נֹתֵ֥ן לָ⁠כֶ֖ם לְ⁠רִשְׁתָּֽ⁠הּ	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “command the people to prepare provisions for themselves because within three days they will be crossing over this Jordan to enter to possess the land that Yahweh their God is giving to them to possess it”   If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “command the people to pepare provisions for themselves because within three days they will be crossing over this Jordan to enter to possess the land that Yahweh their God is giving to them to possess it”
1:11	ck8h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	בְּ⁠ע֣וֹד׀ שְׁלֹ֣שֶׁת יָמִ֗ים	1	Here Joshua was counting the current day as day one. This was the way that Jewish people counted days. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “in two days from now” or “on the day after tomorrow”
1:13	dgxd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	זָכוֹר֙ אֶת־הַ⁠דָּבָ֔ר אֲשֶׁ֨ר	1	Joshua did not think that the people from these three tribes had forgotten what Moses had instructed them. Rather, he is using the word **Remember** to cause them to pay attention to what he is going to say next. If you would not use the word **Remember** for this purpose you could use an equivalent expression or indicate the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “You know the word that” or “You remember the word that” or “Keep in mind the word that”
1:13	ylv8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אֶת־הַ⁠דָּבָ֔ר	1	Here, **word** represents what Moses had said to Joshua using words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your language or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the instructions” or “the words”
1:13	jquc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	אֶתְ⁠כֶ֛ם…אֱלֹהֵי⁠כֶם֙…לָ⁠כֶ֔ם…לָ⁠כֶ֖ם	1	Every occurrence of the words **your** and **you** in this verse are plural and refer to Joshua and the Israelites.
1:13	l5qn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	מֵנִ֣יחַ לָ⁠כֶ֔ם	1	The phrase **give rest** is an idiom that refers to living peacefully and settling down in the land after Israel defeated its enemies. If your readers would not understand this, you could use an equivalent idiom or use plain language. Alternate translation: “cause you to live peacefully”
1:14	vefn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וּ⁠מִקְנֵי⁠כֶם֒	1	Here, the word translated as **livestock** refers to cows, sheep, and goats. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “and your cows and sheep and goats”
1:14	ennq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	בְּ⁠עֵ֣בֶר הַ⁠יַּרְדֵּ֑ן	1	Joshua is describing this **land** from the perspective of the land that Yahweh originally promised to the Israelites west of the Jordan. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “on the east side of the Jordan”
1:14	d575		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אֲחֵי⁠כֶ֗ם	1	Here, the word **brothers** means “fellow Israelites” and refers to the Israelites from the other tribes of Israel. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “your fellow Israelites”
1:14	rk3h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	גִּבּוֹרֵ֣י הַ⁠חַ֔יִל	1	The phrase **the mighty men of valor** refers to the men who were fighting age, over 20 years old. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “the men of fighting age”
1:14	u212		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	גִּבּוֹרֵ֣י הַ⁠חַ֔יִל	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **valor**, you could express the same idea with an adjective or in some other way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “the mighty men who are valiant” 
1:15	b5yt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אֲשֶׁר־יָנִ֨יחַ & לַֽ⁠אֲחֵי⁠כֶם֮	1	The phrase **gives rest** refers to living peacefully and settling down in the land after Israel defeated its enemies. It has the same meaning as the phrase **give rest** in [1:13](../01/13.md). See how you translated that phrase there.
1:15	f85b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	 לַֽ⁠אֲחֵי⁠כֶם֮ 	1	See how you translated the word **brothers** in the previous verse where it is used with the same meaning.
1:18	zhz1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	כָּל־אִ֞ישׁ	1	Although the term **man** is masculine, the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh are using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a phrase that makes this clear. Alternate translation: “Every person”
1:18	rel4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	כָּל־אִ֞ישׁ אֲשֶׁר־יַמְרֶ֣ה אֶת־פִּ֗י⁠ךָ וְ⁠לֹֽא־יִשְׁמַ֧ע אֶת־דְּבָרֶ֛י⁠ךָ לְ⁠כֹ֥ל אֲשֶׁר־תְּצַוֶּ֖⁠נּוּ יוּמָ֑ת	1	These two phrases mean basically the same thing and emphasize that any form of disobedience will be punished. The phrase **rebels against your mouth** and the phrase **will not hear your words** mean basically the same thing. The Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh are the same thing twice, in slightly different ways, to emphasize that they will **put to death** anyone who rebels against what Joshua commands. If saying the same thing twice might be confusing for your readers, you can combine the phrases into one and show the emphasis in a way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “We will surely put to death every man who rebels against what you instruct us to do”
1:18	mxi0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	יַמְרֶ֣ה אֶת־פִּ֗י⁠ךָ וְ⁠לֹֽא־יִשְׁמַ֧ע אֶת־דְּבָרֶ֛י⁠ךָ	1	The speakers are using the words **mouth** and **words** and associating them with the instructions or commands that Joshua would speak with his **mouth** using **words**.

1:18	m66s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	יוּמָ֑ת	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **death**, you could express the same idea with an active verb or in some other way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “we will kill”

2:1	w886		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	הַ⁠שִּׁטִּ֞ים	1	This is the name of a place on the east side of the Jordan River. It means “acacia trees.”
2:1	ig8n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	אִשָּׁ֥ה זוֹנָ֛ה וּ⁠שְׁמָ֥⁠הּ רָחָ֖ב	1	The author is using the phrase **a woman, a prostitute** to introduce **Rahab** as a new participant in the story.

This actually occurred after Rahab spoke her final words to the spies in [2:21](../02/21.md). In your translation, you may wish to relate these events in the order in which they happened and put the information in this verse after the quotation from Rahab in [2:21](../02/21.md). Alternatively, you could indicate that what the author says here anticipates what happens a little later in the story. Alternate translation: “Then she agreed to lower them down by a rope through the window”

Because Rahab’s house was built into the city wall, she was able to let the spies out a window and lower them down to the ground outside the city wall.

4:intro	eh7p				0	# Joshua 4 General Notes\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### God’s war\nThe conquering of the Promised Land was a special war. It was God’s war against the people of Canaan and Joshua recognized that they would only be victorious through Yahweh’s power. This is why their first act after crossing the Jordan River was to build an altar. This war was a witness to Yahweh’s power. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/promisedland]])\n\n### Crossing the Jordan River\n\nIn this chapter the words **crossing over** refer to going to the opposite bank of the Jordan River.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Chiasm\n\nHebrew poetry sometimes uses a literary a device called a “chiasm” (sometimes called “chiasmus”). A chiasm is when words or phrases are ordered in a AB-BA sequence. In [Joshua 4:7](../04/07.md) Joshua uses a chiasm. The ULT follows the Hebrew order and translates the part of this verse that contains a chiasm as “Because **the waters of the Jordan were cut off from the face of the Box of the Covenant of Yahweh** when **it crossed over in the Jordan**, **the waters of the Jordan were cut off**. (The repeated phrases are highlighted for the purpose of illustration). Notice that the identical phrase “the waters of the Jordan were cut off” is repeated and the phrase “it crossed over in the Jordan” refers to the same thing as the phrase “from the face of the Box of the Covenant of Yahweh” because the word “it” refers to “the Box of the Covenant of Yahweh.” These phrase are repeated in an AB-BA sequence: “the waters of the Jordan were cut off-from the face of the Box of the Covenant of Yahweh … it crossed over in the Jordan-the waters of the Jordan were cut off.”

4:6	giom		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	מָחָר֙	1	Joshua is speaking as if the children of this generation of Israelites would ask about the stones on the day after this event, **tomorrow**. He is using the term to mean “in the future.” Many languages use this word in the same way, but if it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly.

He means that the 12 stones were still in the middle of the Jordan at the time he wrote this account of them. If it would be clearer in your language, you could use an equivalent idiom or state the meaning plainly, here and for the other occurrences of this phrase in the book.

You could convert the Hebrew day and month into an approximate date on the calendar that your culture uses. However, the Jews used a lunar calendar, so if you use a solar calendar, the date will be different every year and the translation will not be entirely accurate. So you may just want to give the number of the day and the name of the month on the Hebrew calendar. You say approximately what time of year that is on your calendar in a footnote, for example, “The ‘first month’ was the month of Aviv, which is in the spring of the year, in March and April on Western calendars.” Alternate translation: “on the tenth day of the month of Aviv”

(See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/circumcise]])\n\n### Manna\n\nYahweh stops providing manna in this chapter and will no longer provide them with their daily allotment of food.

5:2	uwpn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	בָּ⁠עֵ֣ת הַ⁠הִ֗יא	1	The author is using this phrase to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event.
5:2	nc87		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	חַֽרְב֣וֹת צֻרִ֑ים	1	The word **flint** describes a type of hard stone. If your readers would not be familiar with this type of stone, you could use the name of something similar in your area or you could use a more general term. Alternate translation: “knives of sharpened stone” or “knives with blades made of stone”
5:2	j017		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	וְ⁠שׁ֛וּב מֹ֥ל	1	Yahweh is expressing a single idea by using two verbs together. The verb **return** tells in what way he wants Joshua to **circumcise** the Israelite men. Alternate translation: “again circumcise”
5:2	glk7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠שׁ֛וּב מֹ֥ל אֶת־ בְּנֵֽי־ יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל שֵׁנִֽית	1	This does not mean that these men had already been circumcised once and that Yahweh wanted Joshua to circumcise each of them for a **second time**. Rather, as [5:4](../05/04.md) explains, the previous generation of male Israelites had been circumcised, but they had died in the wilderness; the current generation of Israelite males had not yet been circumcised. Alternate translation: “and do a second general circumcision of all Israelite males, for this generation”
5:2	d7tg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal	שֵׁנִֽית	1	If your language does not use ordinal numbers, you can use a cardinal number here or an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “for time number two”
5:3	m1u7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	 וַ⁠יָּ֨מָל֙	1	There were over 600,000 males, so the author is using **Joshua**, who was in charge of this task, to represent the many people who were necessarily involved. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “And he and other Israelite leaders circumcised”
5:3	jin6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate	גִּבְעַ֖ת הָ⁠עֲרָלֽוֹת	1	**Gibeath Haaraloth** is the name that the Israelites gave to the place where they held this second general circumcision ceremony. The name commemorates the Israelites rededicating themselves to Yahweh. In your translation you could spell it the way it sounds in your language, or you could use a word or phrase from your language that expresses the meaning of this name. Alternate translation: “the Hill of the Foreskins”
5:4	i17c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	הַ⁠יֹּצֵא֩ & בְּ⁠צֵאתָ֖⁠ם	1	In a context such as this, your language may say “having gone” and “in their going out” rather than **having come** and **in their coming out**. Use whichever is more natural, here and in the next two verses.

If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a connecting word or phrase on the first clause rather than on the second one. Alternate translation: “while all of the people having come out were circumcised, all the people born”
5:5	b06g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	מֻלִ֣ים הָי֔וּ כָּל־ הָ⁠עָ֖ם הַ⁠יֹּֽצְאִ֑ים	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “someone had circumcised all the people who came out”
5:5	mqv5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הָ⁠עָ֖ם & הָ֠⁠עָם	1	In this verse, the expression **the people** means “the males.” If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “the males … the males”
5:5	mhgs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/ writing-pronouns	לֹא־ מָֽלוּ	1	Here, **they** is an indefinite pronoun that does not have a specific referent in the immediate context. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this with a different expression that does not use an indefinite pronoun. Alternate translation: “had not been circumcised” or “no one had circumcised”

Alternate translation: “because they had not listened to the voice of Yahweh, the sons of Israel had walked in the wilderness 40 years, until the finishing of all of the nation of the men of war having come out from Egypt”
5:6	qbbd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הַ⁠גּ֜וֹי אַנְשֵׁ֤י הַ⁠מִּלְחָמָה֙ 	1	The author seems to be speaking as if these **men of war** were a **nation** of their own. In this language and culture, people sometimes used the term “nation” to mean “army,” as in [Joel 1:6](../jol/01/06.md), for example. Alternate translation: “the men of war in the army”
5:6	u9iz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	לֹֽא־שָׁמְע֖וּ בְּ⁠ק֣וֹל יְהוָ֑ה	1	Here, the word **listened** means “obeyed.” If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “they had not obeyed the voice of Yahweh”
5:6	k8wl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לֹֽא־שָׁמְע֖וּ בְּ⁠ק֣וֹל יְהוָ֑ה	1	The author is using the **voice** of Yahweh by association to mean the things that Yahweh commanded by using his voice. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “had not obeyed what Yahweh commanded them” or “had not done what Yahweh told them to do”
5:6	mu8b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	לַֽ⁠אֲבוֹתָ⁠ם֙	1	The author is using the term **fathers** to mean “ancestors.” If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “to their ancestors”
5:6	o55f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	לָ֔⁠נוּ	1	The author is addressing his listeners directly by saying **us**. Since the original listeners were Israelites, **us** would have been inclusive if he had marked that form. However, unless your readers are Israelites, they would not be included in the promises described here, which Yahweh made to Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their descendants. So it might be more natural in your language to use the exclusive form if your language marks that distinction. Decide as a team how to translate this.
5:6	jrp7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אֶ֛רֶץ זָבַ֥ת חָלָ֖ב וּ⁠דְבָֽשׁ	1	Yahweh spoke of the land being good for animals and plants as if the **milk** and **honey** from those animals and plants were actually **flowing** through the land. If this metaphor makes sense in your language, you may translate it. If your language has metaphors that mean a land is good for producing healthy livestock and good crops, you may consider using those. If neither is the case, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “a fertile land that produces many good things”

Alternate translation: “Because they had not circumcised them on the way, they were uncircumcised. So Joshua circumcised them.”
5:7	j004		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	עֲרֵלִ֣ים הָי֔וּ כִּ֛י לֹא־ מָ֥לוּ אוֹתָ֖⁠ם	1	See how you translated the similar expressions in [5:5](../05/05.md). Alternate translation: “no one had circumcised them yet; no one had done this` on the way”

If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “all of the Israelite males had finished being circumcised”
5:8	j005		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	תַּ֥מּוּ כָל־ הַ⁠גּ֖וֹי לְ⁠הִמּ֑וֹל	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “when the leaders had finished circumcising all of the Israelite males”
5:9	x1q8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	גַּלּ֛וֹתִי אֶת־ חֶרְפַּ֥ת מִצְרַ֖יִם מֵ⁠עֲלֵי⁠כֶ֑ם	1	Yahweh is speaking as if he had actually **rolled away** the **disgrace of Egypt** from the Israelites. If it would be clearer in your language, you could use an equivalent idiom or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I have removed the disgrace of Egypt from you”
5:9	sgya		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	גַּלּ֛וֹתִי אֶת־ חֶרְפַּ֥ת מִצְרַ֖יִם מֵ⁠עֲלֵי⁠כֶ֑ם	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **disgrace**, you could express the same idea in another way. See the discussion of this phrase in the General Notes to this chapter. Alternate translation: “I have taken you out of the disgraceful situation you were in as former slaves of the Egyptians”

If so, you can shorten it. Alternate translation: “people call that place Gilgal” or “the name of that place has been Gilgal”
5:10	tdl1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal	בְּ⁠אַרְבָּעָה֩ עָשָׂ֨ר י֥וֹם לַ⁠חֹ֛דֶשׁ	1	It may be more natural in your language to use an ordinal number here.

5:13	hegq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠יִּשָּׂ֤א עֵינָי⁠ו֙ וַ⁠יַּ֔רְא	1	The author is using a common expression to mean that Joshua looked some distance away, since he **lifted up his eyes** in order to do this and he had to walk over to the man whom he saw. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “that he looked off into the distance”
5:13	x26s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	וְ⁠הִנֵּה	1	The author is using the term **behold** to focus attention on what happens next in this story. Your language may have a comparable expression that you could use in your translation.

In that culture, this action was a way that a person showed great respect and reverence for someone else. If there is a gesture with similar meaning in your culture, you could consider using it here in your translation. You could also explain the significance of the gesture; the UST models one way to do that.
5:14	j018		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	מָ֥ה אֲדֹנִ֖⁠י מְדַבֵּ֥ר אֶל־ עַבְדּֽ⁠וֹ	1	As a way of showing respect, Joshua is speaking to the prince of Yahweh’s army and about himself in the third person.

Alternate translation: “Because the place that you are standing on is holy, slip off your sandal from upon your foot”
5:15	ge5y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	שַׁל־נַֽעַלְ⁠ךָ֙ מֵ⁠עַ֣ל רַגְלֶ֔⁠ךָ	1	Joshua removing his **sandal** was a symbolic action by which he showed great respect and reverence towards someone superior and acknowledged his willingness to obey him.

5:15	j006		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	 נַֽעַלְ⁠ךָ֙	1	The prince of Yahweh’s army is not referring to one particular **sandal** that Joshua was wearing. He means both of Joshua’s sandals. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using a plural form. Alternate translation: “your sandals”
6:intro	uie9				0	# Joshua 6 General Notes\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Yahweh conquers\n\nIt was God, not the army, who gave them victory. It is said, “Shout! For Yahweh has given you the city.” The circumstances of Israel’s victory in the battle for Jericho were very unusual. It was never common to march around a city or to shout in order to win a military battle. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

The author is using them together for emphasis. See the further discussion in the General Notes to this chapter. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine them. Alternate translation: “The rulers of Jericho were so afraid of the Israelites that they had shut the city gates so that no one could enter, and they had shut up the people inside so that no one could leave”
6:1	jq71		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וּ⁠מְסֻגֶּ֔רֶת	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “And the rulers had also shut up the people inside”
6:2	qfoa		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	רְאֵה֙	1	Yahweh is speaking as if he wants Joshua to **See** or look at something.

Alternate translation: “Pay attention”
6:2	j65i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture	נָתַ֣תִּי 	1	Yahweh is using the past tense in order to refer to something that he will do in the future. He is doing this to show that the event will certainly happen. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use the future tense. Alternate translation: “I am about to give” or “I will certainly give”
6:2	v4hu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	 נָתַ֣תִּי בְ⁠יָֽדְ⁠ךָ֔ אֶת־יְרִיח֖וֹ	1	Here, **hand** represents by association the control or power that a person would have over something. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I have delivered Jericho to your control” or “I have allowed you to conquer Jericho”
6:2	djup		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	גִּבּוֹרֵ֖י הֶ⁠חָֽיִל	1	Yahweh is leaving out a word that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could supply the word from the context. Alternate translation: “and the mighty men of valor” or “along with the mighty men of valor”
6:2	km13		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	גִּבּוֹרֵ֖י הֶ⁠חָֽיִל	1	See how you translated the phrase **mighty men of valor** in [1:14](../01/14.md). Alternate translation: “the valiant warriors”
6:3	fu9e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	פַּ֣עַם אֶחָ֑ת 	1	The context implies that they were to walk around the city **one time** each day. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “one time each day”
6:5	j007		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	בִּ⁠מְשֹׁ֣ךְ ׀ בְּ⁠קֶ֣רֶן הַ⁠יּוֹבֵ֗ל 	1	Yahweh is using this possessive form to mean the **horn** that makes a **blast**.

6:5	oe7s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הָ⁠עָ֖ם & הָ⁠עָ֖ם	1	In this context, the phrase **the people** refers to the Israelite soldiers. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “the soldiers … the soldiers”
6:5	zdc7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠עָל֥וּ הָ⁠עָ֖ם	1	Here, the phrase **go up** refers to climbing up over the collapsed pieces of the walls to get into the city. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “and the soldiers will climb up over the collapsed city walls”
6:5	ukux		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אִ֥ישׁ נֶגְדּֽ⁠וֹ	1	Yahweh is using a common expression to mean that each of the soldiers in the army that is encircling the city should rush into the part of it that is directly in front of him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “each soldier going into the part of the city that is in front of him”
6:7	jf9o		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	עִבְר֖וּ & יַעֲבֹ֕ר	1	The phrase **pass over** is a common expression that indicates walking or moving forward. If it would be clearer in your language, you could use an equivalent idiom or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Start walking & will walk”
6:7	g18m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	 וְ⁠הֶ֣⁠חָל֔וּץ	1	To translate this term here and in verse 9, see how you translated the similar expression in [4:12](../04/12.md). Alternate translation: “and the soldiers with their weapons”

6:8	l35d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לִ⁠פְנֵ֣י יְהוָ֔ה	1	As the last sentence in this verse makes clear, the author is using the name **Yahweh** by association to mean **the Box of the Covenant of Yahweh**, since it represents Yahweh’s presence with the people of Israel. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “in front of the Box of the Covenant of Yahweh”
6:8	ayf9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַֽ⁠אֲרוֹן֙ בְּרִ֣ית יְהוָ֔ה הֹלֵ֖ךְ אַחֲרֵי⁠הֶֽם	1	The author does not mean that **the Box of the Covenant of Yahweh** was **going** by itself. Priests were carrying it. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “And the priests carrying the Box of the Covenant of Yahweh went behind them”
6:9	gch6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אַחֲרֵ֣י הָ⁠אָר֔וֹן	1	Here again, it is implied that priests were carrying **the Box**. Alternate translation: “behind the Box, which priests were carrying”
6:9	i5vh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	הָל֖וֹךְ וְ⁠תָק֥וֹעַ בַּ⁠שּׁוֹפָרֽוֹת	1	The author is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete.

6:10	v7ib		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הָ⁠עָם֩	1	As in [6:5](../06/05.md), the phrase **the people** refers to the Israelite soldiers. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “the Israelite soldiers”

Joshua says the same thing three times, in slightly different ways, to emphasize to the Israelite soldiers and priests that they must remain completely silent until he gives them the command, **Shout!** If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine the phrases into one and show the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “ “You must remain completely silent” or “You must remain absolutely quiet”
6:10	tc4f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	י֣וֹם	1	Joshua is using the term **day** to refer to a specific time. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the time when”
6:11	hf4m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יַּסֵּ֤ב אֲרוֹן־יְהוָה֙ אֶת־הָ⁠עִ֔יר	1	Here, the word **he** refers to Joshua. It is implied that Joshua did not carry the **Box of Yahweh** around Jericho himself but rather instructed the priests do it. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “And the priests brought the box of Yahweh around the city”
6:13	lxf4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-reduplication	הֹלְכִ֣ים הָל֔וֹךְ	1	The author is repeating the verb **walking** in order to intensify the idea that it expresses. If your language can repeat words for intensification, it would be appropriate to do that here in your translation. If not, your language may have another way of expressing the emphasis. Alternate translation: “were walking continually”
6:13	wjy6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	הָל֖וֹךְ וְ⁠תָק֥וֹעַ בַּ⁠שּׁוֹפָרֽוֹת	1	The author is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete.

6:13	qp0v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys 	הָל֖וֹךְ וְ⁠תָק֥וֹעַ בַּ⁠שּׁוֹפָרֽוֹת	1	The author may be expressing a single idea by using two words connected with **and**. While the priests actually were **walking** and **blowing on the shofars** at the same time, the word **walking** might be describing in what way the priests were **blowing**, that is, continually. Alternate translation: “blowing continually on the shofars”
6:14	j232		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal	בַּ⁠יּ֤וֹם הַ⁠שֵּׁנִי֙	1	If your language does not use ordinal numbers, you could use cardinal numbers here. Alternate translation: “on day two”

6:15	bgwj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	כַּ⁠עֲל֣וֹת הַ⁠שַּׁ֔חַר	1	The author is using the word **dawn** by association to mean the sun.

6:16	sc3s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	 הָ⁠עָם֙ 	1	As in [6:5](../06/05.md) and [6:10](../06/10.md), the phrase **the people** refers to the Israelite soldiers. Alternate translation: “the Israelite soldiers”
6:16	fj73		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture	נָתַ֧ן יְהוָ֛ה לָ⁠כֶ֖ם אֶת־הָ⁠עִֽיר	1	Joshua is using the past tense in order to refer to something that Yahweh will do in the future. He is doing this to show that the event will certainly happen. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use the future tense. See how you translated the similar expression in [6:2](../06/02.md). Alternate translation: “Yahweh is about to give the city to you” or “Yahweh will certainly give the city to you”
6:17	a98e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הַ⁠חֵ֔רֶם	1	To decide how to translate the term **devoted** here, in the next verse, and in verse 21, see the discussion in the General Introduction to Joshua. Also see how you translated the term in [2:10](../02/10.md). Alternate translation: “something that we must destroy completely”

Alternate translation: “Because she hid the messengers whom we sent, only Rahab the prostitute will live, she and all who are with her in the house”

So use plural forms in your translation if your language marks that distinction.
6:19	j019		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	קֹ֥דֶשׁ ה֖וּא	1	Since Joshua has just described a list of things, it may be more natural in your language to use the pronoun “they” rather than **it**. Alternate translation: “they are holy things”
6:20	fm69		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַֽ⁠יִּתְקְע֖וּ & וַֽ⁠יִּלְכְּד֖וּ	1	In its first instance, the pronoun **they** refers to the priests.

Alternate translation: “and the priests blew … and the soldiers captured”

If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “including all the people who lived there, regardless of their age or sex”
6:21	hmkk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	מִ⁠נַּ֖עַר וְ⁠עַד־זָקֵ֑ן	1	The author is using the adjectives **young** and **old** as nouns in order to describe groups of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate these words with noun phrases. Alternate translation: “from young people to old people”
6:21	cf5x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	לְ⁠פִי־חָֽרֶב	1	The author is speaking of **the sword** as if it were a living thing that had a **mouth** and could eat. This is probably a reference to the way a sword cuts into a person as if it were an animal biting him. An idea implicit in this personification is that when a sword eats, it devours everything. So this expression means “to the degree that the sword devours,” in other words, “completely.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “destroying it completely”

In your translation, you may wish to relate these events in the order in which they happened. Alternate translation: “Since you swore to the woman, the prostitute, that you would do this, enter her house and bring out from there the woman and all who are to her”
6:22	d0fw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	הָ⁠אִשָּׁ֣ה הַ⁠זּוֹנָ֑ה	1	Joshua is using the phrase **the woman, the prostitute** to reintroduce Rahab as a participant in the story. If your language has its own way of reintroducing participants, you can use it here in your translation.
6:22	krqs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual	נִשְׁבַּעְתֶּ֖ם	1	Since Joshua is speaking to two men, **you** would be dual if your language uses that form. Otherwise, it would be plural.

6:25	d0je		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל 	1	The author is speaking of the Israelite people by association with the man **Israel** from whom they descended. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the people of Israel”

6:26	rmeu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	אָר֨וּר הָ⁠אִ֜ישׁ	1	Joshua is not speaking of one particular **man** but of any man who might possibly rebuild Jericho in the future, If it would be helpful in your language, use a more natural phrase. Alternate translation: “Cursed is any man”

He means that these sons will die at the beginning and ending of the rebuilding. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “At the cost of his firstborn he will found it, and at the cost of his youngest he will set up its gates”

7:1	v6rb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry	וַ⁠יִּמְעֲל֧וּ בְנֵֽי־ יִשְׂרָאֵ֛ל מַ֖עַל	1	For emphasis, the author is using a construction in which a verb and its object come from the same root. You may be able to use the same construction in your language to express the meaning here. Alternatively, your language may have another way of showing the emphasis. The idea is that one Israelite did something secret and deceptive that was a betrayal of the trust that Yahweh had placed in all of the Israelites. Alternate translation: “But the sons of Israel deceptively betrayed Yahweh”
7:1	mtm4			בַּ⁠חֵ֑רֶם & הַ⁠חֵ֔רֶם	1	To decide how to translate the term **devoted** in its two instances here and throughout this chapter, see the discussion in the General Introduction to Joshua.

You could also use plain language. Alternate translation: “the anger of Yahweh”
7:1	j020		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וַ⁠יִּֽחַר	1	The author is speaking as if the **nose** of Yahweh, representing his anger, had actually **burned**. He mans that it became very intense.

There may be an equivalent word or expression in your language that you can use in your translation to convey this strong feeling. If not, you could specify that Gideon said this because he was feeling fear. Alternate translation: “Oh, no! My Lord Yahweh!” or “I am afraid, my Lord Yahweh!”

If you must state who did the action, the previous verse indicates that Yahweh is the one who will “take” or catch the person who stole the devoted things, and the context implies that the Israelites are the ones who are supposed burn the one who took the banned things. Alternate translation: “you shall burn with fire the one Yahweh catches with the devoted thing”

Alternate translation: “and about 5 pounds of silver and one wedge of gold whose weight was a little over a pound” or “and 200 pieces of silver weighing over two kilograms and a wedge of gold that weighed about half a kilogram”

7:21	u41u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	תַּחְתֶּֽי⁠הָ	1	Since Achan is saying that the **silver** is beneath the **coat** and the **gold**, it may be more natural in your language to use a plural pronoun here. Alternate translation: “under them”

7:23	s59g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	לִ⁠פְנֵ֥י יְהוָֽה	1	This could mean: (1) “where Yahweh could see them.” The idea is not that Yahweh did not know before where they were; he told Joshua in [7:11](../07/11.md) that an Israelite had stolen some of the devoted things and hidden them. Rather, the idea is that this was public evidence that the Israelites had found the wrongdoer and would punish him as Yahweh had told them to. Alternate translation: “where Yahweh could see them” (2) “in front of the tent of meeting.” The phrase could be a description of where the Israelites **poured … out** the silver coins, coat, and gold wedge. The author would be using the name **Yahweh** by association to mean the place where his presence was. But this would also indicate that these things were serving as conclusive evidence against Achan. Alternate translation: “in front of the tent of meeting”
7:24	j009		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠כָל־ יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל עִמּ֑⁠וֹ	1	This phrase does not mean that Joshua also brought **all Israel** to the Valley of Achor when he brought Achan there. It means that Joshua and **all Israel with him** brought Achan and his family and possessions to the Valley of Achor. Be sure that this is clear in your translation. The UST models one way to do that.
7:24	ta3l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate	עֵ֥מֶק עָכֽוֹר	1	The word **Achor** is the name of a valley. In your translation, you could spell it the way it sounds in your language, or you could use a word or phrase from your language that expresses the meaning of this name. As the next two verses explain, the word means “trouble,” and the Israelites gave that name to the valley on this occasion. Alternate translation: “to the Valley of Trouble”
7:25	vd6n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	מֶ֣ה עֲכַרְתָּ֔⁠נוּ	1	Joshua is using the question form to rebuke Achan.

8:intro	f3jc				0	# Joshua 8 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Sin brought defeat\n\nIt was great sin to take what was to be destroyed. Because of their sin, Yahweh withheld victory from the Israelites. Sin resulted in defeat in battle. Because they repented, Yahweh brought victory to Israel in Ai. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/repent]])\n\n### Built an altar\n\nAltars were commonly built in the Ancient Near East to commemorate important events. Several altars were built in the Book of Joshua.
8:1	l4p8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	אַל־תִּירָ֣א וְ⁠אַל־תֵּחָ֔ת	1	The phrases **Do not be terrified** and **do not be dismayed** mean similar things. Yahweh is using them together to emphasize that Joshua and the Israelite soldiers must not be afraid. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “Do not be afraid at all” or “There is absolutely no reason for you to be terrified”

8:1	t7bq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture 	נָתַ֣תִּי בְ⁠יָדְ⁠ךָ֗ 	1	Yahweh is using the past tense in order to refer to something that he will do in the future. He is doing this to show that the event will certainly happen. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use the future tense. Alternate translation: “I am about to give into your hand” or “I will certainly give into your hand”

8:5	zlt5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	בָּ⁠רִֽאשֹׁנָ֔ה	1	Joshua is using the adjective **first** as a noun. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this adjective with an equivalent phrase, here and in the next verse. Alternate translation: “the first time” or “at the first time”
8:5	a6e7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal 	בָּ⁠רִֽאשֹׁנָ֔ה	1	If your language does not use ordinal numbers, you could use an equivalent expression to express the meaning, here and in the next verse. Alternate translation: “before”

8:9	i3lf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	מִ⁠יָּ֣ם לָ⁠עָ֑י 	1	As the General Notes to this chapter discuss, here and several other times in the following verses, the author describes the location of one place relative to another in the way that is characteristic of his culture. Express these relative locations the way someone in your culture would. Alternate translation: “to the west of Ai”

For a discussion of why [8:3](../08/03.md) says that Joshua sent 30,000 men to lie in ambush while this verse says that he sent **about 5,000 men**, see the General Notes to this chapter. 
8:13	x0cl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/ writing-endofstory	Quote	1	The first sentence in this verse is a summary statement for 8:3–12. Use a natural form in your language for a summary statement at the end of one section of a story. Be sure that it is clear that this is a summary and not a description of a further action.
8:14	a0rv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	כִּ⁠רְא֣וֹת מֶֽלֶךְ־ הָ⁠עַ֗י	1	The author does not say specifically what the king of Ai **saw**. This could mean: (1) that the king saw Joshua. The author has just said that Joshua went and spent the night in the valley near Ai, and the king may have seen him in the morning and concluded that this was the main force of the Israelite army and that he could attack and destroy it. Alternate translation: “as soon as the king of Ai saw Joshua” (2) that the king saw that the Israelite army north of the city. This could be a more general reference to the king seeing that the Israelites had set up their main camp to the north of the city. Alternate translation: “as soon as the king saw the Israelite army”
8:14	kov9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	וַֽ⁠יְמַהֲר֡וּ וַ⁠יַּשְׁכִּ֡ימוּ	1	This phrase expresses a single idea by using two words connected with **and**. The word **hurried** tells in what way the men of the city **got up early**. Alternate translation: “Then … quickly got up early”

8:16	lcb5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וַ⁠יִּזָּעֲק֗וּ כָּל־הָ⁠עָם֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר ב⁠עיר	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “And the king summoned all of the people who were in the city”
8:16	k8ff		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	כָּל־הָ⁠עָם֙	1	In this context, the phrase **the people** refers to the men who were able to fight. It is clear from [8:24](../08/24.md) that other people remained in the city. Alternate translation: “all of the fighting men”
8:16	yt5n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וַ⁠יִּנָּתְק֖וּ	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “and this drew them away”
8:17	kijl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	וְ⁠לֹֽא־נִשְׁאַ֣ר אִ֗ישׁ בָּ⁠עַי֙ וּ⁠בֵ֣ית אֵ֔ל אֲשֶׁ֥ר לֹֽא־יָצְא֖וּ אַחֲרֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this sentence as a positive statement. Alternate translation: “And every man in Ai and Bethel went out after Israel”
8:17	zip6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אִ֗ישׁ	1	Here, the term **man** refers specifically to the men who were able to fight. They left these two cities to pursue the Israelite army. Older men and those unable to fight because of some physical disability probably did not leave these cities. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “a man of fighting age” or “a man who could fight”
8:17	gnnz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וּ⁠בֵ֣ית אֵ֔ל	1	The statement that the fighting men of **Bethel** also pursued the Israelites implicitly suggests that Bethel and Ai were allied cities. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly.  Alternate translation: “or in its allied city of Bethel”
8:17	odgx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וַ⁠יַּעַזְב֤וּ אֶת־ הָ⁠עִיר֙ פְּתוּחָ֔ה	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “and they left the gates of the city open”
8:18	xe2m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	בְ⁠יָדְ⁠ךָ֖ אֶתְּנֶ֑⁠נָּה	1	See how you translated the similar expression in [8:1](../08/01.md). Alternate translation: “I will enable you to conquer it”

You should retain this action in your translation. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate its meaning in footnote.
8:19	cyya		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	וְ⁠הָ⁠אוֹרֵ֡ב קָם֩ מְהֵרָ֨ה מִ⁠מְּקוֹמ֤⁠וֹ וַ⁠יָּר֨וּצוּ֙	1	The word **ambush** is a singular noun that refers to a group of people acting together. That is why the pronoun **they** is plural. If your language does not use singular nouns in this way, you could describe this **ambush** as a group. Alternate translation: “And the Israelite soldiers who were hiding themselves rose quickly from their place, and they ran”
8:19	brnr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	וַֽ⁠יְמַהֲר֔וּ וַ⁠יַּצִּ֥יתוּ	1	This phrase expresses a single idea by using two words connected with **and**.

8:20	lcmy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	וְ⁠הִנֵּ֨ה	1	The author is using the term **behold** to focus attention on what happens next in this story. Your language may have a comparable expression that you could use in your translation.
8:20	vvzs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וְ⁠לֹא־הָיָ֨ה בָ⁠הֶ֥ם יָדַ֛יִם לָ⁠נ֖וּס הֵ֣נָּה וָ⁠הֵ֑נָּה	1	Here, **hand** represents the capability of a person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or state the meaning plainly. This statement seems to introduce the action that the author describes in the rest of this verse and in the next two verses, in which the soldiers from Ai and Bethel become surrounded by the Israelite soldiers. Alternate translation: “and it was not possible for them to flee here or there”
8:20	d2dq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	הֵ֣נָּה וָ⁠הֵ֑נָּה	1	The author is speaking of two things in order to mean them and everything in between. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “anywhere”
8:22	mxej		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	 וְ⁠אֵ֨לֶּה יָצְא֤וּ מִן־הָ⁠עִיר֙ לִ⁠קְרָאתָ֔⁠ם וַ⁠יִּֽהְי֤וּ לְ⁠יִשְׂרָאֵל֙ בַּ⁠תָּ֔וֶךְ	1	The pronoun **these** refers to the Israelite soldiers who had been hiding and who had just set the city of Ai on fire. The pronoun **them** refers to the Israelite soldiers who had openly attacked Ai and then pretended to flee, who had just turned around to attack their enemies. The pronoun **they** refers to the soldiers who had come out of the cities of Ai and Bethel. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “And the Israelite soldiers who had been hiding and who had just set the city of Ai on fire came out from the city to meet the Israelite soldiers who had just turned around to attack, so the soldiers who had come out of the cities of Ai and Bethel were in the midst of Israel”
8:22	dlr1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וַ⁠יִּֽהְי֤וּ לְ⁠יִשְׂרָאֵל֙ בַּ⁠תָּ֔וֶךְ אֵ֥לֶּה מִ⁠זֶּ֖ה וְ⁠אֵ֣לֶּה מִ⁠זֶּ֑ה	1	The author is using the term **Israel** by association to the Israelite army. It is not significant which instance of **here** refers to which body of Israelite soldiers, the one coming from the city or the one coming back from the wilderness. Alternate translation: “so they were in the midst of Israelite soldiers, some coming at them from one direction and others coming at them from the other direction”
8:22	s1lu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יַּכּ֣וּ אוֹתָ֔⁠ם עַד־ בִּלְתִּ֥י הִשְׁאִֽיר־ ל֖⁠וֹ	1	After referring to the Israelite soldiers as **they** and the soldiers from Ai and Bethel as **them**, the author then refers to the Israelites as **he** and to their enemies as **him**. This probably reflects the use earlier in the verse of the singular term **Israel** to represent the Israelite soldiers. It may be more natural in your language to use plural pronouns throughout this sentence. Alternate translation: “And they struck them until they left to them no survivor or fugitive”
8:24	dura		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish	בַּ⁠שָּׂדֶ֗ה בַּ⁠מִּדְבָּר֙	1	By using the terms **field** and **wilderness** together, the author could be: (1) giving further information about where **the field** was located. Alternate translation:  “in the field that was in the wilderness” (2) naming two locations where the Israelite army killed the soldiers from Ai and Bethel. Alternate translation: “in the field and in the wilderness”
8:24	xg2z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	 וַֽ⁠יִּפְּל֥וּ כֻלָּ֛⁠ם לְ⁠פִי־חֶ֖רֶב עַד־תֻּמָּ֑⁠ם וַ⁠יָּשֻׁ֤בוּ כָל־יִשְׂרָאֵל֙ הָ⁠עַ֔י וַ⁠יַּכּ֥וּ אֹתָ֖⁠הּ לְ⁠פִי־חָֽרֶב	1	See how you translated the phrase “to the mouth of the sword” in [6:21](../06/21.md). Alternate translation: “once they had killed every one of those soldiers and none were left, that all of Israel returned to Ai and killed everyone who was there”
8:24	uhnh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וַֽ⁠יִּפְּל֥וּ כֻלָּ֛⁠ם	1	The author is describing dying in battle by association with the word the word **fallen**, since soldiers who die in battle fall to the ground and die. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “and all of them had been killed” or “and all of them had died”
8:25	d2ud		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	הַ⁠נֹּ֨פְלִ֜ים	1	See how you translated the similar expression in the previous verse . Alternate translation: “the ones who were killed”
8:25	s6hq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	כֹּ֖ל אַנְשֵׁ֥י הָ⁠עָֽי	1	While the terms **man** and **woman** earlier in the verse have a specific sense, the masculine term **men** here has a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use language in your translation here that is clearly inclusive of both men and women. Alternate translation: “the entire population of the city”
8:26	gcgu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes	וִ⁠יהוֹשֻׁ֨עַ֙ לֹֽא־ הֵשִׁ֣יב יָד֔⁠וֹ	1	The author is expressing a positive meaning by using a negative word together with a term that is the opposite of the action he wishes to emphasize. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “And Joshua continued holding out his hand”
8:27	jyr5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	רַ֣ק הַ⁠בְּהֵמָ֗ה וּ⁠שְׁלַל֙ הָ⁠עִ֣יר הַ⁠הִ֔יא בָּזְז֥וּ לָ⁠הֶ֖ם יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל	1	Here, the word **However** is introducing a contrast. What follows the word **However** is in contrast to what the Israelites did to the inhabitants of Ai in the previous verse. Use a natural form in your language for introducing a contrast. Alternate translation: “By contrast, Israel did plunder for themselves the livestock and the spoil of that city”
8:27	agn1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	כִּ⁠דְבַ֣ר יְהוָ֔ה	1	The author is using the term **word** to represent what Yahweh commanded by using words. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “according to the commandment of Yahweh”
8:28	nq1b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	שְׁמָמָ֔ה	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **desolation**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “a desolate place”
8:29	yq50		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	עַ֖ד הַ⁠יּ֥וֹם הַ⁠זֶּֽה	1	The author is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete.

8:30	isui		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential	אָ֣ז	1	The word **Then** indicates that the event the story will now relate came after the event it has just described. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could show this relationship by using a fuller phrase. Alternate translation: “After that” or “After raising a great pile of stones over the corpse of the king of Ai”
8:31	td7f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	כַּ⁠כָּתוּב֙ בְּ⁠סֵ֨פֶר֙ תּוֹרַ֣ת מֹשֶׁ֔ה	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

8:31	ihwd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	אֲשֶׁ֛ר לֹֽא־ הֵנִ֥יף עֲלֵי⁠הֶ֖ן בַּרְזֶ֑ל 	1	The law is using the first part of a process to mean that entire process. Picking up an **iron tool** and holding it over a stone is the first step in using that tool to shape the stone. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “which no one has used an iron tool to shape”
8:33	cool		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	מִ⁠זֶּ֣ה ׀ וּ⁠מִ⁠זֶּ֣ה ׀ לָ⁠אָר֡וֹן	1	As the General Notes to this chapter discuss, the author is describing the location of one place relative to another in the way that is characteristic of his culture.

8:33	vffb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	חֶצְי⁠וֹ֙ & וְ⁠הַֽ⁠חֶצְי֖⁠וֹ	1	The pronoun **him** in both instances refers to **Israel**, which means all of the Israelites. It may be more natural in your language to use plural pronouns. Alternate translation: “half of them … and half of them”
8:33	wd9u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	בָּ⁠רִאשֹׁנָֽה	1	The author is using the adjective **first** as a noun. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this adjective with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “when he first delivered the law”
8:34	vf71		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	הַ⁠כָּת֖וּב	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “that Moses had written”

Alternate translation: “Joshua read every word that Moses had commanded”
8:35	ozlo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠הַ⁠נָּשִׁ֣ים וְ⁠הַ⁠טַּ֔ף וְ⁠הַ⁠גֵּ֖ר	1	The author is making clear that on this occasion, the **assembly of Israel** did not consist only of male representatives of tribes or clans or extended families, but that it also included **women** and **children** and **sojourners**.

9:intro	w1cx				0	# Joshua 9 General Notes\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Israel’s mistake\n\nIsrael was deceived because “they did not consult with Yahweh for guidance.” Instead of consulting Yahweh, they attempted to achieve victory under their own power. This was sinful. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])\n\n## Important Translation Issues\n\n### The Hivites\n\nIn [3:10](../03/10.md) the Israelites are given a list of the nations that they are told to “dispossess” from the land. This list includes the Hivites. In [9:1-2](../09/01.md) the author of Joshua records that when the kings on the west side of the Jordan River heard what the Israelites had done to Ai that they made an agreement to fight against the Israelites. The list in [9:2](../09/02.md) of kings that agreed to fight against the Israelites includes “the Hivite.” The author records in [9:3-4](../09/03.md) that when “those who dwelled in Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and to the Ai … they … acted with cunning.” The author then records in [9:7](../09/07.md) that those who dwelled in Gibeon were “Hivite.” The Hivite nation consisted of multiple people groups of whom the Gibeonites were just one. This is why the author could say in [9:1-2](../09/01.md) that among the kings who gathered to fight the Israelites were Hivites and also say that the Gibeonites were Hivites.

9:1	j011		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	בְּ⁠עֵ֨בֶר הַ⁠יַּרְדֵּ֜ן	1	The description that follows indicates that by **the other side of the Jordan**, the author means the side opposite to the one from which the Israelites approached the land of Canaan. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “the west side of the Jordan River”

He is describing the people groups that these **kings** ruled. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using plural forms. Alternate translation: “that is, the kings of the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites”
9:2	uj94		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	פֶּ֖ה אֶחָֽד	1	The author is using a common expression of his culture, **as one mouth**, to mean “by unanimous agreement.” (All the kings said the same thing, that they would fight the Israelites, so it was as if together they only had one mouth.) If it would be clearer in your language, you could use an equivalent idiom or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “by unanimous agreement”

Rather, the idea is that the other kings acted by joining forces to fight the Israelites, and the people of Gibeon **also** acted, but **with cunning** rather than by fighting. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. “And they also took action, but unlike the other kings, they did not prepare to fight; they used cunning”
9:4	aktq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	בְּ⁠עָרְמָ֔ה	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **cunning**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “craftily”

9:6	rz8e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	אִ֣ישׁ יִשְׂרָאֵ֗ל	1	The author is not referring to a specific **man**. He means the men **of Israel** in general and, as verses 15 and 18–21 indicate, most likely the leaders of Israel. Alternate translation: “the leaders of Israel”

If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “In that case, we could not cut a covenant with you!”
9:8	ki9n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	עֲבָדֶ֣י⁠ךָ אֲנָ֑חְנוּ	1	By saying **We are your servants**, the Gibeonites do not mean that they are willing to become slaves, such as they eventually do become in this episode. Rather, they are agreeing to let Joshua be their ruler. They mean implicitly that they will accept the terms he specifies, such as paying tribute. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “We are willing to serve you as our ruler”
9:9	mrhs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	מֵ⁠אֶ֨רֶץ רְחוֹקָ֤ה מְאֹד֙ בָּ֣אוּ עֲבָדֶ֔י⁠ךָ לְ⁠שֵׁ֖ם יְהוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֑י⁠ךָ	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes.

9:9	kvs5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	עֲבָדֶ֔י⁠ךָ	1	To show respect to Joshua, the Gibeonites are speaking about themselves in the third person.

Alternate translation: “We, your servants”
9:9	yve3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לְ⁠שֵׁ֖ם יְהוָ֣ה	1	Here, as in [7:9](../07/09.md), Yahweh’s **name** represents his reputation. Alternate translation: “because of the reputation of Yahweh”

Alternate translation: “and told us to take provisions in our hand for the road and go to meet you and say to you”
9:11	hq3m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	בְ⁠יֶדְ⁠כֶ֤ם	1	The Gibeonites and their leaders were using one part of a person, his **hand**, to represent all of him in the act of bringing something with them.

Alternate translation: “that we were your servants and that we wanted you to cut a covenant with us”
9:12	bwk2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	הִנֵּ֣ה	1	In this context, the Gibeonites are using the term **behold** to mean that they want the Israelites to look at their bread. Alternate translation: “look at it”  
9:13	yyy2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	וְ⁠הִנֵּ֖ה	1	The Gibeonites are using the word **behold** here in the same way as in the previous verse. Alternate translation: “look at it”

9:16	kr1s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	וַ⁠יְהִ֗י	1	The author is using this phrase to introduce a new development in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new development.

The author says the same thing twice, in slightly different ways, to emphasize that the Gibeonites lived close to the Israelites. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine the phrases into one and show the emphasis in a way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “that they actually lived close to them!”  
9:17	s1u5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal	בַּ⁠יּ֣וֹם הַ⁠שְּׁלִישִׁ֑י	1	If your language does not use ordinal numbers, but your culture reckons the present day as day one, you could use a cardinal number here. Otherwise, see how you translated the similar expressions in [1:11](../01/11.md) and [9:16](../09/16.md).  Alternate translation: “on day three” or “after traveling for two days”

9:19	vrwa		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns	אֲנַ֨חְנוּ֙ נִשְׁבַּ֣עְנוּ	1	For emphasis, the **leaders** are stating a pronoun whose meaning is already present in the verb translated as **sworn**. If your language can state implied pronouns explicitly for emphasis, you may want to use that construction here in your translation. Other languages may have other ways of bringing out this emphasis. The ULT does so by using the intensive pronoun **ourselves**.
9:19	z1k2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	לֹ֥א נוּכַ֖ל לִ⁠נְגֹּ֥עַ בָּ⁠הֶֽם	1	In context such as this, the word translated as **touch** has the sense of “harm” or “kill.” In some languages, this may sound like an understatement for emphasis, and you could express the meaning that way. Alternate translation: “we cannot do the slightest thing to harm them”

You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “so Yahweh will not be angry with us and punish us”

If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to make this part of the quotation from the leaders if it does. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to end the quotation before this phrase, as the ULT does.

9:23	ozk4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וְ⁠לֹֽא־יִכָּרֵ֨ת מִ⁠כֶּ֜ם עֶ֗בֶד	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

9:24	wuz9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	לָ⁠כֶם֙ & מִ⁠פְּנֵי⁠כֶ֑ם & מִ⁠פְּנֵי⁠כֶ֔ם	1	The first two instances of **your** are singular because the Gibeonites are addressing Joshua. The other two instances of **your** and the word **you** are plural because the Gibeonites are referring to the Israelites as a group. Use the corresponding forms in your translation if your language marks this distinction.
9:24	kbti		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	מִ⁠פְּנֵי⁠כֶ֔ם	1	The Gibeonites are using one part of the Israelite people, their **faces**, to represent all of them.

9:25	octw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בְּ⁠עֵינֶ֛י⁠ךָ	1	The Gibeonites are using the term **eyes** by association to mean sight. Sight, in turn, represents judgment and perspective.

If it would be clearer in your language, you could use the future tense. Alternate translation: “I will certainly give them into your hand”
10:8	m9x5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	into your hand	1	As the General Notes to this chapter discuss,  the author is using the term **hand** by association to mean power or control. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language, here and in the rest of the chapter. Alternate translation: “into your power”
10:8	s4h7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	will stand at your face	1	See how you translated the similar expression in [1:5](../01/05.md). Alternate translation: “will be able to resist you”
10:10	w2y6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry	and he struck them {with} a great striking	1	For emphasis, the author is using a construction in which a verb and its object come from the same root.

Alternate translation: “and he struck them severely”
10:10	n7k3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Beth Horon & Azekah & Makkedah	1	The words **Beth Horon**, **Azekah**, and **Makkedah** are the names of cities.
10:11	s5m8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	in their fleeing from the face of Israel	1	The author is using the expression **from the face of** by association to mean “in front of.” Since the fleeing enemies were in front of the Israelites, the Israelites were behind them, and it may be more natural in your language to express the meaning that way.  Alternate translation: “as they were fleeing, with the Israelites pursuing closely behind them”
10:11	e9v4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	great stones from the heavens	1	As the author indicates later in the verse, these were not **stones** in the sense of rocks, but **hail** stones. It may be helpful to indicate this explicitly in your translation at this point in the verse. Alternate translation: “great hailstones from the sky”
10:12	i3k7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	in the day of Yahweh giving the Amorite to the face of the sons of Israel	1	The author is using a common expression to mean that Yahweh enabled the Israelites to defeat the Amorites.

10:12	g5n2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	the Amorite	1	The author is not referring to a specific **Amorite**. He means all of these Amorites who opposed Joshua.

You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “Sun, be still over Gibeon, and moon, be still over the Valley of Aijalon”
10:12	i7t3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	Sun, be still over Gibeon, and moon, over the Valley of Aijalon	1	Since the author says that here **Joshua spoke to Yahweh**, and since Joshua by himself did not have the power to stop the sun and moon from moving through the sky, this is implicitly a prayer or request from Joshua to Yahweh. You may wish to translate it that way. Alternate translation: “Please make the sun be still over Gibeon and make the moon be still over the Valley of Aijalon” or “May the sun be still over Gibeon, and may the moon be still over the Valley of Aijalon”
10:13	r4k8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	Is it not written in the Book of Jashar?	1	The author is using the question form for emphasis. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “This account is indeed written in the Book of Jashar.”
10:13	p9w2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	Is it not written in the Book of Jashar?	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

10:13	h2m7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	and it did not hurry to go	1	The author is expressing a single idea by using two verbs together. The word **hurry** tells in what way the sun did not **go**. Alternate translation: “and it did not go quickly”
10:14	r8f3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	And none has been like this day & for Yahweh fought for Israel	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes.

10:19	y4h7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	But you	1	The word **you** is plural here because Joshua is addressing all of soldiers other than the ones who will stay and guard the cave. So use the plural form in your translation if your language marks that distinction. Alternate translation: “But all of the rest of you”
10:19	d8n3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	do not stand	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a positive expression to translate this double negative that consists of the negative particle **not** and the verb **stand**, which would be negative in this context.

10:19	p6f2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture	Yahweh your God has given them into your hand	1	Joshua is using the past tense to describe something that will happen in the future in order to show that the event will certainly happen.

10:20	w3k8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry	striking them {with} a very great striking	1	See how you translated the similar expression in [10:10](../10/10.md). Alternate translation: “striking them very severely”

10:21	m5t6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	No one sharpened his tongue	1	The author is speaking as if people could **sharpen** their **tongues**.

Alternate translation: “No one said anything hostile”

10:22	j026		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	Open the mouth of the cave	1	The author assumes that readers will understand that this means to remove the stones that were blocking the entrance to the cave.

10:24	s7h4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	put your feet on the necks of these kings	1	Putting a foot on the neck of an enemy was a symbolic action that showed complete victory over that enemy.

Be strong and be courageous, because Yahweh will do thus to all of your enemies with whom you {are} fighting	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes.

10:25	p6t2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	Do not be afraid and do not be dismayed	1	These two phrases mean basically the same thing. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine them. Alternate translation: “Do not be at all fearful”

10:39	i6r8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	Just as he had done to Hebron, thus he did to Debir and to its king, and just as he had done to Libnah and to its king	1	Since the author has already described what Joshua did to Hebron and Libnah, it may be more natural in your language to present this information first.

Alternate translation: “and killed all the Anakites who lived in the hill country, in Hebron, in Debir, in Anab, and in all of the hill country of Judah, and in all of the hill country of Israel”
11:21	j032		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Debir & Anab	1	The words **Debir** and **Anab** are the names of cities.
11:23	j036		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	And the land rested from war	1	The author is speaking of **land** as if it were a living thing that could rest.

He is using the phrase **according to their divisions** implicitly to mean that Joshua divided up the land among the tribes. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “And Joshua divided it up among the tribes and gave it to Israel for an inheritance”
11:23	j039		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לְ⁠נַחֲלָ֧ה	1	The author is using the term **inheritance** by association to mean a lasting possession that would be passed down to future generations.

12:intro	ga6k				0	# Joshua 12 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThe ULT sets the lines in 12:2–5 farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because they are part of a long list.
12:1	k3n2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	Now these {are} the kings of the land	1	As the General Notes to this chapter discuss, here the author begins to provide background information about how the Israelites divided up the land they conquered. This background information continues through Chapter 21. In this chapter, the author provides a summary of all the territories the Israelites conquered. In your translation, introduce this information in a way that would be natural in your own language and culture.
12:1	m4p7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	on the other side of the Jordan, from the rising of the sun	1	As the General Introduction to Joshua discusses, here and throughout the following chapters, the author describes the location of one place relative to another in the way that is characteristic of his culture. He means here that if someone were traveling from the territories he is about to describe to the area where most of the Israelites settled, he would be coming **from the rising of the sun**, that is, from the east. In your translation, express this in the way your culture describes the relative location of places. Alternate translation: “to the east of the Jordan River”
12:1	n9x4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	from the sunrise	1	As the General Introduction to Joshua discusses, here the author is using the term **sunrise** by association to mean the direction where the sun rises.

12:2	e5j8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	Sihon, the king of the Amorite	1	The author is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete.

12:2	g2p9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	the Amorite	1	The author is not referring to a specific **Amorite**. He means Amorites in general. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using a plural form. Alternate translation: “the Amorites”
12:2	i7k4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	ruling from Aroer, which {is} on the lip of the wadi of Arnon, and the middle of the wadi and half of Gilead and unto the Jabbok wadi, the border of the sons of Ammon,	1	Since the expression **half of Gilead** summarizes what the rest of the verse says, it may be more natural in your language to put this expression at the end of the verse. Alternate translation: “ruling from the middle of the wadi of Arnon, including Aroer on the lip of the wadi, and unto the Jabbok wadi, the border of the sons of Ammon; in all, half of Gilead”
12:2	n3m5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Aroer	1	As the General Introduction to Joshua discusses, all names in border descriptions and lists, such as are found in this chapter, are the names of cities and towns unless otherwise indicated in the biblical text, in a note, or in the UST. So the word **Aroer** is the name of a city, as are similar words throughout this chapter.
12:2	j052		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	lip	1	The author is speaking as if this **wadi** were something that had a **lip**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “edge”
12:3	i2n5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	and the Arabah unto the Sea of Kinnereth from the sunrise and unto the Sea of the Arabah	1	Since the expression **from the sunrise** applies to **the Arabah**, it may be more natural in your language to put the\\ose expressions together. Alternate translation: “and the Arabah from the sunrise from the Sea of Kinnereth to the Sea of the Arabah” or “and the Arabah east of the Jordan River, from the Sea of Kinnereth to the Sea of the Arabah”
12:3	n6p4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	the Sea of the Arabah, the Sea of Salt	1	The words **Sea of the Arabah** and **Sea of Salt** are both names for what is now known as “the Dead Sea.”

12:4	e6n2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	And the border of Og	1	The author is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete.

You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “and he ruled over half of Gilead, as far as the border with Sihon, the king of Heshbon”
12:6	p4k2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	them & it	1	The pronoun **them** refers to the kings mentioned previously, and **it** refers to their land. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “those kings … their land”
12:7	m7n5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	on the other side of the Jordan, toward the sea	1	As the General Introduction to Joshua discusses, here the author is using the expression **toward the sea** by association to mean in the direction of the Mediterranean Sea from his location, that is, the west.

12:23	e5p7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	the king of the nations in Gilgal	1	This could mean: (1) Alternate translation: “the king who ruled the people groups in the region of Gilgal” (2) Alternate translation: “the king of the city of Goyim in Gilgal”

This land had been promised to them in Numbers 32.\n\n### Driving out the people\n\nWhile Yahweh achieved many great victories through Joshua, Israel was still supposed to drive out the rest of the Canaanites.

13:1	d5k7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	had aged and had come into days & You have aged, you have come into days	1	The expressions **had aged** and **had come into days** mean similar things. The author is using them together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “was very old … You are now very old”
13:2	j053		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	and all of the Geshurite	1	Yahweh is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete.

13:2	g3m9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	the Geshurite	1	The author is not referring to a specific **Geshurite**. He means Geshurites in general. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using a plural form. Alternate translation: “the Geshurites”

13:3	p6k9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	it shall be reckoned to the Canaanite	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “you shall consider this to be Canaanite territory”
13:3	e8m3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	it shall be reckoned to the Canaanite	1	The Philistines and Geshurites were not Canaanites.

13:3	m5n7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	it shall be reckoned to the Canaanite	1	The author is using the term **Canaanite** by association to mean territory that Yahweh wants the Israelites to conquer, since he had told them to conquer all Canaanite territory.

The household also included servants. You can supply this word in your translation or use an equivalent expression.

14:4	x2n7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-exceptions	And they gave no portion to the Levites in the land if not cities for dwelling and their pasturelands for their livestock and for their property	1	If it would appear in your language that the author was making a statement and then contradicting it, you could reword this as a positive statement. Alternate translation: “The only portion that they gave to the Levites in the land was cities for dwelling and their pasturelands for their livestock and property”
14:4	p5k8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	And they gave no portion to the Levites	1	Here, **they** is an indefinite pronoun that does not have a specific referent in the immediate context. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this with a different expression that does not use an indefinite pronoun. Alternate translation: “And the Levites were given no portion”
14:6	n3m9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Jephunneh & Kenizzite	1	The word **Jephunneh** is the name of a man, and the word **Kenizzite** is the name of a people group.

14:7	m2p6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	word	1	Caleb is using the term **word** by association to mean the report he gave by using words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “a report”
14:8	m5k3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	But my brothers	1	Caleb is using the term **brothers** to describe people who are descended from the same ancestor. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “But my fellow Israelites”

If your language does not mark travel for change in elevation, you can translate such expressions more simply. Alternate translation: “went”
14:8	m3p7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	made the heart of the people melt	1	Here the **heart** represents courage, and **melt** represents losing courage. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “made the people lose their courage”

Alternate translation: “telling me that the land on which my foot had trodden would certainly be for an inheritance for me and my sons forever, since I had been full after Yahweh his God”

Alternate translation: “Because you obeyed Yahweh your God completely, the land on which your foot has trodden will be an inheritance for you and your descendants forever”
14:9	o2p5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-oathformula	If the land on which your foot has trodden will not be for an inheritance for you and for your sons unto forever	1	Following the custom of his culture, Moses is swearing an oath by stating the first part of a condition (**if**) but not the second part (“then”). If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explicitly state the second part of this condition. Alternate translation: “If the land on which your foot has walked does not become an inheritance for you and your descendants forever, then may Yahweh punish me severely”
14:9	s7k3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	the land on which your foot has trodden	1	Moses is using one part of Caleb, his **foot**, to mean all of him in the act of walking. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the land where you have walked”
14:9	m9n6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	your sons	1	Moses is speaking as if all of the descendants of Caleb were actually his **sons**. Alternate translation: “your descendants”
14:9	i5p2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	you were full after Yahweh my God	1	See how you translated the similar expression in [14:8](../14/08.md).
14:10	j057		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	behold & behold	1	In both instances, Caleb is using the term **behold** to focus his listener’s attention on what he is about to say. Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation. Alternate translation: “listen to this … listen to this”
14:10	m8n3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	this word	1	Caleb is using the term **word** by association to mean a command that Yahweh spoke by using wordds. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “this command”
14:10	i2p6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	I am a son of 85 years	1	Caleb is using a common expression of his culture to state his age. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I am 85 years old”
14:11	j060		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	Still I {am} strong today just as on the day Moses sent me. As {was} my strength then, so {is} my strength now	1	These two phrases mean basically the same thing. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine them. Alternate translation: “I have just as much strength now as I had then, on the day when Moses sent me”
14:11	i3m9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	for war, and for going out and for coming in	1	Caleb is using a common expression to refer to leadership. It is clear from verses such as [1 Kings 3:7](../1ki/03/07.md) that the expression **going out and coming in** is a general description of the work of rulers and commanders. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “both to fight in war and to command soldiers in battle”
14:12	e6p3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	and great fortified cities	1	The author is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “and that there were great fortified cities there”
14:12	i8k5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	Yahweh {will be} with me	1	Caleb is using a common expression to mean that God will help him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Yahweh will help me”
14:14	r5n2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	Hebron is to Caleb, the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite, for an inheritance unto this day, because he was full after Yahweh, the God of Israel	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “Because Caleb obeyed Yahweh completely, Hebron has belonged to him and his descendants as an inheritance unto this day”
14:14	i4m7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	he was full after Yahweh	1	See how you translated the similar expressions in [14:8](../14/08.md) and [14:9](../14/09.md).
14:15	j041		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	(Now the name of Hebron formerly {was} Kiriath Arba. He {was} a great man among the Anakites.)	1	The author is providing background information to help readers recognize that **Hebron** is the same city that they may have known as **Kiriath Arba**. He is also providing information about the man **Arba** for whom the city was originally named. In your translation, present this information in a way that would be natural in your own language and culture.
14:15	p9k6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	And the land rested from war	1	See how you translated the similar expression in [11:23](../11/23.md). Alternate translation: “And there was no more war in the land”
15:intro	ght5				0	# Joshua 15 General Notes\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\nThis chapter is about the land given to the tribe of Judah. It will be difficult to fully understand their location without a map. Further research may be needed to understand the location of their land. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
15:1	j061		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	the lot	1	The author is using the term **lot** by association to mean the territory that was assigned to the tribe of Judah by casting lots. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “the territory assigned”
15:1	i5k7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	from the wilderness of Zin in the Negev from the end of the south	1	As the General Introduction to Joshua discusses, here and throughout this chapter, the author describes the location of one place relative to another in the way that is characteristic of his culture. In your translation, express these relative locations in the way that your culture would describe them. Alternate translation: “to the wilderness of Zin in the Negev at its extreme southern end”
15:2	n3p8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	the Sea of Salt	1	See how you translated this name in [3:16](../03/16.md) and [12:3](../12/03.md). Alternate translation: “the Dead Sea”
15:2	j062		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	the tongue	1	The author is speaking of this sea as if it were a living thing that had a **tongue**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the bay”
15:3	t4n7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate	the Ascent of Akrabbim	1	**Akrabbim** is a Hebrew word that the ULT has spelled out using English letters so that readers will know how it sounds. The word means “scorpions” in Hebrew, and here it is the name of a place. In your translation you could spell this name the way it sounds in your language, or you could express its meaning as a name. Alternate translation: “Scorpion Pass”
15:3	i5k8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	then it went up	1	As the General Introduction to Joshua discusses, in Hebrew, writers and speakers generally indicated whether people were going up to a higher elevation or going down to a lower elevation when they traveled. If your language does not mark travel for change in elevation, you can translate such expressions more simply, here and throughout this chapter. Alternate translation: “then it went”
15:4	j063		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	{to} the wadi of Egypt	1	This seems to be the same body of water that is mentioned in [13:13](../13/13.md), where it is called the Shihor River. You could use that same name here if that would be helpful to your readers.
15:4	q3m9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks	This will be for you the border of the south	1	The author is not addressing all of his readers directly and telling them that this will be their border. Rather, he is quoting the words that Yahweh told Moses to speak to the Israelites in [Numbers 34:3](../num/34/03.md) about what their southern border would be as a nation. The implication is that the territory of the tribe of Judah would extend to the south all the way to this national border. You may wish to indicate that this sentence is a quotation by putting it within first-level quotation marks or by using some other punctuation or convention that your language uses to indicate a first-level quotation.
15:4	p8k4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	This will be for you the border of the south	1	Another approach to translating this sentence would be to use the past tense and the third person, as the author does in the rest of this account, to show that he is not addressing readers directly but continuing to describe the borders of the tribe of Judah. Alternate translation: “This was their southern border”
15:5	p2n7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	from the tongue	1	See how you translated the same expression in [15:2](../15/02.md). Alternate translation: “from the bay”

15:8	m7n2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	to the shoulder of the Jebusite from the south	1	The author is using the term **Jebusite**, which he explains means **Jerusalem**, by association to mean Mount Zion, the mountain on which the Jebusite city of Jerusalem was located. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “to the southern shoulder of Mount Zion”
15:8	p3k6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	to the shoulder of the Jebusite from the south	1	The author is speaking of the mountain on which **Jerusalem** was built as if it were a living thing that had a **shoulder**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “to the southern slope of Mount Zion”
15:8	p9m4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	the head of the hill	1	The author is speaking of this **hill** as if it were a living thing that had a **head**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the top of the hill”
15:9	b6k2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	to Baalah (it is Kiriath Jearim)	1	The author is providing background information to explain to readers that the city he calls **Baalah** is the same one that they know as **Kiriath Jearim**. In your translation, present this information in a way that would be natural in your own language and culture.
15:10	p4n7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	to the shoulder of Mount Jearim from the north	1	See how you translated the same expression in [15:8](../15/18.md).  Alternate translation: “to the north slope of Mount Jearim”
15:10	b8k5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	Mount Jearim & (it is Kesalon)	1	The author is providing background information to help readers understand that **Mount Jearim** was also known as **Kesalon**.

15:11	j064		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	the shoulder of Ekron to the north	1	See how you translated the same expression in [15:8](../15/18.md). Alternate translation: “the northern slope of the mound on which the city of Ekron was built”
15:11	e5k4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	And the goings out of the border were at the sea	1	As the General Introduction to Joshua discusses, when the author says **the sea**, typically he means the Mediterranean Sea. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “And the border ended at the Mediterranean Sea”
15:12	h7p3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	{was} the Great Sea and the border	1	See how you translated the similar expression in [13:23](../13/23.md). Alternate translation: “was the coast of the Great Sea”
15:12	n3k8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	{was} the Great Sea	1	See how you translated this name in [1:4](../01/04.md). Alternate translation: “was the Mediterranean Sea”
15:13	p6n2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	he gave	1	The pronoun **he** refers to Joshua. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “Joshua gave”
15:13	j058		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	according to the mouth of Yahweh to Joshua	1	The author is using the term **mouth** by association to mean the words that Yahweh spoke. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “according to what Yahweh had commanded Joshua”
15:13	b8p5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	Kiriath Arba (the father of the Anak), it {is} Hebron	1	See how you presented the similar background information that the author provides in [14:15](../14/15.md) about the former and current name of this city.
15:14	m2n9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	the three sons of Anak, Sheshai and Ahiman and Talmai, the children of Anak	1	The author is using the term **sons** to refer to the three clans that were descended from a man named **Anak**. He is using the term **children** to mean “descendants.” Alternate translation: “the three Anakite clans of Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai, who were all descendants of Anak”
15:15	b5k4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	(Now the name of Debir {was} formerly Kiriath Sepher.)	1	The author is providing background information to help readers understand that **Debir** was formerly known as **Kiriath Sepher**. In your translation, present this information in a way that would be natural in your own language and culture.
15:17	p7n3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	So he gave	1	The pronoun **he** refers to Caleb. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “So Caleb gave”
15:18	j042		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	Now it happened	1	The author is using this phrase to introduce background information that is not part of the main narrative. In your translation, introduce this information in a way that would be natural in your own language and culture.
15:18	j043		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	in the coming of her	1	The author assumes that his readers will understand what he means by this phrase. This could mean: (1) that Aksah came to Kiriath Sepher in order to marry Othniel and that she made this **request** when she arrived and saw the land that Caleb had given to him. Alternate translation: “when Aksah arrived at Kiriath Sepher” (2) that the author is using this expression to describe Aksah entering Othniel’s household as his wife. Alternate translation: “once Aksah had married Othniel”
15:18	j044		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	that she persuaded him to request the field	1	The author is leaving implicit who was to make this request. The meaning does not seem to be that Aksah persuaded Othniel that he should **request** this **field** from Caleb, since he is not the one who asks; she is. In this culture, a young man such as Othniel may not have had the standing to make this kind of request from a leader such as Caleb. So the meaning seems to be that Aksah persuaded Othniel that she should ask for the field. In this culture, a daughter may have been able to make such a request of her father. Alternate translation: “that she persuaded him to allow her to request the field”
15:18	j045		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	the field from her father	1	The author has a particular **field** in view. The narrative suggests implicitly that Caleb had given some land to Othniel but that it was arid territory. It suggests further that near this land, there was some ground that was suitable for cultivation because it was watered by springs. You could state this information explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “from her father some land that was nearby the land that he had already given to Othniel and that was watered by springs and so could be cultivated”
15:18	j046		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	What for you?	1	Caleb is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “What would you like me to do for you?”
15:19	j047		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	Give	1	This is an imperative, but it communicates a polite request rather than a command. Use a form in your language that communicates a polite request. It may be helpful to add an expression such as “please” to make this clear. Alternate translation: “Please give”
15:19	j048		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	a blessing	1	In this context, the word **blessing** is an abstract noun. It does not refer to something that someone would say to cause good and beneficial things to happen to a person. Instead, it refers to a good and beneficial thing itself. If your language does not use abstract nouns in this way, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “something that will benefit me”
15:19	j049		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense	you shall also give to me	1	Aksah is using a verb form that could either indicate what a person ought to do or what a person is going to do. This could mean: (1) that since the land Caleb gave Aksah and Othniel was dry, he also ought to give them some land with springs of water. Alternate translation: “you should also give me” (2) that Aksah is answering Caleb’s question and this is implicitly her request. Alternate translation: “my request is that you will also give me”
15:19	j050		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	springs of waters & the upper springs and the lower springs	1	Aksah and the author are using these expressions to mean by association the land on which these **springs** were located. Alternate translation: “some land that has springs of waters … some land in that area where there were upper springs and lower springs”
15:19	j051		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	springs of waters	1	It might seem that this expression contains extra information that would be unnatural to express in your language. If so, you can shorten it. Alternate translation: “springs” or “land on which there are springs”
15:20	e4n7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	This {is} the inheritance of	1	As the General Introduction to Joshua discusses, the author is using the term **inheritance** by association to mean a lasting possession that would be passed down to future generations. Alternate translation: “The following cities became the possession of”
15:21	m7k3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	at the end of the tribe of	1	The author is using the term **tribe** by association to mean the territory that belonged to this tribe. The context shows that by **end**, he means the southern end. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “at the southern end of the territory of the tribe of”
15:21	n5p8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Kabzeel and Eder and Jagur	1	As the General Introduction to Joshua discusses, these names and all of the other names in verses 22–62 are the names of cities unless the text indicates otherwise with expressions such as “the wadi of Egypt” or “the Great Sea” as in [15:47](../15/47.md).
15:25	b3k6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	and Kerioth Hezron (it is Hazor)	1	The author is providing background information to help readers understand that the city formerly known as **Kerioth Hezron** is the one they know as **Hazor**. In your translation, present this information in a way that would be natural in your own language and culture.
15:32	e8m4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	All of the cities	1	The author assumes that readers will know he means the **cities** in the southern part of Judah’s territory. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “All of the cities in the southern part of the territory of Judah”
15:33	e2p7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	In the lowlands	1	The author is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “These were the cities in the lowlands of the territory of Judah”
15:46	j065		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	{were} on the hand of Ashdod	1	The author is using the term **hand** by association to mean near or close by. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “were nearby Ashdod”
15:47	n4p2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	the wadi of Egypt	1	See how you translated this same name in [13:13](../13/13.md) and [15:4](../15/04.md). Alternate translation: “the Shihor River”
15:47	h7k5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	and the Great Sea and the border	1	See how you translated the similar expression in [13:23](../13/23.md) and [15:12](../15/12.md). Alternate translation: “and the coast of the Great Sea”
15:48	e5m8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	And in the hill country	1	The author is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “And these were the cities in the hill country of the territory of Judah”
15:49	b8k3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	and Kiriath Sannah (it is Debir)	1	The author is providing background information to help readers understand that the city formerly known as **Kiriath Sannah** is the one they know as **Debir**. In your translation, present this information in a way that would be natural in your own language and culture.
15:54	b2p6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	and Kiriath Arba (it is Hebron)	1	The author is providing background information to help readers understand that the city formerly known as **Kiriath Arba** is the one they know as **Hebron**. In your translation, present this information in a way that would be natural in your own language and culture.
15:60	b4k9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	Kiriath Baal (it is Kiriath Jearim)	1	The author is providing background information to help readers understand that the city formerly known as **Kiriath Baal** is the one they know as **Kiriath Jearim**. In your translation, present this information in a way that would be natural in your own language and culture.
15:61	e7m2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	In the wilderness	1	The author is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “These were the cities in the wilderness of the territory of Judah”
15:63	g3k8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	the Jebusite & the Jebusite	1	The author is not referring to a specific **Jebusite**. He means the Jebusite people group in general. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using a plural form. Alternate translation: “the Jebusites … the Jebusites”
16:intro	bpv3				0	# Joshua 16 General Notes\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Drive them out\n\nThe Israelites were to completely drive out the Canaanites. If they did not drive them out completely, the Canaanites would cause the Israelites to worship other gods. It was sinful to allow the Canaanites to remain in the land. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/falsegod]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\nThis chapter is about the land given to the tribe of Ephraim, one of Joseph’s sons. It will be difficult to fully understand their location without a map. Further research may be needed to understand the location of their land. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
16:1	m4n7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	the lot	1	The author is using the term **lot** by association to mean the territory that was assigned by casting lots.

If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language, here and throughout this chapter. Alternate translation: “to the waters east of Jericho”
16:3	m5n8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	toward the sea	1	As the General Introduction to Joshua discusses, here the author is using the term **sea** by association to mean the direction of the Mediterranean Sea, that is, from his perspective, the west. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language, here and throughout this chapter. Alternate translation: “westward”
16:2	otie		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	from Bethel to Luz	1	As the General Introduction to Joshua discusses, all names in border descriptions and lists, such as are found in this chapter, are the names of cities and towns unless otherwise indicated in the biblical text, in a note, or in the UST. So the words **Bethel** and **Luz** are the names of cities, as are similar words throughout this chapter.
16:3	m8k4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	to the border of the Japhletite, unto the border of Lower Beth Horon	1	The author is using the term **border** by association to mean territory. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “to the territory of the Japhletites, to the territory of Lower Beth Horon”
16:3	g3p7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	the Japhletite	1	The author is not referring to a specific **Japhletite**. He means the members of the Japhletite people group in general.

16:4	m3k8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	inherited	1	As the General Introduction to Joshua discusses, here and throughout this chapter, the author is using by association the idea of inheriting to mean receiving a lasting possession that would be passed down to future generations. Alternate translation: “received territory as a lasting possession”

17:intro	m3nk				0	# Joshua 17 General Notes\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Manasseh’s lack of faith\nEven though they were one of the largest and most powerful tribes of Israel, the tribe of Manasseh lacked faith in the power of Yahweh. This caused them many problems. It would also cause their descendants many problems. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]])\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\nThis chapter is about the land given to the tribe of Manasseh, one of Joseph’s sons. It will be difficult to fully understand their locations without a map. Further research may be needed to understand the locations of their land. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

So most of the tribal allotments went to descendants of Jacob’s sons, but the allotments described in [16:5–10](../16/05.md) and in this chapter went to descendants of Jacob’s grandsons.
17:1	e5p8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	For Makir, the firstborn of Manasseh, the father of Gilead	1	Be sure that it is clear in your translation that **Makir**, not **Manasseh**, was the **father of Gilead**. Alternate translation: “For Makir, who was the firstborn of Manasseh and who was the father of Gilead”
17:1	m7k2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	because he was a man of war, so to him	1	The author is using the singular pronouns **he** and **him**, representing Makir, by association to mean his descendants. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “because his descendants were great warriors, so to them”
17:2	p6n3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	And it was	1	The pronoun **it** refers to the territory assigned by lot on the west side of the Jordan River. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “And the territory assigned by lot on the west side of the Jordan River was”
17:3	e4k7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-exceptions	no sons were to him, if not daughters	1	If it would appear in your language that the author was making a statement and then contradicting it, you could reword this as a positive statement. Alternate translation: “the only children he had were daughters”

17:4	m3k9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	an inheritance	1	As the General Introduction to Joshua discusses, here and throughout this chapter, the term **inheritance** means by association a lasting possession that would be passed down to future generations. Alternate translation: “a lasting possession of land”
17:4	m5p7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	our brothers	1	Since, as [17:3](../17/03.md) indicates, these women had no actual **brothers**, they are using that term to refer to their relatives. Alternate translation: “the other members of our tribe”
17:4	p2k8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	And he gave	1	The pronoun **he** refers to Joshua. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “And Joshua gave”
17:4	m7n4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	according to the mouth of Yahweh	1	The author is using the term **mouth** by association to mean the words that Yahweh spoke. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “according to what Yahweh had commanded”
17:4	k3p6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship	the brothers of their father	1	Your language may have its own term or expression for this relationship. Alternate translation: “their uncles”
17:5	m4k2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	So ten portions of Manasseh fell	1	See how you translated the similar expression in [13:6](../13/06.md). Alternate translation: “So the leaders assigned ten portions of land by lot to the tribe of Manasseh”
17:5	e8p9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	So ten portions of Manasseh fell	1	The meaning in context seems to be that five of these **portions** went to the clans named in [17:2](../17/02.md) and the other five went to the daughters of Zelophehad and their descendants. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “So the leaders assigned portions of land to the five clans descended from Manasseh’s sons and to the five daughters of Zelphehad and their families”
17:5	i5k3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	which {were} from the other side of the Jordan	1	As the General Introduction to Joshua discusses, here and throughout this chapter, the author describes the location of one place relative to another from his own perspective and in the way that is characteristic of his culture. In your translation, express these relative locations in the way your culture would describe them. Alternate translation: “on the east side of the Jordan River”
17:6	m6p4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	the daughters of Manasseh & his sons	1	The author is speaking of these people as if they were the actual **daughters** and **sons** of Manasseh. Alternate translation: “the female descendants of Manasseh who had no brothers ... his male descendants”
17:7	m3k8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	which is on the face of Shechem	1	The author is using the term **face** by association to mean the area in front of something. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “which is next to Shechem”
17:8	b5p2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	The land of Tappuah was to Manasseh, but Tappuah at the border of Manasseh {was} to the sons of Ephraim	1	The author is providing background information to help readers understand that while the territory around Tappuah belonged to Manasseh, the city of Tappuah itself belonged to Ephraim. In your translation, present this information in a way that would be natural in your own language and culture.
17:9	e7k4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	and its goings out were seaward	1	As the General Introduction to Joshua discusses, when the author says **seaward**, typically he means the Mediterranean Sea. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “and the border ended at the Mediterranean Sea”
17:10	e4n9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	Southward {was} to Ephraim, and northward {was} to Manasseh	1	The author assumes that readers will understand he is referring to the land on either side of the wadi of Kanah. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “The land south of the wadi of Kanah belonged to Ephraim, while the land north of the wadi belonged to Manasseh”
17:10	p8k5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	its border	1	The pronoun **its** refers to the territory of Manasseh. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “Manasseh’s western border”
17:10	p3m7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	And it met	1	The pronoun **it** refers to the territory of Manasseh. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “And Manasseh’s territory met”
17:11	m5k2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	and its daughters	1	The author is speaking of these towns as if they were the **daughters** of the main cities. Alternate translation: “and its surrounding towns”
17:11	e9p4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	the three of a height	1	This could mean: (1) that the last three cities mentioned, **En Dor**, **Taanach**, and **Megiddo**, were located on heights. They were all near the city of **Dor**, and they may have been considered part of the “heights of Dor” mentioned in [11:2](../11/02.md). Alternate translation: “these last three cities being in the heights of Dor” (2) that the author wants readers to recognize that the city he calls **Dor** was also known as Naphoth Dor. The word translated as **a height** could be a proper name, Naphoth. Alternate translation: “the third city on this list also being known as Naphoth Dor”
17:12	g4k7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	the Canaanite & they did not dispossess him	1	The author is not referring to a specific **Canaanite**. He means the Canaanite people group in general. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using a plural form. Alternate translation: “the Canaanites … they did not dispossess them”
17:13	r5p8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-reduplication	But dispossessing, they did not dispossess him	1	The author is repeating the verb **dispossess** in order to intensify the idea that it expresses. If your language can repeat words for intensification, it would be appropriate to do that here in your translation. If not, your language may have another way of expressing the emphasis. Alternate translation: “But they definitely did not drive them out”
17:14	ID		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	Why have you given to me {as} an inheritance one lot and one portion, when I am a numerous people, since Yahweh has blessed me unto now?	1	The descendants of Joseph are using the question form for emphasis. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “You should not have given us only one lot, one portion, as an inheritance! After all, we are a numerous people, since Yahweh has blessed us unto now.”
17:14	p3k6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	to me & when I am & has blessed me	1	The author is speaking of the tribes of Joseph as if they were a single person who could speak. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly using plural pronouns, as the author himself does in verse 16. Alternate translation: “to us ... when we are ... has blessed us”
17:14	d7m4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	one lot and one portion	1	The terms **lot** and **portion** mean similar things. The descendants of Joseph are using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “only one portion of land”
17:15	p8n2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	you are & go up for yourself & and you shall clear for yourself & to you	1	Joshua is speaking to the tribes of Joseph as if they were a single person who could receive commands.

17:15	e4k9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	and you shall clear	1	The author is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “and you shall clear the land”
17:15	g6p3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	the Perizzite	1	The author is not referring to a specific **Perizzite**. He means the Perizzite people group in general. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using a plural form. Alternate translation: “the Perizzites”
17:15	i3k7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	is narrow to you	1	Joshua is using a common expression to mean there is not enough space. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “is not big enough for you”
17:16	g5m8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	and a chariot of iron {is} with every Canaanite	1	The descendants of Joseph are not referring to a specific **Canaanite** or to a specific **chariot**. They mean the members of the Canaanite people group in general and the chariots they possess. It may be more natural in your language to express these meanings using plural forms. Alternate translation: “and the Canaanites all have iron chariots”
17:16	m2k4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	and a chariot of iron	1	The metal iron was barely used during this time period, so this is not a reference to chariots entirely made of **iron**. Those would have been too heavy for any practical use in warfare anyway. It is probably a reference by association to chariots whose wheels or floor were strengthened with iron or that had iron studs or points to make them more destructive when used in ramming. Alternate translation: “chariots fitted out with iron”
17:17	m7p5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	to the house of Joseph	1	The author is speaking of the tribes descended from Joseph as if they were a **house**. He is envisioning them as if they were one household living together. Alternate translation: “to the tribes descended from Joseph”

If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly using plural pronouns. Alternate translation: “All of you are ... is to all of you all ... to all of you”
17:17	d8n3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	There will not be one lot to you	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a positive expression to translate this double negative that consists of the negative particle **not** and the term **one**, which is negative in this context. Alternate translation: “You will receive more than one lot”
17:17	apm6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	one lot	1	Joshua is using the term **lot** by association to a portion of territory assigned by lot. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language.  Alternate translation: “one portion of territory”
17:18	g2k6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	For & For	1	Joshua is using the word **For** in each instance to introduce the reason for what he has just said. Alternate translation: “You will have more than one portion because ... This is also true because”
17:18	s5p9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	and its goings out will be to you	1	The author is using one part of the territory, its **goings out** or boundaries, to mean all of it. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and all of that territory will belong to you”

18:1	r4k7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	And the land was subdued to their face	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could move this clause to the beginning of the verse, since it gives the reason for the result that the rest of the verse describes.

18:3	m6k4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	your fathers	1	Joshua is speaking as if these people were the actual **fathers** of the current generation. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “your ancestors”

18:4	i8k5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	according to the mouth of their inheritance	1	Joshua is using the expression **the mouth** to mean “the needs,” since people need food to put in their mouths.

18:5	i7k3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	from the south & from the north	1	As the General Introduction to Joshua discusses, here and throughout this chapter, the author describes the location of one place relative another from his own perspective and in the way that is characteristic of his culture. In your translation, express these relative locations in the way that your culture would describe them. Alternate translation: “in the south ... in the north” or “in the southern part of the land of Canaan ... in the northern part of the land of Canaan”
18:6	m5n8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	to the face of	1	Joshua is using the term **face** by association to mean the presence of someone. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “in the presence of”
