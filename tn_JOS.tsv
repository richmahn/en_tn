Conquest of the land of Canaan (1:1–12:24)\n    * Preparation for conquest; spies; crossing the Jordan River (1:1–5:1)\n    * Ceremonies at Gilgal; conquest of Jericho and Ai (5:2–8:29)\n    * The covenant affirmed at Shechem (8:30–35)\n    * Southern and central campaigns; northern campaigns (9:1–12:24)\n1. Settlement in the Promised Land; division of the land (13:1–22:34)\n1. Joshua’s final days (23:1–24:33)\n\n### What is the Book of Joshua about?\n\nThe Book of Joshua is about the Israelites entering and occupying the Promised Land. Joshua was the leader that replaced Moses. He led the Israelites as they fought the people living in the Promised Land. This book also tells how the Israelites divided the land among the twelve tribes. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/promisedland]])\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nThis book traditionally has the title “Joshua” because Joshua leads the people of Israel after Moses dies. Translators may create a title such as “The Book About When Joshua Led Israel.” Translators should avoid a title that suggests Joshua as the writer of the book.\n\n### Who wrote the Book of Joshua?\n\nThe book does not tell who wrote it. However, some verses in the book indicate that Joshua may have written at least part of it. Since ancient times, Jews have thought that Joshua wrote most of the book.\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### How does the Book of Joshua present the cause of historical events?\n\nIn the ancient Near East, people assumed that gods caused world events to happen in a certain way. The Book of Joshua has some similarities with this view, but there are important differences. The events in the Book of Joshua occurred because Yahweh promised the Israelites that he would give them the Promised Land. What happened also depended on whether or not the Israelites obeyed Yahweh.\n\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\n\n### What does the phrase “to this day” mean?\n\nThis phrase was used by the writer to refer to the time when he was writing. The translator should be aware that “to this day” refers to a time already passed. He must avoid giving the impression to readers that “to this day” means “to the present day.” The translator might decide to say “to this day, at the time when this was being written,” or “to this day, at the time of writing.” This Hebrew phrase occurs in Joshua 4:9; 6:25; 7:26; 8:28, 29; 10:27; 13:13; 14:14; 15:63; 16:10.\n\n### What does the phrase “all Israel” mean?\n\nThis phrase appears many times in the Book of Joshua, but it does not always mean every person in the nation of Israel. At times it means the Israelite army. At other times it means the representatives of the twelve tribes of Israel. In still other passages, it probably means a large number of the people in the nation of Israel.\n\n### When should Joshua be translated?\n\nThe Book of Joshua should probably not be translated before Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. This is because the historical events of Joshua will not be understood without the information in these previous books.

4:intro	eh7p				0	# Joshua 4 General Notes\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### God’s war\nThe conquering of the Promised Land was a special war. It was God’s war against the people of Canaan and Joshua recognized that they would only be victorious through Yahweh’s power. This is why their first act after crossing the Jordan River was to build an altar. This war was a witness to Yahweh’s power. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/promisedland]])\n\n### Crossing the Jordan River\n\nIn this chapter the words **crossing over** refer to going to the opposite bank of the Jordan River.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Chiasm\n\nHebrew poetry sometimes uses a literary a device called a “chiasm” (sometimes called “chiasmus”). A chiasm is when words or phrases are ordered in a AB-BA sequence. In [Joshua 4:7](../04/07.md) Joshua uses a chiasm. The ULT follows the Hebrew order and translates the part of this verse that contains a chiasm as “Because **the waters of the Jordan were cut off from the face of the Box of the Covenant of Yahweh** when **it crossed over in the Jordan**, **the waters of the Jordan were cut off**. (The repeated phrases are highlighted for the purpose of illustration). Notice that the identical phrase “the waters of the Jordan were cut off” is repeated and the phrase “it crossed over in the Jordan” refers to the same thing as the phrase “from the face of the Box of the Covenant of Yahweh” because the word “it” refers to “the Box of the Covenant of Yahweh.” These phrase are repeated in an AB-BA sequence: “the waters of the Jordan were cut off-from the face of the Box of the Covenant of Yahweh...it crossed over in the Jordan-the waters of the Jordan were cut off.”

You could convert the Hebrew day and month into an approximate date on the calendar that your culture uses. However, the Jews used a lunar calendar, so if you use a solar calendar, the date will be different every year and the translation will not be entirely accurate. So you may just want to give the number of the day and the name of the month on the Hebrew calendar, and say approximately what time of year that is on your calendar in a footnote.

In this verse, each occurrence of the phrase **so that** introduces a purpose clause that gives one of the two purposes for which Yahweh dried up the Jordan River and the Sea of Reeds.

When men are circumcised they are unable to move without pain or to defend themselves in battle for several days. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/circumcise]])\n\n### Manna\n\nYahweh stops providing manna in this chapter and will no longer provide them with their daily allotment of food. This does not mean Yahweh’s care and provision will stop.

The author says the same thing twice, in slightly different ways, to emphasize the intensity of the fear that these kings felt when they heard what Yahweh had done. If saying the same thing twice might be confusing for your readers, you can combine the phrases into one. Alternate translation: “then their heart melted” or “they became so afraid that they no longer had any courage to fight”

Here, **hearts** refers to courage.The **kings** were so afraid that it was as if their courage melted away like wax in a fire. Here, the word **spirit** refers to the **kings** will to fight. If your readers would not understand this, you could use equivalent idioms or use plain language. See how you translated “our hearts have melted and the spirit in a man no longer stands before your face” in [2:11](../02/11.md).

This section of the verse means that Yahweh wanted the current generation of male Israelites to be circumcised. The previous generation of male Israelites had been circumcised but they had died in the wilderness as [5:4](../05/04.md) states. The current generation of Israelite males had not yet been circumcised. Alternate translation: “and circumcise this generation of male Israelites” or “and again, circumcise the sons of Israel”

If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of the information in this verse, since the phrase **they had not listened to Yahweh** gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “Because the sons of Israel had not listened to the voice of Yahweh, to whom Yahweh had sworn to not let them see the land that Yahweh had sworn to their fathers to give to us, a land flowing with milk and honey, they walked in the wilderness 40 years, until the finishing of all the nation of the men of war who had gone out from Egypt”

Because of their sin, Yahweh withheld victory from the Israelites. Sin resulted in defeat in battle. Because they repented, Yahweh brought victory to Israel in Ai. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/repent]])\n\n### Built an altar\n\nAltars were commonly built in the Ancient Near East to commemorate important events. Several altars were built in the Book of Joshua.

In the city where he sought refuge, his case would be solved legally: “Do this so that one who unintentionally kills a person can go there. These cities will be a place of refuge from anyone who seeks to avenge the blood of a person who was killed.” (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/refuge]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/avenge]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/blood]])
