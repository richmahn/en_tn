# Connecting Statement:

The words "they" and "them" refer to the false teachers Peter speaks of in verses 12-19.

# If they have escaped ... and are again entangled ... and overcome, the last state has become worse ... than the first

This sentence is a description of a conditional statement that is true. The false teachers had at one time "escaped," but if they are again entangled ... and overcome," then "the last state has become worse ... than the first."

# the corruption of the world

The word "defilements" refers to sinful behavior that makes one morally impure. The "world" refers to human society. Alternate translation: "the defiling practices of sinful human society" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ

You can translate "knowledge" using a verbal phrase. See how you translated similar phrases in [2 Peter 1:2](../01/02.md). Alternate translation: "by knowing the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# the last state has become worse for them than the first

"their condition is worse than it was before"
