# people who try to escape ... promise freedom ... slaves of corruption

Peter speaks of people who live sinfully as if they are slaves to sin who need to be released from their captivity. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# They promise freedom to them, but they themselves are slaves of corruption

"Freedom" here is an idiom for the ability to live exactly as one wants. AT: "They promise to give them the ability to live exactly as they want to live, but they themselves cannot escape their own sinful desires"  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# For a man is a slave to whatever overcomes him

Peter speaks of a person as a slave when anything has control over that person, and that thing as the master of that person. AT: "For if something has control over a person, that person becomes like a slave to that thing" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
