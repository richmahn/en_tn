# These men are springs without water

Springs flowing with water promise refreshment for thirsty people, but "springs without water" will leave the thirsty disappointed. In the same way, false teachers, although they promise many things, are unable to do what they promise. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# mists driven by a storm

When people see storm clouds, they expect rain to fall. When the winds from the storm blow the clouds away before the rain can fall, the people are disappointed. In the same way, false teachers, although they promise many things, are unable to do what they promise. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# The gloom of thick darkness is reserved for them

The word "them" refers to the false teachers. This can be stated in active form. AT: "God has reserved the gloom of thick darkness for them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
