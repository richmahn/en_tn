## translationNotes

* **these men are like springs without water** - Just as a spring that is dried up does not provide water for physical life, their teaching does not lead to spiritual life. "They are a false place of refreshing. An empty oasis." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
* **They are like clouds that a storm drives** - Storm clouds carry rain. This rain can bring nourishing water or destructive floods. These men are like those clouds carrying destruction. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
* **They speak with vain arrogance** - Their speech is boastful without meaning.
* **They entice people through the lusts of the flesh** - They appeal to the sinful nature to engage people in immoral and sinful actions.
* **They entice people who try to escape from those who live in error** - They try to destroy people who are new to the faith.
* **They promise freedom to them, but they themselves are slaves of corruption** - They promise a false freedom, a freedom to sin for believers. But this is slavery to sin.
* **For a man is a slave to whatever overcomes him** - A man will pursue those desires he lacks self-control over. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
