## these men are like springs without water ##

Just as a spring that is dried up does not provide water for physical life, their teaching does not lead to spiritual life. "They are a false place of refreshing. An empty oasis." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

## They are like clouds that a storm drives ##

Storm clouds carry rain. This rain can bring nourishing water or destructive floods. These men are like those clouds carrying destruction. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

## They speak with vain arrogance. ##

Their speech is boastful without meaning.

## They entice people through the lusts of the flesh. ##

They appeal to the sinful nature to engage people in immoral and sinful actions.

## They entice people who try to escape from those who live in error. ##

They pry on people who are new to the faith.

## They promise freedom to them, but they themselves are slaves of corruption. ##

They promise a false freedom, a freedom to sin for believers. But this is slavery to sin.

## For a man is a slave to whatever overcomes him. ##

A man will pursue those desires he lacks self-control over. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
