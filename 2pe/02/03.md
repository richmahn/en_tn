# exploit you with deceptive words

"convince you to give them money by telling you lies"

# their condemnation has not been idle, and their destruction is not asleep

Peter speaks of "condemnation" and "destruction" as if they are persons who act. The two phrases mean basically the same thing and emphasize how soon the false teachers will be condemned. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# their condemnation has not been idle, and their destruction is not asleep

You can translate these phrases with verbs in positive terms. AT: "God will soon condemn them; he is ready to destroy them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
