* **heresies** - opinions that are contrary to the teaching of Christ and the apostles.
* **the Master who bought them** - Jesus is the Master who paid for the sins of all men through His death, burial and resurrection.
* **their sensuality** - "their" refers to the false prophet and teachers. Alternate translation: "how they behave in an extremely immoral manner"
