# 2 Peter 02 General Notes #

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Flesh #####

"Flesh" is a metaphor for a person's sinful nature. It is not the physical part of man that is sinful. "Flesh" represents the human nature that rejects all things godly and desires what is sinful. This is the condition of all humans before they receive the Holy Spirit by believing in Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/flesh]])

##### Implicit information #####
There are several analogies in 2:4-8 that are difficult to understand if the Old Testament has not yet been translated. Further explanation may be necessary. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
