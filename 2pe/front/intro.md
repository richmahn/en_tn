#### Who wrote the Book of 2 Peter? ####

The author identified himself as Simon Peter. Simon Peter was an apostle and also wrote 1 Peter. Peter wrote this letter probably while in a prison in Rome just before he died. Peter called this letter his second letter, so we can date it after 1 Peter. He addressed the letter to the same audience as his first letter. This was probably Christians scattered throughout Asia Minor. 

#### What is the Book of 2 Peter about? ####

Peter wrote this letter in order to encourage believers to live good lives. He warned them about false teachers who were saying Jesus was taking too long to return. He told them that Jesus was not slow in returning. Instead God was giving people time to repent so that they would be saved.

#### How should the title of this book be translated? ####

Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, "2 Peter" or "Second Peter." Or they may choose a clearer title, such as "The Second Letter from Peter" or "The Second Letter Peter Wrote." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts ##

#### Who were the people Peter spoke against? ####

It is possible that the people Peter spoke against were those who would eventually become known as Gnostics. These teachers distorted the teachings of scripture for their own gain. They lived in immoral ways and taught others to do the same. 

#### What does it mean that God inspired Scripture? ####

The doctrine of scripture is a very important one. 2 Peter helps readers to understand that while each writer of scripture has his own distinct way of writing, God is the true author of scripture (1:20-21).
