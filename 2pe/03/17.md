# Connecting Statement:

Peter finishes instructing the believers and ends his letter.

# since you know about these things

"These things" refers to the truths about the patience of God and the teachings of these false teachers.

# guard yourselves

"protect yourselves"

# so that you are not led astray by the deceit of lawless people

Here "led astray" is a metaphor for being persuaded to do something wrong. This can be stated in active form. AT: "so that lawless people do not deceive you and cause you do something wrong" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# you lose your own faithfulness

Faithfulness is spoken of as if it were a possession that believers could lose. AT: "you stop being faithful" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
