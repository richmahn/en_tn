## They wilfully forget this ##

mockers say that nothing has changed since the creation and they purposely choose to forget.

## that the heavens and the earth were established out of water and through water, long ago, by the word of God ##

"God spoke and the heavens existed and the earth came out of the water and also separated by water"

## and that through his word and the water the world at that time, being flooded, was destroyed ##

"The same word that God used to create the world he used to destroy the existing world with a flood"

## that same word ##

"the word of God"

## and that the heavens and the earth are reserved by that same word for fire ##

"God's word is reserving the heavens and earth for fire."

## being reserved for the day of judgment and the destruction of the ungodly people ##

Heavens and earth are being kept until God judges the ungodly people.
