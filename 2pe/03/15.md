# consider the patience of our Lord to be salvation

Because the Lord is patient, the day of judgment has not yet happened. This gives people an opportunity to repent and be saved, as he explained in [2 Peter 3:9](../03/09.md). Alternate translation: "Also, think about the patience of our Lord as giving you an opportunity to repent and be saved" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# according to the wisdom that was given to him

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "according to the wisdom that God gave to him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
