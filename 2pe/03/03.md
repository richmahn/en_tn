# Know this first

"Know this as the most important thing." See how you translated this in [2 Peter 1:20](../01/20.md).

# proceed according to their own desires

Here the word "desires" refers to sinful desires that are opposed to God's will. Alternate translation: "live according to their own sinful desires" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# proceed

act, behave
