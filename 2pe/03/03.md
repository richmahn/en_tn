## translationNotes

* **Know this first** - "this is most important to understand"
* **"Where is the promise of his return?** - The mockers are being sarcastic in asking this and are not expecting an answer. AT: "The promise that Jesus would return is not true." (See [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **all things remain the same since the beginning of creation** - This is in reference to the basic order of life since the fall of man. People are born and people die. They marry and are given in marriage. There is continued fighting and sin. AT: "life's hardships remains the same since the beginning, the reign of the Messiah has not come to make our life easy". (See [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
