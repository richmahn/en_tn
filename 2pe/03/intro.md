# 2 Peter 03 General Notes #

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Fire #####
Fire is related to destruction and, because of this, it is associated with punishment.

##### Day of the Lord #####
The exact time of the coming day of the Lord will come as a surprise to the world. This is what the simile "like a thief in the night" means. Because of this, Christians are to be prepared for the coming of the Lord. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/dayofthelord]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
