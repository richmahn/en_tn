# Connecting Statement:

Peter begins to tell the believers how they should live as they wait for the day of the Lord.

# Since all these things will be destroyed in this way

This can be stated in active form. AT: "Since God will destroy all these things in this way" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# what kind of people should you be?

Peter uses this rhetorical question to emphasize what he will say next, that they "should live holy and godly lives." AT: "you know what kind of people you should be." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# the heavens will be destroyed by fire, and the elements will be melted in great heat

This can be stated in active form. AT: "God will destroy the heavens by fire, and he will melt the elements in great heat" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# the elements

Possible meanings are 1) the heavenly bodies, such as the sun, moon, and stars or 2) the things that make up heaven and earth, such as soil, air, fire, and water. See how you translated this in [2 Peter 3:10](./10.md).

# where righteousness will dwell

Peter speaks of "righteousness" as if it were a person. This is a metonym for people who are righteous. AT: "where righteous people will dwell" or "where people will live righteously" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
