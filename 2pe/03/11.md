# Connecting Statement:

Peter begins to tell the believers how they should live as they wait for the day of the Lord.

# Since all these things will be destroyed in this way

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "Since God will destroy all these things in this way" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# what kind of people should you be?

Peter uses this rhetorical question to emphasize what he will say next, that they "should live holy and godly lives." Alternate translation: "you know what kind of people you should be." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
