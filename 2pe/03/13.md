# where righteousness will dwell

Peter speaks of "righteousness" as if it were a person. This is a metonym for people who are righteous. Alternate translation: "where righteous people will dwell" or "where people will live righteously" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
