# 2 Peter 01 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Peter formally introduces this letter in verses 1-2. Writers often began letters in this way in the ancient Near East.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Knowledge of God #####
Having knowledge of God means to belong to him or to have a relationship with him. Here, "knowledge" is more than just mentally knowing about God. It is a knowledge that causes God to save a person and to give him grace and peace. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/know]])

##### Living godly lives #####
Peter teaches that God has given believers all that they need for living godly lives. Therefore, believers should do everything they can to obey God more and more. If believers continue to do this, then they will be effective and productive through their relationship with Jesus. However, if believers do not continue living godly lives, then it is like they have forgotten what God did through Christ to save them. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/godly]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/save]])

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### The truth of Scripture #####
Peter teaches that the prophecies in Scripture were not made up by men. The Holy Spirit revealed God's message to the men spoke them or wrote them down. Also, Peter and the other apostles did not make up the stories they tell people about Jesus. They witnessed what Jesus did and heard God called Jesus his son.
