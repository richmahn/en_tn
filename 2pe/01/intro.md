# 2 Peter 01 General Notes #

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Knowing God #####
Christian spiritual growth is often described as knowing God more or knowing God better. This is because growing Christians understand the things of God better as they grow. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/spirit]])

##### Forgetting what God has done #####
Peter believes Christians who are not leading godly lives have forgotten the cost of their salvation. He reasons: if they remembered their former lives and what Jesus has done, they would be sufficiently motivated to live godly lives. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/godly]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/save]])

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### Divine revelation #####
Peter describes Christianity as a religion which has been revealed and proved by God, and it is therefore implied that it is not a creation of man, like all other religions (except Judaism). (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/reveal]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
