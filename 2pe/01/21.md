# men spoke from God when they were carried along by the Holy Spirit

Peter speaks of the Holy Spirit helping the prophets to write what God wanted them to write as if the Holy Spirit was carrying them from one place to another. Alternate translation: "men spoke from God as the Holy Spirit directed them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
