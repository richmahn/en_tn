# to stir you up by way of reminder

Here the word "stir" means to awaken someone from sleep. Peter speaks of causing his readers to think about these things as if he were waking them from sleep. Alternate translation: "to remind you of these things so that you will think about them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# as long as I am in this tent ... the putting off of my tent will be soon

Peter speaks of his body as if it were a tent that he is wearing and will take off. Being in his body represents being alive, and taking it off represents dying. Alternate translation: "as long as I am in this body ... I will soon take off this body" or "as long as I am alive ... I will die soon" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
