# Connecting Statement:

Peter tells the believers about his obligation to continue reminding them and teaching them.

# to remind you of these things

Here the words "these things" refers to everything that Peter has said in the previous verses.

# you are strong in the truth

"you strongly believe the truth of these things"

# to stir you up by way of reminder

Here the word "stir" means to awaken someone from sleep. Peter speaks of causing his readers to think about these things as if he were waking them from sleep. AT: "to remind you of these things so that you will think about them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# as long as I am in this tent ... the putting off of my tent will be soon

Peter speaks of his body as if it were a tent that he is wearing and will take off. Being in his body represents being alive, and taking it off represents dying. AT: "as long as I am in this body ... I will soon take off this body" or "as long as I am alive ... I will die soon" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])

# after my departure

Peter speaks of his death as if he were leaving one place to go to another. AT: "after my death" or "after I die" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
