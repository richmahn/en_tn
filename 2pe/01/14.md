# as long as I am in this tent ... the putting off of my tent will be soon

Peter speaks of his body as if it were a tent that he is wearing and will take off. Being in his body represents being alive, and taking it off represents dying. AT: "as long as I am in this body ... I will soon take off this body" or "as long as I am alive ... I will die soon" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
