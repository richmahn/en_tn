# General Information:

Peter identifies himself as the writer and identifies and greets the believers he is writing to.

# slave and apostle of Jesus Christ

Peter speaks of being Jesus Christ's servant. He also was given the position and authority of being Christ's apostle.

# to those who have received the same precious faith

That these people have received faith implies that God has given that faith to them. Alternate translation: "to those to whom God has given the same precious faith" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# to those who have received

"to you who have received." Peter addresses all believers who may read this letter.

# we have received

Here the word "we" refers to Peter and the other apostles, but not to those to whom he is writing. Alternate translation: "we apostles have received" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
