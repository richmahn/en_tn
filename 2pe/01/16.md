# Connecting Statement:

Peter continues to explain his teachings to the believers and explains why they are trustworthy.

# For we did not follow cleverly invented myths

Here the word "we" refers to Peter and the other apostles, but not to his readers. AT: "For we apostles did not follow cleverly made-up stories" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

# the power and the appearance

These two phrases may refer to the same thing and be translated as a single phrase. AT: "the powerful coming" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])

# the appearance of our Lord Jesus Christ

Possible meanings are 1) the future second coming of Jesus or 2) the past appearance of Jesus during the Transfiguration.

# our Lord Jesus Christ

Here the word "our" refers to all believers. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-inclusive]])

# when a voice was brought to him by the majestic Glory

This can be stated in active form. AT: "when he heard a voice come from the majestic Glory" or "when the majestic Glory spoke to him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# the majestic Glory

Peter refers to God in terms of his glory. This is a euphemism that avoids using God's name, out of reverence for him. AT: "God, the supreme Glory," (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])

# We heard this voice that came out of heaven

Peter is referring to himself and to the disciples James and John, who heard the voice of God.

# we were with him

"we were with Jesus"
