Peter continues to talk to the believers.

## Therefore ##

The word "therefore" begins the response of the believer to what was previously stated.

## make your calling and election sure for yourselves ##

"calling" refers to the general invitation of salvation by God to the all people. "election" refers to the specific people that God has chosen. These two words have similar meaning. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

## you will not stumble ##

You will not fail morally or spiritually.
