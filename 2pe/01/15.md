# you may be always able to remember these things

Here the words "these things" refers to everything that Peter has said in the previous verses.

# after my departure

Peter speaks of his death as if he were leaving one place to go to another. Alternate translation: "after my death" or "after I die" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
