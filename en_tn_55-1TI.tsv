Paul and Timothy<br>- Warning about false teachers (1:3-11)<br>- Paul thankful for what Christ has done in his ministry (1:12-17)<br>- He calls Timothy to fight in this spiritual battle (1:18-20)<br>1. Prayer for all (2:1-8)<br>1. Roles and responsibilities in the church (2:9-6:2)<br>1. Warnings<br>- Second warning about false teachers (6:3-5)<br>- Money (6:6-10)<br>1. Description of a man of God (6:11-16)<br>1. Note to the wealthy people (6:17-19)<br>1. Closing words to Timothy (6:20,21)<br><br>#### Who wrote the Book of 1 Timothy?<br><br>Paul wrote 1 Timothy. Paul was from the city of Tarsus. He had been known as Saul in his early life. Before becoming a Christian, Paul was a Pharisee. He persecuted Christians. After he became a Christian, he traveled several times throughout the Roman Empire telling people about Jesus.<br><br>This book is the first letter Paul wrote to Timothy. Timothy was his disciple and close friend. Paul probably wrote it near the end of his life.<br><br>#### What is the Book of 1 Timothy about?<br><br>Paul had left Timothy in the city of Ephesus to help the believers there. Paul wrote this letter to instruct Timothy about various matters. The topics he addressed included church worship, qualifications for church leaders, and warnings against false teachers. This letter shows how Paul was training Timothy to be a leader among the churches.<br><br>#### How should the title of this book be translated?<br><br>Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, "1 Timothy" or "First Timothy." Or they may choose a clearer title, such as "Paul's First Letter to Timothy." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])<br><br>## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts<br><br>#### What is discipleship?<br><br>Discipleship is the process of making people to be disciples of Christ. The goal of discipleship is to encourage other Christians to be more like Christ. This letter gives many instructions about how a leader should train a less mature Christian. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/disciple]])<br><br>## Part 3: Important Translation Issues<br><br>##### Singular and plural "you"<br>In this book, the word "I" refers to Paul. Also, the word "you" is almost always singular and refers to Timothy. The exception to this is 6:21. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])<br><br>#### What did Paul mean by the expression "in Christ," "in the Lord," etc.?<br><br>Paul meant to express the idea of a very close union with Christ and the believers. Please see the introduction to the Book of Romans for more details about this kind of expression.<br><br>#### What are the major textual issues in the text of the Book of 1 Timothy?<br><br>For the following verse, modern versions of the Bible differ from older versions. The ULT text has the modern reading and puts the older reading in a footnote. If a translation of the Bible exists in the general region, translators should consider using the reading found in those versions. If not, translators are advised to follow the modern reading.<br><br>* "godliness is a way to get more money." Some older versions of the Bible read this way, "godliness is a way to get more money: withdraw from such things." (6:5)<br><br>(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])<br>
1TI	01	intro	a4v2	1 Timothy 01 General Notes		0		# 1 Timothy 01 General Notes<br>#### Structure and formatting<br><br>Paul formally introduces this letter in verses 1-2. Writers often began letters in this way in the ancient Near East.<br><br>#### Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>##### Spiritual children<br>In this chapter, Paul calls Timothy a "son" and his "child." Paul discipled Timothy as a Christian and a church leader. Paul may also have led him to believe in Christ. Therefore, Paul called Timothy his "son in the faith." (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/disciple]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/spirit]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])<br><br>##### Genealogies<br><br>Genealogies are lists that record a person's ancestors or descendants. Jews used genealogies to choose the right man to become king. They did this because only a son of a king could normally become king. They also showed from what tribe and family they came. For example, priests came from the tribe of Levi and the family of Aaron. Most important people had records of their genealogies.<br><br>#### Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>##### Play on words<br>The phrase "the law is good if one uses it lawfully" is a play on words. The words "law" and "lawfully" sound similar in the original language.<br>
