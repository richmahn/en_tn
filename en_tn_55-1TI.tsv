1TI	front	intro	wy83			0		# Introduction to 1 Timothy<br><br>## Part 1: General Introduction<br><br>### Outline of the Book of 1 Timothy<br><br>In this letter, Paul alternates between personal commands to Timothy that empower him to act as his representative and with his authority, and instructions for how followers of Jesus should live in community.<br><br>1. Greetings (1:1-2)<br>2. Paul commands Timothy to tell people not to teach false doctrines (1:3-20)<br>3. Paul gives instructions about how to re-establish order and decency in the church (2:1-15)<br>4. Paul gives instructions about how to ensure that elders and deacons are properly qualified (3:1-13)<br>5. Paul commands Timothy regarding his own personal conduct (3:14-5:2)<br>6. Paul gives instructions to ensure church support for worthy widows (5:3-16) and elders (5:17-20)<br>7. Paul commands Timothy that he must be impartial (5:21-25)<br>8. Paul gives instructions to ensure order in master-servant relationships (6:1-2a)<br>9. Paul commands Timothy regarding how he should teach and conduct himself (6:2b-16)<br>10. Paul gives instructions for how people who are rich should live (6:17-19)<br>11. Paul commands Timothy to guard what has been entrusted to his care (6:20-21a)<br>12. Closing blessing to the whole church (6:21b)<br><br>### Who wrote the Book of 1 Timothy?<br><br>A man named Paul wrote 1 Timothy. Paul was from the city of Tarsus. He had been known as Saul in his early life. Before becoming a Christian, Paul was a Pharisee. He persecuted Christians. After he became a Christian, he traveled several times throughout the Roman Empire telling people about Jesus.<br><br>Paul may have written other letters to Timothy, but this is the earliest one that we still have. That is why it is known as 1 Timothy or First Timothy. Timothy was Paul’s disciple and close friend. Paul probably wrote this letter near the end of his life.<br><br>### What is the Book of 1 Timothy about?<br><br>Paul had left Timothy in the city of Ephesus to help the believers there. Paul wrote this letter to instruct Timothy about various matters. The topics he addressed included church worship, qualifications for church leaders, and warnings against false teachers. This letter shows how Paul was training Timothy to be a leader among the churches while Timothy himself trained other leaders.<br><br>### How should the title of this book be translated?<br><br>Translators may choose to call this book by its customary title, “1 Timothy” or “First Timothy.” Or they may choose a different title, such as “Paul’s First Letter to Timothy.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])<br><br>## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts<br><br>### What is discipleship?<br><br>Discipleship is the process of making people to be disciples of Christ. The goal of discipleship is to encourage other Christians to be more like Christ. This letter gives many instructions about how a leader should train a less mature Christian. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/disciple]])<br><br>## Part 3: Important Translation Issues<br><br>### What did Paul mean by the expression “in Christ”?<br><br>Paul meant to express the idea of a very close union with Christ and the believers. Please see the introduction to the Book of Romans for more details about this kind of expression.<br><br>### What are the major textual issues in the text of the book of 1 Timothy?<br><br>In [6:5](../06/05.md), the oldest Greek manuscripts differ from later Greek manuscripts. Modern translations may also differ depending on the Greek manuscript that they translate from. The ULT text translates the Greek from the oldest manuscripts and puts the differences from later manuscripts in a footnote. If a translation of the Bible exists in the general region, translators should consider following the decision in that translation. If not, translators are advised to follow the oldest Greek manuscripts as reflected in the ULT text. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
1TI	1	intro	a4v2			0		# 1 Timothy 01 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Paul formally introduces this letter in verses 1-2. Writers often began letters in this way in the ancient Near East.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Spiritual children<br>In this chapter, Paul calls Timothy a “son” and his “child.” Paul discipled Timothy as a Christian and a church leader. Paul may also have led him to believe in Christ. Therefore, Paul called Timothy his “son in the faith.” (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/disciple]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/spirit]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])<br><br>### Metaphor<br><br>In this chapter Paul speaks figuratively of people who are not fulfilling the purpose of their faith as if they had “missed the mark” that they were aiming at, as if they had “turned away” down a wrong path, and as if they had been “shipwrecked.” He speaks figuratively of following Jesus faithfully as “fighting the good fight.”
1TI	1	1	i3zz		Παῦλος	1	Paul	In the culture of this time, letter writers would give their own names first. Your language may have a particular way of introducing the author of a letter, and if it would be helpful to your readers, you could use it here. Immediately after introducing the writer, you might also want to indicate to whom the letter was written. Alternate translation: “I, Paul, am the one writing this letter to you, Timothy”
1TI	1	1	xl6d		κατ’ ἐπιταγὴν Θεοῦ	1	by the command of God	Alternate translation: “by the authority of God”

1TI	1	2	pyi6	figs-metaphor	γνησίῳ τέκνῳ	1	a true son	Paul speaks of his close relationship to Timothy as though they were father and son. This shows Paul’s sincere love and approval of Timothy. It is also likely that Paul personally led Timothy to trust in Christ. That would be another reason why Paul considered him to be like his own child, since Timothy entered his new life as a follower of Jesus because of Paul. Alternate translation: “who is truly like a son to me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1TI	1	2	rd5v		χάρις, ἔλεος, εἰρήνη	1	Grace, mercy, peace	In this culture, letter writers would offer a good wish for the recipient before introducing the main business of the letter. Alternate translation: “I hope you are experiencing God’s kindness, mercy, and peace”
1TI	1	2	p4lz	guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	Θεοῦ Πατρὸς	1	God the Father	Here, **Father** is an important title for God. Alternate translation: “God, who is our Father” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])

1TI	1	3	k35a	figs-yousingular	σε	1	you	In this letter, with one exception, the words **you**, **your**, and **yourself** refer to Timothy and so are singular. A note will discuss the one exception in [6:21](../06/21.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
1TI	1	3	amp4		προσμεῖναι ἐν Ἐφέσῳ	1	remain in Ephesus	“wait for me there in the city of Ephesus”

1TI	1	3	t113		τισὶν	1	certain ones	Alternate translation: “certain people”
1TI	1	3	v4g2	figs-explicit	ἑτεροδιδασκαλεῖν	1	teach differently	The implication is that these people were not teaching in a different way, but teaching different things than what Paul and Timothy taught. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “a different doctrine from what we teach” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1TI	1	4	pw2h		μύθοις	1	fables	These were fanciful stories of some kind, perhaps about the supposed exploits of various spiritual beings. But since we no longer know exactly what these stories were about, it would probably be best to use a general term for them. Alternate translation: “made-up stories”
1TI	1	4	qpv9	figs-hyperbole	γενεαλογίαις ἀπεράντοις	1	endless genealogies	Paul uses the term **endless** as an exaggeration to emphasize that these are very long. Alternate translation: “lists of names that seem as if they will never end” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
1TI	1	4	ft33		γενεαλογίαις	1	genealogies	Usually, this term refers to a record of a person’s ancestors. However, in this case it could also mean a record of the supposed ancestors of spiritual beings. Alternate translation: “lists of names”
1TI	1	4	qb9l		αἵτινες ἐκζητήσεις παρέχουσι	1	which promote arguments	The people were debating about these stories and lists of names, but no one could know for certain whether they were true. Alternate translation: “these make people disagree angrily”
1TI	1	4	eu9f	figs-abstractnouns	οἰκονομίαν Θεοῦ	1	rather than the stewardship of God, which is by faith	If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **stewardship** with a concrete noun such as “plan” or “work.” Alternate translations: “helping us to understand God’s plan to save us” or “helping us to do God’s work” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1TI	1	4	p2sr	figs-abstractnouns	τὴν ἐν πίστει	1		If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **faith** with a verb such as “trust” or “believe.” Alternate translations: “which we learn by believing in God” or “which we do by trusting in God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1TI	1	5	myi5		δὲ	1	Now	Paul uses this word to introduce background information that will help Timothy understand the purpose of what he is commanding him. You can translate it with a word or phrase in your language that introduces background information.
1TI	1	5	iwnk	grammar-connect-logic-goal	τὸ δὲ τέλος τῆς παραγγελίας ἐστὶν	1		Here Paul is expressing to Timothy the **goal** or the outcome that he desires from the commands that Paul gave him. Alternate translation: “I am commanding these things in order to get this result” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
1TI	1	5	l7un		παραγγελίας	1	command	This refers to the instructions that Paul has given Timothy in [1:3](../01/03.md) and [1:4](../01/04.md).
1TI	1	5	i9rs	figs-explicit	ἐστὶν ἀγάπη	1	is love	That God’s people would show **love** is the goal of the command. If it is necessary to include the object of “love,” you can say “each other” or “others.” This may also include love for God. Alternate translation: “is that God’s people would love others” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1TI	1	5	t123	figs-metaphor	ἐκ καθαρᾶς καρδίας	1	from a pure heart	Here, the **heart** figuratively represents a person’s thoughts and inclinations. Alternate translation: “from a desire for only what is good” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1TI	1	5	mbe6	figs-metonymy	ἐκ καθαρᾶς καρδίας	1	from a pure heart	Here, **pure** figuratively indicates that the person wants only good things and does not have mixed motives that also include some bad ones. Alternate translation: “from a desire for only what is good” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1TI	1	5	ar8t		συνειδήσεως ἀγαθῆς	1	a good conscience	Your translation should make it clear that love is the one goal of the command and is followed by three things that lead to this love. This is the second thing, after “a pure heart.” Alternate translation: “and from a conscience that leads a person to choose right instead of wrong”
1TI	1	5	m53g		πίστεως ἀνυποκρίτου	1	a sincere faith	This is the third thing that leads to love, which is the one goal of the command. It is not a third goal of the command. Alternate translations: “and from faith that is genuine” or “and from faith that is without hypocrisy”
1TI	1	5	zziu	figs-abstractnouns	πίστεως ἀνυποκρίτου	1		If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **faith** with a verb such as “trust” or “believe.” Here, **faith** could mean (1) trust in God or (2) belief in true teaching about God. Alternate translations: “firmly trusting in God” or “sincerely believing the true message about God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1TI	1	6	j4z3	figs-metaphor	τινες ἀστοχήσαντες	1	some, having missed the mark	Paul speaks figuratively of faith in Christ as if it were a target that people should aim at. Paul means that some people are not fulfilling the purpose of their faith, which is to love, as he has just explained.

1TI	1	6	se38	figs-metaphor	ἐξετράπησαν εἰς	1	have turned away	Here, **turned away** figuratively means these people have stopped doing what God has commanded. Alternate translation: “are no longer doing what God commands. Instead of that, they just engage in” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1TI	1	7	v28u	figs-explicit	νομοδιδάσκαλοι	1	teachers of the law	Here, **law** refers specifically to the law of Moses. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly, as in the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1TI	1	7	kz8x	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	μὴ νοοῦντες	1	not understanding	If the contrast is not clear in your language between what these people want to be (teachers of the law) and their ability to do it, you may want to mark the contrast. Alternate translations: “but not understanding” or “and yet they do not understand” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
1TI	1	7	t131	figs-doublenegatives	μὴ…μήτε…μήτε	1	not…either…or	Paul uses a triple negative in Greek for emphasis here, “not … neither … nor.” None of these negatives cancel each other to create a positive meaning. Instead, the negative meaning is retained throughout. If your language uses double negatives for emphasis that do not cancel one another, it would be appropriate to use that construction here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
1TI	1	7	t132	figs-parallelism	ἃ λέγουσιν, μήτε περὶ τίνων διαβεβαιοῦνται	1	what they are saying or about which they make confident affirmations	These two phrases mean similar things. Paul uses the repetition for emphasis. You do not need to put both phrases in your translation if that might be confusing for your readers. Alternate translation: “the things that they say so confidently are true” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
1TI	1	8	d6dz		οἴδαμεν δὲ ὅτι καλὸς ὁ νόμος	1	we know that the law is good	Alternate translations: “we understand that the law is useful” or “we understand that the law is beneficial”
1TI	1	8	t134	figs-exclusive	οἴδαμεν	1	we know	In this letter, Paul uses the words **we**, **us,** and **our** to refer either to Timothy and himself, or else to all believers, which would also include the two of them. So generally, these words include the addressee. A note will discuss the one possible exception in [4:10](../04/10.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
1TI	1	8	r86g		ἐάν τις αὐτῷ νομίμως χρῆται	1	if one uses it lawfully	Alternate translations: “if a person uses it correctly” or “if a person uses it in the way that God intended”

Alternate translation: “God did not make the law for people who are righteous” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1TI	1	9	dl5l	figs-nominaladj	δικαίῳ	1	the righteous	Paul is using this adjective as a noun, to refer to a class of people that it describes. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate it with a noun phrase. Alternate translation: “for people who are righteous” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
1TI	1	9	t139	figs-nominaladj	ἀνόμοις δὲ καὶ ἀνυποτάκτοις, ἀσεβέσι καὶ ἁμαρτωλοῖς, ἀνοσίοις καὶ βεβήλοις	1	the lawless and the rebellious, the ungodly and the sinful, the godless and the profane	Paul is also using these adjectives as nouns to refer to the classes of people that they describe. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate each of these adjectives with a noun phrase. Alternate translation: “people who break the law, people who defy authority, people who do not honor God, people who commit sins, people who live as if God did not matter, people who live as if nothing was sacred” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
1TI	1	9	t141		πατρολῴαις καὶ μητρολῴαις, ἀνδροφόνοις	1	father-killers and mother-killers, man-slayers	In this list Paul uses several compound words to express his meaning concisely and vividly. In each case the first term in the compound, a noun, is the object of the second term in the compound, a verb. Three of these compound words are in this verse, and two more are in the next verse. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate them either with single terms or with phrases. Alternate translations: “patricides and matricides, murders” or “people who kill other people, even their own fathers and mothers”
1TI	1	9	t142	figs-gendernotations	ἀνδροφόνοις	1	man-slayers	Paul uses the term **man** here in a generic sense that includes both men and women. Alternate translation: “murderers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
1TI	1	10	y5dx	figs-nominaladj	πόρνοις	1	the immoral	Paul is using this adjective as a noun to refer to a class of people that it describes.

1TI	1	10	v1gh	figs-idiom	ἀρσενοκοίταις	1	male-liers	This is the fourth compound word on the list. The term “lie” figuratively means to have sexual relations. Alternate translation: “men who have sexual relations with other males” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1TI	1	10	bzw4	figs-gendernotations	ἀνδραποδισταῖς	1	man-stealers	This is the fifth and last compound word on the list. Paul uses the term **man** here in a generic sense that includes both men and women. Alternate translation: “people who kidnap other people to sell them as slaves” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
1TI	1	10	gg42		καὶ εἴ τι ἕτερον τῇ ὑγιαινούσῃ διδασκαλίᾳ ἀντίκειται	1	and if anything else is contrary to healthy teaching	Here Paul leaves out some of the words that, in many languages, a sentence would need to be complete. He means that if anything else is contrary to healthy teaching, then the law is made for people who do that, too. Alternate translation: “and for people who do anything else that is against wholesome teaching”
1TI	1	10	t147	figs-metonymy	τῇ ὑγιαινούσῃ διδασκαλίᾳ	1	healthy teaching	This is a figurative way to say that the teaching is good and reliable in every way and has no defect or corruption. A person with a healthy mind would recognize this teaching as correct. Alternate translation: “correct teaching” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1TI	1	11	mg4t		τὸ εὐαγγέλιον τῆς δόξης τοῦ μακαρίου Θεοῦ	1	to the gospel of glory of the blessed God	This could mean one of two things. Alternate translations: “the gospel about the glory that belongs to the blessed God” or “the glorious gospel about the blessed God”
1TI	1	11	a58d	figs-activepassive	ὃ ἐπιστεύθην ἐγώ	1	with which I have been entrusted	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who did the action.

1TI	1	12	ff1n	figs-metaphor	θέμενος εἰς διακονίαν	1	placing me into service	Paul speaks of the task of serving God as if it were a location that one could be placed in. Alternate translations: “he assigned me to serve him” or “he appointed me as his servant” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1TI	1	13	q75p	figs-explicit	ὄντα βλάσφημον	1	being a blasphemer	Paul is referring to his character before he believed in Jesus.

Alternate translation: “I did not act the way God would have trusted me to act, but that was because I did not know what I was doing, and so Jesus had mercy on me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
1TI	1	13	nv6k	figs-activepassive	ἠλεήθην	1	I was shown mercy	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who did the action. Alternate translation: “Jesus had mercy on me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1TI	1	14	t158		δὲ	1	Indeed	Paul uses this word to introduce an expanded description of the way Jesus treated him mercifully even though he persecuted the followers of Jesus.

1TI	1	14	z5lv	figs-idiom	μετὰ πίστεως καὶ ἀγάπης τῆς ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ	1	with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus	This could mean one of two things: (1) Paul could be referring to faith and love that he received from Jesus when he became **in** him, which would mean figuratively “in relationship with” him. Alternate translation: “and enabled me to trust him and love him” (2) Paul could be referring to the faith and love that Jesus himself possesses and could be saying that these were the basis of the mercy that Jesus showed him. Alternate translation: “because he believed in me and loved me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1TI	1	15	z48s		πιστὸς ὁ λόγος	1	This word is trustworthy	In this context, the term **word** refers to an entire statement. Alternate translation: “this statement is dependable”
1TI	1	15	rh2r		καὶ πάσης ἀποδοχῆς ἄξιος	1	and worthy of all acceptance	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say who does this action. Alternate translations: “and we should believe it without any doubt” or “and we should have full confidence in it”
1TI	1	15	t163	figs-quotemarks	ὅτι	1		Paul uses this term to introduce a direct quotation.

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
1TI	1	15	t164		ὧν πρῶτός εἰμι ἐγώ	1	of whom I am the first	Here the term **first** has the sense of the superlative example of a class, in this case a negative class. Alternate translation: “and I am the worst one of all”
1TI	1	16	z5kg	figs-activepassive	ἠλεήθην	1	I was shown mercy	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who did the action. Alternate translation: “Jesus had mercy on me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

1TI	1	17	k9sc		δὲ	1	Now	Paul uses this word to introduce a change in what he is writing. As a result of what he has been teaching Timothy, he now writes a blessing to and about God. Use a word to indicate this change in your language, such as “so” or “now.”
1TI	1	17	ts5z	figs-abstractnouns	τιμὴ καὶ δόξα	1	be honor and glory	If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the ideas behind the abstract nouns **honor** and **glory** with verbs.

1TI	1	18	b6uq	figs-metaphor	τέκνον	1	child	Paul speaks of his close relationship to Timothy as though they were father and son. This shows Paul’s sincere love and approval of Timothy. It is also likely that Paul personally led Timothy to trust in Christ, and that would be another reason why Paul considered him to be like his own child. Alternate translation: “you who are like my very own child” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1TI	1	18	y6jg		κατὰ τὰς προαγούσας ἐπὶ σὲ προφητείας	1	in accordance with the earlier prophecies about you	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say who did this action. Alternate translation: “in agreement with what other believers prophesied about you”

1TI	1	19	jj6k	figs-abstractnouns	ἔχων πίστιν	1		If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **faith** with a phrase that uses a verb such as “trust” or “believe.” Here, **faith** could refer to: (1) a relationship with Jesus or (2) a belief in the message about Jesus. Alternate translations: (1) “continue trusting in Jesus” or (2) “keep believing the true teaching” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

1TI	1	19	h2wk	figs-metaphor	τινες…περὶ τὴν πίστιν ἐναυάγησαν	1	have shipwrecked regarding the faith	Paul speaks figuratively of these people as if they were a ship that had sunk. He means that these people no longer believe in Jesus and no longer live as his followers.

1TI	1	19	dyr6	figs-abstractnouns	περὶ τὴν πίστιν	1		If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **faith**.

1TI	1	20	az10	figs-explicit	οὓς παρέδωκα τῷ Σατανᾷ	1		This probably means that Paul expelled them from the community of believers. Since they are no longer a part of the community, Satan has access to them and can harm them. If it would be helpful to your readers, you may want to include this information in a footnote. Alternate translation: “I have allowed Satan to make them suffer” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1TI	1	20	s76c	figs-activepassive	ἵνα παιδευθῶσι	1	so that they may be taught	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who would do the action. Alternate translation: “so that God may teach them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1TI	2	intro	c6rf			0		# 1 Timothy 02 General Notes<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Peace<br>Paul encourages Christians to pray for everyone. They should pray for rulers so that Christians can live peacefully, in a godly and dignified way.<br><br>### Women in the church<br><br>Scholars are divided over how to understand this passage in its historical and cultural context. Some scholars believe that God created men and women to serve in distinctly different roles in marriage and the church. Other scholars believe that God wants women to use the gifts He gives them on an equal basis with men. Translators should be careful not to let how they understand this issue affect how they translate this passage.

1TI	2	2	pb58	figs-abstractnouns	ἐν πάσῃ εὐσεβείᾳ καὶ σεμνότητι	1	in all godliness and dignity	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express the idea behind the abstract nouns **godliness** and **dignity** with phrases that use verbs such as “honor” and “respect.” Alternate translation: “that honors God and that other people will respect” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1TI	2	3	t186	figs-doublet	καλὸν καὶ ἀπόδεκτον ἐνώπιον…Θεοῦ	1	good and acceptable before God	The terms **good** and **acceptable** mean similar things. Paul may be using them together for emphasis.

1TI	2	7	cbn6	translate-unknown	κῆρυξ	1		A **herald** is someone who is sent out to announce a message.

1TI	2	7	h18q		διδάσκαλος ἐθνῶν ἐν πίστει καὶ ἀληθείᾳ	1	a teacher of the nations in faith and truth	This could mean either of two things: (1) **faith and truth** could be describing the content of what Paul teaches.

Alternate translation: “a true and faithful teacher of the Gentiles”
1TI	2	7	t201	figs-hendiadys	διδάσκαλος ἐθνῶν ἐν πίστει καὶ ἀληθείᾳ	1	a teacher of the nations in faith and truth	If this phrase has the second meaning that the previous note discusses, Paul may be using the two terms **faith** and **truth** together to express one idea.

1TI	2	8	unw6	translate-symaction	ἐπαίροντας ὁσίους χεῖρας	1	to pray, lifting up holy hands	It was the customary posture in this culture for people to raise their hands while praying.

1TI	2	9	t210	figs-synecdoche	μὴ ἐν πλέγμασιν	1	not in braided hair	Paul mentions **braids** and gold as ways a woman could give undue attention to her hair.

Alternate translations: “not with fancy hairstyles” or “not by means of elaborate hairstyles that attract attention” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
1TI	2	9	rf5v	translate-unknown	μαργαρίταις	1	pearls	These are beautiful and valuable mineral balls that people use as jewelry.

1TI	2	13	v7v6	figs-ellipsis	εἶτα Εὕα	1	then Eve	Here Paul leaves out some of the words that a sentence would ordinarily need in order to be complete. Alternate translation: “and then God created Eve” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

1TI	2	14	t221	figs-abstractnouns	ἐν παραβάσει γέγονεν	1	transgression	If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the ideas behind the abstract noun **transgression** with a verbal phrase. Alternate translations: “began to sin” or “began to disobey God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1TI	2	15	krx4	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	δὲ	1		Use a natural way in your language to indicate that this sentence provides a contrast to the previous sentence. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
1TI	2	15	t222		σωθήσεται	1	she will be saved through child-bearing	Here, **she** likely refers to Eve, mentioned in the preceding verse, and whom Paul describes as “the woman.” “They,” later in the sentence, refers to women in general. To show how Paul shifts the topic from Eve, a representative woman, to all women, the word **she** could be translated here as “women.”
1TI	2	15	u8iv		σωθήσεται…διὰ τῆς τεκνογονίας	1	she will be saved through child-bearing	This could mean one of three things: (1) It may be that people thought that women would be condemned because of Eve’s sin and punished even more than with the pain of childbearing (see Genesis 3:16), or they may have thought that a woman who believed in Jesus was no longer under the punishment that God gave in Genesis 3:16. Since the Greek word translated **through** can also mean “with” or “while,” Paul may be saying here that women continue to have the punishment of pain in childbirth but will be saved from additional punishment as long as they have faith in Jesus. (2) It may be that the women of the church in Ephesus were being led away from faith in Jesus by the false teachers (see 2 Timothy 3:6), so Paul is recommending that they focus on raising their families rather than listening to (or participating in) the “foolish talk” (1:6). (3) **Childbearing** could also be a reference to the birth of Jesus as a human child to be the Savior. Alternate translations: (1) “God will save women, although they do have to endure childbirth” or (2) “God will save women as they attend to their families” or (3) “God will save women through Jesus, who was born as a child”
1TI	2	15	i0ap	figs-synecdoche	διὰ τῆς τεκνογονίας	1		If option number 2 from the previous note is correct, then Paul is figuratively referring to all of the aspects of motherhood by mentioning the beginning part of it: childbearing. Alternate translation: “as they attend to their families” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
1TI	2	15	n818	figs-activepassive	σωθήσεται	1	she will be saved	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who did the action. Alternate translation: “God will save women” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1TI	2	15	gh3c		ἐὰν μείνωσιν	1	if they remain	Here, **they** refers to women. Paul switches from the singular to the plural as he switches from talking about Eve as the representative of women to women in general. Alternate translation: “if women continue living”
1TI	2	15	sl57	figs-abstractnouns	ἐν πίστει, καὶ ἀγάπῃ, καὶ ἁγιασμῷ	1	in faith and love and holiness	If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the ideas behind the abstract nouns **faith**, **love**, and **holiness** with verbs. Alternate translation: “trusting Jesus, loving others, and living in a holy way” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1TI	2	15	dcf3	figs-idiom	μετὰ σωφροσύνης	1	with self-control	Possible meanings of this expression here are: (1) “with good judgment,” (2) “with modesty,” or (3) “with clear thinking” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1TI	3	intro	d9db			0		# 1 Timothy 03 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>[3:16](../03/16.md) was probably a song, poem, or creed the early church used to express what it understood to be the meaning of who Jesus was and what he did.<br><br>### Overseers and deacons<br>The church has used different titles for church leaders. Some titles include elder, pastor, and bishop. The word “overseer” reflects the Greek term in verses 1-2, which means literally an “over-seer.” The word “bishop” is derived directly from the letters of this Greek term. Paul writes about another kind of church leader, a “deacon,” in verses 8 and 12.<br><br>### Character qualities<br>This chapter lists several qualities that an overseer or deacon in the church must have. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1TI	3	1	t227		πιστὸς ὁ λόγος	1	This word is trustworthy	As in [1:15](../01/15.md), in this context the term **word** has a meaning more like “statement” or “message.” Alternate translation: “this statement is dependable”
1TI	3	1	t228	figs-quotemarks	πιστὸς ὁ λόγος	1	This word is trustworthy	Paul uses this phrase to introduce a direct quotation. It may be helpful to your readers if you indicate this by setting off the words that follow in the rest of the verse with quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language may use to indicate a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
1TI	3	1	t229	translate-unknown	ἐπισκοπῆς	1	overseer	This term describes a leader of the early Christian church whose work was to take care of the spiritual needs of believers and make sure that they received accurate biblical teaching. Alternate translation: “spiritual leader” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1TI	3	1	f133		καλοῦ ἔργου	1	a good work	Alternate translations: “an honorable task” or “an honorable role”
1TI	3	2	dff6		μιᾶς γυναικὸς ἄνδρα	1	a husband of one wife	This means that he has only one wife, that is, he does not have any other wives or concubines. This also means that he does not commit adultery and may also mean that he has not divorced a previous wife. Alternate translations: “a man who has only one woman” or “a man who is faithful to his wife”
1TI	3	2	qnq9		δεῖ…εἶναι…νηφάλιον, σώφρονα, κόσμιον, φιλόξενον	1	must be…sober, self-controlled, orderly, hospitable	Alternate translation: “He must not do anything to excess, he must be reasonable and behave well, and he must be welcoming to strangers”

1TI	3	3	pc2g	figs-metaphor	ἀφιλάργυρον	1	not money-loving	If the expression **loving** money would not convey the idea of something inappropriate in your language, it might be helpful to use a term that expresses the idea of “greed.” Alternate translation: “not greedy for money” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1TI	3	4	a8gu		προϊστάμενον	1	managing	Alternate translations: “he should lead” or “he should take care of”
1TI	3	4	w3un		ἐν ὑποταγῇ, μετὰ πάσης σεμνότητος	1	in obedience with all honor	This could mean one of several things: (1) The overseer’s children should obey their father and show respect to him. Alternate translation: “who obey him completely respectfully” (2) The overseer’s children should show respect to everyone. Alternate translation: “who obey him and show respect to everyone” or (3) The overseer should show respect to those in his household as he leads them. Alternate translation: “who obey him as he treats them with respect”
1TI	3	5	n5lt	figs-rquestion	εἰ δέ τις τοῦ ἰδίου οἴκου προστῆναι οὐκ οἶδεν, πῶς ἐκκλησίας Θεοῦ ἐπιμελήσεται?	1	for if someone does not know how to manage his own household, how will he take care of the church of God?	Paul is making a statement, not actually asking a question. He does not expect Timothy to explain how a man who could not manage his own household could take care of God’s church. Instead, Paul is using the question form to emphasize how important it is for an overseer to demonstrate faithfulness in his personal life before assuming a leadership role in the church. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could translate these words as a statement. Alternate translation: “I say this because a man who is not able to manage his own household will certainly not be able to take care of the church of God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
1TI	3	5	c814	figs-metonymy	ἐκκλησίας Θεοῦ	1	the church of God	Here, the term **church** refers to a local group of God’s people, not to a building. Alternate translations: “a group of God’s people” or “a local gathering of believers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1TI	3	6	q7hu		μὴ νεόφυτον	1	not a new convert	Alternate translations: “he should not be still just learning the faith” or “he must be mature from a long, steady growth in the faith”
1TI	3	6	t240	figs-explicit	τυφωθεὶς	1	puffed up	Paul is warning that a new convert might become excessively proud if he were given an important leadership position right away. Alternate translation: “becoming proud of himself” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1TI	3	6	t241	figs-metaphor	τυφωθεὶς	1	puffed up	Paul describes being proud figuratively as if it made a person swell in size. Alternate translation: “thinking that he is better than others” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1TI	3	6	v6f5	figs-metaphor	ἵνα μὴ…εἰς κρίμα ἐμπέσῃ τοῦ διαβόλου	1	so that he may not fall…into the judgment of the devil	Paul describes the experience of being condemned for having done wrong as like falling into a hole.

1TI	3	9	c44a	figs-metaphor	ἔχοντας	1	holding	Paul speaks of true teaching about God as if it were an object that a person could hold. Alternate translation: “they must continue to believe” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1TI	3	9	jda1	figs-abstractnouns	τὸ μυστήριον	1	the mystery of the faith	Paul uses the abstract noun **mystery** to refer to a truth that had existed for some time but that God was revealing at that moment. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind this term with a verb such as “reveal.” Alternate translation: “what God has now revealed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1TI	3	9	rfv7	figs-abstractnouns	τὸ μυστήριον τῆς πίστεως	1		Here, **faith** refers to the content of the **mystery**, that is, the specific things that God has revealed and that followers of Jesus must believe.

1TI	3	9	y91f	figs-metaphor	ἐν καθαρᾷ συνειδήσει	1	with a clean conscience	Paul speaks figuratively of a person’s sense of right and wrong being **clean**, which means that it assures that person that he has done nothing wrong. Alternate translation: “knowing that they are not doing anything wrong” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1TI	3	10	hl1p	figs-activepassive	οὗτοι…δοκιμαζέσθωσαν πρῶτον	1	let them…be tested first	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who would the action. Alternate translations: “the leaders should observe and approve of them first” or “they should first prove themselves” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

1TI	3	13	t259		οἱ…καλῶς διακονήσαντες	1	those having served well	This could refer either to deacons, whom Paul has just discussed, or to overseers as well, as a conclusion to Paul’s entire discussion of church leaders.

1TI	3	14	t262	figs-idiom	ἐν τάχει	1	in quickness	This expression describes Paul’s haste and urgency. Alternate translation: “as soon as I can” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1TI	3	14	zzzu	figs-go	ἐλθεῖν	1		In some languages it is more natural to say “go” here, rather than **come**. Alternate translation: “to go” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])
1TI	3	15	z9z8		ἐὰν δὲ βραδύνω	1	but if I delay	This does not imply that Paul might choose to take his time rather than hurrying. Alternate translations: “but in case I cannot get there soon” or “but if something prevents me from getting there soon”
1TI	3	15	p9u4		ἵνα εἰδῇς πῶς δεῖ ἐν οἴκῳ Θεοῦ ἀναστρέφεσθαι	1	so that you may know how one ought to behave in the household of God	Paul speaks of the group of believers as a family because God adopts each believer as a son or daughter through Christ. Possible meanings here are: (1) Paul is referring to the believers in general. Alternate translation: “so that you all may know how to conduct yourselves as members of God’s family” or (2) Paul is referring specifically to Timothy’s behavior in the church. Alternate translation: “so that you may know how to conduct yourself as a member of God’s family”
1TI	3	15	wzk3	figs-distinguish	οἴκῳ Θεοῦ…ἥτις ἐστὶν ἐκκλησία Θεοῦ ζῶντος	1	the household of God, which is the church of the living God	This phrase gives us further information about **the household of God**. It is not making a distinction between a household of God that is the church and one that is not the church. Alternate translation: “household of God, by which I mean the community of people who believe in the living God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish]])
1TI	3	15	cd5r	figs-metaphor	στῦλος καὶ ἑδραίωμα τῆς ἀληθείας	1	a pillar and support of the truth	Paul speaks of the truth as if it were a building and of the community of believers as if they were helping to hold up that building.

1TI	3	15	t267	figs-doublet	στῦλος καὶ ἑδραίωμα	1	a pillar and support	The terms **pillar** and **support** mean basically the same thing. They are architectural features that hold up parts of buildings. Paul uses the terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine them into an equivalent phrase.

1TI	3	15	sg64	figs-idiom	Θεοῦ ζῶντος	1	the living God	Alternate translations: “the God who is genuinely alive” or “the true God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1TI	3	16	w473		μέγα ἐστὶν τὸ τῆς εὐσεβείας μυστήριον	1	great is the mystery of godliness	While in most of this letter Paul uses the term **godliness** to describe godly living, in this instance the term instead seems to describe the reverence for God that would lead a person to live a right life. Alternate translation: “the truth that God has revealed, that leads us to worship him, is great”
1TI	3	16	t271	figs-explicit	μέγα ἐστὶν τὸ τῆς εὐσεβείας μυστήριον	1	great is the mystery of godliness	Since Paul follows this statement by quoting a hymn or poem about the life of Jesus, the implication is that he sees Jesus as having made it possible for people to worship God in the most genuine way. Alternate translation: “the truth that God has revealed about why we worship Jesus is great” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1TI	3	16	y8sp	writing-poetry	ὃς ἐφανερώθη ἐν σαρκί, ἐδικαιώθη ἐν Πνεύματι, ὤφθη ἀγγέλοις, ἐκηρύχθη ἐν ἔθνεσιν, ἐπιστεύθη ἐν κόσμῳ, ἀνελήμφθη ἐν δόξῃ	1	Who was revealed…taken up in glory	This is most likely a song or poem that Paul is quoting. If your language has a way of indicating that this is poetry, such as through line-by-line formatting, you could use that here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry]])
1TI	3	16	m4xi	figs-activepassive	ὃς ἐφανερώθη ἐν σαρκί	1	Who was revealed in flesh	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form. (Be sure not to suggest in your translation that Jesus only seemed or appeared to be human.) Alternate translations: “he revealed himself as a human being” or “he came to earth as a human being” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1TI	3	16	rqp6	figs-metonymy	ἐν σαρκί	1	in flesh	Paul uses the term **flesh** figuratively here to mean “in a human body.” He is describing the human body by reference to something associated with it, the flesh that envelops it. Alternate translation: “as a true human being” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1TI	3	16	gm36	figs-activepassive	ἐδικαιώθη ἐν Πνεύματι	1	was justified in the Spirit	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “the Holy Spirit confirmed that he was who he said he was” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1TI	3	16	fn1k	figs-activepassive	ὤφθη ἀγγέλοις	1	was seen by angels	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “the angels saw him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1TI	3	16	c3wx	figs-activepassive	ἐκηρύχθη ἐν ἔθνεσιν	1	was proclaimed among the nations	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who did the action.

1TI	3	16	jz11	figs-activepassive	ἀνελήμφθη ἐν δόξῃ	1	was taken up in glory	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who did the action. Alternate translation: “God the Father took him up to heaven in glory” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1TI	3	16	mr3a	figs-abstractnouns	ἀνελήμφθη ἐν δόξῃ	1	was taken up in glory	The abstract noun **glory** refers to the way Jesus received power from God the Father and is worthy of honor. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind this term with an adjective such as “powerful” and a verb such as “admire.” Alternate translation: “God the Father took him up to heaven, making him powerful and making everyone admire him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1TI	4	intro	b39h			0		# 1 Timothy 04 General Notes<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>Paul speaks in [4:14](./14.md) of prophecy. A “prophecy” is a message that God communicates to people through someone to whom He has given a special gift of hearing and conveying these messages. The specific prophecy that Paul describes revealed how Timothy would become a gifted leader of the church. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Cultural practices<br><br>In verse 14 Paul speaks of church leaders placing their hands on Timothy. That was one way of indicating publicly that a person was being placed in a leadership position in the church.<br><br>### Variation in names<br><br>In this chapter Paul speaks of church leaders called “elders.” They seem to be the same kind of leaders that he calls “overseers” in chapter 3.
1TI	4	1	jzr9		δὲ	1	Now	Paul uses this word to introduce background information that will help Timothy and the believers in Ephesus understand the next part of his letter. The false teachings that Timothy must oppose are something that the Spirit has already predicted. You can translate the term with the word or phrase in your language that is most similar in meaning and significance.
1TI	4	1	b739	figs-idiom	ἐν ὑστέροις καιροῖς	1	in later times	This expression refers to the time period when God’s purposes in history are approaching their culmination and so the evil opposition to them increases. Paul is probably referring to the time period between Jesus’ resurrection and his second coming. Alternate translation: “in these days as God’s purposes advance” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1TI	4	1	b931	figs-metaphor	ἀποστήσονταί τινες τῆς πίστεως	1	some will leave the faith	Paul speaks of people ceasing to trust in Christ as if they were physically leaving a place. Alternate translation: “some people will stop trusting in Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1TI	4	1	hw98	figs-abstractnouns	ἀποστήσονταί τινες τῆς πίστεως	1		Here, **faith** refers to either: (1) the teachings about Jesus, or (2) trust in Jesus. Alternate translations: (1) “some people will stop believing the teachings about Jesus” or (2) “some people will stop trusting in Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1TI	4	1	q13m		προσέχοντες	1	attending to	Alternate translations: “and turn their attention to” or “because they are paying attention to”
1TI	4	1	ae5w	figs-doublet	πνεύμασι πλάνοις καὶ διδασκαλίαις δαιμονίων	1	deceiving spirits and teachings of demons	These two phrases mean similar things. Paul may be using them together for emphasis. If you think having both phrases in your translation might be confusing for your readers, you could combine them into a single expression. Alternate translation: “the things that evil spirits say to trick people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
1TI	4	2	pw29		ἐν ὑποκρίσει ψευδολόγων	1	in false-speaking hypocrisy	If it would be clearer in your language, you could start a separate sentence here. Alternate translation: “The people who teach these things are hypocrites, and they tell lies”
1TI	4	2	u2f4	figs-metaphor	κεκαυστηριασμένων τὴν ἰδίαν συνείδησιν	1	their own consciences having been seared	Paul is speaking figuratively of these people as if their sense of right and wrong had been ruined like skin that someone had burned with a hot iron. Alternate translation: “they will not have any sense of right and wrong any more” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1TI	4	2	t288	figs-activepassive	κεκαυστηριασμένων τὴν ἰδίαν συνείδησιν	1	their own consciences having been seared	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “they will be people who have destroyed their sense of right and wrong” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1TI	4	3	t289		κωλυόντων γαμεῖν	1	forbidding to marry	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “these people teach that it is wrong to marry”
1TI	4	3	wd2l	figs-explicit	κωλυόντων γαμεῖν	1	forbidding to marry	The implication is that these false teachers will forbid believers to marry. Alternate translation: “these people will forbid believers to marry” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1TI	4	3	t291	figs-ellipsis	ἀπέχεσθαι βρωμάτων	1	to abstain from foods	Here Paul leaves out some of the words that a sentence would ordinarily need in order to be complete. He does not mean that these false teachers will forbid believers to abstain from certain foods, but that the false teachers will require them to abstain from certain foods. In other words, the meaning of **forbidding** does not carry forward from the previous clause; rather, the meaning of “requiring” should be supplied. Alternate translation: “they will require believers to abstain from certain foods” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
1TI	4	3	m1d6	figs-explicit	ἀπέχεσθαι βρωμάτων	1	to abstain from foods	The implication is that these false teachers will forbid only certain foods and that they will impose this restriction on believers. Alternate translation: “they will forbid believers to eat certain foods” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1TI	4	3	t293	figs-doublet	τοῖς πιστοῖς καὶ ἐπεγνωκόσι τὴν ἀλήθειαν	1	the faithful and the ones knowing the truth	These two expressions mean the same thing. Paul uses them together for emphasis. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine these terms. Alternate translation: “by the genuine believers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
1TI	4	3	t294	figs-nominaladj	τοῖς πιστοῖς	1	the faithful	Paul is using this adjective as a noun to refer to a class of people that it describes. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate it with a noun phrase. Alternate translation: “by people who believe in Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
1TI	4	3	t295	figs-nominaladj	ἐπεγνωκόσι τὴν ἀλήθειαν	1	the ones knowing the truth	Paul is using this participle, which functions as an adjective, as a noun to refer to a class of people that it describes. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate it with a noun phrase. Alternate translation: “people who understand the truth about Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
1TI	4	4	pppf	grammar-connect-logic-result	ὅτι	1		This word communicates that what follows is the reason for what Paul just said. Use a natural way in your language to give a reason. Alternate translation: “that is true because” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
1TI	4	4	dv4s	figs-distinguish	πᾶν κτίσμα Θεοῦ καλόν	1	every creature of God is good	If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the expression **creation of God** with a relative clause. Alternate translation: “everything that God created is good” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish]])
1TI	4	4	a15j	figs-activepassive	οὐδὲν ἀπόβλητον μετὰ εὐχαριστίας λαμβανόμενον	1	nothing being received with thanksgiving is vile	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who would do the action. Alternate translation: “we are free to eat anything that we can thank God for” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1TI	4	5	gwcs	grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1		This word communicates that what follows is the reason for the last part of what Paul has just said. In other words, it is the reason why “nothing being received with thanksgiving is vile.” Use a natural way in your language to give a reason. Alternate translation: “because” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
1TI	4	5	m5mb	figs-activepassive	ἁγιάζεται	1	it is sanctified	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translations: “it becomes holy” or “it is suitable to eat” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1TI	4	5	fhd6	figs-metonymy	διὰ λόγου Θεοῦ	1	by the word of God	In this context, the term **word** has a specific meaning. It refers to the pronouncement that God made in his word that everything that he created was good. Alternate translation: “because of what God said about it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1TI	4	5	t300	figs-explicit	καὶ ἐντεύξεως	1	and prayer	In context, the implication is that this refers to prayers of thanksgiving to God for food. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “and because of the thanks that people offer to God for it in prayer” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1TI	4	6	ks5x	figs-metaphor	ταῦτα ὑποτιθέμενος τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς	1	Placing these things before the brothers	Paul speaks of his instructions as if they were objects that could be physically placed in front of the other believers. Alternate translation: “if you help the believers remember these things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1TI	4	6	hfx3		ταῦτα	1	these things	This refers to the teaching that began in [3:16](../03/16.md).
1TI	4	6	h6qr	figs-gendernotations	τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς	1	the brothers	Paul is using the term **brothers** in a generic sense that includes men and women. Alternate translation: “the brothers and sisters” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
1TI	4	6	uyeb	figs-metaphor	τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς	1	the brothers	This term figuratively means a fellow believer in Jesus. Alternative translation: “your fellow believers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1TI	4	6	t304	figs-activepassive	ἐντρεφόμενος τοῖς λόγοις τῆς πίστεως, καὶ τῆς καλῆς διδασκαλίας ᾗ παρηκολούθηκας	1	being nourished by the words of the faith and of the good teaching that you have followed	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say what is doing the action. Alternate translation: “the statements of what we believe, expessed in proper teaching, are causing you to trust more strongly in Christ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1TI	4	6	f8vs	figs-metaphor	ἐντρεφόμενος τοῖς λόγοις τῆς πίστεως, καὶ τῆς καλῆς διδασκαλίας ᾗ παρηκολούθηκας	1	being nourished by the words of the faith and of the good teaching that you have followed	Paul speaks of these statements and teachings as if they could physically feed Timothy and make him strong. Alternate translation: “the statements of what we believe, expressed in proper teaching, are causing you to trust more strongly in Christ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1TI	4	6	ny78	figs-metonymy	τοῖς λόγοις τῆς πίστεως, καὶ τῆς καλῆς διδασκαλίας	1	the words of the faith and of the good teaching	Paul uses the term **words** figuratively to describe the statements of belief and the teachings that explain them, both expressed in words. Alternate translation: “the statements of what we believe, expressed in proper teaching” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1TI	4	7	th4i		τοὺς…βεβήλους καὶ γραώδεις μύθους	1	profane and old-womanish fables	See how you translated **myths** in [1:4](../01/04.md) and **profane** in [1:9](../01/09.md). Alternate translation: “foolish, made-up stories in which nothing is sacred”
1TI	4	7	elk7	figs-idiom	τοὺς…γραώδεις μύθους	1	old-womanish fables	The term **old-womanish** is an idiom that means “silly” or “foolish.” Paul tells Timothy in [5:2](../05/02.md) that he should respect older women as mothers, so Paul’s expression here should be recognized as idiomatic rather than disrespectful. Your language may have a similar expression. Alternate translation: “old wives’ tales” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1TI	4	7	sea5	figs-metaphor	γύμναζε…σεαυτὸν πρὸς εὐσέβειαν	1	train yourself for godliness	Paul tells Timothy figuratively to work to develop godly character as if he were an athlete improving his physical conditioning. Alternate translation: “diligently practice acting in ways that please God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1TI	4	8	t311	figs-quotemarks	γὰρ	1	for	What follows after this word is a direct quotation of a saying that Paul uses for teaching. It may be helpful to your readers if you indicate this by setting off the words that follow in the rest of the verse with quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language may use to indicate a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
1TI	4	8	i6rh		σωματικὴ γυμνασία	1	bodily training	Alternate translation: “physical exercise”
1TI	4	8	t313		πρὸς ὀλίγον ἐστὶν ὠφέλιμος	1	is valuable for a little	This could mean one of three things. Alternate translations: (1) “has some small value” or (2) “has value for a little while” or (3) “does not have very much value”
1TI	4	8	df19		ἐπαγγελίαν ἔχουσα	1	having promise for	Alternate translation: “will bring benefits”
1TI	4	9	t315		πιστὸς ὁ λόγος	1	This word is trustworthy	As in [1:15](../01/15.md) and [3:1](../03/01.md), in this context, the term **word** means “statement” or “saying.” (Paul is referring to the entire saying that he quoted in the previous verse.) Alternate translation: “this statement is dependable”
1TI	4	9	hc1t		καὶ πάσης ἀποδοχῆς ἄξιος	1	and worthy of all acceptance	See how you translated this in [1:15](../01/15.md). Alternate translations: “and we should believe it without any doubt” or “and we should have full confidence in it”
1TI	4	10	l2yl	grammar-connect-logic-result	εἰς τοῦτο γὰρ	1	for unto this	The term **this** refers to “godliness,” which Paul mentions in the previous two verses. Paul is giving a reason why Timothy should believe the saying about the value of godliness. He and his other fellow workers are striving very hard to become godly, so it must be valuable. Alternate translation: “after all, it is for godliness that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
1TI	4	10	c9db	figs-doublet	κοπιῶμεν καὶ ἀγωνιζόμεθα	1	we toil and struggle	The terms **toil** and **struggle** mean basically the same thing. Paul uses them together to emphasize the intensity with which he and his fellow workers are serving God. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine these terms. Alternate translation: “we work so hard” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
1TI	4	10	t320	figs-exclusive	κοπιῶμεν καὶ ἀγωνιζόμεθα	1	we toil and struggle	This could be the one place where **we** does not include the addressee. Paul has just told Timothy to make godliness his priority rather than physical exercise, and he may be offering himself and his other fellow workers as an example of that for Timothy to follow. So if your language makes that distinction, you may wish to use the exclusive form in this phrase. However, **we** in the next phrase would include Timothy, since Paul is encouraging Timothy to join him and his fellow workers in making godliness his priority as someone who, like them, has hoped in the living God.

1TI	4	10	qmj6	figs-idiom	Θεῷ ζῶντι	1	the living God	See how you translated this in [3:15](../03/15.md). Alternate translations: “the God who is genuinely alive” or “the true God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

1TI	4	12	qi8l		μηδείς σου τῆς νεότητος καταφρονείτω	1	Let no one despise your youth	The term **despise** here does not mean “hate,” but “think little of” or “scorn.” Alternate translation: “Do not let anyone disrespect you just because you are young”

1TI	4	13	kky7	figs-abstractnouns	πρόσεχε τῇ ἀναγνώσει, τῇ παρακλήσει, τῇ διδασκαλίᾳ	1	to the reading, to the exhortation, to the teaching	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate the abstract nouns **reading**, **exhortation**, and **teaching** with verbal phrases. Alternate translation: “continue reading the Scriptures to the people in your meeting there, exhorting them, and teaching them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1TI	4	14	i1ka	figs-doublenegatives	μὴ ἀμέλει	1		You can state this in a positive way if that is more natural for your language. Alternate translations: “continue to use” or “make sure you develop” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])

1TI	4	14	hdd9	figs-explicit	μὴ ἀμέλει τοῦ ἐν σοὶ χαρίσματος	1	Do not neglect the gift in you	The implication is that this **gift** is the ability that God has given Timothy for ministry. Alternate translation: “do not neglect the ability that God has given you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1TI	4	14	xp1k	figs-activepassive	ὃ ἐδόθη σοι διὰ προφητείας	1	which was given to you through prophecy	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who did the action. Alternate translation: “which you received when leaders of the church prophesied about you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1TI	4	14	rr8f	translate-symaction	ἐπιθέσεως τῶν χειρῶν τοῦ πρεσβυτερίου	1	with the imposition of the hands of the elders	Paul is speaking of a ceremony during which the church leaders put their hands on Timothy and prayed that God would enable him to do the work he had commanded him to do. Alternate translation: “when the elders all laid their hands on you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])

1TI	4	15	m65m	figs-metaphor	ἐν τούτοις ἴσθι	1	Study these things, be in them	Paul is speaking figuratively as if Timothy could physically be inside the instructions he has just given him. Alternate translation: “and follow them consistently” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1TI	4	15	merc	figs-explicit	σου ἡ προκοπὴ	1		If it is helpful in your language, you may want to make explicit in what way Timothy is to make **progress**. Alternate translation: “your increasing ability to live the way that Jesus wants you to live” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

1TI	4	16	u7ez		καὶ σεαυτὸν σώσεις καὶ τοὺς ἀκούοντάς σου	1	you will save both yourself and your listeners	Possible meanings are: (1) Timothy will save himself and those who hear him from God’s judgment or (2) Timothy will protect himself and those who hear him from the influence of false teachers. Perhaps Paul means both things since, if Timothy can persuade the people of the church in Ephesus not to listen to the false teachers, then he will also spare them from God’s judgment for the wrong things they would have done if they had listened to those teachers. Alternate translation: “you will keep both yourself and your listeners from believing and doing the wrong things”
1TI	5	intro	jx4e			0		# 1 Timothy 05 General Notes<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Honor and respect<br><br>Paul encourages younger Christians to honor and respect older Christians.

1TI	5	1	wt5y	figs-you		0	General Information:	Paul was giving these commands to one person, Timothy. Languages that have different forms of “you” or different forms for commands would use the singular form here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
1TI	5	1	l4w5		πρεσβυτέρῳ μὴ ἐπιπλήξῃς	1	Do not rebuke an older man	Alternate translation: “do not reprimand an older man”
1TI	5	1	dnf2		ἀλλὰ παρακάλει	1	but exhort him	Alternate translation: “instead, encourage him”
1TI	5	1	enp9	figs-simile	ὡς πατέρα…ὡς ἀδελφούς	1	as a father…as brothers	Paul uses these similes to tell Timothy that he should treat fellow believers with the same sincere love and respect that he would show to family members. Alternate translation: “as if he were your own father … encourage them as if they were your own brothers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
1TI	5	2	t1pv	figs-simile	ὡς μητέρας…ὡς ἀδελφὰς	1	as mothers…as sisters	Paul uses these similes to tell Timothy that he should treat fellow believers with sincere love and respect, just as he would treat family members. Alternate translation: “encourage each of them as if they were your own mother … encourage them as if they were your own sisters” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
1TI	5	2	ivl7	figs-abstractnouns	ἐν πάσῃ ἁγνίᾳ	1	in all purity	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate the idea behind the abstract noun **purity** with an adjective such as “pure.” Alternate translation: “making sure that your thoughts and actions are pure” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1TI	5	3	smp5	figs-idiom	χήρας τίμα	1	Honor widows	This is an idiom. Alternate translation: “provide for widows” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1TI	5	3	qc6s		τὰς ὄντως χήρας	1	real widows	Alternate translation: “widows who have no one else to provide for them”
1TI	5	4	vv64		τέκνα ἢ ἔκγονα	1		Here, these **children** and **grandchildren** are adults who are able to care for others, not young children.
1TI	5	4	w38h		πρῶτον	1	first	This could mean one of two things, or possibly both: (1) It could mean that, of all of their religious duties, taking care of their family is the most important one and the one that they should learn to do before anything else. Alternate translation: “as the most basic part of belonging to God’s people” or (2) It could mean that these children and grandchildren should be the first ones to take care of their family members, before the rest of the congregation. Alternate translation: “before the church offers any support”
1TI	5	4	fnab		μανθανέτωσαν…εὐσεβεῖν	1		Here, **learn** means to practice, that is, to learn by doing. Alternate translation: “let them become proficient in honoring”
1TI	5	4	t344	figs-parallelism	μανθανέτωσαν…τὸν ἴδιον οἶκον εὐσεβεῖν, καὶ ἀμοιβὰς ἀποδιδόναι τοῖς προγόνοις	1	let them learn to honor their own household and to make repayment to their forebears	There are two possible meanings here: (1) These two phrases may mean similar things and you could combine them if that would be clearer in your language. If **honor** is an idiom for “provide” here, as in the previous verse, then Paul may be using repetition for emphasis. Alternate translation: “let them provide the support that their widowed mother or grandmother needs and deserves” or (2) However, there may be a slight difference in meaning, and you could also choose to bring that out in your translation. Paul may actually be giving two reasons why people should support their widowed mothers or grandmothers. Alternate translation: “this is a respectful thing to do for widowed family members, and it will repay them for supporting their children and grandchildren as they were growing up” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
1TI	5	4	g5mu	figs-metonymy	τὸν ἴδιον οἶκον	1	their own household	Paul uses this phrase figuratively to refer to family members, by association to the way they live in the same house. Alternate translations: “their own family members” or “those living in their homes” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1TI	5	4	q5c8		ἀμοιβὰς ἀποδιδόναι τοῖς προγόνοις	1	make repayment to their forebears	Alternate translation: “let them do good to their mother or grandmother in return for the good things their parents and grandparents gave them”

1TI	5	4	t348	figs-metaphor	τοῦτο…ἐστιν ἀπόδεκτον ἐνώπιον τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	this is pleasing before God	Paul uses the expression **before God**, which means “in front of God,” to mean “where God can see.” Alternate translations: “this is pleasing in God’s view” or “this pleases God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1TI	5	5	xp1u	figs-hendiadys	ἡ…ὄντως χήρα καὶ μεμονωμένη	1	the genuine and left-alone widow	The two words **genuine** and **left-alone** work together to describe one condition, and they may be combined if that is clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “a widow who is genuinely alone” Or it may be that **left-alone** further defines **genuine**. Alternate translation: “a real widow, that is, one who has no family” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
1TI	5	5	ggk0		ἡ…χήρα	1		Here, **the … widow** does not refer to any specific widow, but to all widows who meet this description. Alternate translations: “any … widow” or “all … widows”
1TI	5	5	u1lj	figs-ellipsis	προσμένει ταῖς δεήσεσιν καὶ ταῖς προσευχαῖς	1	continues in requests and prayers	Paul leaves a verb unexpressed here that your language might need to express. Alternate translations: “continues in making requests and prayers” or “continues to make requests and to offer prayers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
1TI	5	5	rwp4	figs-hendiadys	ταῖς δεήσεσιν καὶ ταῖς προσευχαῖς	1	requests and prayers	The phrase **requests and prayers** expresses a single idea by using two words connected with **and**. The word **requests** tells what kind of **prayers** Paul is talking about here. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the meaning with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translations: “making requests to God in prayer” or “praying to God for what she needs” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]]).
1TI	5	5	rb9f	figs-merism	νυκτὸς καὶ ἡμέρας	1	night and day	The words **night** and **day** are used together to mean that she prays to God often, no matter what time it is. It does not mean that she prays all night and all day without ever stopping. Alternate translation: “at all times” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
1TI	5	6	t353	figs-nominaladj	ἡ…σπαταλῶσα	1	the one cavorting	Paul is using this participle, which functions as an adjective, as a noun to describe a certain kind of widow. It does not refer to a specific person. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate it with a noun phrase. Alternate translation: “any widow who lives wantonly and extravagantly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
1TI	5	6	qy5h	figs-metaphor	ζῶσα τέθνηκεν	1	living, has died	Paul speaks figuratively about people who do not seek to please God as if they were dead. Alternate translation: “has died in her spirit, even though she is still alive physically” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1TI	5	7	qw6m		καὶ ταῦτα παράγγελλε, ἵνα ἀνεπίλημπτοι ὦσιν	1	Also command these things, so that they may be irreproachable	This statement seems to refer back to [4:11](../04/11.md), “Command and teach these things,” which Paul tells Timothy after telling him in [4:6](../04/06.md) to “place these things before the brothers.” So **they** seems to refer to all the believers in this situation, including the widows, their families, and the local church that is supposed to organize the list of widows and make sure that the widows are cared for well. Alternate translation: “also give these instructions to the believers, so that no one will be able to accuse them of doing anything wrong”
1TI	5	8	p7h2	figs-idiom	τις τῶν ἰδίων καὶ μάλιστα οἰκείων οὐ προνοεῖ	1	does not provide for his own, and especially for household members	Here, **his own** is an idiom that means “his own relatives.” Alternate translation: “a person does not help with his relatives’ needs, and especially those of the family members living in his home” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1TI	5	8	y645	figs-abstractnouns	τὴν πίστιν ἤρνηται	1	he has denied the faith	Here, **the faith** refers to believing in Jesus and obeying him. Paul explains that this action would be equivalent to denying all of this. Alternate translations: “by doing that, he denies that he belongs to Jesus” or “he has shown that he does not follow the Messiah” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1TI	5	8	evm7	figs-explicit	ἔστιν ἀπίστου χείρων	1	is worse than an unbeliever	The implication is that this person is worse than an unbeliever because even unbelievers take care of their own relatives. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “is worse than those who do not believe in Jesus, because they do take care of their relatives” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1TI	5	9	s8ql	figs-activepassive	χήρα καταλεγέσθω	1	Let a widow be enrolled	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who would do the action. Alternate translation: “have the church put a widow on the register” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1TI	5	9	khe1	figs-explicit	χήρα καταλεγέσθω	1		There seems to have been a list of widows who had no family to help them. The church members met these women’s needs for food, clothing, and shelter, and these women then devoted their lives to serving the Christian community. If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “have the church put a woman on the list of widows who truly need help” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1TI	5	9	i27x	figs-litotes	μὴ ἔλαττον ἐτῶν ἑξήκοντα γεγονυῖα	1	being not less than sixty years old	Paul is using a figure of speech here that expresses a positive meaning by using a negative word together with a word that is the opposite of the intended meaning. Alternate translation: “if she is at least sixty years old” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
1TI	5	9	q9dj	figs-idiom	ἑνὸς ἀνδρὸς γυνή	1	a wife of one husband	Like the similar expression in [3:2](../03/02.md), this means that she has only one husband, and may also means that she was only married once. (If it means the second possibility, it is not clear whether Paul means to exclude women who were married more than once and widowed each time, or more specifically women who divorced their husbands and married other men.) Alternate translations: (1) “she was always faithful to her husband” or (2) “she had one husband” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1TI	5	10	l8nm	figs-activepassive	ἐν ἔργοις καλοῖς μαρτυρουμένη	1	attested in good works	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who did the action. Alternate translation: “people must be able to attest to her good deeds” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1TI	5	10	mik7		ἐξενοδόχησεν	1	has received strangers	Alternate translations: “has welcomed strangers into her home” or “practiced hospitality”
1TI	5	10	ygl3	translate-symaction	ἁγίων πόδας ἔνιψεν	1	has washed the feet of the saints	In this culture, people walked barefoot or in sandals on roads that were dusty or muddy, so washing their feet once they entered a home was a way of helping them be comfortable and clean. If the people of your culture would not be familiar with this practice, you could use a general expression instead. Alternate translation: “has cared for believers who visited her” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
1TI	5	10	t366	figs-synecdoche	ἁγίων πόδας ἔνιψεν	1	has washed the feet of the saints	Paul may be using one type of humble service figuratively to represent humble service in general. Alternate translation: “has done humble things to help other believers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
1TI	5	10	bw4h	figs-idiom	ἁγίων	1	the saints	This expression refers to believers in Jesus as people who are “holy” or “set apart” for God. Alternate translations: “the believers” or “God’s holy people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1TI	5	10	ey6i	figs-nominaladj	θλιβομένοις ἐπήρκεσεν	1	relieved the afflicted	Paul is using the adjective **afflicted** as a noun to refer to a class of people that it describes. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate it with a noun phrase. Alternate translation: “has helped people who were suffering” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
1TI	5	10	h96j	figs-hyperbole	παντὶ ἔργῳ ἀγαθῷ ἐπηκολούθησεν	1	pursued every good work	Paul uses the word **every** here as a generalization for emphasis. Alternate translation: “she has done many good deeds” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
1TI	5	11	rv5h		νεωτέρας δὲ χήρας παραιτοῦ	1	But refuse younger widows	Alternate translation: “But do not add the names of widows who are younger than 60 years old to the list of widows”
1TI	5	11	vqq9	figs-explicit	ὅταν…καταστρηνιάσωσιν τοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	when they become wanton against Christ	The implication is that when a widow accepted a place on the register, she promised to remain unmarried and devote herself to serving other believers. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this explicitly. Alternate translation: “when they feel bodily desires that are contrary to their pledge of chastity” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1TI	5	12	t372		ἔχουσαι κρίμα	1	having judgment	Alternate translation: “and so they incur God’s judgment”
1TI	5	12	nha7		τὴν πρώτην πίστιν ἠθέτησαν	1	they have broken their first pledge	The term **pledge** here refers to a commitment that the widows made, as the last note to [5:11](../05/11.md) explains, that they would serve the Christian community for the rest of their lives and not remarry if the community would supply their needs. Alternate translations: “they have not kept their prior commitment” or “they have not done what they had previously promised to do”
1TI	5	13	t4iv		ἀργαὶ μανθάνουσιν	1	they learn to be lazy ones	Alternate translation: “they get into the habit of doing nothing”
1TI	5	13	t375	figs-nominaladj	ἀργαὶ	1	lazy ones	Paul is using the adjective **lazy** as a noun to refer to a class of people that it describes. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate it with a noun phrase. Alternate translation: “people who are lazy” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
1TI	5	13	t376		περιερχόμεναι τὰς οἰκίας	1	going around houses	Alternate translation: “going from house to house”
1TI	5	13	nll4	figs-doublet	φλύαροι καὶ περίεργοι, λαλοῦσαι τὰ μὴ δέοντα	1	babblers and busybodies, saying what they should not	These three phrases may be ways of speaking about the same activity. Paul may be using repetition to emphasize that these women should not be looking into the private lives of people and telling about them to others who would be no better off after hearing this gossip. If you think it would be helpful to your readers, you could combine these phrases into a single one. Alternate translation: “people who interfere openly in other people’s business” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]]) (A doublet can consist of more than two terms.)
1TI	5	13	cym5		φλύαροι	1	babblers	Alternate translation: “people who talk nonsense”
1TI	5	14	u94k		τῷ ἀντικειμένῳ	1	the one opposing	This expression could refer by implication to (1) Satan (that is the reading of UST) or (2) collectively to unbelievers who are opposing the followers of Jesus. Alternate translations: (1) “the devil” or (2) “unbelievers who are opposing you”
1TI	5	15	fy54	figs-metaphor	ἐξετράπησαν ὀπίσω τοῦ Σατανᾶ	1	having…turned aside after Satan	Paul speaks of living in faithfulness to Christ as if it were a path that one can either follow or turn aside from. He means that some younger widows have stopped obeying Jesus and have started to do what Satan would want them to do instead. Alternate translation: “have stopped living in obedience to Jesus and have decided to obey Satan” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1TI	5	16	g8k5	figs-nominaladj	τις πιστὴ	1	any believing woman	Paul is using this participle, which functions as an adjective, as a noun to refer to a class of people that it describes. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate it with a noun phrase. Alternate translation: “any woman who believes in Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
1TI	5	16	mf4s	figs-explicit	ἔχει χήρας	1	has widows	The implication is that she has widows within her extended family. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “has relatives who are widows” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1TI	5	16	y6hf	figs-metaphor	καὶ μὴ βαρείσθω ἡ ἐκκλησία	1	let the church not be weighed down	Paul speaks figuratively of the community having to help more people than it is able to help as if it were carrying too much weight on its back. Alternate translations: “so that the church will not have more work than it can do” or “so that the Christian community will not have to support widows whose families could provide for them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1TI	5	16	t384	figs-activepassive	καὶ μὴ βαρείσθω ἡ ἐκκλησία	1	let the church not be weighed down	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translations: “so that the church will not have more work than it can do” or “so that the Christian community will not have to support widows whose families could provide for them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1TI	5	16	d35m		ὄντως χήραις	1	genuine widows	Alternate translation: “widows who have no one else to provide for them”
1TI	5	17	u93q	figs-activepassive	οἱ καλῶς προεστῶτες πρεσβύτεροι…ἀξιούσθωσαν	1	The elders having ruled well, let them be considered worthy	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who would do the action. Alternate translation: “All believers should consider elders who are good leaders to be deserving” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1TI	5	17	wp9d	figs-abstractnouns	διπλῆς τιμῆς	1	double honor	Here, **double honor** means either: (1) that the congregation should honor the elders in two ways, or (2) that they should honor them twice as much as others. Since Paul quotes two Scriptures in the next verse that support the idea of church leaders being paid for their work, the first possibility is more likely. Alternate translations: (1) “of both respect and payment for their work” or (2) “of more respect than others receive” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1TI	5	17	r8ew	figs-nominaladj	οἱ κοπιῶντες	1	the ones toiling	Paul is using the participle **toiling**, which functions as an adjective, as a noun to refer to members of a class of people that it describes. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate it with a noun phrase. Alternate translation: “elders who labor diligently” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
1TI	5	17	t389	figs-hendiadys	ἐν λόγῳ καὶ διδασκαλίᾳ	1	in the word and in teaching	This phrase may be expressing a single idea by using two phrases (which are actually just two words in Greek) connected with **and**. The phrase **in the word** would be identifying the content of the **teaching**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the meaning with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “at teaching from the Scriptures” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
1TI	5	17	t390	figs-metonymy	λόγῳ	1	the word	Paul may be using the term **word** here figuratively to describe the Scriptures, which God inspired people to put into words. Alternate translation: “the Scriptures” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1TI	5	18	kh55	figs-personification	λέγει γὰρ ἡ Γραφή	1	For the Scripture says	Paul figuratively describes Scripture as if it could speak for itself. Alternate translations: “for it is written in the Scriptures” or “for we read in the Scriptures that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
1TI	5	18	t392	figs-declarative	βοῦν ἀλοῶντα οὐ φιμώσεις	1	You will not muzzle a threshing ox	Here the Scriptures use a statement in order to give a command. Alternate translation: “you must not muzzle an ox while it is treading on grain” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative]])
1TI	5	18	vw3a	figs-metaphor	βοῦν ἀλοῶντα οὐ φιμώσεις	1	You will not muzzle a threshing ox	Paul is quoting this passage figuratively. He is using it to indicate that, just as God wanted oxen to be able to eat some of the grain that they were working to separate from its husks, so church leaders deserve to receive payment from the Christian community that they are serving. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1TI	5	18	g985	translate-unknown	φιμώσεις	1	you will not muzzle	A **muzzle** is a sleeve that goes over an animal’s snout to prevent it from opening its jaws and eating while it is doing work. If your readers would not be familiar with this object, you could use a more general expression instead. Alternate translations: “keep an ox’s mouth shut” or “prevent an ox from eating” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1TI	5	18	t6kp	translate-unknown	ἀλοῶντα	1	a threshing ox	An ox in this culture would **thresh** grain by walking on it or pulling a heavy object over it to separate the grain from the husks. Alternate translation: “an ox that is separating grain from husks” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1TI	5	18	kys1		ἄξιος ὁ ἐργάτης τοῦ μισθοῦ αὐτοῦ	1	The worthy is worthy of his wages	Alternate translations: “a worker has a right to be paid” or “a worker should receive his wages”
1TI	5	19	af68	grammar-connect-exceptions	κατηγορίαν μὴ παραδέχου, ἐκτὸς εἰ	1	do not receive an accusation, except if	If, in your language, it would appear that Paul was making a statement and then contradicting it, you could reword this statement to avoid using an exception clause. Alternate translation: “only believe that an accusation is true if” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-exceptions]])
1TI	5	19	t399	figs-ellipsis	ἐπὶ δύο ἢ τριῶν μαρτύρων	1	upon two or three witnesses	Here, **on** stands for the concept of “relying on.” You may need to use a more complete phrase in your language. Alternate translations: “you are relying on the testimony of two or three people” or “at least two people give evidence for it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
1TI	5	19	kmy5		δύο ἢ τριῶν	1	two or three	Alternate translations: “at least two” or “two or more”
1TI	5	20	m4uh	figs-nominaladj	τοὺς ἁμαρτάνοντας	1	the ones sinning	Paul is using this participle, which functions as an adjective, as a noun to refer to a class of people that it describes. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate it with a noun phrase. There are two possibilities here: (1) This could refer to any believers who are sinning, or (2) Paul could still be talking about elders. Alternate translations: (1) “believers who are sinning” or (2) “elders who are doing wrong things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
1TI	5	20	db63	figs-metaphor	ἐνώπιον…πάντων	1	before all	Paul uses the expression **before** to mean “in front of.” Alternate translations: “where everyone can see” or “in public” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1TI	5	20	ql4m	figs-explicit	ἵνα καὶ οἱ λοιποὶ φόβον ἔχωσιν	1	so that the rest also may have fear	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say what, by implication, people will be afraid of doing. Alternate translation: “so that other people will be afraid to sin themselves” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1TI	5	20	t404	figs-idiom	φόβον ἔχωσιν	1	may have fear	This is an idiom. Alternate translation: “will be afraid” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1TI	5	21	x0zp		διαμαρτύρομαι ἐνώπιον τοῦ Θεοῦ, καὶ Χριστοῦ Ἰησοῦ, καὶ τῶν ἐκλεκτῶν ἀγγέλων	1		By calling on **God and Christ Jesus and the chosen angels** as witnesses to what Paul is saying, Paul is making Timothy responsible to God to do what he says. If this is not clear, then put this into the form that your language uses for an oath. Alternate translation: “as God and Christ Jesus and the chosen angels are my witnesses, I put you under oath”
1TI	5	21	t405	figs-metaphor	ἐνώπιον τοῦ Θεοῦ, καὶ Χριστοῦ Ἰησοῦ	1	before God and Christ Jesus and the chosen angels	Paul uses the expression **before**, meaning “in front of,” to indicate “where they can see.” Seeing, in turn, figuratively means attention and judgment. Alternate translation: “as God and Christ Jesus and the chosen angels are watching” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1TI	5	21	t7jq	figs-idiom	τῶν ἐκλεκτῶν ἀγγέλων	1	the chosen angels	This means the angels whom God has chosen to serve him in a special way. Alternate translation: “the angels who are God’s special servants” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1TI	5	21	dph6		ταῦτα φυλάξῃς	1	keep these things	Alternate translation: “you follow these instructions”
1TI	5	21	t409		ταῦτα	1	these things	Grammatically, this could refer either to the instructions Paul has just given Timothy about elders or to the instructions he is about to give Timothy regarding his own personal conduct. But since Paul tells Timothy to follow these instructions without favoring one person over another, it is most likely that this refers to the instructions about elders. Alternate translation: “these things that I have just told you”
1TI	5	21	t408	figs-doublet	χωρὶς προκρίματος, μηδὲν ποιῶν κατὰ πρόσκλισιν	1	without partiality, doing nothing out of favoritism	The terms **partiality** and **favoritism** mean similar things. Paul may be using repetition to emphasize that Timothy must judge honestly and be fair to everyone. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine these terms. Alternate translation: “being completely fair to everyone” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
1TI	5	22	qb71	translate-symaction	χεῖρας ταχέως μηδενὶ ἐπιτίθει	1	Place hands hastily on no one	The **placing of hands** was a ceremony in which one or more church leaders would put their hands on people and pray that God would enable them to serve the church in a way that would please God. Timothy was to wait until a person had shown good character for a long time before officially and publicly setting that person apart in this way to serve the Christian community. Alternate translation: “wait until a person has consistently demonstrated good character before appointing that person to church leadership” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
1TI	5	22	t411	figs-litotes	χεῖρας ταχέως μηδενὶ ἐπιτίθει	1	Place hands hastily on no one	Paul is using a figure of speech here that expresses a positive meaning by using a negative word together with a word that is the opposite of the intended meaning. Alternate translation: “wait until a person has consistently demonstrated good character before appointing that person to church leadership” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
1TI	5	22	pyl8	figs-explicit	μηδὲ κοινώνει ἁμαρτίαις ἀλλοτρίαις	1	nor share in the sins of others	The implication in context may be that if Timothy appoints a person to leadership before they are ready or without ensuring that their character is exemplary, then Timothy will bear some responsibility for that person’s ultimate failure as a leader, or he will appear to have approved of the person’s sins, once they are uncovered. Alternate translation: “so that you do not become responsible for the moral and leadership failures of others” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1TI	5	23	xl32	figs-explicit	οἴνῳ ὀλίγῳ χρῶ	1	use a little wine	Paul is telling Timothy to use wine specifically as medicine. The water in that area was impure and often caused sickness. Alternate translation: “in addition, you should drink some wine from time to time as medicine” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1TI	5	24	uk56	figs-gendernotations	ἀνθρώπων	1	men	Paul uses the term **men** here in a generic sense that includes both men and women. Alternate translation: “people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
1TI	5	24	ug1z	figs-personification	πρόδηλοί εἰσιν, προάγουσαι εἰς κρίσιν	1	are evident, going ahead into judgment	Paul speaks of sins as if they could move on their own ahead of a person to the place where that person will be judged for committing them. There are two possibilities for this place of **judgment**: (1) This refers to the judgment when the sinner stands before God on the last day. Alternate translation: “are so obvious that everyone knows they are guilty long before God declares them guilty” or (2) This refers to judgment before the church. Alternate translation: “are clear to everyone, even before the church leaders confront them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
1TI	5	24	i1c6	figs-personification	τισὶν δὲ καὶ ἐπακολουθοῦσιν	1	but they also follow after some	Paul speaks once again of sins as if they could move on their own. As in the previous clause, Paul may be referring to either (1) judgment by God, Alternate translation: “but the sins of other people do not become evident until God judges them” or (2) judgment by the church. Alternate translation: “but the sins of some people remain hidden for a long time” This latter alternative also allows the possibility that Paul is referring to judgment by God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
1TI	5	25	pd8v	figs-explicit	καὶ τὰ ἔργα τὰ καλὰ πρόδηλα	1	good works are also evident	Implicitly, here Paul does not mean all good works, since in the rest of the sentence he speaks of some good works that are not evident. Alternate translation: “most good works are also obvious” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1TI	5	25	qlu5	figs-explicit	τὰ ἔργα τὰ καλὰ	1	good works	The implication is that these works are considered **good** because they are consistent with God’s character, purposes, and will. Alternate translation: “actions that God approves” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1TI	5	25	bl51	figs-metaphor	καὶ τὰ ἄλλως ἔχοντα, κρυβῆναι οὐ δύναταί	1	and the ones having otherwise are not able to be hidden	Paul speaks of good works as if they were objects that someone could hide. Alternate translation: “and people will find out later about even those good deeds that are not obvious” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1TI	5	25	t420	figs-activepassive	καὶ τὰ ἄλλως ἔχοντα, κρυβῆναι οὐ δύναταί	1	and the ones having otherwise are not able to be hidden	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who will do the action. Alternate translation: “and people who secretly do good works will not be able to hide them forever” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1TI	5	25	bb2t	figs-doublenegatives	κρυβῆναι οὐ δύναταί	1		If it is clearer in your language, you can say this in a positive way. Alternate translation: “people will learn about later” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])

1TI	6	1	e3ce		ἵνα μὴ τὸ ὄνομα τοῦ Θεοῦ καὶ ἡ διδασκαλία βλασφημῆται	1		If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this in a positive way. Alternate translation: “so that unbelievers will always speak respectfully about God’s character and about the things that we teach”

Here, as well, it is a figurative way to say that the teaching is good and reliable in every way and has no defect or corruption. A person with a healthy mind would recognize this teaching as correct. Alternate translations: “to the correct words” or “to the true expression of our faith” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

1TI	6	4	qu86	figs-metaphor	νοσῶν περὶ ζητήσεις	1	ailing about controversies and word-battles	Paul speaks of people who feel compelled to engage in useless arguments as if they were ill.

1TI	6	4	i3lk	figs-doublet	ζητήσεις καὶ λογομαχίας	1	controversies and word-battles	These two terms mean basically the same thing, although the second term refers more specifically to arguments about the meaning of words.
