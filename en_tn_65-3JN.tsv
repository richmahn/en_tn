3JN	front	intro	kwv9			0		# Introduction to 3 John<br>## Part 1: General Introduction<br><br>#### Outline of the Book of 3 John<br><br>1. Introduction (1:1)<br>1. Encouragement and instructions to show hospitality (1:2-8)<br>1. Diotrephes and Demetrius (1:9-12)<br>1. Conclusion (1:13-14)<br><br>#### Who wrote the Book of 3 John?<br><br>The letter does not give the name of the author. The author only identified himself as "the elder" (1:1). The letter was probably written by the Apostle John near the end of his life.<br><br>#### What is the Book of 3 John about?<br><br>John wrote this letter to a believer named Gaius. He instructed Gaius to be hospitable to fellow believers who were traveling through his area.<br><br>#### How should the title of this book be translated?<br><br>Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, "3 John" or "Third John." Or they may choose a clearer title, such as "The Third Letter from John" or "The Third Letter John Wrote." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])<br><br>## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts<br><br>#### What is hospitality?<br><br>Hospitality was an important concept in the ancient Near East. It was important to be friendly towards foreigners or outsiders and provide help to them if they needed it. In 2 John, John discouraged Christians from showing hospitality to false teachers. In 3 John, John encouraged Christians to show hospitality to faithful teachers.<br><br>## Part 3: Important Translation Issues<br><br>#### How does the author use family relationships in his letter?<br><br>The author used the terms "brother" and "children" in a way that can be confusing. The scriptures often used the term "brothers" to refer to Jews. But in this letter, John used the word to refer to Christians. Also, John called some believers his "children." These are believers he taught to obey Christ.<br><br>John also used the term "Gentile" in a way that could be confusing. The scriptures often used the term "Gentile" to refer to people who are not Jews. But in this letter, John used the word to refer to those who did not believe in Jesus.<br>
