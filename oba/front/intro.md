## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts ##

#### What was Edom's relationship to Israel? ####

Obadiah referred to Edom as Israel's brother. This is because the Edomites descended from Esau, and the Israelites descended from Jacob. Jacob and Esau were brothers. This made Edom betraying Israel much worse.
