## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts ##

#### What was Edom's relationship to Israel? ####

Obadiah referred to Edom as Israel's brother. This is because the Edomites were descendants of Esau, and the Israelites were descendants of Jacob. Jacob and Esau were brothers. This made Edom's betrayal of Israel much worse.

#### How do I translate the concept of "pride"? ####

Obadiah spoke a lot about "pride" in his book. When Obadiah spoke about the "pride" of Edom, he meant that the nation thought they were more powerful than Yahweh and that he would not or was not able to punish them. (See: rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/proud)
