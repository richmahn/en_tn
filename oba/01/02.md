# Behold, I will make you

Beginning in verse 2, Obadiah records the words that Yahweh speaks directly to Edom.

# Behold

This alerts the reader to pay special attention to what follows. Alternate translation: "Look" or "Pay attention to what I am about to tell you"

# I will make you small among the nations, you will be greatly despised

These two phrases mean similar things and are used to emphasize that Edom will lose its important status. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# I will make you small among the nations

Something that is insignificant is spoken of as if it is of small size, and can easily be overlooked. Alternate translation: "I will make you insignificant among the nations" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# you will be greatly despised

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "the people of other nations will hate you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
