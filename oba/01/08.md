# Will I not on that day," says Yahweh, "destroy ... mountain of Esau?

Yahweh uses this question to emphasize the certainty of the destruction of Edom. Alternate translation: "'On that day,' says Yahweh, 'I surely will destroy ... mountain of Esau." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# the mountain of Esau

Most of the land of Esau was mountains, so this is one way of referring to the land of Edom.
