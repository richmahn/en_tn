# your brother Jacob

Here "Jacob" represents his descendants. Because Jacob was the brother of Esau, the people of Edom are spoken of as if they were the brothers of the descendants of Jacob. Alternate translation: "your relatives who are the descendants of Jacob" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# you will be covered with shame

To be covered with something is an idiom for fully experiencing it. Alternate translation: "you will be completely ashamed" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# will be cut off forever

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "will never exist again" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
