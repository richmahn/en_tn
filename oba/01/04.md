# Though you soar high like the eagle and though your nest is set among the stars

Both of these exaggerations say that Edom is built in a very high place by saying it is built much higher than possible. Alternate translation: "And I tell you that even if you had wings and could fly higher than eagles fly, and if you could make your homes among the stars" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# I will bring you down from there

Pride is associated with height while humility is associated with being low. To "bring down" is an idiom that means to humble someone. Alternate translation: "I will humble you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
