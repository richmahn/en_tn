Obadiah's vision concerning Edom continues.

## The pride of your heart ##

Yahweh uses the part of a person's body that is associated with emotions to refer to the people of Edom feeling pride. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

## in the clefts of the rock ##

"in the cracks in the rock"

## in your lofty home ##

"in your home that was built in a high place"

## Who will bring me down to the ground? ##

This question is showing how the Edomites were proud and felt safe. AT: "I am safe from all attackers." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## Though you tower high like the eagle, and though your nest is set among the stars ##

Both of these phrases are saying Edom is built much higher than possible, to say it was built in a very high place. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]], [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## tower  ##

to be much taller than other things.

## I will bring you down from there ##

Pride is associated with height and humility is associated with being low.  Yahweh says he will bring Edom down to say he will humble it. AT: "I will humble you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
