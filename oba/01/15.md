# General Information:

Yahweh concludes his message to Edom in verse 15. In verses 16-21, Yahweh speaks through Obadiah to tell the people of Judah that they will possess the land of Edom.

# For the day of Yahweh is near ... will return on your own head

Bible experts are not certain whether verse 15 goes with verse 14 as the end of the previous section, or goes with verse 16 as the beginning of the new section.

# For the day of Yahweh is near upon all the nations

"Soon the time will come when Yahweh will show all the nations that he is Lord"

# As you have done, it will be done to you

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "I will do to you the same things that you did to others" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# your deeds will return on your own head

Here "return on your own head" means they will be punished for those things. Alternate translation: "you will suffer the consequences for the things you have done" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
