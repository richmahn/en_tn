# General Information:

In verses 16-21, Yahweh speaks through Obadiah to tell the people of Judah that they will possess the land of Edom.

# those that escape

These are the people of Jerusalem that are still alive after Yahweh has finished punishing the city. This can be made explicit. Alternate translation: "some of the Israelites who escape the punishment of Yahweh" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# it will be holy

The word "it" refers to "mount Zion."

# house of Jacob will be a fire ... Joseph a flame

Yahweh speaks of the houses of Jacob and Joseph as if they were fire because they will destroy Esau like a fire that quickly and completely burns up straw. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the house of Jacob

The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house. In this case it refers to Jacob's descendants. Alternate translation: "descendants of Jacob" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
