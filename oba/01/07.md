Yahweh continues giving Obadiah his message to Edom.

## your alliance ##

The word "your" refers to the nation of Edom.

## will send you on your way to the border ##

"will send you out of their land." The people of Edom will try to take refuge in the land of their allies, but their allies will not let the people of Edom stay in their land.

## There is no understanding in him ##

"Edom cannot understand."

## Will I not on that day, says Yahweh, destroy... ##

"On that day, says Yahweh, I surely will destroy..." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## your mighty men will be dismayed ##

"your strong warriors will be afraid"

## Teman ##

the name of a region in the land of Edom. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

## so that every man may be cut off from the mountain of Esau by slaughter ##

AT: "so that there will be no more people in the mountains of Esau because enemies killed them." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## mountain of Esau ##

Most of the land of Esau was mountains, so this is one way of referring to the land of Esau.
