Righteousness by faith in Jesus Christ (1:16-17)<br>3. All mankind is condemned because of sin (1:18-3:20)<br>4. Righteousness through Jesus Christ by faith in him (3:21-4:25)<br>5. The fruits of the Spirit (5:1-11)<br>6. Adam and Christ compared (5:12-21)<br>7. Becoming like Christ in this life (6:1-8:39)<br>8. God’s plan for Israel (9:1-11:36)<br>9. Practical advice for living as Christians (12:1-15:13)<br>10. Conclusion and greetings (15:14-16:27)<br><br>### Who wrote the Book of Romans?<br><br>The Apostle Paul wrote the Book of Romans. Paul was from the city of Tarsus. He had been known as Saul in his early life. Before becoming a Christian, Paul was a Pharisee. He persecuted Christians. After he became a Christian, he traveled several times throughout the Roman Empire telling people about Jesus.<br><br>Paul probably wrote this letter while he was staying in the city of Corinth during his third trip through the Roman Empire.<br><br>### What is the Book of Romans about?<br><br>Paul wrote this letter to the Christians in Rome. Paul wanted to get them ready to receive him when he visited them. He said his purpose was to “bring about the obedience of faith” (16:26).<br><br>In this letter Paul most fully described the gospel of Jesus Christ. He explained that both Jews and non-Jews have sinned, and God will forgive them and declare them righteous only if they believe in Jesus (chapters 1-11). Then he gave them practical advice for how believers should live (chapters 12-16),<br><br>### How should the title of this book be translated?<br><br>Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “Romans.” Or they may choose a clearer title, such as “Paul’s Letter to the Church in Rome,” or “A Letter to the Christians in Rome.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])<br><br>## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts<br><br>### What are the titles used to refer to Jesus?<br><br>In Romans, Paul described Jesus Christ by many titles and descriptions: Jesus Christ (1:1), the Seed of David (1:3), the Son of God (1:4), the Lord Jesus Christ (1:7), Christ Jesus (3:24), Propitiation (3:25), Jesus (3:26), Jesus our Lord (4:24), Lord of Hosts (9:29), a Stumbling Stone and Rock of Offence (9:33), the End of the Law (10:4), the Deliverer (11:26), Lord of the Dead and the Living (14:9), and the Root of Jesse (15:12).<br><br>### How should theological terms in Romans be translated?<br><br>Paul uses many theological terms that are not used in the four gospels. As early Christians learned more about the meaning of Jesus Christ and his message, they needed words and expressions for new ideas. Some examples of these words are “justification” (5:1), “works of the law” (3:20), “reconcile” (5:10), “propitiation” (3:25), “sanctification” (6:19), and “the old man” (6:6).<br><br>The “key terms” dictionary can help translators understand many of these terms. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])<br><br>Terms such as those given above are difficult to explain. It is often hard or impossible for translators to find equivalent terms in their own languages. It can help to know that word equivalents of these terms are not necessary. Instead, translators can develop short expressions to communicate these ideas. For example, the term “gospel” can be translated as “the good news about Jesus Christ.”<br><br>Translators should also remember that some of these terms have more than one meaning. The meaning will depend on how the author is using the word in that particular passage. For example, “righteousness” sometimes means that a person obeys God’s law. At other times, “righteousness” means that Jesus Christ has perfectly obeyed God’s law for us.<br><br>### What did Paul mean by “a remnant” of Israel (11:5)?<br><br>The idea of a “remnant” is important both in the Old Testament and for Paul. Most of the Israelites were either killed or scattered among other people when the Assyrians and then the Babylonians conquered their land. Only a relatively few Jews survived. They were known as “the remnant.”<br><br>In 11:1-9, Paul speaks of another remnant. This remnant is the Jews whom God saved because they believed in Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/remnant]])<br><br>## Part 3: Important Translation Issues<br><br>### What did Paul mean by being “in Christ”?<br><br>The phrase “in Christ” and similar phrases occur in 3:24; 6:11, 23; 8:1,2,39; 9:1; 12:5,17; 15:17; and 16:3,7,9,10. Paul used these kinds of phrases as a metaphor to express that Christian believers belong to Jesus Christ. Belonging to Christ means the believer is saved and is made a friend with God. The believer is also promised to live with God forever. However, this idea can be difficult to represent in many languages.<br><br>These phrases also have specific meanings that depend on how Paul used them in a particular passage. For example, in 3:24 (“the redemption that is in Christ Jesus”), Paul referred to our being redeemed “because” of Jesus Christ. In 8:9 (“you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit”), Paul spoke of believers submitting “to” the Holy Spirit. In 9:1 (“I tell the truth in Christ”), Paul meant that he is telling the truth that “is in agreement with” Jesus Christ.<br><br>Nevertheless, the basic idea of our being united with Jesus Christ (and with the Holy Spirit) is seen in these passages as well. Therefore, the translator has a choice in many passages that use “in.” He will often decide to represent the more immediate sense of “in,” such as, “by means of,” “in the manner of,” or “in regard to.” But, if possible, the translator should choose a word or phrase that represents the immediate sense and the sense of “in union with.” (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/inchrist]])<br><br>### How are the ideas of “holy,” “saints” or “holy ones,” and “sanctify” represented in Romans in the ULT?<br><br>The scriptures use such words to indicate any one of various ideas. For this reason, it is often difficult for translators to represent them well in their versions. In translating into English, the ULT uses the following principles:<br><br>* Sometimes the meaning in a passage implies moral holiness. Especially important for understanding the gospel is the fact that God considers Christians to be sinless because they are united to Jesus Christ. Another related fact is that God is perfect and faultless. A third fact is that Christians are to conduct themselves in a blameless and faultless manner in life. In these cases, the ULT uses “holy,” “holy God,” “holy ones” or “holy people.” (See: 1:7)<br>* Sometimes the meaning in a passage indicates a simple reference to Christians without implying any particular role filled by them. In cases where some other English versions have “saints” or “holy ones,” the ULT uses “believers.” (See: 8:27; 12:13; 15:25, 26, 31; 16:2, 15)<br>* Sometimes the meaning in a passage indicates the idea of someone or something set apart for God alone. In these cases, the ULT uses “set apart,” “dedicated to,” “consecrated,” or “reserved for.” (See: 15:16)<br><br>The UST will often be helpful as translators think about how to represent these ideas in their own versions.<br><br>### What are the major issues in the text of the Book of Romans?<br><br>For the following verses, modern version of the Bible differ from older versions. The ULT includes the modern reading and puts the older reading in a footnote.<br><br>* “he \[God\] works all things together for good” (8:28). Some older versions read, “All things work together for good.”<br>* “But if it is by grace, it is no longer by works. Otherwise grace would no longer be grace” (11:6). Some older versions read: “But if it is by works, then is it no more grace: otherwise work is no more work.”<br><br>The following verse is not in the best ancient copies of the Bible. Translators are advised not to include this verse. However, if in the translators’ region there are older Bible versions that have this verse, the translators can include it. If it is translated, it should be put inside square brackets (\[\]) to indicate that it is probably not original to the Book of Romans.<br><br>* “May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen” (16:24).<br><br>(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
ROM	1	intro	hn5n			0		# Romans 1 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>The first verse is a type of introduction. People in the ancient Mediterranean region often started their letters this way. Sometimes this is called a “salutation.”<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### The gospel<br><br>This chapter refers to the contents of the Book of Romans as “the gospel” ([Romans 1:2](../rom/01/02.md)). Romans is not a gospel like Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. Instead, chapters 1-8 present the biblical gospel: All have sinned. Jesus died for our sins. He was raised again that we might have new life in him.<br><br>### Fruit<br><br>This chapter uses the imagery of fruit. The image of fruit usually refers to a person’s faith producing good works in their life. In this chapter, it refers to the results of Paul’s work among the Roman Christians. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/fruit]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]])<br><br>### Universal Condemnation and the Wrath of God<br><br>This chapter explains that everyone is without excuse. We all know about the true God, Yahweh, from his creation all around us. Because of our sin and our sinful nature, every person justly deserves the wrath of God. This wrath was satisfied by Jesus dying on a cross for those who believe in him. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/believe]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### “God gave them over”<br><br>Many scholars view the phrases “God gave them over” and “God gave them up” as theologically significant. For this reason, it is important to translate these phrases with God playing a passive role in the action. God simply allows men to pursue their own desires, he does not force them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Difficult phrases and concepts<br><br>This chapter has many difficult ideas in it. How Paul writes makes many of the phrases in this chapter difficult to translate. The translator may need to use the UST to understand the meaning of the phrases. And it may be necessary to more freely translate these phrases. Some of the difficult phrases include: “obedience of faith,” “Son of God,” “whom I serve in my spirit,” “from faith to faith” and “exchanged the glory of the imperishable God for the likenesses of an image of perishable man.”

Your language may have a particular way of introducing the author of a letter, and if it would be helpful to your readers, you could use it here. Immediately after introducing the writer, you might also want to indicate to whom the letter was written (See [Romans 1:7](../01/07.md)).

ROM	1	1	w6j9	figs-ellipsis	κλητὸς ἀπόστολος	1		A word is left out here in the original that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete. Since English needs it, **to be** is added in brackets. Do what is natural in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
ROM	1	1	ukts	grammar-connect-logic-goal	εἰς εὐαγγέλιον Θεοῦ	1		Here, **for** introduces a purpose clause. Paul is stating the purpose for which he is **a servant of Christ Jesus**, and the reason why Jesus **called** him and **set** him **apart** . Use a natural way in your language for introducing a purpose clause. Alternate translation: “in order to preach God’s good news” or “so that I could announce the good news from God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
ROM	1	1	ji90	grammar-connect-logic-goal	εὐαγγέλιον Θεοῦ	1		Paul is using the possessive form to describe that **the gospel** comes from **God**. If this is not clear in your language, you could use the adjective “God’s” instead of the noun **God.**  Alternate translation: “God’s gospel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
ROM	1	2	tobh	writing-background	ὃ προεπηγγείλατο διὰ τῶν προφητῶν αὐτοῦ ἐν Γραφαῖς ἁγίαις,	1		In this verse Paul provides this background information about the nature of “the gospel” he proclaims. Paul wants to help readers understand that the ancient promises found in the writings of the **prophets** of the **holy scriptures** of the Jewish people about the coming of the Messiah or Christ were now coming true. Use the natural form in your language for expressing background information. Alternate translation: “this good news that I am proclaiming is what God promised long ago in the prophetical writings that are found in the Jewish sacred writings” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
ROM	1	2	cu3r	figs-distinguish	ὃ	1		Here, **which** marks that further information is going to be given about “the gospel of God” (See [1:1](../01/01.md)). Paul is emphasizing that “the gospel of God” has its origin in **the holy scriptures** that also come from God.

Here, **Son** could refer to: (1) the divine nature of Jesus. Alternate translation: “God’s divine Son” (2) the human nature of Jesus as “Christ” (See [1:1,6](../01/01.md)). Because **Son** is an Old Testament title that can refer to David and his descendants as God’s chosen kings (See [2 Samuel 7:14; Psalm 2](2sam/07/14.md), Paul could also be using **Son** as a synonym for God’s anointed king or “Christ.” Alternate translation: “his Son the Christ” or “God’s Son the anointed king” (3) both Jesus’ divine and human natures.

ROM	1	4	sxo3	figs-parallelism		1		In [1:3–4](../01/03.md) Paul uses similar phrases, in different ways, to show that Jesus is both human and God. As it relates to Jesus’ human nature, he “was born from a seed of David according to the flesh.” As it relates to Jesus’ divine nature, he **was designated the Son of God by resurrection in power according to the Spirit**.

ROM	1	4	nhz7	figs-infostructure		1		In this verse, Paul places these phrases in the order he wants to emphasize. If it would be more natural in your language, you could change the order of these phrases. Alternate translation: See the UST (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
ROM	1	4	at5s	figs-activepassive	τοῦ ὁρισθέντος Υἱοῦ Θεοῦ	1	he was declared with power to be the Son of God	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

Alternate translation: “God demonstrated that Jesus was his Son” or “God identified Jesus, ‘Son of God’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ROM	1	4	cp80	guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	Υἱοῦ Θεοῦ…Πνεῦμα…Κυρίου	1		**Son of God** is an important title that describes the relationship between **God** and **Jesus**. The mention of **the Spirit** indicates that Paul is referring to the activity of the Trinity in God’s designation of Jesus as **Son of God**.

Paul is simply stating that he belongs to **God**. If in your language **my God** would indicate a distinction between Paul’s **God** and the **God** of church at Rome God, you could add the plural pronoun “our.” Alternate translation: “our God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish]])
ROM	1	8	tdsj	figs-possession	τῷ Θεῷ μου	1		Paul is using the possessive form to express that he belongs to **God**. When saying, **my God**, Paul does not mean that he owns or has authority over God. Paul means that as a “servant of Jesus Christ” (See [1:1](../01/01.md)), God has ownership and authority over him. You could use a natural way in your language to make this explicit. Alternate translation: “the God I belong to” or “the God that I serve” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
ROM	1	8	qtoy	figs-possession	διὰ Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ	1		Here, Paul is using the possessive form **through Jesus Christ** to express Paul’s authority as an apostle (See [1:1](../01/01.md)).

ROM	1	8	mekg	writing-pronouns	περὶ πάντων ὑμῶν	1		The pronoun **you** is plural and refers to the church at Rome. When Paul says **all of you** he is addressing the whole church as if they are one person. Throughout this letter, **you** refers exclusively to the church at Rome, unless otherwise noted.

ROM	1	8	d31r	figs-possession	ἡ πίστις ὑμῶν	1		Paul is using the possessive form **your faith** to express how much the Roman church trusts in God.  He does not mean that the Roman church has a different **faith** than Paul’s **faith**. Both the church at Rome and Paul trust in **God through Jesus Christ**. If the phrase **your faith** would make a distinction in your language between the **faith** of the Roman church and Paul, use a natural way in your language to avoid this distinction. Alternate translation: “how you trust in Christ” or “the way you trust God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])

ROM	1	8	k7qf	figs-hyperbole	ἐν ὅλῳ τῷ κόσμῳ	1		Here, **throughout the whole world** is an exaggeration that means “across the inhabited world” or “wherever the Roman Empire is.” Paul is not referring to every place on the planet.

ROM	1	9	e9n1	figs-metaphor	μάρτυς γάρ μού ἐστιν ὁ Θεός	1		Paul is appealing to God to validate his personal motives.

He means that he serves God devotedly or enthusiastically by preaching the gospel. If your readers would not understand what **in my spirit in the gospel** means in this context, you could use equivalent metaphors from your culture. Alternatively, you could express Paul’s meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternative translation, “fervently when preaching the gospel about his Son” or “enthusiastically by announcing the good news concerning his Son” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ROM	1	9	o66d	figs-possession	τοῦ Υἱοῦ αὐτοῦ	1		Here, Paul could be using the possessive form **of his Son** to refer to: (1) Jesus as the object of the gospel.

ROM	1	9	f9p2	figs-hyperbole	ἀδιαλείπτως	1	I make mention of you	Here, the word **continually** is an exaggeration that figuratively express the frequency of Paul’s prayers to God for the church at Rome. Paul does not mean that he spends all of his time praying for the church at Rome. If your language would not use exaggeration in this way, use plain language and express the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “I regularly” or “I habitually” (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole)
ROM	1	9	vtuq	figs-idiom	μνείαν ὑμῶν ποιοῦμαι	1		Here, the term **making mention** is an idiom for prayer.

ROM	1	10	mdc8	figs-parallelism	πάντοτε ἐπὶ τῶν προσευχῶν μου, δεόμενος	1	I always request in my prayers that … I may at last be successful … in coming to you	This phrase means the same thing as “I continually make mention of you” in [1:9](../01/09.md). Paul says the same thing twice, in slightly different ways, to show how intensely he prays that God will allow him to visit the church at Rome. Alternate translation: “in all my prayers, I beg God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

ROM	1	10	zfp4	figs-hyperbole	εἴ πως ἤδη ποτὲ	1	by any means	Here, the phrase **if somehow now at last** is an exaggeration that Paul uses to speak about visiting the church at Rome. Paul expresses a deep longing for God to allow him to come to Rome, because he has been hindered so many times (See [1:11, 13](../01/11.md)). If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your language that shows deep longing. Alternate translation: “that at this time there would finally be some way that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
ROM	1	10	is3p	figs-parallelism	εὐοδωθήσομαι ἐν τῷ θελήματι τοῦ Θεοῦ, ἐλθεῖν πρὸς ὑμᾶς	1	at last	Since the word translated as **I will be successful** often means “to have a good journey,” Paul may be stressing how much he wants to visit the church at Rome. So here, **I will be successful** and ** to come to you** mean similar things. Paul says a similar thing twice, to show how deeply he desires to visit the church at Rome. If this is confusing in your language, you could make that idea explicit. Alternate translation: “if God wills it, I will have a good journey when I visit you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

Paul means that they should mutually encourage each other because they have a mutual faith in Christ.

Alternate translation: “since we have a mutual trust in Christ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ROM	1	13	yi1f	figs-litotes	οὐ θέλω δὲ ὑμᾶς ἀγνοεῖν	1	I do not want you to be uninformed	Here Paul uses a figure of speech that expresses a strong positive meaning by using a negative word together with a word that is the opposite of the intended meaning.

ROM	1	13	axe9	figs-aside	καὶ ἐκωλύθην ἄχρι τοῦ δεῦρο	1		Here Paul is using an aside in order to reinforce how much he wants to visit the Roman church.

ROM	1	13	zvrj	figs-explicit	καὶ ἐκωλύθην ἄχρι τοῦ δεῦρο	1		Paul assumes that his readers will know that **until now** means “even at the present time.” He does not mean that he was **hindered* until the moment he wrote these words, but now he can come to Rome.

Alternate translation: “because I want to announce the gospel to you believers in the Messiah at Rome, I am eager” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])

ROM	1	16	zq2q	figs-merism	Ἰουδαίῳ τε πρῶτον καὶ Ἕλληνι	1		Paul figuratively refers to **the Jew** and **the Greek**, using these types of people in order to include all of humanity or **everyone**. In other words, the good news about the Christ is not just for Jews (as would be assumed in this context), but is for each person from every nation who continues to trust in God, since God makes no distinction between people types (See [2:11; 3:22; 10:12](../02/11.md); [Acts 10:34](acts/10/34.md)).

(See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/judge]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/believe]])<br><br>### “Therefore you are without excuse”<br><br>This phrase looks back at Chapter 1. In some ways, it actually concludes what Chapter 1 teaches. This phrase explains why everyone in the world must worship the true God.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### “Doers of the Law”<br><br>Those who try to obey the law will not be justified by trying to obey it. Those who are justified by believing in Jesus show that their faith is real by obeying God’s commands. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/justice]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]])<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Rhetorical Questions<br><br>Paul uses several rhetorical questions in this chapter. It appears the intent of these rhetorical questions is to make the reader see their sin so they will trust in Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/guilt]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]])<br><br>### Hypothetical Situation<br><br>In context, “he will give eternal life” in verse 7 is a hypothetical statement. If a person could live a perfect life, they would earn eternal life as a reward. But only Jesus was able to live a perfect life.<br><br>Paul gives another hypothetical situation in verses 17-29. Here he explains that even those who earnestly try to obey the law of Moses are guilty of violating the law. In English, this is about those who follow the “letter” of the law but cannot follow the “spirit” or general principles of the law. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### “You who judge”<br><br>At times, You can translate this in a simpler way. But it is translated in this relatively awkward way because when Paul refers to “people who judge” he is also saying that everyone judges. It is possible to translate this as “those who judge (and everyone judges).”

Alternate translation: “However” or “Indeed” or “In fact” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])

He means that these people stubbornly refuse to repent from their judgmental way of life.

ROM	2	5	f52g	figs-hendiadys	τὴν σκληρότητά σου καὶ ἀμετανόητον	1	hardness and unrepentant heart	This phrase expresses a single idea by using two words connected with **and**.

He means that the more they refuse to repent, the greater will be their punishment when God finally judges all humanity **on the day of wrath**.

Alternatively, you could express Paul’s meaning in a non-figurative way.

The repetition is used to emphasize the two components of the Judgment Day: **wrath** against **unrepentant** people and **righteous judgment** for those who repent. If your language does not use repetition in this way, you could combine these phrases. Alternate translation: “on the final day that God will punish unrepentant people and reveal who is righteous” or “when God finally reveals how he punishes the unrepentant and vindicates his righteous people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
ROM	2	5	yqta	figs-idiom	ἐν ἡμέρᾳ ὀργῆς	1		Here, the phrase **the day of wrath** is an idiom that refers to the common Old Testament phrase for God’s final judgment of the human race (For example see [Zephaniah 1:15, 18; 2:3](../Zeph/01/15.md)). Paul does not mean that this is a literal **day** when this will happen, but a period of time or even outside of how humans reckon time. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could capitalize the term **day** or make this explicit some other way. Alternate translation: “when God punishes for the last time” or “on the Day of God’s wrath” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

ROM	2	6	ylpm			1		In [2:7-10](../02/06.md), Paul explains what he means that God will **pay back to each according to his deeds**. If your language does not use a colon to indicate that that follows is the explanation of an idea, use a natural way in your language to make this explicit.

He means that they are striving or trying to live in such a way as to achieve **eternal life**. If your readers would not understand what **are seeking** means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express Paul’s meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternative translation: “for those who … keep working to attain” or “to those people who … keep hoping to attain” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ROM	2	7	ub51	figs-abstractnouns	δόξαν καὶ τιμὴν καὶ ἀφθαρσίαν	1	praise, honor, and incorruptibility	If your language does not use abstract nouns for these ideas, you could express the ideas behind the abstract nouns **glory**, **honor**, and **incorruptibility** in another way.

ROM	2	7	gec6	figs-ellipsis	ζωὴν αἰώνιον	1	seeking	Paul is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete.

ROM	2	17	cnq7	grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἰ	1	if you call yourself a Jew	In [2:17-20](../02/17.md), Paul speaks as if these descriptions of Jews were hypothetical possibilities, but he means that they are actually true.

Alternate translation: “since” or “because” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
ROM	2	17	kfe8	figs-youcrowd	σὺ	1		Even though Paul is speaking to the Jewish people, he is hypothetically addressing an individual, so **you** and **your** and **yourself** is singular throughout [2:17–27](../02/17.md) unless otherwise noted. But if the singular form would not be natural in your language for someone who was speaking to a group of people, you could use the plural forms of **you** and **your** and **yourself** in your translation.

ROM	2	24	pg0g	figs-explicit	δι’ ὑμᾶς	1		The implication is that since the Jews are God’s people, and represent him to **among the Gentiles**, their bad behavior is what causes **the Gentiles** to blaspheme **the name of God**.

Alternate translation: “as a result of how you act” or “because of the way you behave” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

ROM	2	25	xq62	figs-hyperbole	ἡ περιτομή σου, ἀκροβυστία γέγονεν	1	your circumcision becomes uncircumcision	Here, **your circumcision becomes uncircumcision** is an exaggeration that Paul uses to show how important it is for God’s people to **practice the law**. Paul does not mean that when someone transgresses God’s **law** he is no longer physically circumcised. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your language that expresses this idea. Alternate translation: “it is as if you are no longer circumcised” or “it is the same as if you never received circumcision” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
ROM	2	26	vt7f	figs-hypo	ἐὰν οὖν	1	the uncircumcised person	Paul is using a hypothetical situation to help his readers recognize the benefits for **the uncircumcised one** who **keeps the requirements of the law**.

ROM	2	26	mkhr	figs-possession	τὰ δικαιώματα τοῦ νόμου	1		Paul is using the possessive form to describe **requirements** found in **the law**.

ROM	2	26	be71	figs-rquestion	οὐχ ἡ ἀκροβυστία αὐτοῦ εἰς περιτομὴν λογισθήσεται	1	will not his uncircumcision be considered as circumcision?	Paul is using a rhetorical question here to emphasize how important it is do what **the law** requires. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “certainly God will reckon him as circumcised” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
ROM	2	26	rjb5	figs-activepassive	οὐχ ἡ ἀκροβυστία αὐτοῦ εἰς περιτομὴν λογισθήσεται	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Paul implies that “God” did it.

Here, **who, by nature uncircumcised, fulfills the law** gives us further information about the person who **will condemn** the **transgressor of the law**. If this is not understood in your language, you can make the relationship between these phrases clearer. Alternate translation: “Even if a Gentile is physically uncircumcised, but performs what the law requires, that person will judge” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish]])
ROM	2	27	pree	figs-distinguish	σὲ τὸν διὰ γράμματος καὶ περιτομῆς παραβάτην νόμου	1		Here, **though having the letter and circumcision** gives us further information about the **transgressor of the law**.

ROM	4	intro	f9jc			0		# Romans 4 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with verses 7-8 of this chapter, which are words from the Old Testament.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### The purpose of the law of Moses<br><br>Paul builds upon material from chapter 3. He explains how Abraham, the father of Israel, was justified. Even Abraham could not be justified by what he did. Obeying the law of Moses does not make a person right with God. Obeying God’s commands is a way a person shows they believe in God. People have always been justified only by faith. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/justice]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]])<br><br>### Circumcision<br><br>Circumcision was important to the Israelites. It identified a person as a descendant of Abraham. It was also a sign of the covenant between Abraham and Yahweh. However, no person was justified only by being circumcised. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/circumcise]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/covenant]])<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Rhetorical Questions<br><br>Paul uses rhetorical questions in this chapter. It appears the intent of these rhetorical questions is to make the reader see their sin so they will trust in Jesus.

ROM	5	intro	i1dt			0		# Romans 5 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Many scholars view verses 12-17 as some of the most important, but difficult, verses in Scripture to understand. Some of their richness and meaning has likely been lost while being translated from how the original Greek was constructed.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Results of justification<br><br>How Paul explains the results of our being justified is an important part of this chapter. These results include having peace with God, having access to God, being confident about our future, being able to rejoice when suffering, being eternally saved, and being reconciled with God. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/justice]])<br><br>### “All sinned”<br><br>Scholars are divided over what Paul meant in verse 12: “And death spread to all people, because all sinned.” Some believe that all of mankind was present in the “seed of Adam.” So, as Adam is the father of all mankind, all of mankind was present when Adam sinned. Others believe that Adam served as a representative head for mankind. So when he sinned, all of mankind “fell” as a result. Whether people today played an active or passive role in Adam’s original sin is one way these views differ. Other passages will help one decide. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/seed]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])<br><br>### The second Adam<br><br>Adam was the first man and the first “son” of God. He was created by God. He brought sin and death into the world by eating the forbidden fruit. Paul describes Jesus as the “second Adam” in this chapter and the true son of God. He brings life and overcame sin and death by dying on the cross. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sonofgod]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/death]])

ROM	6	intro	v522			0		# Romans 6 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Paul begins this chapter by answering how someone might hypothetically object to what he taught in Chapter 5. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Against the Law<br><br>In this chapter, Paul refutes the teaching that Christians can live however they want after they are saved. Scholars call this “antinomianism” or being “against the law.” To motivate godly living, Paul recalls the great price Jesus paid for a Christian to be saved. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/save]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/godly]])<br><br>### Servants of sin<br><br>Before believing in Jesus, sin enslaves people. God frees Christians from serving sin. They are able to choose to serve Christ in their lives. Paul explains that when Christians choose to sin, they willingly choose to sin. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])<br><br>### Fruit<br><br>This chapter uses the imagery of fruit. The image of fruit usually refers to a person’s faith producing good works in their life. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/fruit]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]])<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Rhetorical Questions<br><br>Paul uses rhetorical questions in this chapter. It appears the intent of these rhetorical questions is to make the reader see their sin so they will trust in Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/guilt]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Death<br><br>Paul uses “death” many different ways in this chapter: physical death, spiritual death, sin reigning in the heart of man, and to end something. He contrasts sin and death with the new life provided by Christ and the new way Christians are supposed to live after they are saved. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/death]])

ROM	8	intro	ev4r			0		# Romans 8 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>The first verse of this chapter is a transitional sentence. Paul concludes his teaching of Chapter 7 and leads into the words of Chapter 8.<br><br>Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with verse 36. Paul quotes these words from the Old Testament.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Indwelling of the Spirit<br><br>The Holy Spirit is said to live inside a person or inside their heart. If the Spirit is present, this signifies that a person is saved. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/save]])<br><br>### “These are sons of God”<br><br>Jesus is the Son of God in a unique way. God also adopts Christians to be his children. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sonofgod]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/adoption]])<br><br>### Predestination<br><br>Many scholars believe Paul in this chapter teaches on a subject known as “predestination.” This is related to the biblical concept of “predestine.” Some take this to indicate that God has, from before the foundation of the world, chosen some to be eternally saved. Christians have different views on what the Bible teaches on this subject. So translators need to take extra care when translating this chapter, especially with regards to elements of causation. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/predestine]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/save]])<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Metaphor<br><br>Paul poetically presents his teaching in verses 38 and 39 in the form of an extended metaphor. He explains that nothing can separate a person from the love of God in Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### No condemnation<br><br>This phrase must be translated carefully to avoid doctrinal confusion. People are still guilty of their sin. God disapproves of acting sinfully, even after believing in Jesus. God still punishes the sins of believers, but Jesus has paid the punishment for their sin. This is what Paul expresses here. The word “condemn” has several possible meanings. Here Paul emphasizes that people who believe in Jesus are no longer punished eternally for their sin by being “condemned to hell.” (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/guilt]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/condemn]])<br><br>### Flesh<br><br>This is a complex issue. “Flesh” is possibly a metaphor for our sinful nature.

ROM	9	intro	w6f4			0		# Romans 9 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>In this chapter, Paul changes what he is teaching about. In Chapters 9-11, he focuses on the nation of Israel.<br><br>Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with verses 25-29 and 33 of this chapter. Paul quotes all of these words from the Old Testament.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Flesh<br><br>Paul uses the word “flesh” in this chapter only to refer to Israelites, people physically descending from Abraham through Jacob, who God named Israel. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/flesh]])<br><br>In other chapters, Paul uses the word “brother” to mean fellow Christians. However, in this chapter, he uses “my brothers” to mean his kinsmen the Israelites.<br><br>Paul refers to those who believe in Jesus as “children of God” and “children of the promise.”<br><br>### Predestination<br><br>Many scholars believe Paul in this chapter teaches extensively on a subject known as “predestination.” This is related to the biblical concept of “predestine.” Some take this to indicate that God has, from before the foundation of the world, chosen some people to eternally save. Christians have different views on what the Bible teaches on this subject. So translators need to take extra care when translating this chapter. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/predestine]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/save]])<br><br>### Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Stone of stumbling<br><br>Paul explains that while some Gentiles accepted Jesus as their savior by believing in him, most Jews were trying to earn their salvation and so rejected Jesus. Paul, quoting the Old Testament, describes Jesus as a stone that the Jews stumble over when walking. This “stone of stumbling” causes them to “fall.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### “It is not everyone in Israel who truly belongs to Israel”<br><br>Paul uses the word “Israel” in this verse with two different meanings. The first “Israel” means the physical descendants of Abraham through Jacob. The second “Israel” means those who are God’s people through faith. The UST reflects this.

ROM	11	intro	e9qz			0		# Romans 11 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with verses 9-10, 26-27, and 34-35, which are words from the Old Testament.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Grafting<br><br>Paul uses the image of “grafting” to refer to the place of the Gentiles and Jews in the plans of God. Making one plant to be permanently part of another plant is called “grafting.” Paul uses the picture of God grafting the Gentiles as a wild branch into his saving plans. But God has not forgotten about the Jews, who are spoken of as the natural plant. God will also save Jews who believe in Jesus.<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### “Did God reject his people? May it never be”<br><br>Whether Israel (the physical descendants of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob) has a future in the plans of God, or if they have been replaced in the plans of God by the church, is a major theological issue in Chapters 9-11. This phrase is an important part of this section of Romans. It seems to indicate that Israel remains distinct from the church. Not all scholars arrive at this conclusion. Despite their currently rejecting Jesus as their Messiah, Israel has not exhausted the grace and mercy of God.

ROM	13	intro	l4q7			0		# Romans 13 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>In the first part of this chapter, Paul teaches Christians to obey rulers who govern them. At that time, ungodly Roman rulers governed the land. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/godly]])<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Ungodly rulers<br><br>When Paul teaches about obeying rulers, some readers will find this difficult to understand, especially in places where rulers persecute the church. Christians must obey their rulers as well as obey God, unless the rulers do not allow Christians to do something God explicitly commands them to do. There are times when a believer must submit to these rulers and suffer at their hands. Christians understand that this world is temporary and they will ultimately be with God forever. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/eternity]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Flesh<br><br>This is a complex issue. “Flesh” is possibly a metaphor for our sinful nature. Paul is not teaching that our physical bodies are sinful. Paul appears to be teaching that as long as Christians are alive (“in the flesh”), we will continue to sin. But our new nature will be fighting against our old nature. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/flesh]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])
