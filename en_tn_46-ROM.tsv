ROM	front	intro	gtn1			0		# Introduction to Romans<br><br>## Part 1: General Introduction<br><br>### Outline of the book of Romans<br><br>1. Introduction (1:1–15)<br>2. Main Theme: Righteousness is received by trusting in Jesus Christ (1:16–17)<br>3. All mankind is condemned because of sin (1:18–3:20)<br>4. Righteousness is received through Jesus Christ by trusting in him (3:21–5:21)<br>5. Becoming like Christ in this life (6:1–8:39)<br>6. God’s plan for Israel (9:1–11:36)<br>7. Instructions for living as Christians (12:1–15:13)<br>8. Conclusion (15:14–16:27)<br><br>### Who wrote the book of Romans?<br><br>The Apostle Paul wrote the book of Romans and may other books in the New Testament. Paul was from the city of Tarsus. He had been known as Saul in his early life. Before becoming a Christian, Paul was part of a strict Jewish religious group called the Pharisees. He persecuted Christians. After he became a Christian, he traveled several times throughout the Roman Empire telling people about Jesus.<br><br>Paul probably wrote this letter while he was staying in the city of Corinth during his third trip through the Roman Empire.<br><br>### What is the book of Romans about?<br><br>Paul wrote this letter to the Christians in Rome. Paul wanted to get them ready to receive him when he visited them. He said his purpose was to “bring about the obedience of faith” ([16:26](../16/26.md)).<br><br>In this letter Paul most fully described the gospel of Jesus Christ. He explained that both Jews and non-Jews have sinned, and God will forgive them and declare them righteous only if they believe in Jesus (chapters 1–11). Then he gave them practical advice for how believers should live (chapters 12–16),<br><br>### How should the title of this book be translated?<br><br>Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “Romans.” Or they may choose a clearer title, such as “Paul’s Letter to the Church in Rome,” or “A Letter to the Christians in Rome.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])<br><br>## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts<br><br>### What are the titles used to refer to Jesus?<br><br>In Romans, Paul described Jesus Christ by many titles and descriptions: Jesus Christ (1:1), the Seed of David (1:3), the Son of God (1:4), the Lord Jesus Christ (1:7), Christ Jesus (3:24), Propitiation (3:25), Jesus (3:26), Jesus our Lord (4:24), Lord of Hosts (9:29), a Stumbling Stone and Rock of Offence (9:33), the End of the Law (10:4), the Deliverer (11:26), Lord of the Dead and the Living (14:9), and the Root of Jesse (15:12).<br><br>### How should theological terms in Romans be translated?<br><br>Paul uses many theological terms that are not used in the four Gospels. As early Christians learned more about the meaning of Jesus Christ and his message, they needed words and expressions for new ideas. Some examples of these words are “justification” (5:1), “works of the law” (3:20), “reconcile” (5:10), “propitiation” (3:25), “sanctification” (6:19), and “the old man” (6:6). If your language doesn’t have similar words, you can develop short phrases to communicate these ideas. For example, the term “gospel” can be translated as “the good news about Jesus Christ.”<br><br>Translators should also remember that some of these terms have more than one meaning. The meaning will depend on how the author is using the word in that particular passage. For example, “righteousness” sometimes means that a person obeys God’s law. At other times, “righteousness” means that Jesus Christ has perfectly obeyed God’s law for us.<br><br>### What did Paul mean by “a remnant” of Israel ([11:5](../11/05.md))?<br><br>The idea of a “remnant” is important both in the Old Testament and for Paul. Most of the Israelites were either killed or scattered among other people when the Assyrians and then the Babylonians conquered their land. Only a relatively few Jews survived. They were known as “the remnant.”<br><br>In [11:1–9](../11/01.md), Paul speaks of another remnant. This remnant is the Jews whom God saved because they believed in Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/remnant]])<br><br>## Part 3: Important Translation Issues<br><br>### What did Paul mean by being “in Christ”?<br><br>The phrase “in Christ” and similar phrases occur in 3:24; 6:11, 23; 8:1,2,39; 9:1; 12:5,17; 15:17; and 16:3,7,9,10. Paul used these kinds of phrases as a metaphor to express that Christian believers belong to Jesus Christ. Belonging to Christ means the believer is saved and is made a friend with God. The believer is also promised to live with God forever. However, this idea can be difficult to represent in many languages.<br><br>These phrases also have specific meanings that depend on how Paul used them in a particular passage. For example, in [3:24](../03/24.md) (“the redemption that is in Christ Jesus”), Paul referred to our being redeemed “because” of Jesus Christ. In [8:9](../08/09.md) (“you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit”), Paul spoke of believers submitting “to” the Holy Spirit. In [9:1](../09/01.md) (“I tell the truth in Christ”), Paul meant that he is telling the truth that “is in agreement with” Jesus Christ.<br><br>Nevertheless, the basic idea of our being united with Jesus Christ (and with the Holy Spirit) is seen in these passages as well. Therefore, the translator has a choice in many passages that use “in.” He will often decide to represent the more immediate sense of “in,” such as, “by means of,” “in the manner of,” or “in regard to.” But, if possible, the translator should choose a word or phrase that represents the immediate sense and the sense of “in union with.” (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/inchrist]])<br><br>### How are the ideas of “holy,” “saints” or “holy ones,” and “sanctify” represented in Romans in the ULT?<br><br>The scriptures use such words to indicate any one of various ideas. For this reason, it is often difficult for translators to represent them well in their versions. In translating into English, the ULT uses the following principles:<br><br>* Sometimes the meaning in a passage implies moral holiness. Especially important for understanding the gospel is the fact that God considers Christians to be sinless because they are united to Jesus Christ. Another related fact is that God is perfect and faultless. A third fact is that Christians are to conduct themselves in a blameless and faultless manner in life. In these cases, the ULT uses “holy,” “holy God,” “holy ones” or “holy people.” (See: [1:7](../01/07.md))<br>* Sometimes the meaning in a passage indicates a simple reference to Christians without implying any particular role filled by them. In cases where some other English versions have “saints” or “holy ones,” the ULT uses “believers.” (See: 8:27; 12:13; 15:25, 26, 31; 16:2, 15)<br>* Sometimes the meaning in a passage indicates the idea of someone or something set apart for God alone. In these cases, the ULT uses “set apart,” “dedicated to,” “consecrated,” or “reserved for.” (See: [15:16](../15/16.md))<br><br>The UST will often be helpful as translators think about how to represent these ideas in their own versions.<br><br>### Singular and plural “you”<br><br>In this book, the word “you” is almost always plural and refers to Paul’s audience. There are only four instances of singular “you,” three of which are quotations from the Old Testament ([9:7](../09/07.md), [17](../09/17.md); [13:4](../13/04.md), [15:9](../15/09.md)). Those exceptions will be addressed in the notes. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])<br><br>### What are the major issues in the text of the book of Romans?<br><br>For the following verses, modern version of the Bible differ from older versions. The ULT includes the modern reading and puts the older reading in a footnote.<br><br>* “he \\[God\\] works all things together for good” ([8:28](../08/28.md)). Some older versions read, “All things work together for good.”<br>* “But if it is by grace, it is no longer by works. Otherwise grace would no longer be grace” ([11:6](../11/06.md)). Some older versions read: “But if it is by works, then is it no more grace: otherwise work is no more work.”<br><br>The following verse is not in the best ancient copies of the Bible. Translators are advised not to include this verse. However, if in the translators’ region there are older Bible versions that have this verse, the translators can include it. If it is translated, it should be put inside square brackets (\\[\\]) to indicate that it is probably not original to the book of Romans.<br><br>* “May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen” ([16:24](../16/24.md)).<br><br>(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
ROM	1	intro	hn5n			0		# Romans 1 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>1. Introduction (1:1–15)<br>    * Greeting (1:1–7)<br>    * Paul plans to visit Rome (1:8–15)<br>2. Main Theme: Righteousness is received by having faith in Jesus Christ (1:16–17)<br>3. All mankind is condemned because of sin (1:18–3:20)<br>    * All non-Jews have sinned (1:18–32)<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### The gospel<br><br>This chapter refers to the contents of the Book of Romans as “the gospel” ([1:2](../rom/01/02.md)). Romans is not a Gospel like Matthew, Mark, Luke, or John, which are historical accounts of the life of Jesus. Instead, chapters 1–8 present the biblical gospel, which is the good news of salvation. The gospel contains the following true ideas: Everyone has sinned. Jesus died for our sins. Jesus came back to life again so that we might live for his glory and receive eternal life when we die.<br><br>### Universal Condemnation and the Wrath of God<br><br>In this chapter Paul explains that no one has an excuse for sinning. We all know about the true God, Yahweh, from his creation all around us. Because of our sin and our sinful nature, every person justly deserves the eternal punishment of God. The requirement for this punishment was satisfied by Jesus dying on a cross for those who believe in him. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/believe]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### “God gave them over”<br><br>Many scholars view the phrases “God gave them over” and “God gave them up” as theologically significant. For this reason, it is important to translate these phrases with God playing a passive role in the action. God allows men to pursue their own sinful desires, he does not force them to act sinfully. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

Alternate translation: “of what we know about God and what is true about God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
ROM	2	21	vy0h	figs-rquestion	ὁ οὖν διδάσκων ἕτερον, σεαυτὸν οὐ διδάσκεις? ὁ κηρύσσων μὴ κλέπτειν, κλέπτεις?	1		In [verses 21–23](../02/21.md) Paul transitions from his description of the Jews in [verses 17–20](../02/17.md) to a series of rhetorical questions. These questions emphasize the hypocrisy of the Jews, who thought they were superior to non-Jews because they knew the Law of Moses. If you would not use rhetorical questions for this purpose in your language, you could translate Paul’s words as statements or exclamations and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “then you, who teach another, do not teach yourself! You, who preach not to steal, actually steal!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
ROM	2	21	rftq	grammar-connect-words-phrases	οὖν	1		Here, **then** indicates that what follows is the second half of the factual conditional statement that Paul began with “if you name yourself a Jew” in [verse 17](../02/17.md). Paul wants to show that what the Jews believe and how they live are in contrast. If you divided [verses 17–21](../02/17.md) into separate sentences, then you may need to include a short form of the “if” statement here. Alternate translation: “if all this is really true, then” or “since all this is really true, then” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
ROM	2	21	uq9y	grammar-collectivenouns	ἕτερον	1	You who teach others, do you not teach yourself?	Here, **another** is a singular pronoun that refers to a group of people. If your language does not use singular pronouns in that way, you can use a different expression. Alternate translation: “other people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns]])
ROM	2	21	abq0	figs-explicit	σεαυτὸν οὐ διδάσκεις	1		Here Paul implies that the Jews need to **teach** themselves because they do not actually obey the laws that they teach. They act as if they do not know the Law of Moses. If this might confuse your readers, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “since you don’t obey the law, do you not teach yourself” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ROM	2	22	parm	figs-rquestion	ὁ λέγων μὴ μοιχεύειν, μοιχεύεις? ὁ βδελυσσόμενος τὰ εἴδωλα, ἱεροσυλεῖς?	1	You who preach against stealing, do you steal?	Like in the previous verse, Paul is not asking for information here, but is using the question form twice to emphasize the truth of what he is saying. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as statements or exclamations and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “You, who says not to commit adultery, actually commit adultery! You, who abhor idols, actually rob temples!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
ROM	2	22	dmpg	figs-explicit	ἱεροσυλεῖς	1	You who preach against stealing, do you steal?	Here Paul implies that the **temples** the Jews **rob** are where **idols** are kept and worshipped. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “do you rob temples where idols are kept” or “should you actually enter an idol temple and rob it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ROM	2	23	z80m	figs-rquestion	ὃς ἐν νόμῳ καυχᾶσαι διὰ τῆς παραβάσεως τοῦ νόμου, τὸν Θεὸν ἀτιμάζεις	1		Like in the previous two verses, Paul is not asking for information here, but is using the question form to emphasize the truth of what he is saying. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “You, who boast in the law, actually dishonor God through the transgression of the law!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
ROM	2	23	grr3	figs-metaphor	ὃς ἐν νόμῳ καυχᾶσαι	1	You who boast in the law, do you dishonor God by breaking the law?	Paul uses **in the law** figuratively as if it were something that people could boast inside of. He means that the Jews brag that they are the only nation who knows God’s law, which has similar meaning to “boast in God” in [verse 17](../02/17.md). If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternative translation, “You, who brag that you are the only ones who know God’s law” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ROM	2	23	ob98	figs-abstractnouns	διὰ τῆς παραβάσεως τοῦ νόμου	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **transgression**, you could express the same idea in another way.

ROM	2	24	yp4l	figs-infostructure	τὸ γὰρ ὄνομα τοῦ Θεοῦ δι’ ὑμᾶς βλασφημεῖται ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσιν, καθὼς γέγραπται	1		If it would be more natural in your language, you could change the order of these phrases. Alternate translation: “For, just as it is written, ‘the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you.’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
ROM	2	24	z54i	grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1		**For** here indicates that what follows is the reason why the previous statement is true. If it might help your readers, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “These things I have said about you are true because” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
ROM	2	24	lk5n	figs-quotemarks	τὸ…ὄνομα τοῦ Θεοῦ δι’ ὑμᾶς βλασφημεῖται ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσιν	1		In this clause Paul quotes part of [Isaiah 52:5](../../isa/52/05.md). It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by setting off all of this material with quotation marks or with whatever punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
ROM	2	24	c4sk	figs-possession	τὸ…ὄνομα τοῦ Θεοῦ	1		Paul is using the possessive form to indicate the **name** that belongs to **God**. Paul does not mean that **God** is a **name**. If this is not clear in your language, you could use a different expression. Alternate translation: “God’s name” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
ROM	2	24	mvwq	figs-synecdoche	τὸ…ὄνομα τοῦ Θεοῦ	1		Paul uses **the name of God** figuratively to refer to**God** himself. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the meaning plainly, as in the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
ROM	2	24	ccm9	figs-activepassive	τὸ…ὄνομα τοῦ Θεοῦ δι’ ὑμᾶς βλασφημεῖται ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσιν	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “the Gentiles blaspheme the name of God because of you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ROM	2	24	m2bq	grammar-connect-logic-result	τὸ…ὄνομα τοῦ Θεοῦ δι’ ὑμᾶς βλασφημεῖται ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσιν	1		If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “because of you the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
ROM	2	24	pg0g	figs-explicit	δι’ ὑμᾶς	1		Paul quotes Isaiah implying that the bad behavior of the Jews is what causes **the Gentiles** to blaspheme **the name of God**. Since the Jews were supposed to represent God to the world, their bad behavior misrepresented God so that the Gentiles blasphemed him. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “as a result of how you act” or “because of the way you behave” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ROM	2	24	e144	figs-you	δι’ ὑμᾶς	1		Here, **you** is the plural and refers to the Jewish people. This is the only occurrence of plural **you** in [verses 17–27](../02/17.md). If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “you Jewish people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
ROM	2	24	edrf	figs-activepassive	καθὼς γέγραπται	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Since Paul is referring to something Isaiah wrote, you could indicate Isaiah as the subject. Alternate translation: “just as Isaiah wrote” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ROM	2	24	end9	writing-quotations	γέγραπται	1		Here Paul uses **it is written** to indicate a quotation from an Old Testament book ([Isaiah 52:5](../../isa/52/05.md)). If your readers would misunderstand this, you could use a comparable phrase that indicates that Peter is quoting from an important text. Alternate translation: “it had been written in the scriptures” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
ROM	2	25	vdu7	grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1		**For** here indicates that [verses 25–29] provide another reason why both Jews and Gentiles will be punished for their sins, as stated in [verse 12](../02/12.md). Paul is arguing against the idea that circumcision guaranteed a Jew’s salvation, which some Jews believed. If it might help your readers, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “Jews will be judged along with Gentiles because” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
ROM	2	25	vp6o	figs-abstractnouns	περιτομὴ…ἡ περιτομή σου, ἀκροβυστία γέγονεν	1		If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **circumcision** and **uncircumcision**, you could express the same ideas in a different way.

ROM	2	25	wm24	figs-ellipsis	ὠφελεῖ	1		Paul is leaving out a word here that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could supply the word from the context. Alternate translation: “benefits you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
ROM	2	25	pqhz	figs-possession	παραβάτης νόμου	1		Paul is using the possessive form to describe a person who transgresses **the law**. If this is not clear in your language, you could use a different expression. Alternate translation: “one who transgresses the law” or “one who breaks the law”(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
ROM	2	25	xq62	figs-hyperbole	ἡ περιτομή σου, ἀκροβυστία γέγονεν	1	your circumcision becomes uncircumcision	Here, **your circumcision becomes uncircumcision** is an exaggeration that Paul uses to show how important it is for God’s people to **practice the law**. Paul does not mean that the person who transgresses God’s **law** is no longer physically circumcised. If this would confuse your readers, you express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “it is as if you are not circumcised” or “it is the same as if you were never circumcised” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
ROM	2	26	vt7f	figs-hypo	ἐὰν οὖν	1	the uncircumcised person	Paul is using a hypothetical situation to help his readers recognize the benefits for **the uncircumcised one** who **keeps the requirements of the law**.

ROM	2	26	r9i4	figs-nominaladj	ἡ ἀκροβυστία	1	the uncircumcised person	Paul is using the adjective **uncircumcision** as a noun in order to describe a group of people.

Alternate translation: “the people who are uncircumcised” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
ROM	2	26	nf3j	figs-idiom	φυλάσσῃ	1	keeps the requirements of the law	Here, **keeps** is an idiom that means “obeys.” If your readers would not understand this, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “is obedient to” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ROM	2	26	mkhr	figs-possession	τὰ δικαιώματα τοῦ νόμου	1		Paul is using the possessive form to describe **requirements** found in **the law**.

ROM	2	26	be71	figs-rquestion	οὐχ ἡ ἀκροβυστία αὐτοῦ εἰς περιτομὴν λογισθήσεται	1	will not his uncircumcision be considered as circumcision?	Paul is using a rhetorical question here to emphasize how important it is do what **the law** requires. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way.

ROM	2	26	rjb5	figs-activepassive	οὐχ ἡ ἀκροβυστία αὐτοῦ εἰς περιτομὴν λογισθήσεται	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

ROM	2	27	lqz2	grammar-connect-logic-result	κρινεῖ ἡ ἐκ φύσεως ἀκροβυστία, τὸν νόμον τελοῦσα	1	And will not the one who is naturally uncircumcised condemn you … the law?

ROM	2	28	n34i	figs-metonymy	ἡ…περιτομή	1	flesh	Here Paul uses **circumcision** figuratively to refer to the change in thinking and attitude that happens when God saves a person. It can also be considered an inward mark of belonging to God’s people, like how circumcision was an outer mark of being Jewish. This was called “circumcision of the heart” in the Old Testament ([Deuteronomy 30:6](../../deu/30/06.md); [Jeremiah 4:4](../../jer/04/04.md)).

ROM	2	29	kjc9	figs-explicit	ἐν Πνεύματι	1		Here, **the Spirit** could refer to: (1) the Holy Spirit, who changes a person’s thoughts and attitude when God saves that person, as in the UST.

You may need to indicate that Paul is asking these questions as if he were a non-Christian Jew responding to his arguments. When Paul asks the rhetorical questions, he is speaking as if he were a non-Christian Jew arguing against Paul. When Paul answers those questions, he is speaking as himself. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this change in speakers with quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate quotations, as in the UST.

Paul is not asking for information, but is using these two questions here to express the objections that a Jew might have to what Paul said in the previous chapter, especially what he said in [2:28–29](../02/28.md). If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way.

ROM	3	31	ppvo	figs-exclusive	νόμον ἱστάνομεν	1		Here, **we** is used exclusively to refer to Paul and other Christians. Your language may require you to mark these forms. Alternate translation: “we Christians uphold the law” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
ROM	3	31	c295	figs-metaphor	νόμον ἱστάνομεν	1		Paul uses **uphold** figuratively to refer to **the law** as if it were an object that people could hold up high. The meaning of **uphold** here is the opposite meaning of **nullify** earlier in the verse. It could mean: (1) Christians fulfill the requirements of the law by trusting in Jesus, who fulfilled the law for them. Alternate translation: “we fulfill the law by faith” (2) Christians value **the law** and affirm that it is useful. Alternative translation: “we confirm that the law is useful” or “we affirm that the law has value”(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ROM	4	intro	f9jc			0		# Romans 4 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>4. Righteousness is received through Jesus Christ by trusting in him (3:21–5:21)<br>    * God’s righteousness is received through faith (3:21–26)<br>    * No one can boast in works (3:27–31)<br>    * The examples of Abraham and David (4:1–25)<br><br>Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with [verses 7–8](../04/07.md) of this chapter, which are words from the Old Testament.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### The purpose of the law of Moses<br><br>In this chapter Paul continues to develop his argument based on what he wrote in the previous chapter. He explains how God made Abraham, the ancestor of all Jews, righteous a long time before God gave the Jews the Law of Moses. Even Abraham could not become righteous by what he did. Rather, God made Abraham righteous on the basis of Abraham’s faith. Obeying the law of Moses does not make a person righteous. People have always become righteous only by faith. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/justice]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]])<br><br>### Circumcision<br><br>Circumcision was important to the Israelites. It identified a person as a descendant of Abraham. It was also a sign of the covenant between Abraham and Yahweh. However, being circumcised never made anyone righteous. In this chapter Paul uses “circumcision” to refer to Jews and “uncircumcision” to refer to non-Jews. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/circumcise]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/covenant]])<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Rhetorical Questions<br><br>In [verses 1](../04/01.md), [3](../04/03.md), and [9–10](../04/09.md) Paul continues using rhetorical questions like he did in the previous chapter. He does this in order to answer objections that Jews might make about what he is saying.
ROM	4	1	q7wc			0	Connecting Statement:	[Verses 1–12](../04/01.md) are a series of rhetorical questions and answers that Paul uses to emphasize that even **Abraham**, the ancestor of the Jewish people, was made righteous by God “through faith.”
ROM	4	1	gxv3	grammar-connect-logic-result	τί οὖν	1		Here, **then** indicates that what follows is a response to what Paul said in the previous chapter, especially what he said in [3:27–31](../03/27.md).

ROM	4	1	gw29	figs-rquestion	τί οὖν ἐροῦμεν, εὑρηκέναι Ἀβραὰμ τὸν προπάτορα ἡμῶν κατὰ σάρκα?	1		In this verse Paul is not asking for information, but is using a question to express the objections that a Jew might have to what Paul said in the previous chapter, especially what he said in [3:27–31](../03/27.md). If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “Then we will say that Abraham, our forefather according to the flesh, has surely discovered something!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
ROM	4	1	rhrp	figs-quotemarks	τί οὖν ἐροῦμεν, εὑρηκέναι Ἀβραὰμ τὸν προπάτορα ἡμῶν κατὰ σάρκα?	1		In this verse and the first part of the next verse, Paul is speaking as if he were a non-Christian Jew arguing against Paul. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate quotations, as in the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
ROM	4	1	s4b5	figs-exclusive	ἐροῦμεν	1		In [verses 1–9](../04/01.md) Paul uses **we** exclusively to speak of himself and other Jews. Your language may require you to mark these forms. Alternate translation: “will we Jews say” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
ROM	4	1	ot88	figs-infostructure	εὑρηκέναι Ἀβραὰμ τὸν προπάτορα ἡμῶν κατὰ σάρκα	1		If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases. Alternate translation: “that Abraham has discovered, who is our forefather according to the flesh” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
ROM	4	1	fk5t	figs-idiom	κατὰ σάρκα	1		See how you translated **according to the flesh** in [1:3](../01/03.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

ROM	4	2	oe12	grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἰ…Ἀβραὰμ ἐξ ἔργων ἐδικαιώθη, ἔχει καύχημα	1		Paul is speaking as if this were a hypothetical possibility, but he means that the unbelieving Jew might think that this is actually true. In Paul’s time some Jewish teachers taught that Abraham had a right to boast because of his faith. However, since translating this as if it were true might confuse your readers, it is best to use a hypothetical sentence, as in the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
ROM	4	2	wvmh	figs-activepassive	Ἀβραὰμ…ἐδικαιώθη	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

Alternate translation: “God justified Abraham” or “God made Abraham right with himself” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ROM	4	2	sibe	figs-explicit	ἐξ ἔργων	1		Paul assumes that his readers would understand that **works**means “works of the law” as in [3:28](../03/28.md).

ROM	4	2	z9wx	figs-metaphor	πρὸς Θεόν	1		Paul speaks figuratively of **Abraham** as if he were located in the presence of **God**. He means that Abraham could not **boast** to God about his **righteousness** if it was **righteous by works**. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternative translation: “from God’s perspective” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ROM	4	3	w9i5	grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	For what does the scripture say	**For** here indicates that what follows in this verse is the reason why Paul said in the previous verse that Abraham cannot boast “before God.” Use a natural way in your language to introduce a reason clause.

ROM	4	3	g1wz	figs-personification	τί…ἡ Γραφὴ λέγει	1		Here Paul uses **say** figuratively as if **the scripture** were a person who could speak.

ROM	4	3	xdtx	figs-explicit	ἡ Γραφὴ	1		Here, **the scripture** refers specifically to the quotation from [Genesis 15:6](../../gen/15/06.md) that follows in this verse.

ROM	5	intro	i1dt			0		# Romans 5 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n4. Righteousness is received through Jesus Christ by trusting in him (3:21–5:21)\n    * God’s righteousness is received through faith (3:21–26)\n    * No one can boast in works (3:27–31)\n    * The examples of Abraham and David (4:1–25)\n    * The blessings of justification (5:1–11)\n    * Adam and Christ are compared (5:12–5:21)\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### The second Adam\n\nAdam was the first man and the first “son” of God. He was created by God. He brought sin and death into the world by eating the forbidden fruit. In this chapter Paul describes Jesus as the “second Adam” and the true son of God. Jesus brings eternal life and overcame sin and death by dying on the cross. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sonofgod]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/death]])\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\nIn this chapter the pronouns “we”, “us”, and “our” refer inclusively to all believers in Christ. Paul calls these people those who have been “justified by faith” in [verse 1](../05/01.md). Your language may require you to mark these forms. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
ROM	5	1	age4	grammar-connect-words-phrases	οὖν	1		**Therefore**, here marks a new section of the letter. It also introduces a result clause that summarizes the blessed results of a person becoming righteous by trusting in Jesus, which Paul just discussed in [1:18](../01/18.md)–[4:25](../04/25.md). Use a natural way in your language to indicate result. Alternate translation: “Since all these things are true” or “As a result of everything that I have just told you being true” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])

Alternate translation: “Let us have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, because we have been justified by faith” or “We can have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, since we have been justified by faith” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])

ROM	5	1	ldru	translate-textvariants	εἰρήνην ἔχωμεν	1		Some ancient copies say “we have peace,” which makes sense, since [verses 1–5](../05/01.md) are a list of blessings that belong to those people who have been **justified by faith**. If the reading **let us have peace** is correct, this phrase may be indicating Paul’s desire that his fellow believers continue to experience the peace they have with God. If a translation of the Bible already exists in your area, you could consider using the reading in that translation. If there is not already a Bible translation in your area, we recommend that you follow the readings of ULT and UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])\n
ROM	5	1	kjpb	figs-imperative	ἔχωμεν	1		Paul uses the phrase **let us have peace** to exhort his Christian readers to continue living peacefully with God. It is not a command. This phrase does not imply that those who have been **justified by faith** do not yet have peace with God. Use a form in your language that communicates an exhortation. Alternate translation: “we must continue to have” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
ROM	5	1	hi12	figs-abstractnouns	εἰρήνην ἔχωμεν	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **peace**, you could express the same idea with a verbal form, as in the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

ROM	5	21	wmy8	figs-personification	ἐβασίλευσεν ἡ ἁμαρτία	1	as sin ruled in death	Here, **sin** is spoken of figuratively as if it were a king ruling over people. Paul means that everyone was controlled by their sinful desires. While death **ruled** in [verse 14](../05/14.md), **sin ruled** after God gave the law. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “everyone was controlled by sin” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
ROM	5	21	wuh2	figs-explicit	ἐν τῷ θανάτῳ	1	as sin ruled in death	Here, **in death** could refer to: (1) the metaphorical location in which **sin ruled**.

ROM	6	intro	v522			0		# Romans 6 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>5. Becoming like Christ in this life (6:1–8:39)<br>    * Baptism represents union with Christ’s death (6:1–14)<br>    * Christians are now slaves of righteousness (6:15–23)<br><br>Paul begins this chapter by answering how someone might hypothetically object to what he taught in Chapter 5. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Against the Law<br><br>In this chapter, Paul refutes the teaching that Christians can live however they want after they are saved. Scholars call this “antinomianism” or being “against the law.” To motivate godly living, Paul recalls the great price Jesus paid for a Christian to be saved. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/save]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/godly]])<br><br>### Servants of sin<br><br>Before believing in Jesus, sin enslaves people. God frees Christians from serving sin. They are able to choose to serve Christ in their lives. Paul explains that when Christians choose to sin, they willingly choose to sin. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])<br><br>### Fruit<br><br>This chapter uses the imagery of fruit. The image of fruit usually refers to a person’s faith producing good works in their life. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/fruit]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]])<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Rhetorical Questions<br><br>Paul uses rhetorical questions in this chapter. It appears the intent of these rhetorical questions is to make the reader see their sin so they will trust in Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/guilt]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Death<br><br>Paul uses “death” many different ways in this chapter: physical death, spiritual death, sin reigning in the heart of man, and to end something. He contrasts sin and death with the new life provided by Christ and the new way Christians are supposed to live after they are saved. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/death]])
ROM	6	1	pvg3	figs-rquestion	τί οὖν ἐροῦμεν? ἐπιμένωμεν τῇ ἁμαρτίᾳ, ἵνα ἡ χάρις πλεονάσῃ?	1	What then will we say? Should we continue in sin so that grace may abound?	Paul is using rhetorical questions in [6:1–3](../06/01.md) to reject certain rumors that misrepresent his teachings (See [3:8](../03/08.md)). If you would not use rhetorical questions for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation or communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “We certainly are not saying that people should keep sinning so that God will be more gracious!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
ROM	6	1	fxgw	grammar-connect-words-phrases	τί οὖν	1		Here, **What then** marks a change in topic in [6:1–11](../06/01.md), where Paul teaches about the connection between Christian baptism and union with Christ’s death and resurrection. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
ROM	6	1	fj9e	figs-exclusive	ἐροῦμεν? ἐπιμένωμεν	1	we say	When Paul says **we** the first time, he is speaking of himself and the other apostles, so **we** would be exclusive (See the similar language in [3:8](../03/08.md)). However, when Paul says **we** the second time, he seems to be including all “who were baptized into Christ Jesus” (See [6:3](../06/03.md)), so the second use of **we** would be inclusive of all Christians. Your language may require you to mark these forms. Alternate translation: “will we apostles say? Should we believers in Christ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
ROM	6	1	sa16	figs-metaphor	ἐπιμένωμεν τῇ ἁμαρτίᾳ, ἵνα ἡ χάρις πλεονάσῃ	1		Paul speaks figuratively of **sin** as if it were a location. He means that Christians should no longer **continue** to live sinfully. He also speaks figuratively of **grace** as though it were a crop (See [5:20](../05/20.md)). He speaks of the power or influence of **grace** expanding in the lives of Christians. If your readers would not understand what **in sin** or **increase** means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternative translation: “Should we continue to live sinfully so that we can experience more of how gracious God is” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ROM	6	1	ju6f	figs-quotations	ἐπιμένωμεν τῇ ἁμαρτίᾳ, ἵνα ἡ χάρις πλεονάσῃ?	1		If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this as an exclamatory direct quotation. Alternate translation (change preceding question mark to a comma): “‘Should we continue in sin so that grace may increase?!’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
ROM	6	1	ngpt	figs-abstractnouns	τῇ ἁμαρτίᾳ…ἡ χάρις	1		See how you translated the abstract nouns: **sin** and **grace** in [5:21](../05/21.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
ROM	6	1	rsny	figs-declarative	ἐπιμένωμεν	1		Paul could be using the question form, **Should we**, as an exclamation that communicates an appeal. If this is confusing in your language, you can use a more natural form for making an appeal. Alternate translation (change preceding question mark to a comma): “We must” or “Let us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative]])
ROM	6	1	f5qt	grammar-connect-logic-goal	ἵνα	1		This phrase introduces a purpose clause. Paul is stating the purpose for which someone would **sin**.

ROM	6	2	pa6g	figs-exclamations	μὴ γένοιτο	1		**May it never be** is an exclamatory phrase that communicates a strong prohibition (See how you translated this phrase in [3:31](../03/31.md)). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations]])
ROM	6	2	rgte	figs-metaphor	οἵτινες ἀπεθάνομεν τῇ ἁμαρτίᾳ, πῶς ἔτι ζήσομεν ἐν αὐτῇ?	1		Paul speaks figuratively of **sin** as if were a location where Christians could live or die. He means that for baptized Christians the spiritual kingdom of sin and death (See [5:14,17,21](../05/14.md)) lost its power over them when Christ was crucified (See [6:6](../06/06.md)). If your readers would not understand what **to die to sin** or **live in it** means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternative translation: “We who are no longer dominated by sinning, how could we still live as though we are dominated by sinning” or “Since we are not dominated by sinning anymore, we certainly cannot still live sinfully!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ROM	6	2	gddr	figs-exclusive	οἵτινες ἀπεθάνομεν	1		Unless otherwise noted, **we** and “our” are inclusive of all Christians in this chapter. Your language may require you to mark these forms. Alternate translation: “We believers who in Christ died” or “We Christians who died” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
ROM	6	3	ok3v	grammar-connect-words-phrases	ὅτι	1		Here, **of the fact that** indicates that what follows is the rhetorical answer to the question of **are you ignorant**. Alternate translation: “of this reality:” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
ROM	6	3	wh26	writing-pronouns	ὅσοι	1		The pronoun **as many as** refers to those people who **were baptized into Christ Jesus**. If this might confuse your readers, you could say the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “as many people as” or “however many of you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ROM	6	3	bd11	figs-metaphor	ἐβαπτίσθημεν εἰς Χριστὸν Ἰησοῦν, εἰς τὸν θάνατον αὐτοῦ ἐβαπτίσθημεν	1		Paul speaks figuratively of **Christ Jesus** and **his death** as if they were locations where someone could **be baptized**. He means that people who are **baptized** as Christians are united to **Christ Jesus** and spiritually share in benefits of **his death**. If your readers would not understand what **baptized into** means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternative translation: “become baptized as a Christians are united to Christ Jesus and also as many as become baptized are united to his death” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ROM	6	3	jfs4	figs-parallelism	ἐβαπτίσθημεν εἰς Χριστὸν Ἰησοῦν, εἰς τὸν θάνατον αὐτοῦ ἐβαπτίσθημεν	1		These two phrases mean the same thing. Paul says the same thing twice, in slightly different ways, to show what happens when a Christian is **baptized**. If saying the same thing twice might be confusing for your readers, you can combine the phrases into one. Alternate translation: “become baptized as Christians are spiritually united to Christ Jesus and spiritually participate in his death” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
ROM	6	3	tcve	figs-abstractnouns	τὸν θάνατον	1		See how you translated **death** in [5:21](../05/21.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
ROM	6	4	ufp9	figs-parallelism	συνετάφημεν οὖν αὐτῷ διὰ τοῦ βαπτίσματος εἰς τὸν θάνατον	1		This sentence means the same thing as [6:3](../06/03.md). Paul says the same thing twice, in slightly different ways, to show what happens in Christian **baptism**. If saying the same thing twice might be confusing for your readers, you can combine the phrases into one. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
ROM	6	4	f4va	figs-metaphor	συνετάφημεν οὖν αὐτῷ διὰ τοῦ βαπτίσματος εἰς τὸν θάνατον	1	We were buried, then, with him through baptism into death	Paul speaks figuratively of **baptism** as if it were a burial. He means that in the physical act of going under the water in **baptism**, the Christian ceases to be under the control of eternal **death** (See “died to sin” in [6:2](../06/02.md)). If your readers would not understand what **buried** and **baptism into death** mean in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternative translation: “So then, being baptized represents being buried with Christ in his tomb” or “When we were baptized, we ceased to be controlled by eternal death” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ROM	6	4	m43r	grammar-connect-logic-result	συνετάφημεν οὖν	1		If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, to emphasis what results from **baptism**. Alternate translation: “So then, we were buried” or “As a result, we were buried” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
ROM	6	4	y71v	figs-abstractnouns	τὸν θάνατον…ἐκ νεκρῶν διὰ τῆς δόξης τοῦ Πατρός…ζωῆς	1		See how you translated the abstract nouns: **death** in [6:3](../06/03.md), **glory** in [5:2](../05/02.md), and **life** in [5:21](../05/21.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

Paul is stating the purpose for which God instituted **baptism**. If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases to make this explicit. Alternate translation (without a comma preceding): “in order that we could walk in newness of life, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
ROM	6	4	qa7r	figs-parallelism	ὥσπερ ἠγέρθη Χριστὸς ἐκ νεκρῶν διὰ τῆς δόξης τοῦ Πατρός, οὕτως καὶ ἡμεῖς ἐν καινότητι ζωῆς περιπατήσωμεν	1		These two phrases mean the same thing. Paul says the same thing twice, in slightly different ways, to show the link between Christ’s resurrection and the Christian’s new way of **life** after **baptism**.

Alternate translation: “we would newly live like Christ did when Father gloriously raised him from death” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
ROM	6	4	z6zk	figs-simile	ὥσπερ ἠγέρθη Χριστὸς ἐκ νεκρῶν διὰ τῆς δόξης τοῦ Πατρός, οὕτως καὶ ἡμεῖς ἐν καινότητι ζωῆς περιπατήσωμεν	1		The point of this comparison is that the new way a Christian should live after being baptized is similar to being **raised from the dead**, like Christ was. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent comparison or express this meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “we should live in a new way, similar to when the Father gloriously raised Christ from death” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
ROM	6	4	dpy2	figs-activepassive	ἠγέρθη Χριστὸς ἐκ νεκρῶν διὰ τῆς δόξης τοῦ Πατρός	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “The Father gloriously resurrected Christ from death” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ROM	6	4	t47r	figs-idiom	ἠγέρθη Χριστὸς ἐκ νεκρῶν	1	just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, so also we might walk in newness of life	Here, the phrase **raised from the dead** is an idiom meaning “resurrected from where dead people are” (See how you translated this phrase in [4:24](../04/24.md)). If your readers would not understand this, you could use an equivalent idiom or use plain language. Alternate translation: “Christ resurrected from death” or “Christ resurrected from the grave” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ROM	6	4	ce9z	figs-nominaladj	ἐκ νεκρῶν	1	just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, so also we might walk in newness of life	Paul is using the adjective **the dead** as a noun in order to describe a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this with a noun phrase. Alternate translation: “where dead people are” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
ROM	6	4	gblc	figs-possession	διὰ τῆς δόξης τοῦ Πατρός	1		Paul is using the possessive form to describe **glory** that comes from or characterizes **the Father**. If this is not clear in your language, you could use the adjective “Father’s” instead of the noun “Father” or make this explicit another way. Alternate translation: “through the glorious power of the Father” or “through the Father’s glory” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
ROM	6	4	r3hn	guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	τοῦ Πατρός	1		**Father** is an important title that describes the relationship between God and **Christ** Jesus, as his “Son” (See [1:3–4, 7](../01/03.md)). Be sure to accurately translate these titles in your translation. Alternate translation: “God his Father” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
ROM	6	4	gtns	figs-idiom	ἡμεῖς ἐν καινότητι ζωῆς περιπατήσωμεν	1		Here, the verb **might walk** is an Old Testament idiom meaning “would live” or “would act.” If your readers would not understand this, you could use an equivalent idiom or use plain language. Alternate translation: “we might live in new way” or “we would act like new people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ROM	6	4	x1t4	figs-rpronouns	καὶ ἡμεῖς	1		Paul uses the phrase **we too** to emphasize the union of the baptized Christian with Christ’s resurrection. Use a way that is natural in your language to indicate this emphasis. Alternate translation: “we who are baptized too” or “even we” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns]])
ROM	6	4	hyab	figs-possession	ἐν καινότητι ζωῆς	1		Paul is using the possessive form to describe **life** that is characterized by **newness**.

ROM	6	4	lvim	figs-abstractnouns	ἐν καινότητι	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **newness**, you could express the same idea with a verbal form. Alternate translation: “renewed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
ROM	6	5	p6xk	figs-metaphor	εἰ γὰρ σύμφυτοι γεγόναμεν τῷ ὁμοιώματι τοῦ θανάτου αὐτοῦ, ἀλλὰ καὶ τῆς ἀναστάσεως ἐσόμεθα	1	we have become united with him in the likeness of his death … be united with his resurrection	Paul speaks figuratively of **death** and **resurrection** as if they were things to which baptized Christians could be physically attached. He means that in baptism Christians participate in the spiritually benefits obtained by Christ’s death and will one day resurrect as he did. If your readers would not understand what **united with** means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternative translation: “Indeed, since we participate in Christ’s death through baptism, we will definitely participate in Christ’s life through resurrection” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ROM	6	5	jdzp	grammar-connect-condition-contrary	εἰ γὰρ	1	we have become united with him in the likeness of his death … be united with his resurrection	Paul is making a conditional statement that sounds hypothetical, but he is already convinced that the condition is true. He goes on to conclude that baptized Christians will **certainly be united with** Christ’s **resurrection**.

If this might confuse your readers, you could say the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “Christ’s … with Christ’s” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ROM	6	5	wnd4	figs-metaphor	σύμφυτοι γεγόναμεν	1	we have become united with him in the likeness of his death … be united with his resurrection	Since the Greek word that ULT translates as **united** can mean “planted with,” Paul may be figuratively likening the process of burying a seed in the ground with being buried with Christ, and the result of a sprouting plant with Christ’s resurrection. If it would help your readers understand, you could make this explicit in your translation. Alternatively, you could express the meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternative translation: “we have become planted with” or “have grown together with him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ROM	6	5	z8wa	figs-abstractnouns	τῷ ὁμοιώματι τοῦ θανάτου αὐτοῦ…τῆς ἀναστάσεως	1	we have become united with him in the likeness of his death … be united with his resurrection	If your language does not use abstract nouns for these ideas of **likeness** and **resurrection**, you could express the same ideas in another way.

ROM	6	5	hg5y	figs-explicit	τῷ ὁμοιώματι τοῦ θανάτου αὐτοῦ	1	we have become united with him in the likeness of his death … be united with his resurrection	The implication is that **likeness of his death** refers to “baptism” (See [6:4](../06/04.md)).

Alternate translation: “in the likeness of his death through baptism” or “in baptism that represents dying with him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ROM	6	5	ruhn	grammar-connect-words-phrases	ἀλλὰ καὶ…ἐσόμεθα	1	we have become united with him in the likeness of his death … be united with his resurrection	Here, **also certainly** strongly emphasizes that the reality of future resurrection is established in Christian baptism. If it would be more natural in your language, you could move this phrase to the beginning of the clause to make this emphasis explicit. Alternate translation: “You also need to know that we will” or “it is absolutely certain that we will” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
ROM	6	5	f1q1	figs-ellipsis	τῆς ἀναστάσεως	1	we have become united with him in the likeness of his death … be united with his resurrection	A word is left out here in the original that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete.

ROM	6	6	fhvh	figs-activepassive	ὁ παλαιὸς ἡμῶν ἄνθρωπος συνεσταυρώθη	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

ROM	6	6	lu12	figs-metaphor	ὁ παλαιὸς ἡμῶν ἄνθρωπος συνεσταυρώθη	1		Paul speaks figuratively of sinful humanity as if it were an **old man** nailed to the same cross as Christ. Paul means that when Christ was **crucified** he destroyed the power of **sin** and death that controlled humanity (See [6:12–18](../06/12.md)). If your readers would not understand what **old man** or **crucified with him** means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternative translation: “on Christ’s cross, God crucified the power of sin that controlled humanity” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

He means that how the human race was controlled by living sinfully was spiritually cancelled by the power Christ’s crucifixion. If your readers would not understand what **body of sin** and **nullified** and **enslaved to sin** mean in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture.

Paul means that Christ died for the sake of freeing humanity from being “enslaved to sin” (See [6:6](../06/06.md), and now that he is resurrected, he lives for the sake of glorifying God. If your readers would not understand what **died for sin** and **lives for God** means to be shipwrecked in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture.

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Flesh<br><br>This is a complex issue. “Flesh” is possibly a metaphor for our sinful nature. Paul is not teaching that our physical bodies are sinful. Paul appears to be teaching that as long as Christians are alive (“in the flesh”), we will continue to sin. But our new nature will be fighting against our old nature. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/flesh]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])

Paul is using a rhetorical question here to emphasize that the Jew is required to obey the law his whole life. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “Because you are Jewish, you certainly understand that what God requires in his law obligates you to obey it for as long as you live!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
ROM	7	1	r9fl	figs-gendernotations	ἀδελφοί…τοῦ ἀνθρώπου…ζῇ	1	brothers	Although the term **brothers** and **the man** and **he** are masculine, Paul is using the words here in a generic sense that includes both males and females.

Paul means that the law teaches that a **married woman** is required to stay married to her **husband** for as long he is alive. If this might be confusing for your readers, you could express this meaning in a non-figurative way.

Through the commandment it killed me	As in [Romans 7:7-8](./07.md), Paul is describing **sin** as a person who can do three things: take the opportunity, deceive, and kill.

ROM	8	intro	ev4r			0		# Romans 8 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>5. Becoming like Christ in this life (6:1–8:39)<br>    * Baptism represents union with Christ’s death (6:1–14)<br>    * Christians are now slaves of righteousness (6:15–23)<br>    * Christians have been freed from the law (7:1–6)<br>    * Christians still struggle with indwelling sin (7:7–25)<br>    * The Holy Spirit dwells in Christians (8:1–27)<br>    * Christians have confidence in God’s love (8:28–8:39)<br><br>The first verse of this chapter is a transitional sentence. Paul concludes his teaching of Chapter 7 and leads into the words of Chapter 8.<br><br>Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with verse 36. Paul quotes these words from the Old Testament.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Indwelling of the Spirit<br><br>The Holy Spirit is said to live inside a person or inside their heart. If the Spirit is present, this signifies that a person is saved. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/save]])<br><br>### “These are sons of God”<br><br>Jesus is the Son of God in a unique way. God also adopts Christians to be his children. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sonofgod]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/adoption]])<br><br>### Predestination<br><br>Many scholars believe Paul in this chapter teaches on a subject known as “predestination.” This is related to the biblical concept of “predestine.” Some take this to indicate that God has, from before the foundation of the world, chosen some to be eternally saved. Christians have different views on what the Bible teaches on this subject. So translators need to take extra care when translating this chapter, especially with regards to elements of causation. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/predestine]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/save]])<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Metaphor<br><br>Paul poetically presents his teaching in verses 38 and 39 in the form of an extended metaphor. He explains that nothing can separate a person from the love of God in Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### No condemnation<br><br>This phrase must be translated carefully to avoid doctrinal confusion. People are still guilty of their sin. God disapproves of acting sinfully, even after believing in Jesus. God still punishes the sins of believers, but Jesus has paid the punishment for their sin. This is what Paul expresses here. The word “condemn” has several possible meanings. Here Paul emphasizes that people who believe in Jesus are no longer punished eternally for their sin by being “condemned to hell.” (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/guilt]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/condemn]])<br><br>### Flesh<br><br>This is a complex issue. “Flesh” is possibly a metaphor for our sinful nature. Paul is not teaching that our physical bodies are sinful. Paul appears to be teaching that as long as Christians are alive (“in the flesh”), we will continue to sin. But our new nature will be fighting against our old nature. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/flesh]])

ROM	9	intro	w6f4			0		# Romans 9 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>6. God’s plan for Israel (9:1–11:36)<br>    * Paul’s sorrow for Israel’s unbelief (9:1–5)<br>    * God chooses whom he wants to choose (9:6–13)<br>    * God shows mercy on whom he wants to show mercy (9:14–18)<br>    * No one can question God’s choice (9:19–33)<br><br>In this chapter, Paul changes what he is teaching about. In Chapters 9-11, he focuses on the nation of Israel.<br><br>Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with verses 25-29 and 33 of this chapter. Paul quotes all of these words from the Old Testament.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Flesh<br><br>Paul uses the word “flesh” in this chapter only to refer to Israelites, people physically descending from Abraham through Jacob, who God named Israel. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/flesh]])<br><br>In other chapters, Paul uses the word “brother” to mean fellow Christians. However, in this chapter, he uses “my brothers” to mean his kinsmen the Israelites.<br><br>Paul refers to those who believe in Jesus as “children of God” and “children of the promise.”<br><br>### Predestination<br><br>Many scholars believe Paul in this chapter teaches extensively on a subject known as “predestination.” This is related to the biblical concept of “predestine.” Some take this to indicate that God has, from before the foundation of the world, chosen some people to eternally save. Christians have different views on what the Bible teaches on this subject. So translators need to take extra care when translating this chapter. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/predestine]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/save]])<br><br>### Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Stone of stumbling<br><br>Paul explains that while some Gentiles accepted Jesus as their savior by believing in him, most Jews were trying to earn their salvation and so rejected Jesus. Paul, quoting the Old Testament, describes Jesus as a stone that the Jews stumble over when walking. This “stone of stumbling” causes them to “fall.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### “It is not everyone in Israel who truly belongs to Israel”<br><br>Paul uses the word “Israel” in this verse with two different meanings. The first “Israel” means the physical descendants of Abraham through Jacob. The second “Israel” means those who are God’s people through faith. The UST reflects this.

ROM	11	intro	e9qz			0		# Romans 11 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>6. God’s plan for Israel (9:1–11:36)<br>    * Paul’s sorrow for Israel’s unbelief (9:1–5)<br>    * God chooses whom he wants to choose (9:6–13)<br>    * God shows mercy on whom he wants to show mercy (9:14–18)<br>    * No one can question God’s choice (9:19–33)<br>    * Israel’s false righteousness (10:1–4)<br>    * Salvation is available to everyone (10:5–21)<br>    * Israel has a faithful remnant (11:1–10)<br>    * Israel’s unbelief resulted in non-Jews’ belief (11:11–24)<br>    * God will save Israel (11:15–32)<br>    * Praise for God’s wisdom (11:33–11:36)<br><br>Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with verses 9-10, 26-27, and 34-35, which are words from the Old Testament.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Grafting<br><br>Paul uses the image of “grafting” to refer to the place of the Gentiles and Jews in the plans of God. Making one plant to be permanently part of another plant is called “grafting.” Paul uses the picture of God grafting the Gentiles as a wild branch into his saving plans. But God has not forgotten about the Jews, who are spoken of as the natural plant. God will also save Jews who believe in Jesus.<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### “Did God reject his people? May it never be”<br><br>Whether Israel (the physical descendants of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob) has a future in the plans of God, or if they have been replaced in the plans of God by the church, is a major theological issue in Chapters 9-11. This phrase is an important part of this section of Romans. It seems to indicate that Israel remains distinct from the church. Not all scholars arrive at this conclusion. Despite their currently rejecting Jesus as their Messiah, Israel has not exhausted the grace and mercy of God.

There are times when a believer must submit to these rulers and suffer at their hands. Christians understand that this world is temporary and they will ultimately be with God forever. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/eternity]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Flesh<br><br>This is a complex issue. “Flesh” is possibly a metaphor for our sinful nature. Paul is not teaching that our physical bodies are sinful. Paul appears to be teaching that as long as Christians are alive (“in the flesh”), we will continue to sin.
