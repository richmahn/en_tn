ROM	front	intro	gtn1			0		# Introduction to Romans\n\n## Part 1: General Introduction\n\n### Outline of the book of Romans\n\n1. Introduction (1:1–15)\n2. Main Theme: Righteousness is received by trusting in Jesus Christ (1:16–17)\n3. All mankind is condemned because of sin (1:18–3:20)\n4. Righteousness is received through Jesus Christ by trusting in him (3:21–5:21)\n5. Becoming like Christ in this life (6:1–8:39)\n6. God’s plan for Israel (9:1–11:36)\n7. Instructions for living as Christians (12:1–15:13)\n8. Conclusion (15:14–16:27)\n\n### Who wrote the book of Romans?\n\nThe Apostle Paul wrote the book of Romans and many other books in the New Testament. Paul was from the city of Tarsus. He had been known as Saul in his early life. Before becoming a Christian, Paul was part of a strict Jewish religious group called the Pharisees. He persecuted Christians. After he became a Christian, he traveled several times throughout the Roman Empire telling people about Jesus.\n\nPaul probably wrote this letter while he was staying in the city of Corinth during his third trip through the Roman Empire.\n\n### What is the book of Romans about?\n\nPaul wrote this letter to the Christians in Rome. Paul wanted to get them ready to receive him when he visited them. He said his purpose was to “bring about the obedience of faith” ([16:26](../16/26.md)).\n\nIn this letter Paul most fully described the gospel of Jesus Christ. He explained that both Jews and non-Jews have sinned, and God will forgive them and declare them righteous only if they believe in Jesus (chapters 1–11). Then he gave them practical advice for how believers should live (chapters 12–16),\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nTranslators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “Romans.” Or they may choose a clearer title, such as “Paul’s Letter to the Church in Rome,” or “A Letter to the Christians in Rome.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### What are the titles used to refer to Jesus?\n\nIn Romans, Paul described Jesus Christ by many titles and descriptions: Jesus Christ ([1:1](../01/01.md)), the Seed of David ([1:3](../01/03.md)), the Son of God ([1:4](../01/04.md)), the Lord Jesus Christ ([1:7](../01/07.md)), Christ Jesus ([3:24](../03/24.md)), Propitiation ([3:25](../03/025.md)), Jesus ([3:26](../03/26.md)), Jesus our Lord ([4:24](../04/24.md)), Lord of Hosts ([9:29](../09/29.md)), a Stone of Stumbling and Rock of Offence ([9:33](../09/33.md)), the End of the Law ([10:4](../10/04.md)), the Deliverer ([11:26](../11/26.md)), Lord of the Dead and the Living ([14:9](../14/09.md)), and the Root of Jesse ([15:12](../15/12.md)).\n\n### How should theological terms in Romans be translated?\n\nPaul uses many theological terms that are not used in the four Gospels. As early Christians learned more about the meaning of Jesus Christ and his message, they needed words and expressions for new ideas. Some examples of these words are “justification” ([5:1](../05/01.md)), “works of the law” ([3:20](../03/20.md)), “reconcile” ([5:10](../05/10.md)), “propitiation” ([3:25](../03/25.md)), “sanctification” ([6:19](../06/19.md)), and “the old man” ([6:6](../06/06.md)). If your language doesn’t have similar words, you can develop short phrases to communicate these ideas. For example, the term “gospel” can be translated as “the good news about Jesus Christ.”\n\nTranslators should also remember that some of these terms have more than one meaning. The meaning will depend on how the author is using the word in that particular passage. For example, “righteousness” sometimes means that a person obeys God’s law. At other times, “righteousness” means that Jesus Christ has perfectly obeyed God’s law for us.\n\n### What did Paul mean by “a remnant” of Israel ([11:5](../11/05.md))?\n\nThe idea of a “remnant” is important both in the Old Testament and for Paul. Most of the Israelites were either killed or scattered among other people when the Assyrians and then the Babylonians conquered their land. Only a relatively few Jews survived. They were known as “the remnant.”\n\nIn [11:1–9](../11/01.md), Paul speaks of another remnant. This remnant is the Jews whom God saved because they believed in Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/remnant]])\n\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\n\n### What did Paul mean by being “in Christ”?\n\nThe phrase “in Christ” and similar phrases occur in [3:24](../03/24.md); [6:11](../06/11.md), [23](../06/23.md); [8:1](../08/01.md), [2](../08/02.md), [39](../08/39.md); [9:1](../09/01.md); [12:5](../12/05.md), [17](../12/17.md); [15:17](../15/17.md); and [16:3](../16/03.md), [7](../16/07.md), [9](../16/09.md), [10](../16/10.md). Paul used these kinds of phrases as a metaphor to express that Christian believers belong to Jesus Christ. Belonging to Christ means the believer is saved and is made a friend with God. The believer is also promised to live with God forever. However, this idea can be difficult to represent in many languages.\n\nThese phrases also have specific meanings that depend on how Paul used them in a particular passage. For example, in [3:24](../03/24.md) (“the redemption that is in Christ Jesus”), Paul referred to our being redeemed “because” of Jesus Christ. In [8:9](../08/09.md) (“you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit”), Paul spoke of believers submitting “to” the Holy Spirit. In [9:1](../09/01.md) (“I tell the truth in Christ”), Paul meant that he is telling the truth that “is in agreement with” Jesus Christ.\n\nNevertheless, the basic idea of our being united with Jesus Christ (and with the Holy Spirit) is seen in these passages as well. Therefore, the translator has a choice in many passages that use “in.” He will often decide to represent the more immediate sense of “in,” such as, “by means of,” “in the manner of,” or “in regard to.” But, if possible, the translator should choose a word or phrase that represents the immediate sense and the sense of “in union with.” (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/inchrist]])\n\n### How are the ideas of “holy,” “saints” or “holy ones,” and “sanctify” represented in Romans in the ULT?\n\nThe Scriptures use such words to indicate any one of various ideas. For this reason, it is often difficult for translators to represent them well in their versions. In translating into English, the ULT uses the following principles:\n\n* Sometimes the meaning in a passage implies moral holiness. Especially important for understanding the gospel is the fact that God considers Christians to be sinless because they are united to Jesus Christ. Another related fact is that God is perfect and faultless. A third fact is that Christians are to conduct themselves in a blameless and faultless manner in life. In these cases, the ULT uses “holy,” “holy God,” “holy ones” or “holy people.” (See: [1:7](../01/07.md))\n* Sometimes the meaning in a passage indicates a simple reference to Christians without implying any particular role filled by them. In cases where some other English versions have “saints” or “holy ones,” the ULT uses “believers.” (See: [8:27](../08/27.md); [12:13](../12/13.md); [15:25](../15/25.md), [26](../15/26.md), [31](../15/31.md); [16:2](../16/02.md), [15](../16/15.md))\n* Sometimes the meaning in a passage indicates the idea of someone or something set apart for God alone. In these cases, the ULT uses “set apart,” “dedicated to,” “consecrated,” or “reserved for.” (See: [15:16](../15/16.md))\n\nThe UST will often be helpful as translators think about how to represent these ideas in their own versions.\n\n### What are the major issues in the text of the book of Romans?\n\nFor the following verses, modern versions of the Bible differ from older versions. The ULT includes the modern reading and puts the older reading in a footnote.\n\n* “he \\[God\\] works all things together for good” ([8:28](../08/28.md)). Some older versions read, “All things work together for good.”\n* “But if it is by grace, it is no longer by works. Otherwise grace would no longer be grace” ([11:6](../11/06.md)). Some older versions read: “But if it is by works, then is it no more grace: otherwise work is no more work.”\n\nThe following verse is not in the best ancient copies of the Bible. Translators are advised not to include this verse. However, if in the translators’ region there are older Bible versions that have this verse, the translators can include it. If it is translated, it should be put inside square brackets (\\[\\]) to indicate that it is probably not original to the book of Romans.\n\n* “May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen” ([16:24](../16/24.md)).\n\n(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
ROM	1	intro	hn5n			0		# Romans 1 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n1. Introduction (1:1–15)\n    * Greeting (1:1–7)\n    * Paul plans to visit Rome (1:8–15)\n2. Main Theme: Righteousness is received by having faith in Jesus Christ (1:16–17)\n3. All mankind is condemned because of sin (1:18–3:20)\n    * All non-Jews have sinned (1:18–32)\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### The gospel\n\nThis chapter refers to the contents of the book of Romans as “the gospel” ([1:2](../rom/01/02.md)). Romans is not a Gospel as are Matthew, Mark, Luke, or John, which are historical accounts of the life of Jesus. Instead, chapters 1–8 present the biblical gospel, which is the good news of salvation. The gospel contains the following true ideas: everyone has sinned, Jesus died for our sins, and Jesus came back to life again so that we might live for his glory and receive eternal life when we die.\n\n### Universal Condemnation and the Wrath of God\n\nIn this chapter Paul explains that no one has an excuse for sinning. We all know about the true God, Yahweh, from his creation all around us. Because of our sin and our sinful nature, every person justly deserves the eternal punishment of God. The requirement for this punishment was satisfied by Jesus dying on a cross for those who believe in him. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/believe]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### “God gave them over”\n\nMany scholars view the phrases “God gave them over” and “God gave them up” as theologically significant. For this reason, it is important to translate these phrases with God playing a passive role in the action. God allows men to pursue their own sinful desires; he does not force them to act sinfully. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

ROM	2	21	vy0h	figs-rquestion	ὁ οὖν διδάσκων ἕτερον, σεαυτὸν οὐ διδάσκεις? ὁ κηρύσσων μὴ κλέπτειν, κλέπτεις?	1		In [verses 21–23](../02/21.md) Paul transitions from his description of the Jews in [verses 17–20](../02/17.md) to a series of rhetorical questions. These questions emphasize the hypocrisy of the Jews, who thought they were superior to non-Jews because they knew the Law of Moses. If you would not use rhetorical questions for this purpose in your language, you could translate Paul’s words as statements or exclamations and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “then you, who teach another, do not teach yourself! You, who preach not to steal, actually steal!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
ROM	2	21	rftq	grammar-connect-words-phrases	οὖν	1		Here, **then** indicates that what follows is the second half of the factual conditional statement that Paul began with “if you name yourself a Jew” in [verse 17](../02/17.md). Paul wants to show that what the Jews believe and how they live are in contrast. If you divided [verses 17–21](../02/17.md) into separate sentences, then you may need to include a short form of the “if” statement here. Alternate translation: “if all this is really true, then” or “since all this is really true, then” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
ROM	2	21	uq9y	grammar-collectivenouns	ἕτερον	1	You who teach others, do you not teach yourself?	Here, **another** is a singular pronoun that refers to a group of people. If your language does not use singular pronouns in that way, you can use a different expression. Alternate translation: “other people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns]])
ROM	2	21	abq0	figs-explicit	σεαυτὸν οὐ διδάσκεις	1		Here Paul implies that the Jews need to **teach** themselves because they do not actually obey the laws that they teach. They act as if they do not know the Law of Moses. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “since you don’t obey the law, do you not teach yourself” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ROM	2	22	parm	figs-rquestion	ὁ λέγων μὴ μοιχεύειν, μοιχεύεις? ὁ βδελυσσόμενος τὰ εἴδωλα, ἱεροσυλεῖς?	1	You who preach against stealing, do you steal?	Like in the previous verse, Paul is not asking for information here, but is using the question form twice to emphasize the truth of what he is saying. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as statements or exclamations and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “You, who says not to commit adultery, actually commit adultery! You, who abhor idols, actually rob temples!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
ROM	2	22	dmpg	figs-explicit	ἱεροσυλεῖς	1	You who preach against stealing, do you steal?	Here Paul implies that the **temples** the Jews **rob** are where **idols** are kept and worshipped. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “do you rob temples where idols are kept” or “should you actually enter an idol temple and rob it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ROM	2	23	z80m	figs-rquestion	ὃς ἐν νόμῳ καυχᾶσαι διὰ τῆς παραβάσεως τοῦ νόμου, τὸν Θεὸν ἀτιμάζεις	1		Like in the previous two verses, Paul is not asking for information here, but is using the question form to emphasize the truth of what he is saying. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “You, who boast in the law, actually dishonor God through the transgression of the law!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
ROM	2	23	grr3	figs-metaphor	ὃς ἐν νόμῳ καυχᾶσαι	1	You who boast in the law, do you dishonor God by breaking the law?	Paul uses **in the law** as if it were something that people could boast inside of. He means that the Jews brag that they are the only nation who knows God’s law, which has similar meaning to “boast in God” in [verse 17](../02/17.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternative translation, “You, who brag that you are the only ones who know God’s law” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ROM	2	23	ob98	figs-abstractnouns	διὰ τῆς παραβάσεως τοῦ νόμου	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **transgression**, you could express the same idea in another way.

ROM	2	24	yp4l	figs-infostructure	τὸ γὰρ ὄνομα τοῦ Θεοῦ δι’ ὑμᾶς βλασφημεῖται ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσιν, καθὼς γέγραπται	1		If it would be more natural in your language, you could change the order of these phrases. Alternate translation: “For, just as it is written, ‘the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you.’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
ROM	2	24	z54i	grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1		**For** here indicates that what follows is the reason why the previous statement is true.

It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by setting off all of this material with quotation marks or with whatever punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
ROM	2	24	c4sk	figs-possession	τὸ…ὄνομα τοῦ Θεοῦ	1		Paul is using the possessive form to indicate the **name** that belongs to **God**. Paul does not mean that **God** is a **name**.

Alternate translation: “the Gentiles blaspheme the name of God because of you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ROM	2	24	m2bq	grammar-connect-logic-result	τὸ…ὄνομα τοῦ Θεοῦ δι’ ὑμᾶς βλασφημεῖται ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσιν	1		If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “because of you the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
ROM	2	24	pg0g	figs-explicit	δι’ ὑμᾶς	1		Paul quotes Isaiah implying that the bad behavior of the Jews is what causes **the Gentiles** to blaspheme **the name of God**. Since the Jews were supposed to represent God to the world, their bad behavior misrepresented God so that the Gentiles blasphemed him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “as a result of how you act” or “because of the way you behave” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ROM	2	24	e144	figs-yousingular	δι’ ὑμᾶς	1		Here, **you** is the plural and refers to the Jewish people. This is the only occurrence of plural **you** in [verses 17–27](../02/17.md).

ROM	2	24	edrf	figs-activepassive	καθὼς γέγραπται	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

ROM	2	24	end9	writing-quotations	καθὼς γέγραπται	1		See how you translated this phrase in [1:17](../01/17.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
ROM	2	25	vdu7	grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1		**For** here indicates that [verses 25–29] provide another reason why both Jews and Gentiles will be punished for their sins, as stated in [verse 12](../02/12.md). Paul is arguing against the idea that circumcision guaranteed a Jew’s salvation, which some Jews believed. Use a natural way in your language for indicating a reason. Alternate translation: “Jews will be judged along with Gentiles because” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
ROM	2	25	vp6o	figs-abstractnouns	περιτομὴ…ἡ περιτομή σου, ἀκροβυστία γέγονεν	1		If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **circumcision** and **uncircumcision**, you could express the same ideas in a different way.

ROM	2	25	wm24	figs-ellipsis	ὠφελεῖ	1		Paul is leaving out a word here that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete.

ROM	2	25	xq62	figs-hyperbole	ἡ περιτομή σου, ἀκροβυστία γέγονεν	1	your circumcision becomes uncircumcision	Here, **your circumcision becomes uncircumcision** is an exaggeration that Paul uses to show how important it is for God’s people to **practice the law**. Paul does not mean that the person who transgresses God’s **law** is no longer physically circumcised. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “it is as if you are not circumcised” or “it is the same as if you were never circumcised” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
ROM	2	26	vt7f	grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical	ἐὰν οὖν	1	the uncircumcised person	Paul is using a hypothetical situation to help his readers recognize the benefits for **the uncircumcised one** who **keeps the requirements of the law**.

ROM	4	intro	f9jc			0		# Romans 4 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>4. Righteousness is received through Jesus Christ by trusting in him (3:21–5:21)<br>    * God’s righteousness is received through faith (3:21–26)<br>    * No one can boast in works (3:27–31)<br>    * The examples of Abraham and David (4:1–25)<br><br>Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with [verses 7–8](../04/07.md) of this chapter, which are words from the Old Testament.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### The purpose of the law of Moses<br><br>In this chapter Paul continues to develop his argument based on what he wrote in the previous chapter. He explains how God made Abraham, the ancestor of all Jews, righteous a long time before God gave the Law of Moses to the Jews. Even Abraham could not become righteous by what he did. Rather, God made Abraham righteous on the basis of Abraham’s faith. Obeying the law of Moses does not make a person righteous. People have always become righteous only by faith. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/justice]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]])<br><br>### Circumcision<br><br>Circumcision was important to the Israelites. It identified a person as a descendant of Abraham. It was also a sign of the covenant between Abraham and Yahweh. However, being circumcised never made anyone righteous. In this chapter Paul uses “circumcision” to refer to Jews and “uncircumcision” to refer to non-Jews. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/circumcise]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/covenant]])<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Rhetorical Questions<br><br>In [verses 1](../04/01.md), [3](../04/03.md), and [9–10](../04/09.md) Paul continues using rhetorical questions like he did in the previous chapter. He does this in order to answer objections that Jews might make about what he is saying.
ROM	4	1	q7wc			0	Connecting Statement:	[Verses 1–12](../04/01.md) are a series of rhetorical questions and answers that Paul uses to emphasize that even **Abraham**, the ancestor of the Jewish people, was made righteous by God “through faith.”
ROM	4	1	gxv3	grammar-connect-logic-result	τί οὖν	1		Here, **then** indicates that what follows is a response to what Paul said in the previous chapter, especially what he said in [3:27–31](../03/27.md). See how you translated **What then** in [3:1](../03/01.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
ROM	4	1	gw29	figs-rquestion	τί οὖν ἐροῦμεν, εὑρηκέναι Ἀβραὰμ τὸν προπάτορα ἡμῶν κατὰ σάρκα?	1		In this verse Paul is not asking for information, but is using a question to express the objections that a Jew might have to what Paul said in the previous chapter, especially what he said in [3:27–31](../03/27.md). If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “Then we will say that Abraham, our forefather according to the flesh, has surely discovered something!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
ROM	4	1	rhrp	figs-quotemarks	τί οὖν ἐροῦμεν, εὑρηκέναι Ἀβραὰμ τὸν προπάτορα ἡμῶν κατὰ σάρκα?	1		In this verse and the first part of the next verse, Paul is speaking as if he were a non-Christian Jew arguing against Paul. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by setting off all of this material with quotation marks or with whatever punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
ROM	4	1	s4b5	figs-exclusive	ἐροῦμεν	1		In [verses 1–9](../04/01.md) Paul uses **we** exclusively to speak of himself and other Jews. Your language may require you to mark these forms. Alternate translation: “will we Jews say” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
ROM	4	1	ot88	figs-infostructure	εὑρηκέναι Ἀβραὰμ τὸν προπάτορα ἡμῶν κατὰ σάρκα	1		If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases. Alternate translation: “that Abraham has discovered, who is our forefather according to the flesh” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
ROM	4	1	fk5t	figs-idiom	κατὰ σάρκα	1		See how you translated **according to the flesh** in [1:3](../01/03.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ROM	4	2	pmua	figs-quotemarks	εἰ γὰρ Ἀβραὰμ ἐξ ἔργων ἐδικαιώθη, ἔχει καύχημα	1		These clauses continue the the statements that a Jew might have to against Paul that began in the previous verse. You may need to indicate this with a closing quotation mark at the end of these clauses or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the end of a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])

ROM	4	2	oe12	grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἰ…Ἀβραὰμ ἐξ ἔργων ἐδικαιώθη, ἔχει καύχημα	1		Paul is speaking as if this were a hypothetical possibility, but he means that the unbelieving Jew might think that this is actually true. In Paul’s time some Jewish teachers taught that Abraham had a right to boast because of his faith. However, since translating this as if it were true might confuse your readers, it is best to use a hypothetical sentence, as in the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
ROM	4	2	wvmh	figs-activepassive	Ἀβραὰμ…ἐδικαιώθη	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

Alternate translation: “God justified Abraham” or “God made Abraham right with himself” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ROM	4	2	sibe	figs-explicit	ἐξ ἔργων	1		Paul assumes that his readers would understand that **works**means “works of the law” as in [3:28](../03/28.md).

ROM	4	2	mefy	figs-explicit	ἀλλ’ οὐ πρὸς Θεόν	1		In this clause Paul begins to respond to the rhetorical questions he wrote in the previous clauses and previous verse. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “I would respond by saying, ‘But not before God!’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ROM	4	2	me3d	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	ἀλλ’ οὐ πρὸς Θεόν.	1		What follows the word **but** here is an emphatic contrast to what was just stated. Paul is negating the argument that he presented earlier in this verse and in the previous verse. You could make this emphasis explicit by replacing the period with an exclamation point or another natural way in your language for introducing am emphatic contrast. Alternate translation: “but certainly not before God!” or “however not from God’s perspective!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
ROM	4	2	z9wx	figs-metaphor	πρὸς Θεόν	1		Paul speaks of **Abraham** as if he were located in the presence of **God**. He means that Abraham could not **boast** to God about his **righteousness** if it was **righteous by works**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternative translation: “from God’s perspective” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ROM	4	3	w9i5	grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	For what does the scripture say	**For** here indicates that what follows in this verse is the reason why Paul said in the previous verse that Abraham cannot boast “before God.” Use a natural way in your language to introduce a reason clause.

Alternate translation: “the scripture surely says” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
ROM	4	3	g1wz	figs-personification	τί…ἡ Γραφὴ λέγει	1		Here Paul uses **say** as if **the scripture** were a person who could speak. He means that the scripture he is about to quote contains information related to the topic he is discussing. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “what information is in the scripture” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

Alternate translation: “what is written in the scripture” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
ROM	4	3	xdtx	figs-explicit	ἡ Γραφὴ	1		Here, **the scripture** refers specifically to the quotation from [Genesis 15:6](../gen/15/06.md) that follows in this verse.

ROM	4	3	smc6	figs-activepassive	ἐλογίσθη αὐτῷ εἰς δικαιοσύνην	1	it was counted to him as righteousness	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

ROM	4	3	qked	figs-abstractnouns	δικαιοσύνην	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **righteousness**, you could express the same idea in a different way.

If the reading **let us have peace** is correct, this phrase may be indicating Paul’s desire that his fellow believers continue to experience the peace they have with God. If a translation of the Bible already exists in your area, you could consider using the reading in that translation. If there is not already a Bible translation in your area, we recommend that you follow the readings of ULT and UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])

ROM	5	2	zp5p	figs-possession	τῆς δόξης τοῦ Θεοῦ	1		Paul is using possessive forms to describe how **glory** relates to **God**. This could refer to: (1) the glory that God shares with believers. This was the same glory that God shared with humans when he created them, but which they lost when the first humans sinned, as mentioned in [3:23](../03/23.md). Alternate translation: “of sharing in the glory God has” or “of the glory from God” (2) glorifying God, as in the similar phrase “the glory of the imperishable God” in [1:23](../01/23.md).

He also speaks figuratively of Christians as if God has freed them from being enslaved to sin and has himself or righteousness their master ([6:18](../06/18.md), [22](../06/22.md)). Because Christians are no longer controlled by their desire to sin, they should instead serve God and live in a way that glorifies him ([6:12–14](../06/12.md), [19](../06/19.md)).

However, in [verses 21–25](../07/21.md) Paul uses the word “law” in several different ways. Each of these different uses will be addressed in the notes. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]])<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Marriage<br><br>Scripture commonly uses marriage as a metaphor.

ROM	8	intro	ev4r			0		# Romans 8 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>5. Becoming like Christ in this life (6:1–8:39)<br>    * Baptism represents union with Christ’s death (6:1–14)<br>    * Christians are now slaves of righteousness (6:15–23)<br>    * Christians have been freed from the law (7:1–6)<br>    * The law is not sinful (7:7–12)<br>    * Christians still struggle with indwelling sin (7:13–25)<br>    * The Holy Spirit dwells in Christians (8:1–27)<br>    * Christians have confidence in God’s love (8:28–8:39)<br><br>Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with [verse 36](../08/36.md). Paul quotes these words from the Old Testament.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Indwelling of the Spirit<br><br>In [verses 9–17](../08/09.md) and [26–27](../08/26.md) Paul says that the Holy Spirit dwells inside Christians to help them stop sinning and to intercede for them. The presence of the Holy Spirit within a person indicates that that person is a genuine Christian. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/save]])<br><br>### Predestination<br><br>Many scholars believe this chapter teaches on a subject known as “predestination.” See the use of the word “predestined” in [verses 28–30](../08/28.md) and “elect” in [verse 33](../08/33.md). Some scholars take this to indicate that God has, from before the foundation of the world, chosen some people to save. Christians have different views on what the Bible teaches on this subject, so translators need to take extra care when translating these verses. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/predestine]])<br><br>## Important figure of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Rhetorical questions<br><br>In [verses 24](../08/24.md) and [31–35](../08/31.md) Paul uses rhetorical questions in order to emphasize that what he is saying is true. If you would not use rhetorical questions for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Flesh<br><br>Paul uses “flesh” in a variety of ways throughout this letter. In this chapter he frequently uses it to refer to sinful human nature. However, he uses “flesh” to refer to Christ’s physical body in [verse 3](../08/03.md). Every use of “flesh” will be discussed in the notes.

In Chapters 9-11, Paul focuses on the nation of Israel.<br><br>Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with [verses 25-29](../09/25.md) and [33](../09/33.md) of this chapter. Paul quotes all of these words from the Old Testament.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Predestination<br><br>Many scholars believe that in this chapter Paul teaches extensively on a subject known as “predestination.” Some take this to indicate that God has chosen to save some people from before the world existed. Christians have different views on what the Bible teaches on this subject, so translators need to take extra care when translating this chapter.

Paul quotes [Isaiah 8:14](../../isa/08/14.md) and [28:16](../../isa/28/16.md) to describe Jesus as if he were a stone that the Jews trip over when walking. See the translations and notes for how Peter uses these same verses from Isaiah in [1 Peter 2:6](../1pe/02/06.md), [8](../1pe/02/08.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

Some readers will find this difficult to accept, especially if they live in places where wicked rulers persecute the church. It is important to recognize that the Holy Spirit led Paul to write these words while the Roman government was persecuting Christians. Christians must obey their rulers as well as obey God. The only time a Christian should disobey governing authorities is when those rulers do not allow Christians to do something God explicitly commands them to do (for an example of such a situation, see [Acts 5:28–29](../act/05/28.md)).<br><br>### “The night advanced, and the day has come near”<br><br>In [13:11–14](../13/11.md) Paul tells his readers that they should behave like Jesus because Jesus is coming back soon. He calls the current time in which people do what is evil the “night,” and he calls the time when Jesus returns the “day.”

The ULT does this with [verse 11](../14/11.md) of this chapter, which Paul quotes from the Old Testament.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Weak in faith<br><br>Paul teaches that Christians can have real faith and at the same time be “weak in faith” regarding some situations. This describes Christians whose faith is immature and who feel guilty about doing certain things that God did not forbid. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]])<br><br>### Dietary restrictions<br><br>In the Law of Moses, God forbid the Jews from eating the meat of some animals which God said were unclean. However, since Christians have been “made dead to the law” ([7:4](../07/04.md)), they are free to eat what they want. The Roman church that Paul wrote this letter to was made up of both Jews and Gentiles. Some of the Jewish believers were offended by the non-Jewish believers eating foods that God had previously forbidden in the Law of Moses. The non-Jewish believers were also judging the Jewish believers for not eating those foods.

Then, they would send the letter with a messenger, who would read the letter to the person or people to whom it was addressed. In this chapter, Tertius mentions that he is the scribe writing the letter for Paul ([16:22](../16/22.md)). Paul begins this chapter by recommending Phoebe to the believers in Rome who receive this letter. This could indicate that Phoebe was the messenger who delivered the letter to them.<br><br>### Greetings<br><br>In this culture, it was common for those who sent letters to include greetings to and from others in their letters. In this way, many people could greet each other but only send one letter. In [verses 3–16](../16/03.md) and [21–23](../16/21.md) Paul includes greetings to and from people whom he and the Romans knew. Express these greetings in a natural form in your language.
