ROM	front	intro	gtn1			0		# Introduction to Romans\n\n## Part 1: General Introduction\n\n### Outline of the book of Romans\n\n1. Introduction (1:1–15)\n2. Main Theme: Righteousness is received by trusting in Jesus Christ (1:16–17)\n3. All mankind is condemned because of sin (1:18–3:20)\n4. Righteousness is received through Jesus Christ by trusting in him (3:21–5:21)\n5. Becoming like Christ in this life (6:1–8:39)\n6. God’s plan for Israel (9:1–11:36)\n7. Instructions for living as Christians (12:1–15:13)\n8. Conclusion (15:14–16:27)\n\n### Who wrote the book of Romans?\n\nThe Apostle Paul wrote the book of Romans and may other books in the New Testament. Paul was from the city of Tarsus. He had been known as Saul in his early life. Before becoming a Christian, Paul was part of a strict Jewish religious group called the Pharisees. He persecuted Christians. After he became a Christian, he traveled several times throughout the Roman Empire telling people about Jesus.\n\nPaul probably wrote this letter while he was staying in the city of Corinth during his third trip through the Roman Empire.\n\n### What is the book of Romans about?\n\nPaul wrote this letter to the Christians in Rome. Paul wanted to get them ready to receive him when he visited them. He said his purpose was to “bring about the obedience of faith” ([16:26](../16/26.md)).\n\nIn this letter Paul most fully described the gospel of Jesus Christ. He explained that both Jews and non-Jews have sinned, and God will forgive them and declare them righteous only if they believe in Jesus (chapters 1–11). Then he gave them practical advice for how believers should live (chapters 12–16),\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nTranslators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “Romans.” Or they may choose a clearer title, such as “Paul’s Letter to the Church in Rome,” or “A Letter to the Christians in Rome.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### What are the titles used to refer to Jesus?\n\nIn Romans, Paul described Jesus Christ by many titles and descriptions: Jesus Christ (1:1), the Seed of David (1:3), the Son of God (1:4), the Lord Jesus Christ (1:7), Christ Jesus (3:24), Propitiation (3:25), Jesus (3:26), Jesus our Lord (4:24), Lord of Hosts (9:29), a Stumbling Stone and Rock of Offence (9:33), the End of the Law (10:4), the Deliverer (11:26), Lord of the Dead and the Living (14:9), and the Root of Jesse (15:12).\n\n### How should theological terms in Romans be translated?\n\nPaul uses many theological terms that are not used in the four Gospels. As early Christians learned more about the meaning of Jesus Christ and his message, they needed words and expressions for new ideas. Some examples of these words are “justification” (5:1), “works of the law” (3:20), “reconcile” (5:10), “propitiation” (3:25), “sanctification” (6:19), and “the old man” (6:6). If your language doesn’t have similar words, you can develop short phrases to communicate these ideas. For example, the term “gospel” can be translated as “the good news about Jesus Christ.”\n\nTranslators should also remember that some of these terms have more than one meaning. The meaning will depend on how the author is using the word in that particular passage. For example, “righteousness” sometimes means that a person obeys God’s law. At other times, “righteousness” means that Jesus Christ has perfectly obeyed God’s law for us.\n\n### What did Paul mean by “a remnant” of Israel ([11:5](../11/05.md))?\n\nThe idea of a “remnant” is important both in the Old Testament and for Paul. Most of the Israelites were either killed or scattered among other people when the Assyrians and then the Babylonians conquered their land. Only a relatively few Jews survived. They were known as “the remnant.”\n\nIn [11:1–9](../11/01.md), Paul speaks of another remnant. This remnant is the Jews whom God saved because they believed in Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/remnant]])\n\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\n\n### What did Paul mean by being “in Christ”?\n\nThe phrase “in Christ” and similar phrases occur in 3:24; 6:11, 23; 8:1,2,39; 9:1; 12:5,17; 15:17; and 16:3,7,9,10. Paul used these kinds of phrases as a metaphor to express that Christian believers belong to Jesus Christ. Belonging to Christ means the believer is saved and is made a friend with God. The believer is also promised to live with God forever. However, this idea can be difficult to represent in many languages.\n\nThese phrases also have specific meanings that depend on how Paul used them in a particular passage. For example, in [3:24](../03/24.md) (“the redemption that is in Christ Jesus”), Paul referred to our being redeemed “because” of Jesus Christ. In [8:9](../08/09.md) (“you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit”), Paul spoke of believers submitting “to” the Holy Spirit. In [9:1](../09/01.md) (“I tell the truth in Christ”), Paul meant that he is telling the truth that “is in agreement with” Jesus Christ.\n\nNevertheless, the basic idea of our being united with Jesus Christ (and with the Holy Spirit) is seen in these passages as well. Therefore, the translator has a choice in many passages that use “in.” He will often decide to represent the more immediate sense of “in,” such as, “by means of,” “in the manner of,” or “in regard to.” But, if possible, the translator should choose a word or phrase that represents the immediate sense and the sense of “in union with.” (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/inchrist]])\n\n### How are the ideas of “holy,” “saints” or “holy ones,” and “sanctify” represented in Romans in the ULT?\n\nThe scriptures use such words to indicate any one of various ideas. For this reason, it is often difficult for translators to represent them well in their versions. In translating into English, the ULT uses the following principles:\n\n* Sometimes the meaning in a passage implies moral holiness. Especially important for understanding the gospel is the fact that God considers Christians to be sinless because they are united to Jesus Christ. Another related fact is that God is perfect and faultless. A third fact is that Christians are to conduct themselves in a blameless and faultless manner in life. In these cases, the ULT uses “holy,” “holy God,” “holy ones” or “holy people.” (See: [1:7](../01/07.md))\n* Sometimes the meaning in a passage indicates a simple reference to Christians without implying any particular role filled by them. In cases where some other English versions have “saints” or “holy ones,” the ULT uses “believers.” (See: 8:27; 12:13; 15:25, 26, 31; 16:2, 15)\n* Sometimes the meaning in a passage indicates the idea of someone or something set apart for God alone. In these cases, the ULT uses “set apart,” “dedicated to,” “consecrated,” or “reserved for.” (See: [15:16](../15/16.md))\n\nThe UST will often be helpful as translators think about how to represent these ideas in their own versions.\n\n### What are the major issues in the text of the book of Romans?\n\nFor the following verses, modern version of the Bible differ from older versions. The ULT includes the modern reading and puts the older reading in a footnote.\n\n* “he \\[God\\] works all things together for good” ([8:28](../08/28.md)). Some older versions read, “All things work together for good.”\n* “But if it is by grace, it is no longer by works. Otherwise grace would no longer be grace” ([11:6](../11/06.md)). Some older versions read: “But if it is by works, then is it no more grace: otherwise work is no more work.”\n\nThe following verse is not in the best ancient copies of the Bible. Translators are advised not to include this verse. However, if in the translators’ region there are older Bible versions that have this verse, the translators can include it. If it is translated, it should be put inside square brackets (\\[\\]) to indicate that it is probably not original to the book of Romans.\n\n* “May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen” ([16:24](../16/24.md)).\n\n(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])

Main Theme: Righteousness is received by having faith in Jesus Christ (1:16–17)<br>3. All mankind is condemned because of sin (1:18–3:20)<br>    * All non-Jews have sinned (1:18–32)<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### The gospel<br><br>This chapter refers to the contents of the Book of Romans as “the gospel” ([1:2](../rom/01/02.md)). Romans is not a Gospel like Matthew, Mark, Luke, or John, which are historical accounts of the life of Jesus. Instead, chapters 1–8 present the biblical gospel, which is the good news of salvation. The gospel contains the following true ideas: Everyone has sinned. Jesus died for our sins. Jesus came back to life again so that we might live for his glory and receive eternal life when we die.<br><br>### Universal Condemnation and the Wrath of God<br><br>In this chapter Paul explains that no one has an excuse for sinning. We all know about the true God, Yahweh, from his creation all around us. Because of our sin and our sinful nature, every person justly deserves the eternal punishment of God. The requirement for this punishment was satisfied by Jesus dying on a cross for those who believe in him. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/believe]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### “God gave them over”<br><br>Many scholars view the phrases “God gave them over” and “God gave them up” as theologically significant. For this reason, it is important to translate these phrases with God playing a passive role in the action. God allows men to pursue their own sinful desires, he does not force them to act sinfully. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

ROM	2	21	rftq	grammar-connect-words-phrases	οὖν	1		Here, **then** indicates that what follows is the second half of the factual conditional statement that Paul began with “if you name yourself a Jew” in [verse 17](../02/17.md). Paul wants to show that what the Jews believe and how they live are in contrast. If you divided [verses 17–21](../02/17.md) into separate sentences, then you may need to include a short form of the “if” statement here. Alternate translation: “if all this is really true, then” or “since all this is really true, then” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
ROM	2	21	uq9y	grammar-collectivenouns	ἕτερον	1	You who teach others, do you not teach yourself?	Here, **another** is a singular pronoun that refers to a group of people. If your language does not use singular pronouns in that way, you can use a different expression. Alternate translation: “other people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns]])
ROM	2	21	abq0	figs-explicit	σεαυτὸν οὐ διδάσκεις	1		Here Paul implies that the Jews need to **teach** themselves because they do not actually obey the laws that they teach. They act as if they do not know the Law of Moses. If this might confuse your readers, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “since you don’t obey the law, do you not teach yourself” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ROM	2	22	parm	figs-rquestion	ὁ λέγων μὴ μοιχεύειν, μοιχεύεις? ὁ βδελυσσόμενος τὰ εἴδωλα, ἱεροσυλεῖς?	1	You who preach against stealing, do you steal?	Like in the previous verse, Paul is not asking for information here, but is using the question form twice to emphasize the truth of what he is saying. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as statements or exclamations and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “You, who says not to commit adultery, actually commit adultery! You, who abhor idols, actually rob temples!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
ROM	2	22	dmpg	figs-explicit	ἱεροσυλεῖς	1	You who preach against stealing, do you steal?	Here Paul implies that the **temples** the Jews **rob** are where **idols** are kept and worshipped.

Alternate translation: “do you rob temples where idols are kept” or “should you actually enter an idol temple and rob it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ROM	2	23	z80m	figs-rquestion	ὃς ἐν νόμῳ καυχᾶσαι διὰ τῆς παραβάσεως τοῦ νόμου, τὸν Θεὸν ἀτιμάζεις	1		Like in the previous two verses, Paul is not asking for information here, but is using the question form to emphasize the truth of what he is saying. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “You, who boast in the law, actually dishonor God through the transgression of the law!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
ROM	2	23	grr3	figs-metaphor	ὃς ἐν νόμῳ καυχᾶσαι	1	You who boast in the law, do you dishonor God by breaking the law?	Paul uses **in the law** figuratively as if it were something that people could boast inside of. He means that the Jews brag that they are the only nation who knows God’s law, which has similar meaning to “boast in God” in [verse 17](../02/17.md). If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternative translation, “You, who brag that you are the only ones who know God’s law” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ROM	2	23	ob98	figs-abstractnouns	διὰ τῆς παραβάσεως τοῦ νόμου	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **transgression**, you could express the same idea in another way.

ROM	2	24	yp4l	figs-infostructure	τὸ γὰρ ὄνομα τοῦ Θεοῦ δι’ ὑμᾶς βλασφημεῖται ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσιν, καθὼς γέγραπται	1		If it would be more natural in your language, you could change the order of these phrases. Alternate translation: “For, just as it is written, ‘the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you.’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
ROM	2	24	z54i	grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1		**For** here indicates that what follows is the reason why the previous statement is true.

ROM	2	24	lk5n	figs-quotemarks	τὸ…ὄνομα τοῦ Θεοῦ δι’ ὑμᾶς βλασφημεῖται ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσιν	1		In this clause Paul quotes part of [Isaiah 52:5](../../isa/52/05.md). It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by setting off all of this material with quotation marks or with whatever punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
ROM	2	24	c4sk	figs-possession	τὸ…ὄνομα τοῦ Θεοῦ	1		Paul is using the possessive form to indicate the **name** that belongs to **God**. Paul does not mean that **God** is a **name**.

ROM	2	24	mvwq	figs-synecdoche	τὸ…ὄνομα τοῦ Θεοῦ	1		Paul uses **the name of God** figuratively to refer to**God** himself. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the meaning plainly, as in the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

ROM	2	24	m2bq	grammar-connect-logic-result	τὸ…ὄνομα τοῦ Θεοῦ δι’ ὑμᾶς βλασφημεῖται ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσιν	1		If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “because of you the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
ROM	2	24	pg0g	figs-explicit	δι’ ὑμᾶς	1		Paul quotes Isaiah implying that the bad behavior of the Jews is what causes **the Gentiles** to blaspheme **the name of God**. Since the Jews were supposed to represent God to the world, their bad behavior misrepresented God so that the Gentiles blasphemed him. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “as a result of how you act” or “because of the way you behave” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ROM	2	24	e144	figs-yousingular	δι’ ὑμᾶς	1		Here, **you** is the plural and refers to the Jewish people. This is the only occurrence of plural **you** in [verses 17–27](../02/17.md).

ROM	2	24	edrf	figs-activepassive	καθὼς γέγραπται	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Since Paul is referring to something Isaiah wrote, you could indicate Isaiah as the subject. Alternate translation: “just as Isaiah wrote” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ROM	2	24	end9	writing-quotations	καθὼς γέγραπται	1		See how you translated this phrase in [1:17](../01/17.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
ROM	2	25	vdu7	grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1		**For** here indicates that [verses 25–29] provide another reason why both Jews and Gentiles will be punished for their sins, as stated in [verse 12](../02/12.md). Paul is arguing against the idea that circumcision guaranteed a Jew’s salvation, which some Jews believed. If it might help your readers, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “Jews will be judged along with Gentiles because” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
ROM	2	25	vp6o	figs-abstractnouns	περιτομὴ…ἡ περιτομή σου, ἀκροβυστία γέγονεν	1		If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **circumcision** and **uncircumcision**, you could express the same ideas in a different way.

ROM	2	25	xq62	figs-hyperbole	ἡ περιτομή σου, ἀκροβυστία γέγονεν	1	your circumcision becomes uncircumcision	Here, **your circumcision becomes uncircumcision** is an exaggeration that Paul uses to show how important it is for God’s people to **practice the law**. Paul does not mean that the person who transgresses God’s **law** is no longer physically circumcised. If this would confuse your readers, you express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “it is as if you are not circumcised” or “it is the same as if you were never circumcised” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
ROM	2	26	vt7f	figs-hypo	ἐὰν οὖν	1	the uncircumcised person	Paul is using a hypothetical situation to help his readers recognize the benefits for **the uncircumcised one** who **keeps the requirements of the law**.

Paul is using a rhetorical question here to emphasize how important it is do what **the law** requires.

When Paul asks the rhetorical questions, he is speaking as if he were a non-Christian Jew arguing against Paul. When Paul answers those questions, he is speaking as himself. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this change in speakers with quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate quotations, as in the UST.

Paul is not asking for information, but is using these two questions here to express the objections that a Jew might have to what Paul said in the previous chapter, especially what he said in [2:28–29](../02/28.md). If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way.

He explains how God made Abraham, the ancestor of all Jews, righteous a long time before God gave the Jews the Law of Moses. Even Abraham could not become righteous by what he did. Rather, God made Abraham righteous on the basis of Abraham’s faith. Obeying the law of Moses does not make a person righteous. People have always become righteous only by faith. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/justice]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]])<br><br>### Circumcision<br><br>Circumcision was important to the Israelites. It identified a person as a descendant of Abraham. It was also a sign of the covenant between Abraham and Yahweh. However, being circumcised never made anyone righteous. In this chapter Paul uses “circumcision” to refer to Jews and “uncircumcision” to refer to non-Jews. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/circumcise]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/covenant]])<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Rhetorical Questions<br><br>In [verses 1](../04/01.md), [3](../04/03.md), and [9–10](../04/09.md) Paul continues using rhetorical questions like he did in the previous chapter. He does this in order to answer objections that Jews might make about what he is saying.

If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “Then we will say that Abraham, our forefather according to the flesh, has surely discovered something!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate quotations, as in the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
ROM	4	1	s4b5	figs-exclusive	ἐροῦμεν	1		In [verses 1–9](../04/01.md) Paul uses **we** exclusively to speak of himself and other Jews. Your language may require you to mark these forms. Alternate translation: “will we Jews say” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
ROM	4	1	ot88	figs-infostructure	εὑρηκέναι Ἀβραὰμ τὸν προπάτορα ἡμῶν κατὰ σάρκα	1		If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases.

In Paul’s time some Jewish teachers taught that Abraham had a right to boast because of his faith.

ROM	4	2	z9wx	figs-metaphor	πρὸς Θεόν	1		Paul speaks figuratively of **Abraham** as if he were located in the presence of **God**. He means that Abraham could not **boast** to God about his **righteousness** if it was **righteous by works**. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternative translation: “from God’s perspective” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ROM	4	3	w9i5	grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	For what does the scripture say	**For** here indicates that what follows in this verse is the reason why Paul said in the previous verse that Abraham cannot boast “before God.” Use a natural way in your language to introduce a reason clause.

If the reading **let us have peace** is correct, this phrase may be indicating Paul’s desire that his fellow believers continue to experience the peace they have with God. If a translation of the Bible already exists in your area, you could consider using the reading in that translation. If there is not already a Bible translation in your area, we recommend that you follow the readings of ULT and UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
ROM	5	1	kjpb	figs-imperative	ἔχωμεν	1		Paul uses the phrase **let us have peace** to exhort his Christian readers to continue living peacefully with God. It is not a command.

ROM	5	2	zp5p	figs-possession	τῆς δόξης τοῦ Θεοῦ	1		Paul is using possessive forms to describe how **glory** relates to **God**. This could refer to: (1) the glory that God shares with believers. This was the same glory that God shared with humans when he created them, but which they lost when the first humans sinned, as mentioned in [3:23](../03/23.md). Alternate translation: “of sharing in the glory God has” or “of the glory from God” (2) glorifying God, as in the similar phrase “the glory of the imperishable God” in [1:23](../01/23.md).

Becoming like Christ in this life (6:1–8:39)<br>    * Baptism represents union with Christ’s death (6:1–14)<br>    * Christians are now slaves of righteousness (6:15–23)<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Slavery<br><br>In this chapter Paul frequently uses the metaphor of the relationship between slaves and their masters. He speaks figuratively of people who live sinfully as if they were slaves to sin and the death it causes ([6:6](../06/06.md), [16–17](../06/16.md), [20](../06/20.md)). He also speaks figuratively of Christians as if God has freed them from being enslaved to sin and has himself or righteousness their master ([6:18](../06/18.md), [22](../06/22.md)). Because Christians are no longer controlled by their desire to sin, they should instead serve God and live in a way that glorifies him ([6:12–14](../06/12.md), [19](../06/19.md)). (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/servant]])<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Rhetorical Questions<br><br>In [verses 1–3](../06/01.md), [15–16](../06/15.md), and [21](../06/21.md) Paul uses rhetorical questions in order to answer objections that people might make about what he is saying.<br><br>## Possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Inclusive language<br><br>In this chapter the pronouns “we”, “us”, and “our” refer inclusively to all believers in Christ. Paul calls these people those who have been “baptized into Christ Jesus” in [verse 3](../06/03.md). Your language may require you to mark these forms. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

In this verse Paul is not asking for information, but is using a question to address rumors some people may have been saying that misrepresented his teachings. If you would not use rhetorical questions for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation or communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “Then we will say that we should continue in the sin so that the grace might increase!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
ROM	6	1	fj9e	figs-exclusive	ἐροῦμεν? ἐπιμένωμεν	1	we say	When Paul says **we** in this verse, he is including all “who were baptized into Christ Jesus,” as mentioned in [6:3](../06/03.md), so **we** is inclusive of all Christians.

However, in [verses 21–25](../07/21.md) Paul uses the word “law” in several different ways. Each of these different uses will be addressed in the notes. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]])<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Marriage<br><br>Scripture commonly uses marriage as a metaphor.

ROM	8	intro	ev4r			0		# Romans 8 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n5. Becoming like Christ in this life (6:1–8:39)\n    * Baptism represents union with Christ’s death (6:1–14)\n    * Christians are now slaves of righteousness (6:15–23)\n    * Christians have been freed from the law (7:1–6)\n    * The law is not sinful (7:7–12)\n    * Christians still struggle with indwelling sin (7:13–25)\n    * The Holy Spirit dwells in Christians (8:1–27)\n    * Christians have confidence in God’s love (8:28–8:39)\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with verse 36. Paul quotes these words from the Old Testament.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Indwelling of the Spirit\n\nIn [verses 9–17](../08/09.md) and [26–27](../08/26.md) Paul says that Holy Spirit dwells inside Christians to help them stop sinning and to intercede for them. The presence of the Holy Spirit within a person indicates that that person is a genuine Christian. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/save]])\n\n### Predestination\n\nMany scholars believe this chapter teaches on a subject known as “predestination.” See the use of the word “predestined” in [verses 28–30](../08/28.md) and “elect” in [verse 33](../08/33.md). Some scholars take this to indicate that God has, from before the foundation of the world, chosen some people to save. Christians have different views on what the Bible teaches on this subject, so translators need to take extra care when translating these verses. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/predestine]])## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n## Important figure of speech in this chapter\n\n### Rhetorical questions\n\nIn [verses 24](../08/24.md) and [31–35](../08/31.md) Paul uses rhetorical questions in order to emphasize that what he is saying is true. If you would not use rhetorical questions for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### Flesh\n\nPaul uses “flesh” in a variety of ways throughout this letter. In this chapter he frequently uses it to refer to sinful human nature. However, he uses “flesh” to refer to Christ’s physical body in [verse 3](../08/03.md). Every use of “flesh” will be discussed in the notes. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/flesh]])\n\n### Inclusive language\n\nIn this chapter the pronouns “we”, “us”, and “our” refer inclusively to all believers in Christ. Paul calls these people “brothers” in [verses 12](../08/12.md). Your language may require you to mark these forms. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

God’s plan for Israel (9:1–11:36)<br>    * Paul’s sorrow for Israel’s unbelief (9:1–5)<br>    * God chooses whom he wants to choose (9:6–13)<br>    * God shows mercy on whom he wants to show mercy (9:14–18)<br>    * No one can question God’s choice (9:19–33)<br><br>Chapter 9 begins a new topic in this letter. In Chapters 9-11, Paul focuses on the nation of Israel.<br><br>Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with [verses 25-29](../09/25.md) and [33](../09/33.md) of this chapter. Paul quotes all of these words from the Old Testament.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Predestination<br><br>Many scholars believe that in this chapter Paul teaches extensively on a subject known as “predestination.” Some take this to indicate that God has chosen some people to eternally save from before the world existed. Christians have different views on what the Bible teaches on this subject, so translators need to take extra care when translating this chapter. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/predestine]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/save]])<br><br>### Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Stone of stumbling<br><br>In [verses 30–33](../09/30.md) Paul explains that God made some Gentiles righteous because they believed in Jesus, but most Jews rejected Jesus because they were trying to obey the Law of Moses to become righteous. Paul quotes [Isaiah 8:14] and [28:16] to describe Jesus as if he were a stone that the Jews trip over when walking. See the translations and notes for how Peter uses these same verses from Isaiah in [1 Peter 2:6](../../1pe/02/06.md), [8](../../1pe/02/08.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

ROM	10	intro	c2li			0		# Romans 10 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n6. God’s plan for Israel (9:1–11:36)\n    * Paul’s sorrow for Israel’s unbelief (9:1–5)\n    * God chooses whom he wants to choose (9:6–13)\n    * God shows mercy on whom he wants to show mercy (9:14–18)\n    * No one can question God’s choice (9:19–33)\n    * Israel’s false righteousness (10:1–4)\n    * Salvation is available to everyone (10:5–21)\n\nSome translations set prose quotations from the Old Testament farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text. The ULT does this with the quoted words in [verse 8](../10/08.md).\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with [verses 18-20](../10/18.md) of this chapter, which are words from the Old Testament.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### God’s righteousness\n\nPaul teaches here that while many Jews earnestly tried to be righteous, they did not succeed. We cannot earn God’s righteousness. God gives us Jesus’ righteousness when we believe in him. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]])\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### Rhetorical questions\n\nPaul uses many rhetorical questions in this chapter. He does this to convince his readers that God does not save only the Jewish people, so Christians must be ready to go and share the gospel with the whole world. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/save]])\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### Different uses of “they,” “them,” and “their”\n\nIn [verses 1–4](../10/01.md), the pronouns “they,” “them,” and “their” always refer to the people of Israel. However, those pronouns refer to various things and people in [verses 5–21](../10/05.md), which will be addressed in the notes. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])\n\n### “I will provoke you to jealousy by what is not a nation”\n\nPaul uses this prophecy to explain that God will use the church to make the people of Israel jealous. This is so they will seek God and believe the gospel. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/jealous]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

The ULT does this with verses 9-10, 26-27, and 34-35, which are words from the Old Testament.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Grafting<br><br>Paul uses the image of “grafting” to refer to the place of the Gentiles and Jews in the plans of God. Making one plant to be permanently part of another plant is called “grafting.” Paul uses the picture of God grafting the Gentiles as a wild branch into his saving plans. But God has not forgotten about the Jews, who are spoken of as the natural plant. God will also save Jews who believe in Jesus.<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### “Did God reject his people? May it never be”<br><br>Whether Israel (the physical descendants of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob) has a future in the plans of God, or if they have been replaced in the plans of God by the church, is a major theological issue in Chapters 9-11. This phrase is an important part of this section of Romans. It seems to indicate that Israel remains distinct from the church. Not all scholars arrive at this conclusion. Despite their currently rejecting Jesus as their Messiah, Israel has not exhausted the grace and mercy of God. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/christ]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/grace]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/mercy]])
