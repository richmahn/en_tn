# are they not written ... Judah?

This can be expressed in active form and assumes that the answer is positive. The question is rhetorical and is used for emphasis. See how you translated this in [2 Kings 8:23](../08/22.md). Alternate translation: "they are written ... Judah." or "you can find them ... Judah." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
