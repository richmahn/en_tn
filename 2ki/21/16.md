# Moreover, Manasseh

"Also, Manasseh" or "In addition, Manasseh"

# Manasseh shed much innocent blood

The words "shed much innocent blood" are a metonym for killing people violently. It might be best to translate this so the reader understands that other people helped Manasseh do this. Alternate translation: "Manasseh ordered his soldiers to kill many innocent people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another with death

This hyperbole emphasizes the great number of people Manasseh had killed throughout Jerusalem. The abstract noun "death" can be stated as "dead people." Alternate translation: "there were very many dead people throughout Jerusalem" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# what was evil in the sight of Yahweh

The sight of Yahweh represents Yahweh's judgment or evaluation. See how you translated this in [2 Kings 3:2](../03/01.md). Alternate translation: "what was evil in Yahweh's judgment" or "what Yahweh considers to be evil" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
