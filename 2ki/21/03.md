# he rebuilt the high places ... he built altars for Baal, made an Asherah pole

Manasseh would have commanded his workers to do the building for him. AT: "he had the high places rebuilt ... he had altars built for Baal, had an Asherah pole made" or "he had his workers rebuild the high places ... he had them build altars for Baal, make an Asherah pole" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
