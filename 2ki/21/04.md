# General Information:

The story of King Manasseh's reign continues.

# It is in Jerusalem that my name will be forever

The name is a metonym for the person. AT: "Jerusalem is where I will forever make known who I am" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# He built altars for all the stars of heaven in the two courtyards of the house of Yahweh

It is implied that he built these altars so people could make sacrifices and worship the stars. Also, he would not have built these altars himself, rather he would have commanded his workers to do it. AT: "He had his workers build altars in the two courtyards of the house of Yahweh so that the people could worship the stars and offer them sacrifices" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# He put his son into the fire

You may need to make explicit why he put his son in the fire and what happened after he did so. AT: "He burned his son to death as an offering to his gods" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# consulted

"asked for information from"

# much evil in the sight of Yahweh

The sight of Yahweh represents Yahweh's judgment or evaluation. See how you translated a similar phrase in [2 Kings 3:2](../03/01.md). AT: "many things that were evil in Yahweh's judgment" or "many things that Yahweh considers to be evil" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
