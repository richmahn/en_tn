# He caused his son to pass through the fire

You may need to make explicit why he caused his son be put into the fire and what happened after he did so. Alternate translation: "He burned his son to death as an offering to his gods" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# consulted with

"asked for information from"

# much evil in the sight of Yahweh

The sight of Yahweh represents Yahweh's judgment or evaluation. See how you translated a similar phrase in [2 Kings 3:2](../03/02.md). Alternate translation: "many things that were evil in Yahweh's judgment" or "many things that Yahweh considers to be evil" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
