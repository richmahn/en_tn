# General Information:

The story of King Manasseh's reign continues.

# that he had made

Manasseh probably did not do the work. His servants would have done the work. Alternate translation: "that Manasseh had ordered his servants to make" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# that I will put my name forever

Here Yahweh putting his "name" on the temple represents him designating it as the place to worship him. Alternate translation: "where I want people to worship me forever" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
