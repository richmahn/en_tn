# General Information:

The story of King Manasseh's reign continues.

# that he had made

Manasseh probably did not do the work. His servants would have done the work. AT: "that Manasseh had ordered his servants to make" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# that I will put my name forever

Here Yahweh putting his "name" on the temple represents him designating it as the place to worship him. AT: "where I want people to worship me forever" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# the feet of Israel

The feet are a synecdoche for the person. AT: "the people of Israel" or "the Israelites" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# even more than the nations that Yahweh had destroyed before the people of Israel

Here "nations" refers to the people who had lived in the land of Canaan before the Israelites had arrived. AT: "even more than the people whom Yahweh had destroyed as the people of Israel advanced through the land" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
