King Joram continues speaking to King Jehoshaphat.

## Will you go with me against Moab to battle? ##

Here "Moab" stands for "the army." AT: "Will you go with me to fight against the army of Moab?" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

## I will go ##

Jehoshaphat is saying that he and his entire army will fight with King Joram against Moab. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

## I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses ##

Jehoshaphat is letting Joram use all of his people and horses as if they were his own.

## By way of the wilderness of Edom ##

To get to Moab from where they were, they would go through Jerusalem and around the southern end of the Dead Sea and into Edom.
