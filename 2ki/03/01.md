# in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah

This describes the time that Joram began to reign by stating how long the current king of Judah had reigned. The meaning of this statement can be made clear. Alternate translation: "in the eighteenth year that Jehoshaphat was king of Judah" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# the eighteenth year

"year 18" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])

# Joram son of Ahab

Sometimes this man is referred to as "Jehoram." This is not the same person as the man mentioned in [2 Kings 1:17](../01/17.md) named "Jehoram."
