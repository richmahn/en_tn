# the king of Israel went with the king of Judah and the king of Edom

This refers to the kings accompanied by their armies. AT: "the king of Israel and his army went with the king of Judah and his army and the king of Edom and his army" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# They wandered around

Possible meanings are 1) the kings were not sure where they were going, and so they changed direction often or 2) the kings knew where they were going and they walked around Moab ([2 Kings 3:08](./07.md)).

# What is this? Has Yahweh called three kings to give them into the hand of Moab?

The king uses a rhetorical question to emphasize how ridiculous and terrible their situation is. This can be written as a statement. AT: "It looks like Yahweh will allow all three of us to be captured by Moab!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# to give them into the hand of Moab

Here "Moab" refers to its army. Also, "the hand of Moab" refers to the "control" of Moab's army. AT: "to give us over to Moab's control" or "so the army of Moab will defeat us" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
