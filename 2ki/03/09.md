# the king of Israel went with the king of Judah and the king of Edom

This refers to the kings accompanied by their armies. Alternate translation: "the king of Israel and his army went with the king of Judah and his army and the king of Edom and his army" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# They wandered around

Possible meanings are 1) the kings were not sure where they were going, and so they changed direction often or 2) the kings knew where they were going and they walked around Moab ([2 Kings 3:08](./07.md)).
