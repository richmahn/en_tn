# What is this? Has Yahweh called three kings to give them into the hand of Moab?

The king uses a rhetorical question to emphasize how ridiculous and terrible their situation is. This can be written as a statement. AT: "It looks like Yahweh will allow all three of us to be captured by Moab!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# to give them into the hand of Moab

Here "Moab" refers to its army. Also, "the hand of Moab" refers to the "control" of Moab's army. AT: "to give us over to Moab's control" or "so the army of Moab will defeat us" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
