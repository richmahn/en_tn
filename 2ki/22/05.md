# house of Yahweh ... in the temple

Here "house of Yahweh" and "temple" mean the same thing.

# Let it be given into the hand of the workmen

Here "hand" represents the workmen as a whole. This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "Tell Hilkiah to give the money to the workmen" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
