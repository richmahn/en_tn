# General Information:

This is the end of the message from Yahweh to King Josiah through the prophetess Huldah.

# See, I will gather you to your ancestors, and you will be gathered to your grave in peace

Both statements mean basically the same thing. They are polite ways of saying he will die. AT: "So I will allow you to die and be buried peacefully" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])

# Your eyes will not see

Here "will not see" represents not experiencing something. AT: "You will not experience" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# Your eyes

Here "eyes" represents the whole person. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# the disaster that I will bring upon this place

Yahweh causing terrible things to happen is spoken of as if disaster were an object that Yahweh would bring to a place. AT: "the terrible things I will cause to happen in this place" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
