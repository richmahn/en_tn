# General Information:

The message from King Josiah to Hilkiah, the high priest, continues.

# Let them give money ... was given to them ... because they handled

Here "them" and "they" refer to the workmen who are in charge of the house of Yahweh in [2 Kings 22:5](./03.md).

# the carpenters, the builders, and the masons

These are the same as the workmen who are in the house of Yahweh in [2 Kings 22:5](./03.md). Here the workers are described in more detail.

# carpenters

workers who build with wood

# masons

workers who build with stone

# no accounting was required for the money that was given to them

This can be stated in active form. AT: "the workmen who were in charge did not have to report how they used the money that the temple guards gave them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# because they handled it faithfully

"because they used the money honestly"
