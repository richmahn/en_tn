The message from King Josiah to Hilkiah, the high priest, continues.

## carpenters ##

workers who build with wood

## masons ##

workers who build with stone

## no accounting was required for the money that was given to them ##

"the workers did not have to report how they used the money that the temple guards gave to them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## because they handled it faithfully ##

AT: "because they used the money honestly"
