These are men's names. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# Go up to Hilkiah

The phrase "Go up" is used because Yahweh's temple was higher in elevation than where King Josiah was located. Alternate translation: "Go to Hilkiah"

# that has been brought into the house of Yahweh, which the temple guards have gathered from the people

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "that the temple guards who gathered the money from the people brought into the temple of Yahweh" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
