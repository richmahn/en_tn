# Let them give money ... was given to them ... because they handled

Here "them" and "they" refer to the workmen who are in charge of the house of Yahweh in [2 Kings 22:5](./03.md).

# no accounting was required for the money that was given to them

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "the workmen who were in charge did not have to report how they used the money that the temple guards gave them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# because they handled it faithfully

"because they used the money honestly"
