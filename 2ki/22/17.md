The message Yahweh sent to King Josiah through Huldah, the prophetess, continues.

## my anger will be kindled against this place and it will not be extinguished ##

AT: "my anger against this place is like a fire that cannot be put out" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## that they would become a desolation ##

"that it would become a bare wilderness"
