# are they not written ... Judah?

This question is used to either inform or remind the readers that the information about Ahaz is in this other book. This can also be stated in active form. See how you translated this in [2 Kings 8:23](../08/22.md). AT: "they are written in The Book of the Events of the Kings of Judah." or "someone has written about them in The Book ... Judah."
