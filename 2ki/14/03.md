# He did what was right in the eyes of Yahweh, yet not like David his father

Here "the eyes of Yahweh" refers to his sight, and his sight refers to his judgment. Alternate translation: "Amaziah did many things that pleased Yahweh, but he did not do as many things that pleased Yahweh as King David had done" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# He did everything that Joash, his father, had done

Joash obeyed Yahweh and did good things. This can be made explicit. Alternate translation: "He did the same good things that his father Joash had done" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
