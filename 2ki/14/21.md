# All the people of Judah took Azariah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in place of his father Amaziah

This is a generalization. Some people may not have wanted him to be king. AT: "The people of Judah took the 16 year-old Azariah and made him king after his father, Amaziah" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# Azariah

This king is better known today by the name "Uzziah."
