# blot out

To completely destroy Israel is spoken of as if Yahweh wiped them away with a cloth. AT: "completely destroy" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the name of Israel

Here "the name of Israel" represents all of Israel and its inhabitants. AT: "the Israelite people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# under heaven

"on earth"

# he saved them by the hand of Jeroboam son of Jehoash

Here "hand" is a metonym for power. Also, "Jehoash" is a synecdoche representing Jehoash and his army. AT: "he enabled King Jeroboam and his army to rescue them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
