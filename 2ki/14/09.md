# A thistle that was in Lebanon ... trampled down the thistle

This is a word picture and a riddle. A cedar tree is great and a thistle is small and worthless. Jehoash compares himself to the cedar and Amaziah to the thistle and warns Amaziah not to attack. If you have a similar comparison in your own language, you can use it. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# thistle

type of bush with thorns

# saying, 'Give your daughter to my son for a wife,'

This direct quotation can be stated as an indirect quotation. AT: "asking the cedar to give his daughter to the thistle's son for a wife" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
