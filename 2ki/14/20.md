# General Information:

This is what happened after the death of King Amaziah.

# They brought him back on horses

"They brought Amaziah's body back on horses"

# All the people of Judah took Azariah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in place of his father Amaziah

This is a generalization. Some people may not have wanted him to be king. AT: "The people of Judah took the 16 year-old Azariah and made him king after his father, Amaziah" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# It was Azariah who rebuilt Elath

Azariah did not do this alone. AT: "It was Azariah who ordered Elath to be rebuilt" or "It was Azariah who supervised the rebuilding of Elath" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# Azariah

This king is better known today by the name "Uzziah."

# Elath

a city in Judah (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# restored it to Judah

"returned it to Judah"

# slept with his ancestors

This is a poetic way to say he died. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
