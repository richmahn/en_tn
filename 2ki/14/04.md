Scripture continues to describe the rule of Amaziah, King of Judah.

## But the high places were not taken away ##

AT: "But he did not remove the high places, the shrines of pagan worship that were built upon the hills."

## As soon as he was completely in control of his kingdom ##

AT: "And so, as soon as Amaziah securely established his royal rule and kingly authority,"

## he executed the servants who had murdered his father, the king ##

AT: "he put to death the leaders who had murdered his father, the king."
