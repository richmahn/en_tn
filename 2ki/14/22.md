# It was Azariah who rebuilt Elath

Azariah did not do this alone. AT: "It was Azariah who ordered Elath to be rebuilt" or "It was Azariah who supervised the rebuilding of Elath" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# Elath

a city in Judah (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# restored it to Judah

"returned it to Judah"

# slept with his ancestors

This is a poetic way to say he died. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
