# Jehoram rested with his fathers and was buried with them

Here "rested" is a polite way of referring to someone dying. After he died, his body was buried in the same place as the bodies of his forefathers. The phrase "was buried" can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "Jehoram died as his ancestors had died, and they buried him with his ancestors" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# Then Ahaziah his son became king in his place

"Then Ahaziah, Jehoram's son, became king after he died"
