# Now

This word is used here to mark a break in the main story line. Here the author starts to tell a new part of the story.

# the woman whose son he had restored to life

The story of this woman and her son is found at [2 Kings 4:8](../04/08.md).

# he had restored to life

"he had caused to become alive again"

# Arise, and ... arose and she obeyed the word of the man of God

To arise here is for a person to stop what he is doing ad begin to do what he needs to do. Alternate translation: "Do as I say, and ... she did what the man of God had told her to do"
