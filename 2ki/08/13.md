## translationNotes

* **Who is your servant, that he should to this great thing?** - Hazael is talking about himself. AT: "Who am I, that I would have the power to do such things?" or "I could never do such things!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **He is only a dog** - Hazael is talking about himself. AT: "I am like a lowly animal." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **came to his master** - AT: "went back to Benhadad,"
* **He answered, "He told me that you would certainly recover"** - AT: "Hazael replied, 'Elisha told me that you would not die from this illness'."
* **so that he died** - Hazael put a wet blanket over king Benhadad's face. Benhadad was unable to breathe through it, and so he died. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicitinfo]])
* **Then Hazael became king in his place** - As Elisha had prophesied, Hazael became the king of Aram after Benhadad was dead.
