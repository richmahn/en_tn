## Who is your servant, that he should to this great thing? ##

Hazael is talking about himself. AT: "Who am I, that I would have the power to do such things?" or "I could never do such things!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## He is only a dog ##

Hazael is talking about himself. AT: "I am like a lowly animal." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## came to his master ##

AT: "went back to Benhadad,"

## He answered, "He told me that you would certainly recover" ##

AT: "Hazael replied, 'Elisha told me that you would not die from this illness'."

## so that he died ##

Hazael put a wet blanket over king Benhadad's face. Benhadad was unable to breathe through it, and so he died. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo]])

## Then Hazael became king in his place ##

As Elisha had prophesied, Hazael became the king of Aram after Benhadad was dead.
