# As for the other matters concerning Jehoram, all that he did

"To read more about the history of Jehoram and what he did,"

# are they not written ... Judah?

This question is used to either inform or remind the readers that the information about Jehoram is in this other book. AT: "these things are written ... Judah." or "someone has written about them ... Judah." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
