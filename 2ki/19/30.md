# The remnant of the house of Judah that survives will again take root and bear fruit

This metaphor compares restoration of the remnant to plantings that take hold and produce results. Alternate translation: "The people of Judah who remain alive will restore their lives and prosperity" or "The people who remain in Judah will prosper and have many children" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
