# General Information:

Here Isaiah is talking to King Hezekiah. He continues using parallelism throughout. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# grows wild

"grows without having been planted"

# The remnant of the house of Judah that survives will again take root and bear fruit

This metaphor compares restoration of the remnant to plantings that take hold and produce results. AT: "The people of Judah who remain alive will restore their lives and prosperity" or "The people who remain in Judah will prosper and have many children" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# The zeal of Yahweh of hosts will do this

"The strong action of Yahweh will make this happen"
