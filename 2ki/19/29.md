Here Isaiah is talking to King Hezekiah.

## grows wild ##

AT: "grows without having been planted,"

## The remnant of the house of Judah that survives will again take root and bear fruit ##

AT: "The people of Judah who remain alive will be like plants who grow and produce fruit." or "The people who remain in Judah will prosper and have many children." (UDB) (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## The zeal of Yahweh of hosts will do this ##

AT: "The strong action of Yahweh will make this happen."
