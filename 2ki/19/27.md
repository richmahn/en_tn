This continues the message from Yahweh, given by Isaiah, the prophet, for King Hezekiah concerning King Sennecherib.

## raging against me ##

AT: "your angry shouting about me,"

## because your arrogance has reached my ears ##

"because I have heard your proud words," (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

## I will put my hook in your nose, and my bit in your mouth ##

AT: "I will lead you like an animal."

## I will turn you back the way you came ##

AT: "I will make you return to your own country the same way you came, without conquering Jerusalem."  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo]])
