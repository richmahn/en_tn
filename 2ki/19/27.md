# General Information:

This continues the message from Yahweh, given by Isaiah, the prophet, for King Hezekiah concerning King Sennecherib. It uses parallelism throughout. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# raging against me

"angry shouting about me"

# because your arrogance has reached my ears

"Ears" are metonymy for listening or hearing. AT: "because I have heard your proud words" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# I will put my hook in your nose, and my bit in your mouth

A "hook" and a "bit" (to control a horse) are metaphors for Yahweh's control of Sennacherib. AT: "I will lead you like an animal" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# I will turn you back the way you came

That Sennacherib will return home before he can conquer Jerusalem can be stated clearly. AT: "I will make you return to your own country the same way you came, without conquering Jerusalem" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
