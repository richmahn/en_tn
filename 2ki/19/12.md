# General Information:

King Sennacharib's message to King Hezekiah continues.

# Have the gods of the nations rescued them, the nations: Gozan ... Assar?

This question assumes Hezekiah knows the answer and provides emphasis. Alternate translation: "The gods of the nations, the nations that my fathers destroyed—Gozan ... Assar—certainly did not rescue them!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# my fathers

"the previous kings of Assyria" or "the armies of the previous kings of Assyria"

# Gozan ... Haran ... Rezeph ... Eden ... Tel Assar

These are all place names. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
