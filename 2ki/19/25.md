This continues the message from Yahweh, given by Isaiah, the prophet, for King Hezekiah concerning King Sennecherib.

## impregnable cities ##

AT: "cities that cannot be captured" or "cities surrounded by high walls" (UDB)

## plants in the field, green grass ##

"as frail as plants and grass in the fields" (UDB) or AT: "as weak as shallow rooted plants" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## the grass on the roof or in the field, burned before it has grown up ##

AT: "like grass before it has matured." or "like grass before it has grown tall."
