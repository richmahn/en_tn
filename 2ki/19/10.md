This is the message that King Sennacharib of Assyria sent to King Hezekiah.

## Do not let your God in whom you trust deceive you, saying ##

AT: "Do not believe your God in whom you trust. He is lying when he says"

## given over into the hand of the king of Assyria" ##

The word "hand" here represents control. AT: "given into the control of Assyria" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## See, you have heard ##

AT: "Listen, you have heard" or "You have certainly heard" (UDB). Here "see" was used to draw attention to what he was about to say next.

## So will you be rescued? ##

Sennacharib used this question to emphasize that God will not be able to rescue them. AT: "Your God will not rescue you" or "You will not be able to escape either" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
