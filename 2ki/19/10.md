This is the message that King Sennacharib of Assyria sent to King Hezekiah.

# Do not let your God in whom you trust deceive you, saying

"Do not believe your God in whom you trust. He is lying when he says"

# the hand of the king of Assyria

"Hand" is metonymy for control, authority or power. AT: "the control of the government of Assyria" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# See, you have heard

"Notice, you have heard" or "You have certainly heard." Here "see" was used to draw attention to what he was about to say next.

# So will you be rescued?

Sennacharib used this question to emphasize that God will not be able to rescue them. AT: "Your God will not rescue you!" or "You will not be able to escape either!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
