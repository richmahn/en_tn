## translationNotes

* **this letter** - This refers to the letter that King Sennacherib of Assyria sent to Hezekiah.  (See: [[:en:bible:notes:2ki:19:08]])
* **you are God alone** - Hezekiah has changed from seeing Yahweh being Isaiah's God to Yahweh being the one and only God. The form of "you" in this location is emphatic. AT: "You yourself are God alone..."
