# this letter

This refers to the letter that King Sennacherib of Assyria sent to Hezekiah. (See: [2 Kings 19:8](./08.md))

# you who sit above the cherubim

You may need to make explicit that the cherubim are those on the lid of the ark of the covenant. The biblical writers often spoke of the ark of the covenant as if it were Yahweh's footstool upon which he rested his feet as he sat on his throne in heaven above. AT: "you who sit on your throne above the cherubim on the ark of the covenant" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
