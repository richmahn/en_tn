## turn your ear, Yahweh, and listen ##

AT: "Please listen to what I am going to say Yahweh." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

## open your eyes, Yahweh, and see ##

AT: "Please look and see what is happening Yahweh,"

## They have put their gods into the fire  ##

The Assyrian kings have burned up the other nations' gods.

## Assyrians have destroyed them ##

The Assyrians destroyed both the nations and the nation's gods.
