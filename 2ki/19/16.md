# General Information:

King Hezekiah continues praying to Yahweh after receiving the letter from King Sennacherib of Assyria.

# Turn your ear, Yahweh, and listen. Open your eyes, Yahweh, and see

Both of these sentences urge Yahweh to pay attention to the things that Sennacherib is saying. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# Turn your ear, Yahweh, and listen

The words "Turn your ear" and "listen" mean the same thing and add emphasis to the plea. Alternate translation: "Yahweh, please listen to what he is saying" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# Open your eyes, Yahweh, and see

The words "Open your eyes" and "see" mean the same thing and add emphasis to the plea. Alternate translation: "Yahweh, please pay attention to what is happening" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
