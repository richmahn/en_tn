# plants in the field, green grass

This metaphor compares the weak victims of the Assyrian advance to fragile plants. Alternate translation: "as frail as plants and grass in the fields" or "as weak as shallow rooted plants" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the grass on the roof or in the field, burned before it has grown up

This continues the metaphor comparing the weak victims of the Assyrian advance to fragile plants in difficult conditions for growing fully. Alternate translation: "like grass before it has matured" or "like grass before it has grown tall" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
