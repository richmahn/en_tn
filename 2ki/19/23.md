# General Information:

This continues the message from Yahweh given by Isaiah, the prophet, to King Hezekiah concerning King Sennacherib. It uses parallelism throughout. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# you have defied the Lord

To "defy" is to openly resist or mock.

# I have gone up ... I will cut down ... I will enter

These boasts made by Sennacherib could only be fulfilled by his army. The pronoun "I" represents him and his army. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# I dried up all the rivers of Egypt under the soles of my feet.

This is a boast that Sennacherib has so many soldiers that their feet dry up the water when they cross a river. This is an exaggeration to emphasize the great number of soldiers he has. AT: "And by marching through the streams of Egypt, we dried them all up!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
