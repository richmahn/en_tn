# General Information:

This continues the message from Yahweh given by Isaiah, the prophet, to King Hezekiah concerning King Sennacherib. It uses parallelism throughout. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# you have defied the Lord

To "defy" is to openly resist or mock.

# I have gone up ... I will cut down ... I will enter

These boasts made by Sennacherib could only be fulfilled by his army. The pronoun "I" represents him and his army. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
