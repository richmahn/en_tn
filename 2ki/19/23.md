## translationNotes

* This continues the message from Yahweh given by Isaiah, the prophet, to King Hezekiah concerning King Sennacherib.
* **you have defied the Lord** - To "defy" is to insult or mock.
* **I have gone up...I will cut down...I will enter...** - These boasts made by Sennacherib could only be fulfilled by his army.
* **I dried up all the rivers of Egypt under the soles of my feet** - "And by marching through the streams of Egypt, we dried them all up!" (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
