This continues the message from Yahweh given by Isaiah, the prophet, to King Hezekiah concerning King Sennacherib.

## you have defied the Lord ##

To "defy" is to insult or mock.

## I have gone up...I will cut down...I will enter... ##

These boasts made by Sennacherib could only be fulfilled by his army.

## I dried up all the rivers of Egypt under the soles of my feet ##

"And by marching through the streams of Egypt, we dried them all up!" (UDB) (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
