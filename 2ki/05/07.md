# he tore his clothes

Often people would rip their clothes if they were in great distress. AT: "he ripped his clothes to show his distress" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])

# Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man wants me to cure a man of his leprosy?

The king uses this rhetorical question to emphasize that the request of the king of Aram is outrageous and something he cannot do. This can be written as a statement. AT: "The king of Aram must think I am some sort of God, with the power over death and life! He wants me to cure this man of his leprosy, but I cannot do that." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# It seems he is seeking to start an argument with me

The king of Israel did not believe the request to heal Naamam was the real reason for the letter. He thought the real reason was to start a fight. AT: "It seems he is looking for an excuse to start a fight with me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
