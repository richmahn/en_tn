# My father

The servants were showing respect to Naaman by addressing him as "my father" or "sir."

# would you not have done it?

The servant uses this question to carefully rebuke Naaman. Alternate translation: "you surely would have done it!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# How much rather then

The servant is comparing how much more willing Naaman should be to obey a simple command since he is willing to obey a difficult one. Alternate translation: "How much more willing you should be to obey" or "Should you not be even more willing to obey" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# How much rather then, when he says to you to simply, 'Dip yourself and be clean?

The servant uses this rhetorical question to emphasize to Naaman that he should obey Elisha's command. This question can be written as statement. Alternate translation: "You should be even more willing to obey when he says to you simply, 'Dip yourself and be clean.'" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
