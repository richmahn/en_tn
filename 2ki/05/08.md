# General Information:

Elisha talks to the King of Israel about Naaman.

# Why have you torn your clothes?

Elisha uses this rhetorical question to emphasize to the king that he does not need to be distressed and tear his clothes. AT: "There is no need to be distressed and tear your clothes." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# your flesh will be restored

This can be written in active form. AT: "your flesh will be well" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# you will be clean

this means that he will no longer be unclean. A person who God considers spiritually unacceptable or defiled is spoken of as if the person were physically unclean. God considers a person who has leprosy as being defiled and unclean. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
