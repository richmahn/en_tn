# As Yahweh lives, before whom I stand, I

"As surely as I know that Yahweh lives, before whom I stand." Here Elisha compares the certainty that Yahweh is alive to the certainty that he will not receive any gifts from Naaman. This is a way of making a solemn promise. AT: "As surely as Yahweh lives, before whom I stand, I promise you that I" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# before whom I stand

Here serving Yahweh is spoken of as standing in his presence. AT: "whom I serve" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# I will receive nothing

This means that he will not accept any gifts. AT: "I will not take any gifts" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
