# the sons of the prophets

This does not mean that they were the sons of prophets, but rather, that they were a group of prophets. See how you translated this phrase in [2 Kings 2:3](../02/03.md). Alternate translation: "the group of the prophets" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# in your hand

The phrase "in your hand" refers to him taking the bottle with him. Alternate translation: "with you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# Ramoth Gilead

Translate the name of this city the same as you did in [2 Kings 8:28](../08/28.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
