# the body of Jezebel will be like dung on the surface of the fields ... so that no one will be able to say

This speaks of the pieces of Jezebel's body being scattered in the field as if they were dung spread in the field. Since the pieces of her body were so small and spread out there was nothing that could be collected and buried. Alternate translation: "the pieces of Jezebel's body will be scattered like dung in the fields ... so that no one will be able to recognize them and say" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# dung

manure, specifically dung used as a fertilizer

# so that no one will be able to say, "This is Jezebel."

"so that no one will be able to recognize her body." or "so no one will be able to tell this was Jezebel."
