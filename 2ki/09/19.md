# Then he sent out a second man on horseback, who came to them

"Then king Joram sent a second messenger riding a horse, who went out to meet Jehu and his army"

# a second man

Joram had already sent one man. This was the next. Alternate translation: "another man" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])

# What have you to do with peace?

Jehu uses this rhetorical question to tell the messenger that it is none of his concern if he comes in peace or not. This may be written as a statement. See how you translated this question in [2 Kings 9:18](../09/18.md). Alternate translation: "It is not your concern if I have come in peace!" or "It is not for you to know if I have come in peace!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
