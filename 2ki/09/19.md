# Then he sent out a second man on horseback, who came to them

"Then king Joram sent a second messenger riding a horse, who went out to meet Jehu and his army"

# second man

"2nd man" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])

# What have you to do with peace?

Jehu uses this rhetorical question to tell the messenger that it is none of his concern if he comes in peace or not. This may be written as a statement. See how you translated this question in [2 Kings 9:18](./17.md). AT: "It is not your concern if I have come in peace!" or "It is not for you to know if I have come in peace!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# For the way that the chariot is being driven is the way that Jehu son of Nimshi drives

This may be stated in active form. AT: "Because the driver of the chariot drives the same way that Jehu son of Nimshi drives" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
