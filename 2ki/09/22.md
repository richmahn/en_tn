# What peace is there, when the idolatrous acts of prostitution and witchcraft of your mother Jezebel are so many?

Jehu uses this rhetorical question to state why he is not coming in peace. This can be stated in active form. AT: "There can be no peace as long as your mother Jezebel practices and promotes so much idolatry in the form of prostitution and witchcraft." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
