# What have you to do with peace?

Jehu uses this rhetorical question to tell the messenger that it is none of his concern if he comes in peace or not. This may be written as a statement. Alternate translation: "It is not your concern if I have come in peace!" or "It is not for you to know if I have come in peace!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# The messenger has met them, but he is not coming back

The watchman told King Joram that the man he sent out is not coming back with a reply to the king's question.
