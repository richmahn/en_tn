The young prophet continues to speak to Jehu, whom he had just anointed as king over Israel.

## I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat and like the house of Baasha the son of Anhijah ##

The prophet says that God will destroy Ahab and his family just as he destroyed Jeroboam and Baasha and their families.

## The dogs will eat Jezebel ##

AT: "Dogs will eat the dead body of Jezebel"
