# what was evil in the sight of Yahweh

The sight of Yahweh represents Yahweh's judgment. See how you translated this in [2 Kings 3:2](../03/02.md). Alternate translation: "what was evil in Yahweh's judgment" or "what Yahweh considers to be evil" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# He did not depart from the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat

Departing from sins represents refusing to do those sins. Alternate translation: "Zechariah did not refuse to commit the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat" or "He sinned as Jeroboam son of Nebat had sinned" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
