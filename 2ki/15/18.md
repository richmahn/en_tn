The sight of Yahweh represents Yahweh's judgment. See how you translated this in [2 Kings 3:2](../03/01.md). Alternate translation: "what was evil in Yahweh's judgment" or "what Yahweh considers to be evil" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# who had caused Israel to sin

Here the word "Israel" represents the people of the kingdom of Israel. Alternate translation: "who had caused the people of Israel to sin" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
