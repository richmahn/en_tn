# are they not written ... Judah?

This question is used to either inform or remind the readers that the information about Azariah is in this other book. This can also be stated in active form. See how you translated this in [2 Kings 8:23](../08/23.md). Alternate translation: "they are written ... Judah." or "you can read about them ... Judah." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
