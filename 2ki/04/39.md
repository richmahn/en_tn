# wild gourds

These vegetables were growing wild, meaning someone had not planted them.

# fill the fold of his robe

He lifted the bottom edge of his robe up to his waist to make a place to carry more gourds than he could carry with his hands only.

# but did not know what kind they were

Since they did not know what kind of gourds they were they did not know whether or not they were safe to eat. The full meaning of this statement can be made clear. AT: "but did not know if they were good or bad to eat" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
