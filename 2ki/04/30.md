# As Yahweh lives, and as you live

"As surely as Yahweh lives and as you live." This shows that the mother is taking an oath. The mother compares the certainty that Yahweh and Elisha are alive to the certainty of what she is saying. This is a way of making a solemn promise. AT: "I solemnly promise that"

# but the child did not speak or hear

This means that the child was not alive. The full meaning of this statement can be made explicit. AT: "but the child did not show any signs of being alive" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# has not awakened

Here being dead is spoken of as being asleep. AT: "is still dead" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
