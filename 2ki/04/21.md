# on the bed of the man of God

This was the bed in the room she had prepared for Elisha when he traveled through Shunem. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# the man of God

"Elisha, the man of God"

# that I may hurry to the man of God and then come back

The woman told her husband she was going to see Elisha but she did not say that she was going because their son had died. A sentence may be added to give the implicit information as in the UDB. AT: "that I may hurry to the man of God and then come back.' But she did not tell her husband that their son had died" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
