## When she came to the man of God at the mountain ##

AT: "When the woman from Shunem arrived at Mount Carmel where Elisha was"

## she caught hold of his feet ##

AT: "she dropped down on the ground in front of him and put her hands around his feet."

## Yahweh has hidden the problem from me, and has told me nothing ##

Elisha can see that the woman is upset but Yahweh has not revealed to him the cause of her problem.
