# that I may hurry to the man of God and then come back

The woman told her husband she was going to see Elisha but she did not say that she was going because their son had died. This implicit information may be stated clearly. Alternate translation: "that I may hurry to the man of God and then come back.' But she did not tell her husband that their son had died" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
