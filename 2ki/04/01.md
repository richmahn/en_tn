# the sons of the prophets

This does not mean that they were the sons of prophets, but rather, that they were a group of prophets. See how you translated this phrase in [2 Kings 2:3](../02/03.md). AT: "the prophets" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# Your servant my husband

"My husband, who was your servant"

# creditor

person who lends other people money

# Your servant has nothing

The woman refers to herself as Elisha's servant to show him honor.

# nothing in the house, except a pot of oil

This is an exaggeration. The only valuable thing she had was a jar of oil. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
