# 2 Kings 18 General Notes

#### Structure and formatting

This chapter begins the story of Hezekiah, one of the great kings of Judah (2 Kings 18 â€“ 20). Because he was so important, there is more space dedicated to the history of his reign.

#### Special concepts in this chapter

##### Trust in Yahweh
Hezekiah trusted and obeyed God. He stopped paying tribute to Assyria so the Assyrians invaded Judah. The Assyrian king told the people of Judah that resistance was useless. Despite this, Hezekiah trusted in the power of Yahweh. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/trust]])
