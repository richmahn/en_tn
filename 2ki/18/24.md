Rabshakeh (see note on [2 Kings 18:16](./16.md)) continues telling the message from the king of Assyria to King Hezekiah's men.

## How could you resist even one captain of the least of my master's servants? ##

Possible meanings are 1) "You could not defeat even one of the least of the king's soldiers" or 2) "You could not defeat a group of the king's soldiers commanded by his least important officer." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## Have I traveled up here without Yahweh to fight against this place and destroy it?  -  ##

** AT: "Yahweh himself told us to come here and destroy this land!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
