## in the ears of the people who are on the wall ##

AT: "because the people standing on the city wall will hear it and be afraid" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## Has my master sent me to your master and to you to speak these words? Has he not sent me to the men who sit on the wall, who will have to ear their own dung and drink their own urine with you?"  ##

AT: "My master sent me not only to you and your master, but also to speak to the people in this city, who will suffer with you when they have to eat their own dung and drink their own urine to survive" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
