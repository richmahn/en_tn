Rabshakeh (see note on [2 Kings 18:16](./16.md)) continues telling the message from the king of Assyria to King Hezekiah's men.

## Now in whom are you trusting? Who has given you courage to rebel against me? ##

The King of Assyria (through his messenger Rabshakeh) does not ask these questions looking for an answer, but wants to make King Hezekiah doubt himself and Egypt's support. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## walking stick of this bruised reed of Egypt ##

The King of Assyria compares Egypt to a weak walking stick; you expect that it will support you when you lean on it, but instead it breaks and cuts you. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
