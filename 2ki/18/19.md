## translationNotes

* Rabshakeh (see note on [[:en:bible:notes:2ki:18:16]]) continues telling the message from the king of Assyria to King Hezekiah's men.
* **Now in whom are you trusting? Who has given you courage to rebel against me?** - The King of Assyria (through his messenger Rabshakeh) does not ask these questions looking for an answer, but wants to make King Hezekiah doubt himself and Egypt's support. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **walking stick of this bruised reed of Egypt** - The King of Assyria compares Egypt to a weak walking stick; you expect that it will support you when you lean on it, but instead it breaks and cuts you. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
