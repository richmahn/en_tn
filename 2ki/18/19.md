# General Information:

Rabshakeh continues telling the message from the king of Assyria to King Hezekiah's men.

# What is the source of your confidence? ... Now in whom are you trusting? Who has given you courage to rebel against me?

The King of Assyria (through his messenger Rabshakeh) does not ask these questions looking for an answer, but wants to make King Hezekiah doubt himself and Egypt's support. AT: "Do not trust in anybody. You were foolish to rebel against me." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# walking stick of this bruised reed of Egypt

The King of Assyria compares Egypt to a weak walking stick; you expect that it will support you when you lean on it, but instead it breaks and cuts you. AT: "the weak support from Egypt" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# but if a man leans ... and pierce it

The speaker is extending the metaphor by describing what happens when a reed is used as a support. AT: "but if someone uses this for support, he will be injured" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
