# General Information:

Rabshakeh continues telling the message from the king of Assyria to King Hezekiah's men.

# What is the source of your confidence?

The King of Assyria (through his messenger Rabshakeh) wants to make King Hezekiah doubt himself and Egypt's support. He does not ask this question looking for an answer. Alternate translation: "You have no reason to think that you can defeat me." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
