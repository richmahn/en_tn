# What is the source of your confidence? ... In whom are you trusting, that you should rebel against me?

The King of Assyria (through his messenger Rabshakeh) does not ask these questions looking for an answer, but wants to make King Hezekiah doubt himself and Egypt's support. AT: "Do not trust in anybody. You were foolish to rebel against me." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
