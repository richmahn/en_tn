# In whom are you trusting, that you should rebel against me?

The King of Assyria (through his messenger Rabshakeh) wants to make King Hezekiah doubt himself and Egypt's support. He does not ask this question looking for an answer. Alternate translation: "You cannot trust anyone to help you rebel against me." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
