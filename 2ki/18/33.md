# General Information:

Rabshakeh continues telling the message from the king of Assyria to King Hezekiah's men.

# Has any of the gods ... Assyria?

He asks this question for emphasis because they know the answer. Alternate translation: "None the gods of the peoples have rescued them ... Assyria." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
