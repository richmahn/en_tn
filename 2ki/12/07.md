# Why have you not repaired anything in the temple?

Joash asks this question to rebuke the priests. Alternate translation: "You should have been repairing the temple!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# give it to those who can make the repairs

"pay workers who will do the repairs"
