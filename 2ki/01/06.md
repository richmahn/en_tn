# Is it because there is no God in Israel that you sent men to consult with Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron?

This rhetorical question is asked as a rebuke for consulting Baal-Zebub. This may be written as a statement. This is irony because they are definitely aware of the God of Israel. See how you translated a similar question in [2 Kings 3:3](../03/03.md). Alternate translation: "You fools! You know there is a God in Israel, but you were acting as though you did not know when you sent men to consult Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# you will not come down from the bed to which you have gone up

When King Ahaziah was injured, he was placed in a bed. Yahweh said that he will never become well and be able to get out of the bed. See how you translated this statement in [2 Kings 3:4](../03/04.md). Alternate translation: "you will not recover and you will not get up from the bed on which you are lying" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
