## Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are going to consult with Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron? ##

AT: "You must not think there is a God in Israel since you are going to get advice from Baal Zebub" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## consult with Baal Zebub ##

The word "consult" means to get the opinion of someone about a question. King Ahaziah wanted to ask Baal Zebub if he would get better.

## You will not come down from the bed to where you have gone up ##

When King Ahaziah was injured, he was placed in a bed. Yahweh said that he will never become well and be able to get out of the bed. Instead he will surely die.
