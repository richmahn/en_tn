# Therefore Yahweh says

This is Yahweh's message to King Ahaziah. AT: "Therefore Yahweh says to King Ahaziah" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# You will not come down from the bed to where you have gone up

When King Ahaziah was injured, he was placed in a bed. Yahweh said that he will never become well and be able to get out of the bed. AT: "You will not recover and you will not get up from the bed on which you are lying" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
