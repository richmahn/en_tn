# Is it because there is no God in Israel from whom you can ask for information?

This rhetorical question is asked as a rebuke for consulting Baal-Zebub. This may be written as a statement. This is irony because the king is definitely aware of the God of Israel. AT: "You must think there is no God in Israel whom you may ask for information!" or "You fool! You know there is a God in Israel to consult, but you acted as if you did not know."

# you will not come down from the bed where you have gone up

When King Ahaziah was injured, he was placed in a bed. Yahweh said that he will never become well and be able to get out of the bed. See how you translated this statement in [2 Kings 3:4](./03.md). AT: "you will not recover and you will not get up from the bed where you are lying" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
