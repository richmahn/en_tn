# to the place about which the man of God had spoken and warned him

This refers to the place that Elisha had warned the king about in [2 Kings 6:9](./08.md).

# More than once or twice, when the king went there, he was on his guard

Elisha would warn the king of where the Aramean army would attack so that he could alert the people before the attack happened. AT: "Elisha warned the king of Israel in this way several times and the Israelites were able to stay safe" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# Will you not tell me who among us is for the king of Israel?

The king of Aram assumes there is a traitor among his soldiers who is giving information to the Israelite king. He uses this rhetorical question to try to find out who that traitor is. This can be written as a statement. AT: "Tell me which of you is for the king of Israel!" or "Tell me which of you is revealing our plans to the king of Israel!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# is for the king of Israel

"To be for someone" means to be loyal to that person. In this case, it means that they would give information to help the king of Israel. AT: "is helping the king of Israel" or "is loyal to the king of Israel" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
