# to the place about which the man of God had spoken and warned him

This refers to the place that Elisha had warned the king about in [2 Kings 6:9](../06/09.md).

# More than once or twice, when the king went there, he was on his guard

Elisha would warn the king of where the Aramean army would attack so that he could alert the people before the attack happened. Alternate translation: "Elisha warned the king of Israel in this way several times and the Israelites were able to stay safe" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
