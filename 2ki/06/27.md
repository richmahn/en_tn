# He said

"The king of Israel answered the woman,"

# If Yahweh does not help you, how can I help you?

The king uses this rhetorical question to tell the woman that he cannot help her. This can be written as a statement. Alternate translation: "If Yahweh is not helping you, then I cannot help you." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Is there anything coming from the threshing floor or winepress?

The king uses this rhetorical question to emphasize that there is no food available. Here the threshing floor refers to grain and the winepress refers to wine. This can be written as a statement. Alternate translation: "There is nothing coming from the threshing floor or the winepress." or "There is no food to harvest or any grapes to make wine to drink."
