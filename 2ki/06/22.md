# Elisha answered

Elisha was replying to the king of Israel's question.

# Would you kill those whom you had taken captive with your sword and bow?

Elisha uses this rhetorical question to rebuke the king and tell him not to kill these men. The words "sword and bow" are a metonym for war in which soldiers use swords and bows and arrows. This can be written as a statement. AT: "You would not kill men whom you had captured in war, so you should not kill these men." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# Put bread and water before them, that they may eat and drink

Here "bread" refers to food in general. AT: "Give them food to eat and water to drink" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# go to their master

This refers to the king of Aram.
