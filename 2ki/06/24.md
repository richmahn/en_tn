## besieged it ##

AT: "did not let anyone or anything go in or out of the city." or "​blockaded the city."​

## So there was a great famine in Samaria ##

AT: "​Because of the siege or blockage, there was very little food left in Samaria."​

## Behold, they besieged it until a donkey'​s head was sold for eighty pieces of silver ##

The Aramean army surrounded the city for a long time, to the point where things that were normally not considered good food (such as a donkey'​s head or dove's dung) were the only food left and worth a high price.
