# Now the king of Aram was waging war against Israel

"When the king of Aram was at war with Israel,"

# Now

This word is used here to mark a break in the main story line. Here the author starts to tell a new part of the story.

# saying, "My camp will be in such and such a place

The king of Aram was telling his counselors where to set up the camp. Here the phrase "such and such" is a way to refer to the information of the location of the camp without writing it out. If this phase does not translate well into your language this may be written as indirect speech. Alternate translation: "and told them where his camp would be located" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
