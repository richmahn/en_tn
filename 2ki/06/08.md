# Now

This word is used here to mark a break in the main storyline. Here the author starts to tell a new part of the story.

# saying, "My camp will be in such and such a place

The king of Aram was telling his counselors where to set up the camp. Here the phrase "such and such" is a way to refer to the information of the location of the camp without writing it out. If this phase does not translate well into your language this may be written as indirect speech. AT: "and told them where his camp would be located" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])

# the man of God

"Elisha the man of God"

# Be careful not to pass that place, for the Arameans are going down there
