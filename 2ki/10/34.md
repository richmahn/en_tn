# are they not written in the book of the events of the kings of Israel?

This rhetorical question can be written as a statement. See how this phrase is translated in [2 Kings 1:18](../01/17.md). Alternate translation: "they are written in the book of the history of the kings of Israel." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
