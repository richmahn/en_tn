# did not leave the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat

This speaks of Jehu committing the same sins that Jeroboam committed, as if Jeroboam's sins were a place that Jehu did not leave. Alternate translation: "did not stop committing the kinds of sins that Jeroboam son of Nebat had committed" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Nebat

See how you translated this man's name in [2 Kings 3:3](../03/01.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
