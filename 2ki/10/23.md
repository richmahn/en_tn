# he said to the worshipers of Baal

"Jehu said to the people who were in the temple to worship Baal"

# but the worshipers of Baal alone

"but that only worshipers of Baal are here"

# If any of the men whom I bring into your hands escapes

Here the "hands" of the men refer to their "control." By being stationed around the temple they were in control of the situation and it was up to them whether people were able to escape or not. AT: "If any of these men that I brought into your control escapes" or "If any of the men that are inside gets away" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# whoever lets that man escape, his life will be taken for the life of the one who escaped

"we will kill the man who let him escape"

# his life will be taken

This can be stated in active form. This is a polite way to refer to a person being killed. AT: "we will take his life" or "we will kill him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# for the life of the one

"in exchange for the life of the man." Here this man is referred to by his "life" to emphasize that he did not die. AT: "for the man" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
