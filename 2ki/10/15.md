# Is your heart with me, as my heart is with yours? ... "It is."

Here a person's "heart" refers to their loyality. If a person's loyalty is "with someone," it means that they are loyal to that person. AT: "Will you be loyal to me, as I will be loyal to you? ... 'I will.'" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# If it is, give me your hand

"If so, put your hand in mine" or "If so, let us shake hands" In many cultures, when two people shake hands, it confirms their agreement. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
