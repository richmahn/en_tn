# Athaliah ... Jehosheba ... Joash

These are the names of people. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# saw that her son was dead

"became aware that her son was dead"

# she arose and killed all the royal children

Athaliah did not personally kill the children. AT: "she commanded her servants to kill all the members of Ahaziah's family who might become king" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# took Joash son of Ahaziah, and hid him away from among the king's sons who were killed, along with his nurse; she put them into a bedroom. They hid him from Athaliah so that he was not killed.

"took Ahaziah's very young son Joash and hid him and his nursemaid in a bedroom in the temple. So he was not killed"

# He remained with her six years, hidden in the house of Yahweh, while Athaliah reigned over the land

This can be stated in active form. AT: "Joash and Jehosheba hid him in the house of Yahweh for six years while Athaliah ruled the land" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
