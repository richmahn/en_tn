# Athaliah ... Jehosheba ... Joash

These are the names of people. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# saw that her son was dead

"became aware that her son was dead"

# she arose and killed all the royal children

Athaliah did not personally kill the children. Alternate translation: "she commanded her servants to kill all the members of Ahaziah's family who might become king" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
