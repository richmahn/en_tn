# Whoever enters within your ranks

"Anyone who tries to go past you while you are protecting King Joash." A rank refers to a line of soldiers.

# let him be killed

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "you must kill him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# You must stay with the king when he goes out, and when he comes in

These two opposite things are a merism that refers to everything the king does. Alternate translation: "You must stay near the king at all times" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
