See [2 Kings 7:1](./01.md) where Elisha told all this to the king before.

## About this time ##

"About this time tomorrow"

## in the gate of Samaria ##

"in the market place of Samaria" or "in the city of Samaria"

## will be available ##

"will be for sale"

## See ##

This brings attention to what the speaker is saying (both the captain and Elijah).

## can this thing happen? ##

AT: "I do not believe this can happen!"  (See [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## you will watch it happen with your own eyes ##

AT: "you will be there when it happens," (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
