The captain asks this question to express his unbelief. This question can be translated as a statement. See how you translated this in [2 Kings 7:2](../07/02.md). Alternate translation: "this could never happen!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

The phrase "with your own eyes" emphasizes that the captain will certainly see the things that Elisha prophesied. See how you translated this in [2 Kings 7:2](../07/02.md). Alternate translation: "you yourself will watch these things happen" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
