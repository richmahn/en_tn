A high ranking captain who was the king's personal assistant is spoken of as if he were a person on whom the king leaned his hand. See how you translated this in [2 Kings 7:2](./01.md). AT: "the captain who was close to the king" or "the captain who was the king's personal assistant" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# trampled him down

The crowd of people were in such a rush to get to the food in the camp that they knocked over the man and trampled him to death.
