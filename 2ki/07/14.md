# Go and see

The implicit information about what the king wanted them to see may be stated clearly. AT: "Go and see if what these lepers have said is true" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# They went after them to the Jordan

"They followed the path the Aramean army took all the way to the Jordan River"

# all the road was full of clothes and equipment

This is an exaggeration that means the men saw these items scattered along the road as they traveled. AT: "there were clothes and equipment all along the road" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
