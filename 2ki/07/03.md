# Why should we sit here until we die?

Although there were four men, probably only one of them asks this question. The question is rhetorical and emphasizes that they should not do this. It can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: "Certainly we should not sit here until we die" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
