# Now

This word is used here to mark a break in the main story line. Here the writer starts to tell a new part of the story.

# Why should we sit here until we die?

Although there were four men, probably only one of them asks this question. The question is rhetorical and emphasizes that they should not do this. It can be translated as a statement. AT: "Certainly we should not sit here until we die" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# If they keep us alive, we will live, and if they kill us, we will only die

The four men with leprosy are saying that the Arameans might feed them so that they can live, or they might kill them, which would be no worse since they would die anyway.
