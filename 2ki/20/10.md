# the stairway of Ahaz

This was probably a special stairway built for King Ahaz in such a way that its steps marked the hours of daylight as the sun's rays advanced along them. In this way, the staircase served to tell the time during the day. AT: "the steps that had been built for King Ahaz" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
