# Marduk-Baladan ... Baladan

These are the names of the king of Babylon and his son. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# listened to those letters

1) "carefully considered those letters" or 2) "heard the message from the king of Babylon"

# There was nothing in his house, nor in all his kingdom, that Hezekiah did not show them

Here "There was nothing ... did not show them" is an exaggeration used for emphasis. It means Hezekiah showed them all of his most valuable things. This can be stated in positive form. AT: "Hezekiah showed him absolutely everything valuable in his house and in all his kingdom" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
