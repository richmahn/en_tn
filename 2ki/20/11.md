# the stairway of Ahaz

This was probably a special stairway built for King Ahaz in such a way that its steps marked the hours of daylight as the sun's rays advanced along them. In this way, the staircase served to tell the time during the day. Alternate translation: "the steps that had been built for King Ahaz" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
