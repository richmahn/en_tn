# So Isaiah said to Hezekiah

Why Isaiah spoke can be stated clearly. AT: "So, because Isaiah knew Hezekiah had been foolish to show the men all his valuable things, Isaiah said to him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# the word of Yahweh

"the message of Yahweh"

# Look, the days are about to come when

"Listen to me, someday there will come a time when"; "Look" is used to draw attention to what Isaiah is about to tell Hezekiah.

# the days

"Days" is synecdoche to refer to an undefined span of time. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
