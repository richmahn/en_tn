# I have heard your prayer, and I have seen your tears

The second part reinforces the first part to make one message by using parallelism. Alternate translation: "I have heard your prayers and seen your tears" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# on the third day

"two days from now" The day Isaiah said this was the first day, so "the third day" would be the same as "two days from now."
