# they slaughtered them before his eyes

The eyes are synecdoche for the whole person. AT: "they forced king Zedekiah to watch them kill his sons" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# he put out his eyes

"Nebuchadnezzar put out Zedekiah's eyes." It might be best to translate so that the reader understands that other people might have helped Nebuchadnezzar do this. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
