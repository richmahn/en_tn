# Did I not say to you, 'Do not go'?

Elisha uses this rhetorical question to emphasize that he had told them previously what would happen. This can be written as a statement. Alternate translation: "I told you that you should not go, because you would not find him!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
