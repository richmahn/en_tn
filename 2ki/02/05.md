# Then the sons of the prophets who were at Jericho came to Elisha and said to him

"When Elijah and Elisha came near Jericho, the sons of the prophets who were from there said to Elisha"

# the sons of the prophets

This does not mean that they were the sons of prophets, but rather, that they were a group of prophets. See how you translated this phrase in [2 Kings 2:3](./03.md). Alternate translation: "the group of men who were prophets" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
