# behold

The word "behold" here alerts us to pay attention to the surprising information that follows.

# a chariot of fire and horses of fire

Here the phrase "of fire" means that these were surround by fire. Alternate translation: "a chariot surrounded by fire pulled by horses surrounded by fire" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])

# went up by a whirlwind into heaven

"was carried into the sky by a whirlwind." Translate the word "whirlwind" the same as you did in [2 Kings 2:1](../02/01.md).
