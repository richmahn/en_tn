# As Yahweh lives, and as you live

"As surely as Yahweh lives and as you live." Here Elisha compares the certainty that Yahweh and Elijah are alive to the certainty of what he is saying. This is a way of making a solemn promise. Alternate translation: "I solemnly promise you that" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
