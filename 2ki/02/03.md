# The sons of the prophets

This does not mean that they were the sons of prophets, but rather, that they were a group of prophets. AT: "A group of men who were prophets" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# As Yahweh lives, and as you live, I will not leave you

"As surely as Yahweh lives and as you live, I will not leave you." Here Elisha compares the certainty that Yahweh and Elijah are alive to the certainty of what he is saying. This is a way of making a solemn promise. See how you translated this phrase in [2 Kings 2:2](./01.md). AT: "I solemnly promise you that I will not leave you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
