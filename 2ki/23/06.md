# General Information:

This continues to tell what King Josiah did in response to the message from Yahweh.

# He brought out ... and burned it ... He beat it ... and threw ... He cleared

The word "he" refers to Josiah. He would have commanded his workers to do these things. Hilkiah and the priests who assisted him did these things. Alternate translation: "He had them bring out ... and burn it ... He had them beat it ... and throw ... He had them clear" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
