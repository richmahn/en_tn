# He broke ... he filled

Josiah would have commanded his workers to do these things. It is likely that Hilkiah and the priests who assisted him did these things. Alternate translation: "He had them break ... they filled" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# filled those places with the bones of human beings

"covered the ground with human bones so people could not use it as a shrine anymore" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
