# Josiah the king destroyed ... Josiah smashed ... The king ruined ... He broke ... he filled

Josiah would have commanded his workers to do these things. It is likely that Hilkiah and the priests who assisted him did these things. Alternate translation: "Josiah the king commanded them to destroy ... They smashed ... He had them ruin ... He had them break ... they filled" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
