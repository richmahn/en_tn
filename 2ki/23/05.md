# He got rid

The word "He" refers to Josiah. He would have commanded his workers to do these things. It is likely that Hilkiah and the priests who assisted him did these things. Alternate translation: "He had them get rid" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# to Baal, to the sun and the moon, to the planets, and to all the stars
