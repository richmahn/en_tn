# Josiah also completely destroyed ... He also burned ... and beat ... He also burned

It might be best to translate so that the reader understands that other people, perhaps Hilkiah and "the priests under him" ([2 Kings 23:4](./04.md)), might have helped Josiah do these things. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# spoke of these things beforehand

"had said that these things would happen"
