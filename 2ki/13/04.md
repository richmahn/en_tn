# implored Yahweh

"prayed to Yahweh"

# he saw the oppression of Israel, how the king of Aram was oppressing them

These two phrases mean the same thing and are repeated for emphasis. The abstract noun "oppression" means the same as "the king of Aram was oppressing them." Alternate translation: "he saw how severely the king of Aram was oppressing Israel" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
