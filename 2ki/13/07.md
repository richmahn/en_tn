# had destroyed them

"had defeated the army of Jehoahaz"

# made them like the chaff at threshing time

The Aramean army had so severely defeated the army of Israel that what remained was so worthless that it is compared to wheat chaff that the laborers walk on at harvest time. Alternate translation: "had crushed them as workers crush chaff under their feet at harvest time" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
