# they did not depart from the sins of the house of Jeroboam

To stop sinning is spoken of as if they departed from the sins. This can be stated in positive form. Alternate translation: "Israel did not stop doing the same sins as Jeroboam had done" or "Israel continued to commit the same sins as Jeroboam had committed" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# house of Jeroboam
