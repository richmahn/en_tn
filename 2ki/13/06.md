# they did not depart from the sins of the house of Jeroboam

To stop sinning is spoken of as if they departed from the sins. This can be stated in positive form. AT: "Israel did not stop doing the same sins as Jeroboam had done" or "Israel continued to commit the same sins as Jeroboam had committed" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# house of Jeroboam

"the family of Jeroboam"

# had destroyed them

"had defeated the army of Jehoahaz"

# made them like the chaff at threshing time

The Aramean army had so severely defeated the army of Israel that what remained was so worthless that it is compared to wheat chaff that the laborers walk on at harvest time. AT: "had crushed them as workers crush chaff under their feet at harvest time" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
