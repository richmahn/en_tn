Elisha continues to talk to Joash, king of Israel.

# Open the window eastward

"open the window that faces east" or "open that window towards the east"

# so he opened it

Since this happens after Joash takes the bow and arrows, he may have had a servant open the window. AT: "So a servant opened it" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# he shot

"Joash shot the arrow"

# This is Yahweh's arrow of victory, the arrow of victory over Aram

The relationship between the arrow and victory can be stated explicitly. AT: "This arrow is a sign from Yahweh that he will give you victory over Aram" or "This arrow symbolizes the victory Yahweh will give you over Aram" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# Aphek

This was a city in the land of Israel. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# But the man of God was angry with him

"But Elisha was angry with King Joash"
