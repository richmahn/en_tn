# wept over him

"wept because Elisha was sick"

# My father, my father

Elisha was not the king's literal father. King Joash used this term as a sign of respect.

# the chariots of Israel and the horsemen are taking you away

This is a reference to Elijah going to heaven in [2 Kings 2:11-12](../02/11.md). Joash uses this phrase to say that Elisha was going to die. AT: "the chariots of Israel and the horsemen are taking you to heaven" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# the horsemen

This refers to the men who drove the chariots. This can be made explicit. AT: "the drivers of the chariots" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
