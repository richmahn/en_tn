# are they not written ... Judah?

This is written as a rhetorical question because at the time this was written people were already aware of this information. This can be written as a statement. It can be translated in active form. See how you translated this in [2 Kings 8:23](../08/22.md). AT: "they are indeed written ... Judah." or "you can find them ... Judah" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# slept with his ancestors

Sleeping is a euphemism for dying. AT: "died and was buried along with his ancestors" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
