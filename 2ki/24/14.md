# He took into exile all Jerusalem

Here "Jerusalem" is a metonym for the people who lived there. And, "all" is a generalization. It means all the most important people AT: "Nebuchadnezzar took all the important people away from Jerusalem" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# the craftsmen and the smiths

"the men who knew how to make and repair things that are made from metal"

# No one was left except the poorest people in the land

This can be translated as a positive statement. AT: "Only the poorest people in the land still lived there" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
