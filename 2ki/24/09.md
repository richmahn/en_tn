# what was evil in the sight of Yahweh

The sight of Yahweh represents Yahweh's judgment or evaluation. See how you translated this in [2 Kings 3:2](../03/01.md). AT: "what was evil in Yahweh's judgment" or "what Yahweh considers to be evil" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# he did all that his father had done

Here "all" is a generalization. It means he did the same sinful things as his father. AT: "he committed the same kinds of sins his father had committed" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
