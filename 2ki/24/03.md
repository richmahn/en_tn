# It was certainly at the mouth of Yahweh

Some versions have, "It was certainly because of the wrath of Yahweh," which is just as good a reading of the original text. If translators have access to versions in major languages in their region, they should probably follow their choice.

# remove them out of his sight

"get rid of them" or "destroy them"

# innocent blood that he shed

Blood is a metonym for innocent life, and shedding blood is a metonym for killing innocent people. AT: "innocent people whom he killed" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood
