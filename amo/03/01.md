# you, people of Israel ... the whole family that I brought up out of the land of Egypt

These two phrases refer to the same group of people. The people God is speaking to are the descendants of those he had taken out of Egypt.

# the whole family

Here "the whole family" represents to the whole nation. The people of Israel were all descendants of Jacob. AT: "the whole nation" or "the whole clan" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
