# For they do not know how to do right

The word "they" refers to the people of Samaria.

# They store up violence and destruction

Here "violence and destruction" represent things they have taken by being violent and destructive. Alternate translation: "They store up things that they have violently stolen from others" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
