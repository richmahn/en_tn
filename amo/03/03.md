# General Information:

Amos uses the questions in verses 3-6 to present examples of things that people already know about what causes things to happen and what are the results of things that happen. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Will two walk together unless they have agreed?

Amos uses this question to remind people of what they already know about what must happen in order for two people to walk together. It can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: "Two people will walk together only if they have first agreed to walk together." or "You know that two people will walk together only if they have agreed to do that." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
