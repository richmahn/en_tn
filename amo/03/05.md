# General Information:

Amos uses the questions in verses 3-6 to present examples of things that people already know about what causes things to happen and what are the results of things that happen. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Can a bird fall in a trap on the ground when no bait is set for him?

Amos uses this question to remind people of what they already know about what causes a bird to fall into a trap. This can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: "A bird can fall into a trap on the ground only when bait has been set for him." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Will a trap spring up from the ground when it has not caught anything?

Amos uses this question to remind people of what they already know about what causes a trap to spring up. This question can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: "A trap will spring up from the ground only when it has caught something." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Will a trap spring up from the ground

This refers to a trap closing. When an animal steps on a trap, the trap closes and the animal cannot get out of it. Alternate translation: "Will a trap close"
