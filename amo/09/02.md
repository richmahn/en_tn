# Though they dig into Sheol, there my hand will take them. Though they climb up to heaven, there I will bring them down

Yahweh uses an exaggerated image of people fleeing to Sheol or heaven to try to escape being killed. Here "Sheol" and "heaven" are a merism that represents all places. AT: "Even if they were to flee to Sheol or to heaven, they would not be able to escape me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])

# there my hand will take them

Here "hand" represents Yahweh's power. AT: "I will pull them up from there" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
