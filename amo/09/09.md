# the house of Israel

Here "house" represents the people. AT: "the people of Israel" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# I will shake the house of Israel ... as one shakes grain in a sieve, so that not the smallest stone will fall to the ground

The picture here is of grain falling through the sieve and stones being kept out. The idea is that Yahweh will remove all of the sinful people from Israel. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# sieve

a surface with many small holes that allow small things to pass through and keep larger things from passing through
