## one shakes grain in a sieve, so that not the smallest stone will fall to the ground ##

The picture here is of grain falling through the sieve and stones being kept out. Some versions understand "not the smallest stone will fall" to mean the good grain will not fall through the sieve with the unwanted material.

## sieve ##

a surface with many small holes that allow small things to pass through and keep larger things from passing through
