# Are you not like the people of Cush to me, ... Israel—this ... declaration—did I not bring up Israel ... the Philistines ... the Arameans from Kir? 

Yahweh uses a question to emphasize that the people of Israel are no more special to him than the people of Cush, the Philistines, and the Arameans. Alternate translation: "You people of Israel, you are certainly no more important to me than the people of Cush—this ... declaration—I brought up Israel ... the Philistines ... the Arameans from Kir." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# this is Yahweh's declaration

Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated these words in [Amos 2:11](../02/11.md). Alternate translation: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this i what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# Kir

See how you translated the name of this place in [Amos 1:5](../01/05.md).
