# Are you not like the people of Cush to me, people of Israel?

Yahweh uses a question to emphasize that the people of Israel are no more special to him than the people of Cush. AT: "You people of Israel, you are certainly now no more important to me than the people of Cush." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# this is Yahweh's declaration

Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated these words in [Amos 2:11](../02/11.md). AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# Did I not bring up Israel out of the land of Egypt, the Philistines from Crete, and the Arameans from Kir?

# Kir
