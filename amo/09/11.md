"At that time"

# I will raise up the tent of David that has fallen

Causing the people of Israel to be great again is spoken of as if David's kingdom were a tent that fell down and Yahweh will set it back up. AT: "David's kingdom will be like tent that has fallen down, but I will raise it back up again" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# close up its breaches

"I will repair its walls"

# I will raise up its ruins, and rebuild it as in the days of old

"I will rebuild its ruins and make it strong like it was long ago"
