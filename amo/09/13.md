# Look

The writer is telling the reader that he is going to say something surprising. Your language may have a way of doing this.

# the days will come ... when the plowman

A future time is spoken of as if "days will come." AT: "there will be a time ... when the plowman" or "in the future ... the plowman" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# when the plowman ... him who plants seed

These are two images of Yahweh restoring prosperity in Israel. This means grain will grow faster than the people can harvest it, and there will be so many grapes, those crushing the grapes will still be working when farmers start planting more vineyards.

# this is Yahweh's declaration

Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [Amos 2:11](../02/11.md). AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# The mountains will drip sweet wine, and all the hills will flow with it

These two lines mean basically the same thing. The huge amount of grapes and wine in Israel is spoken of as if wine flows down the hills and mountains. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
