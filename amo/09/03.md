# Though they hide on the top of Carmel ... Though they are hidden from my sight in the bottom of the sea

Yahweh gives an exaggerated image of the people fleeing to the top of mount Carmel or to the bottom of the sea to escape being killed. Here "top of Carmel" and "bottom of the sea" are a merism that represents all places. AT: "Even if they were to hide on the top of Carmel ... Even if they tried to go the bottom sea, thinking that I could not see them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])

# serpent

an unknown fierce sea animal, not the snake in the garden of Eden and not a common snake
