## translationNotes

* **serpent** - an unknown fierce sea animal (see UDB), not the snake in the garden of Eden and not a common snake
* **I will keep my eyes on them** - If your language has words that usually mean the speaker wants to do others good but can also be used when the speaker wants to do harm, you may want to use it here. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]] and [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
* **and not for good** - words to make sure the hearer understands "for harm" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
