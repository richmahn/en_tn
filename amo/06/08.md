# this is the declaration of the Lord Yahweh, the God of hosts

Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [Amos 3:13](../03/13.md). AT: "this is what the Lord Yahweh, the God of hosts, has declared" or "this is what I, the Lord Yahweh, the God of hosts, have declared" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# I detest the pride of Jacob

Here "Jacob" represents his descendants. AT: "I hate the descendants of Jacob because they have become arrogant" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# I hate his fortresses

It is implied that Yahweh hates the fortresses because the people believed the fortresses would keep them safe. AT: "I hate the people of Israel because they trust in their fortresses, not in me, to protect them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
