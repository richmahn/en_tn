# this is the declaration of the Lord Yahweh, the God of hosts

Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [Amos 3:13](../03/13.md). Alternate translation: "this is what the Lord Yahweh, the God of hosts, has declared" or "this is what I, the Lord Yahweh, the God of hosts, have declared" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# from Lebo Hamath to the brook of the Arabah

Here "Lebo Hamath" represents the northern border of Israel, and "brook of the Arabah" represents the southern border. Alternate translation: "from the northern border of your nation to the southern border" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# brook
