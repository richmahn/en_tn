# General Information:

In 6:9-10 Amos describes a hypothetical situation of what it will be like when Yahweh hands the people of Israel over to their enemies. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])

# if there are ten men left in one house, they will all die

This seems to imply that something terrible is happening, and these ten men go into the house to hide. AT: "if ten men are hiding inside of a house, they will all still die" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
