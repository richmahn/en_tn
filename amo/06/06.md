# drink wine from bowls

This implies that they drink a lot of wine because they drink it from a large bowl rather than a regular wine cup. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# they do not grieve over the ruin of Joseph

Here "Joseph" represents his descendants. Alternate translation: "they do not grieve about the descendants of Joseph whom enemies will soon destroy" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
