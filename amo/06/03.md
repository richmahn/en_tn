# to those who put off the day of disaster

Refusing to believe that Yahweh will cause disaster is spoken of as if the "day of disaster" were an object the people could put far from themselves. AT: "to those who refuse to believe that I will cause them to experience disaster" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# and make the throne of violence come near

Here "throne" is a metonym that represents reign or rule. The people doing evil things, which causes Yahweh to bring disaster on them, is spoken of as if they were causing "violence" to rule them. AT: "but who are actually causing me to send violent people to destroy you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
