# For three sins of ... even for four

This is a poetic device. It does not mean that a specific number of sins had been committed, but indicates that many sins had led to God's judgment. See how you translated these words in [Amos 1:3](./03.md).

# Tyre

Here "Tyre" represents the people of the city of Tyre. AT: "the people of Tyre" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# I will not turn away punishment

Yahweh uses two negatives here to emphasize that he would punish them. See how you translated these words in [Amos 1:3](./03.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])

# their covenant of brotherhood

"the agreement they made to treat you as brothers"

# it will devour her fortresses

Here Yahweh's judgment is spoken of as if it were a fire that was consuming the fortresses. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
