# For three sins of ... even for four

This is a poetic device. It does not mean that a specific number of sins had been committed, but it indicates that many sins had led to God's judgment. See how you translated these words in [Amos 1:3](./03.md).

# Gaza

Here "Gaza" represents the people of the region of Gaza. AT: "the people of Gaza" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# I will not turn away punishment

Yahweh uses two negatives here to emphasize that he would punish them. See how you translated these words in [Amos 1:3](./03.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])

# hand them over to

"deliver them up to" or "sell them to"

# Edom

Here "Edom" represents the people of the country of Edom. AT: "the people of Edom" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# it will devour her fortresses

Here Yahweh's judgment is spoken of as if it were a fire that was consuming the fortresses. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
