# For three sins of ... even for four

This is a poetic device. It does not mean that a specific number of sins had been committed, but indicates that many sins had led to God's judgment. See how you translated these words in [Amos 1:3](./03.md).

# I will not turn away punishment

Yahweh uses two negatives here to emphasize that he would punish them. See how you translated these words in [Amos 1:3](./03.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])

# enlarge their borders

"extend their boundaries" or "expand their territory"
