# Amos 01 General Notes

#### Structure and formatting

This book is written in a poetic form. Because it was written by a farmer, it includes many references to agricultural concepts.

##### "For three sins of Judah, even for four"
The phrase "For three sins of Judah, even for four," is used to begin each oracle. This is not intended to be a literal count but is an idiom indicating a large number of sins. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])
