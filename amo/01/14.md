# Connecting Statement:

Yahweh continues his message of judgment on the people of Ammon.

# it will devour the palaces

Here Yahweh's judgment is spoken of as if it were a fire that was consuming the palaces. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# with a tempest in the day of the whirlwind

The fighting against the people of Ammon is spoken of as if it were a violent storm. AT: "and the fighting will be like a great storm" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# tempest ... whirlwind

These are two kinds of violent storms.

# whirlwind

a strong wind that spins very quickly as it moves and can cause damage

# Their king will go into captivity

The abstract noun "captivity" can be translated as the verb "capture." This can be translated in active form. AT: "Their enemies will capture their king and take him away as a prisoner" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
