# Why do you long for the day of Yahweh?

God uses this question to rebuke the people for saying that they want the day of Yahweh to be soon. This can be translated as a statement. AT: "You long for the day of Yahweh." or "You should not long for the day of Yahweh!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# It will be darkness and not light

Here "darkness" represents a time when disasters happen, and "light" represents a time when good things happen. AT: "It will be a time of darkness and disaster, not of light and blessing" or "On that day there will be disasters, not blessings" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
