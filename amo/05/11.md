# worked stone

"cut stones" or "stones that people have cut"

# you will not drink their wine

The word "their" refers to the vineyards. This may imply that no one will make the wine, or even that there will not be enough good grapes to make wine. AT: "you will not drink the wine that is made from the grapes in your vineyards" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
