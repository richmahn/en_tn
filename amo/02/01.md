# For three sins of ... even for four

This is a poetic device. It does not mean that a specific number of sins had been committed, but indicates that many sins had led to God's judgment. See how you translated these words in [Amos 1:3](../01/03.md).

# Moab

This represents the Moabite people. Alternate translation: "the people of Moab" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# I will not turn away punishment

Yahweh uses two negatives here to emphasize that he would punish them. See how you translated these words in [Amos 1:3](../01/03.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])

# he burned the bones

The word "he" refers to Moab. Alternate translation: "the people of Moab burned the bones"

# to lime

"to ashes"
