# For three sins of ... even for four

This is a poetic device. It does not mean that a specific number of sins had been committed, but indicates that many sins had led to God's judgment. See how you translated these words in [Amos 1:3](../01/03.md).

# Judah

This represents the people of Judah. AT: "the people of Judah" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# I will not turn away punishment

Yahweh uses two negatives here to emphasize that he will punish them. See how you translated these words in [Amos 1:3](../01/03.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])

# Their lies

This expression here probably refers to worshiping false gods or idols. AT: "Their worship of idols" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# go astray ... walked

Worshiping false gods is spoken of as if people were walking behind them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# it will devour the fortresses of Jerusalem

Here Yahweh's judgment is spoken of as if it were a fire that was consuming the fortresses. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
