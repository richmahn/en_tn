#### Important figures of speech in this chapter

##### Idiom
You will notice that the phrase "For three sins of Judah, even for four," is used to begin each of these oracles. This is not intended to be a literal count but is an idiom indicating a large number of sins. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])
