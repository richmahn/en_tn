# plumb line

thin rope with a weight at one end used in building to make sure walls stand straight up and down

# what do you see?

Yahweh uses a question to teach Amos. AT: "tell me what you see." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# I will put a plumb line among my people Israel

Judging the people and determining they are wicked is spoken of as if the Israelites were a wall, and Yahweh determines the wall is not straight by using a plumb line. AT: "my people Israel are wicked. They are like a wall that is not straight up and down" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
