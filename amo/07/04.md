# Look

The writer is telling the reader that something surprising is about to happen. Your language may have a way of doing this.

# the Lord Yahweh called on fire to judge

"the Lord Yahweh used burning fire to punish the people"

# how will Jacob survive? For he is so small.

Here "Jacob" represents his descendants the Israelites. See how you translated this in [Amos 7:2](./01.md). AT: "how will the Israelites survive? We are so small and weak!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
