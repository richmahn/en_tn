# The high places of Isaac will be destroyed, the sanctuaries of Israel will be ruined, and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword

Here "sword" represents an army. This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "I will send an army to attack the house of Jeroboam, and the army will destroy the high places of Isaac and the sanctuaries of Israel" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# Isaac ... Israel

Both of these represent the people of Israel. Alternate translation: "the descendants of Isaac ... the people of Israel" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# the house of Jeroboam

Here "house" represents "family." Translate "Jeroboam" as you did in [Amos 1:1](../01/01.md). Alternate translation: "Jeroboam and his family" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
