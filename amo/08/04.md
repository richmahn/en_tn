# Listen to this

Amos is speaking to the wealthy merchants who harm those who are poor.

# you who trample the needy and remove the poor of the land

This can be restated to remove the nominal adjectives "the needy" and "the poor." Alternate translation: "you who trample those who are in need and remove those in the land that are poor" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])

# you who trample

Harming people is spoken of as if it were stomping on people. Alternate translation: "you who harm" or "you who oppress" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
