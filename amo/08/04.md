# Listen to this

Amos is speaking to the wealthy merchants who harm those who are poor.

# you who trample the needy and remove the poor of the land

This can be restated to remove the nominal adjectives "the needy" and "the poor." AT: "you who trample those who are in need and remove those in the land that are poor" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])

# you who trample

Harming people is spoken of as if it were stomping on people. AT: "you who harm" or "you who oppress" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# They say, "When will the new moon be over, so we can sell grain again? When will the Sabbath day be over, so that we can sell wheat?

The merchants use theses question to emphasize that want to start selling their items again. This can be stated as an indirect quotation. AT: "They are always asking when the new moon will be over or when the Sabbath will be over so that can sell their grain and wheat again." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])

# We will make the measure small and increase the price, as we cheat with false scales

The merchants would use false scales that showed that the amount of grain they were giving was greater than it really was and that the weight of the payment was less than it really was.

# the needy for a pair of sandals

The words "and buy" are understood. AT: "buy the needy for a pair of sandals" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
