# They will stagger from sea to sea; they will run from the north to the east to seek the word of Yahweh

Here "sea to sea" and "the north to the east" represent all of the land of Israel. AT: "They will wander here and there and search all over for the word of Yahweh" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])

# from sea to sea

This implies the Dead Sea in the south and the Mediterranean Sea in the west. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
