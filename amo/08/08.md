# Will not the land quake for this, and every one who lives in it mourn?

Amos uses a question to emphasize that these things will certainly happen. AT: "Yahweh will cause the land to shake, and every one who lives in it will mourn." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# All of it will rise up like the Nile River ... like the river of Egypt

Amos compares the rising and sinking of the waters of the Nile River to how Yahweh will cause the land to shake when he judges the people. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# river of Egypt
