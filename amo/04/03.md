# Connecting Statement:

God continues to speak to the people of Israel.

# breaks in the city wall

places where the enemy had broken down the city wall to enter

# you will be thrown out toward Harmon

This can be stated in active form. AT: "they will throw you out toward Harmon" or "your enemies will force you to leave the city and go toward Harmon" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# Harmon

This is either the name of a place that we do not know, or it refers to Mount Hermon. Some modern versions interpret it in that way. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# this is Yahweh's declaration

Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated these words in [Amos 2:11](../02/11.md). AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
