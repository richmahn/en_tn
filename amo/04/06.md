# Connecting Statement:

God continues to speak to the people of Israel.

# I gave you cleanness of teeth

Here having clean teeth represents having no food in the mouth to make the teeth dirty. Alternate translation: "I caused you to starve" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# lack of bread

Giving them "lack of bread" represents causing them to lack bread, and "bread" represents food in general. Alternate translation: "I caused you not to have enough food" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# you have not returned to me

Returning to God represents submitting again to him. Alternate translation: "you have not submitted again to me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# this is Yahweh's declaration

Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated these words in [Amos 2:11](../02/11.md). Alternate translation: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
