# Go to Bethel and sin, to Gilgal and multiply sin

People would go to Bethel and Gilgal to make sacrifices to God, but they kept sinning anyway. God makes these commands to show that he is angry with them for doing these things. These commands can be expressed as statements. AT: "You go to Bethel to worship, but you sin. You go to Gilgal to worship, but you sin even more" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])

# bring your sacrifices ... every three days. Offer a thanksgiving sacrifice ... proclaim freewill offerings; announce them

God makes these commands in order to show the people that he is angry that even though they do these things, they continue to sin against him in other ways. These commands can be expressed as statements. AT: "You bring your sacrifices ... every three days. You offer a thanksgiving sacrifice ... you proclaim freewill offerings. And you announce them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])

# every three days

Possible meanings are 1) on the third day or 3) every third day. Some versions have "every three years," because the Israelites were supposed to bring their tithes to God once every three years.
