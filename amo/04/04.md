## translationNotes

* **Go to Bethel and sin, to Gilgal and multiply sin** - "Because you refuse to repent, the sacrifices you offer at Bethel and Gilgal only make me more angry" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
* **Bring your sacrifices ... your tithes ... Offer a thanksgiving sacrifice ... proclaim freewill offerings; announce them** - If your language has a way to show that the people refuse to understand that doing these things will do them no good but they will not stop doing them, you may want to use it here. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
* **declaration of the Lord Yahweh** - Translate this as you did in [[:en:bible:notes:amo:03:13]].
