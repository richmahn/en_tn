# Offer a thanksgiving sacrifice ... proclaim freewill offerings; announce them, for this pleases

God makes these commands in order to show the people that even though they do these things, he is angry because they continue to sin against him in other ways. Use the form in your language that shows that they will do these things no matter what Yahweh says, but these things will do them no good. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])

# announce them

"boast about them"

# for this pleases you, you people of Israel

Yahweh rebukes them for being proud about their offerings and sacrifices. They think that God should be pleased with them, but he is not. Alternate translation: "for this pleases you, you people of Israel. But it does not please me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# this is the declaration of the Lord Yahweh

Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated the similar phrase "this is Yahweh's declaration" in [Amos 2:11](../02/11.md). Alternate translation: "this is what the Lord Yahweh declares" or "this is what I, the Lord Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
