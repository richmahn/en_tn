# bring your sacrifices ... every three days. Offer a thanksgiving sacrifice ... proclaim freewill offerings; announce them

God makes these commands in order to show the people that he is angry that even though they do these things, they continue to sin against him in other ways. These commands can be expressed as statements. Alternate translation: "You bring your sacrifices ... every three days. You offer a thanksgiving sacrifice ... you proclaim freewill offerings. And you announce them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])

# announce them

"boast about them"

# for this pleases you, you people of Israel

Yahweh rebukes them for being proud about their offerings and sacrifices. They think that God should be pleased with them, but he is not. Alternate translation: "for this pleases you, you people of Israel. But it does not please me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# this is the declaration of the Lord Yahweh

Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated the similar phrase "this is Yahweh's declaration" in [Amos 2:11](../02/11.md). Alternate translation: "this is what the Lord Yahweh declares" or "this is what I, the Lord Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
