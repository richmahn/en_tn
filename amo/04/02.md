# The Lord Yahweh has sworn by his holiness

This means that Yahweh promised that he would do something, and he assured people that he would do what he promised because he is holy.

# the days will come on you

The word "you" refers to the wealthy women of Israel who lived in Samaria, but also includes men.

# the days will come on you when they will take you away with hooks

A time in the future when bad things will happen to the people is spoken of as if those days will attack the people. The word "they" refers to their enemies. Alternate translation: "There will be a time when your enemies will take you away with hooks" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# they will take you away with hooks, the last of you with fishhooks

These two phrases mean basically the same thing and emphasize that the enemy will capture the people like people catch fish. Alternate translation: "they will capture you as people capture animals, and they take you away" or "they will defeat you and cruelly force you to go away with them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
