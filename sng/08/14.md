## be like a gazelle or a young stag ##

See how you translated this in [Song of Solomon 2:16](../02/16.md).

## the mountains of spices ##

"the mountains that have spices all over them." The woman uses this imagery to invite her lover to enjoy her. See how the lover uses the imagery of a mountain of myrrh and a hill of frankincense in [Song of Solomon 4:6](../04/06.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
