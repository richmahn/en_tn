# You who live

The man is speaking to the woman, so "you" and "live" are feminine singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# listening for your voice

The voice is a metonym for what the person says. If your language has a word for thinking only of what one is listening for, you could use it here. Alternate translation: "waiting to hear you start speaking" or "waiting to hear what you have to say" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# let me hear it

"let me hear your voice."
