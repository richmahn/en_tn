## translationNotes

* The young woman continues to speak to her lover.
* **I would lead you and bring you into my mother's house** - If the lover were her brother, she could bring him to the family home. This was normal in that culture and is still today in some.
* **and you would teach me** - This could also be translated as "and she would teach me." Because the woman is inexperienced in making love, she is imagining that her lover or her mother would teach her how to make love. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
* **I would give you spiced wine to drink / and some of the juice of my pomegranates** - The woman uses these images to say that she will give herself to her lover and make love with him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **spiced wine** - "wine with spices" or "wine that has spices in it" This represents the intoxicating power of love-making. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **juice of my pomegranates** - The woman represents her own sweet liquid with the extract of pomegranates. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **His left hand...embracing me** - See how you translated "His left hand is under my head, and his right hand embraces me" in [[en:bible:notes:sng:02:05]].
