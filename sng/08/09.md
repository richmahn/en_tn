# General Information:

The young woman's brothers continue to speak among themselves.

# If she is a wall ... If she is a door

The little sister ([Song of Songs 8:8](./08.md)) has very small breasts that either have not grown or are very small. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# we will build on her a tower of silver ... we will adorn her with boards of cedar

The brothers decide to decorate the little sister with silver and cedar, symbols of riches, so that she will be more likely to attract a good husband. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# will adorn her

"will decorate her"
