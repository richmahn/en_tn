# I was a wall

The wall is a metaphor for a woman with small breasts. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# my breasts are now like fortress towers

Fortress towers are tall. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# I am in his eyes as one

Here eyes are a metonym for judgment or value. Alternate translation: "I am in his judgment as one" or "he thinks of me as one" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# brings peace

You may need to make explicit to whom the woman brings peace. Alternate translation: "brings him peace" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# peace

"well-being"
