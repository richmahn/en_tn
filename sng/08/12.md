# My vineyard, my very own

The woman refers to herself as a vineyard, as in [Song of Songs 1:6](../01/05.md). Here she emphasizes that she and no one else will decide what she dies with the "vineyard." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# is before me

This is an idiom that means the a person has the right to do what they want with something. AT: "is at my disposal" or "is mine to do with as I desire" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# the thousand shekels are for you, Solomon

The woman knows that Solomon has leased out the vineyard so he can get money, but she does not want money.

# the two hundred shekels

The speaker has not mentioned these before, but the hearer would understand that she is speaking of the money that those who worked the vineyard would have left for their own after they paid Solomon.
