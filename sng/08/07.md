The young woman continues to speak to her lover.

## Surging waters cannot quench love ##

Love is so strong that it is like a fire that is so hot that it cannot be put out even with an ocean full of water. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## Surging waters ##

"Oceans of water" or "Huge amounts of water"

## cannot quench ##

"cannot extinguish" or "cannot put out"

## nor can floods sweep it away ##

Love never changes and always stays the same so it is like something that not even a powerful flood can move. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## floods ##

In Israel, water from the rain flows into deep and narrow valleys. This creates a flood of water so powerful that it can move huge boulders and trees. Even today, floods sometimes sweep away very strong bridges.

## sweep it away ##

"carry it away" or "wash it away"

## If a man gave...the offer would utterly be despised ##

"Even if a man...he would be utterly despised." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])

## for love ##

"in order to get love" or "in order to buy love"
