The young woman continues to speak to the man.

# Surging waters cannot quench love

Love is so strong that it is like a fire that is so hot that it cannot be put out even with an ocean full of water. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Surging waters

"Oceans of water" or "Huge amounts of water"

# cannot quench

"cannot extinguish" or "cannot put out"

# nor can floods sweep it away

Love never changes and always stays the same so it is like something that not even a powerful flood can move. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# floods

In Israel, water from the rain flows into deep and narrow valleys. This creates a flood of water so powerful that it can move huge boulders and trees.

# sweep it away

"carry it away" or "wash it away"

# If a man gave ... the offer would utterly be despised

This is something that could possibly happen. AT: "Even if a man ... he would be utterly despised" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])

# gave

offered to give

# all the possessions in his house

"everything he owns"

# for love

"in order to get love" or "in order to buy love"

# the offer would utterly be despised

This can be translated in active form. AT: "people would completely despise him" or "people would harshly ridicule him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
