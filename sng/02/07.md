# will not awaken or arouse love until she pleases

Here "love" is spoken of as if it were a person asleep that does not want to be awakened. This is a metaphor that represents the man and woman who do not want to be disturbed until they are finished making love. AT: "will not disturb us until we have finished making love" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# will not awaken or arouse

If your language has only one word for waking people out of sleep, you could combine these words. AT: "will not awaken" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
