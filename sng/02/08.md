# General Information:

Here begins Part Two of the book.
It is not clear whether the woman is speaking to herself or to the daughters of Jerusalem.

# Listen

Possible meanings are 1) "Listen carefully to what I am about to say." You could use a word in your language that tells the hearer to listen carefully, or 2) "Listen so you can hear him coming."

# my beloved

This phrase refers to the man whom the woman loves. In some languages it may be more natural for her to refer to him as "my lover." See how you translated this in [Song of Songs 1:13](./12.md). Alternate translation: "my dear one" or "my lover"  

# leaping ... jumping ... gazing ... peering

The woman shows that she is excited to see the man come by using as few words as possible to describe what he is doing. Your language may have a different way of showing that the speaker is excited about what is happening.

# leaping over the mountains, jumping over the hills

"leaping on the mountains, running quickly on the hills." The woman speaks of the man as if he were "a gazelle or a young stag" (verse 9) coming quickly toward her over rough ground. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
