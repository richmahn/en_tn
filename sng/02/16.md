# My beloved is mine

"My beloved belongs to me"

# I am his

"I belong to him"

# he grazes

"feeds" or "eats grass." The woman speaks of the man as if he were "a gazelle or a young stag" (verse 17) that eats plants among the lilies. Grazing is probably a metaphor for lovemaking ([Song of Songs 2:1-2](./01.md)). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# lilies

sweet-smelling flowers that grow in places where there is much water. Translate as the plural of "lily" in [Song of Songs 2:1](./01.md).
