# gazing ... peering

The woman shows that she is excited to see the man come by using as few words as possible to describe what he is doing. Your language may have a different way of showing that the speaker is excited about what is happening.

# like a gazelle or a young stag

Gazelles and young stags move quickly over rough ground. The woman imagines the man coming as fast as he can to be with her. You could translate using animals in your language that people think of as fast. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# a gazelle

This is an animal that looks like a deer and moves quickly. Translate as the singular of "the gazelles" as in [Song of Songs 2:7](./07.md).

# a young stag

"a young male deer"

# look

"listen carefully" or "what I am about to say is important." You could use a word in your language that tells the hearer to listen carefully.

# behind our wall

"on the other side of our wall." The woman is in a house and the man is outside the house.

# our wall

The word "our" refers to the woman and the other people in the house with her. If she is speaking to herself, it is inclusive, but if she is speaking to the daughters of Jerusalem, whether she is referring to herself and her companions or to herself only in plural, as in "We are glad ... We rejoice ... let us celebrate" ([Song of Songs 1:4](../01/01.md)), it is exclusive. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

# gazing through the window

"he stares in through the windows"

# peering through the lattice

# lattice
