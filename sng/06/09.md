# My dove

The Israelites considered doves beautiful birds with pleasant voices. The man thinks the woman's face and voice are beautiful. If calling a woman a "dove" would be offensive, you could leave out the metaphor. See how you translated this in [Song of Songs 2:14](../02/14.md). Alternate translation: "You beautiful woman" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# my undefiled

"my perfect one" or "my faithful one" or "my innocent one." See how you translated this in [Song of Songs 5:2](../05/02.md).

# the only daughter of her mother

This is an exaggeration. Alternate translation: "her mother's special daughter" or "completely different from her mother's other daughters" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# the woman who bore her

"the woman who gave birth to her." This phrase refers to her mother.

# young women ... queens ... concubines

the women spoken of in [Song of Songs 6:8](./08.md).

# called her blessed

"said that things had gone especially well for her"
