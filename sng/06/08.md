# There are sixty queens, eighty concubines ... young women without number

These numbers are to be large, then larger, and then beyond counting. AT: "There are 60 queens, 80 concubines ... more young women than anyone could count" or "There are many queens, even more concubines, and more young women than anyone could count" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# My dove

The Israelites considered doves beautiful birds with pleasant voices. The man thinks the woman's face and voice are beautiful. If calling a woman a "dove" would be offensive, you could leave out the metaphor. See how you translated this in [Song of Solomon 2:14](../02/14.md). AT: "You beautiful woman" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# my undefiled

"my perfect one" or "my faithful one" or "my innocent one." See how you translated this in [Song of Solomon 5:2](../05/02.md).

# the only daughter of her mother

This is an exaggeration. AT: "her mother's special daughter" or "completely different from her mother's other daughters" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# the woman who bore her

"the woman who gave birth to her." This phrase refers to her mother.

# young women ... queens ... concubines

the women spoken of in verse 8

# called her blessed

"said that things had gone especially well for her"
