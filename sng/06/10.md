The ULB understands this to be what the queens and the concubines said about the woman. However, some versions understand these to be the words of the man.

# Who is this who appears like the dawn ... banners?

They are using this question to say that they think the young woman is amazing. AT: "This is an amazing woman! She comes into view like the dawn ... banners!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# who appears like the dawn

The dawn is beautiful. The woman is beautiful. AT: "who comes into view like the dawn" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# as awe-inspiring as an army with its banners

The beauty of the woman is so powerful that it makes the other women feel helpless, as if an army were approaching them. See how you translated this in [Song of Solomon 6:4](./04.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
