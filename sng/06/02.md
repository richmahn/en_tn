# My beloved has gone down to his garden

The word "garden" is a metaphor for the woman. The man is finally able to fully enjoy the woman as they make love. See the explanation of this metaphor in [Song of Solomon 5:1](../05/01.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])

# beloved

Some versions such as the UDB understand this word to refer to the one who loves the woman, but the ULB understands it to refer to the one whom the woman loves. See how you translated this in [Song of Solomon 1:13](../01/12.md).

# to graze in the garden and to gather lilies

These words are metaphors for the man enjoying her body. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# graze
