## translationNotes

* **What is that coming up from the wilderness** - The group of people is traveling from the wilderness to Jerusalem. Because the wilderness is low in the Jordan valley and Jerusalem is high in the mountains, the people must go up in order to reach Jerusalem.
* **like a column of smoke** - Because the people raised much dust in the air as they traveled, the dust looked like smoke in the distance. AT: "with columns of smoke going up." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])

* **powders** - a fine dust made by crushing something solid
* **Look** - This word shows here that the speaker now discovers the answer to the question in verse 6.
* **it is the portable litter** - The word "portable" means that people can easily moved the litter (a bed with a cover) from one place to another.
