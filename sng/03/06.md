# General Information:

Here begins Part Three of the book. It begins with a description of sixty men carrying Solomon's bed up from the wilderness to Jerusalem.

# What is that coming up from the wilderness

The group of people is traveling from the wilderness to Jerusalem. They must go up in order to reach Jerusalem because the wilderness is low in the Jordan valley and Jerusalem is high in the mountains.

# What is that

Many versions translate this "Who is that."

# like a column of smoke

The dust looked like smoke from far away because the people raised much dust in the air as they traveled. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# perfumed with myrrh and frankincense

"with the sweet smell of myrrh and frankincense"

# with all the powders sold by merchants

The words "perfumed with" are understood from the previous phrase. They can be repeated here. Alternate translation: "perfumed with all the powders sold by merchants" or "and with the sweet smell of all the powders that merchants sell" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# powders

a fine dust made by crushing something solid
