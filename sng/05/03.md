# "I have ... dirty?"

You may need to make explicit that these words are what the woman thought to herself when she heard the man speak ([Song of Solomon 5:2](./02.md)). Or you could turn this into an indirect quote, as the UDB does. AT: "I said to myself, 'I have ... dirty?'" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])

# robe

thin linen clothing that people wore on their skin

# must I put it on again?

This can be translated as a statement. AT: "I do not want to put it on again." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# I have washed my feet

While the word "feet" can be a euphemism for private parts, this probably refers to literal feet. The woman seems more likely to want to make love than to want to refrain from lovemaking because she has just bathed. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])

# must I get them dirty?

This can be translated as a statement. AT: "I do not want to get them dirty."

# My beloved put in his hand through the opening of the door latch

Possible interpretations are 1) literal, the lover reaches into the house through a hole in the door in order to open the door or 2) euphemisic, they have begun to make love. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])

# beloved

Some versions such as the UDB understand this word to refer to the one who loves the woman, but the ULB understands it to refer to the one whom the woman loves. See how you translated this in [Song of Solomon 1:13](../01/12.md).

# door latch

"door lock"
