# "I have taken off my robe ... dirty?"

This is what the woman thought to herself when she heard the man speak. ([Song of Songs 5:2](./02.md)). This could be translated with the woman saying that this is what she was thinking, or the woman could just explain the situation and her thoughts as in the UDB. AT: "I thought to myself, 'I have taken off my robe ... dirty?'" or "I had taken off my robe and I did not want to put it on again. I had washed my feet and I did not want to get them dirty." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
