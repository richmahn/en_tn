#### Important figures of speech in this chapter

##### Metaphors
In the ancient Near East, it was common to describe a woman using metaphors involving animals. In many cultures today, this can be considered offensive. Different metaphors of beauty are used in different cultures. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

##### "My sister, my bride"
The woman described is not the sister of her husband. They are not related. Instead, this is a reference to a woman who is a fellow Israelite.
