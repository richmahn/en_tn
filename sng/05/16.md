# General Information:

The young woman continues to describe the man.

# His mouth is most sweet

The mouth is a metonym for either 1) the man's sweet kisses or 2) the sweet words that he says. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# he is completely lovely

"every part of him is lovely" or "all of him is lovely"

# This is my beloved, and this is my friend

The word "This" refers to the man that the woman has just finished describing. AT: "That is what the one I love is like, and that is what my friend is like"

# my beloved

This phrase refers to the man whom the woman loves. In some languages it may be more natural for her to refer to him as "my lover." See how you translated this in [Song of Songs 1:13](./12.md). AT: "my dear one" or "my lover"

# daughters of Jerusalem

"young women of Jerusalem." These young women could not hear her and were not present, but the woman speaks as if they were present and could hear her. See how you translated this in [Song of Songs 2:7](../02/07.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe]])
