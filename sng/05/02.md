# General Information:

Here begins Part Four of the book
The young woman uses euphemisms to describe her dream so that it can be interpreted in two different ways: 1) the woman describes a dream about a night when the man came to visit her at her house; and 2) the woman describes a dream about starting to sleep with the man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])

# but my heart was awake

The heart is the center of thought and feeling. Alternate translation: "but I could think clearly" or "but I knew what I was feeling" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# my beloved

This phrase refers to the man whom the woman loves. In some languages it may be more natural for her to refer to him as "my lover." See how you translated this in [Song of Songs 1:13](./12.md). Alternate translation: "my dear one" or "my lover"

# Open to me

Possible meanings are 1) literal, "Open the door for me," or 2) metaphorical, "Let me make love to you." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# my sister

This is an idiom of affection. They are not actually brother and sister. See how you translated this in [Song of Songs 4:9](../04/09.md). Alternate translation: "my dear" or "my darling" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# my love

"you whom I love." See how you translated this in [Song of Songs 1:9](../01/09.md).

# my dove

See how you translated this in [Song of Songs 2:14](../02/14.md).

# undefiled one

"my perfect one" or "my faithful one" or "my innocent one"

# dew

drops of water or mist that form as the night becomes cool

# my hair with the night's dampness

The words "is wet" are understood from the previous phrase. They can be repeated here. Alternate translation: "my hair is wet with the night's dampness" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
