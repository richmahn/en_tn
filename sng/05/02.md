Here begins Part Four of the book
The young woman uses euphemisms to describe her dream so that it can be interpreted in two different ways: 1) the woman describes a dream about a night when her lover came to visit her at her house; and 2) the woman describes a dream about starting to have sex with her lover. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
