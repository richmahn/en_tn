Here begins Part Four of the book

# General Information:

The young woman uses euphemisms to describe her dream so that it can be interpreted in two different ways: 1) the woman describes a dream about a night when the man came to visit her at her house; and 2) the woman describes a dream about starting to sleep with the man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])

# but my heart was awake

The heart is the center of thought and feeling. AT: "but I could think clearly" or "but I knew what I was feeling" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# beloved

Some versions such as the UDB understand this word to refer to the one who loves the woman, but the ULB understands it to refer to the one whom the woman loves. See how you translated this in [Song of Solomon 1:13](../01/12.md).
