# General Information:

The man continues to praise the woman.

# Your neck is like the tower of David

No one knows if this was a real tower. A tower is a tall, slender building, and saying that David built it implies that it was beautiful. The man considered the woman's neck long and slender and so beautiful. Alternate translation: "Your neck is long and beautiful like the tower of David" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# of David

"that David built"

# built in rows of stone

Women had necklaces that covered their entire necks with rows of decorations. The man compares these rows of decorations with the rows of stone on the tower. Alternate translation: "that has many rows of stone" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# with a thousand shields

The man compares the decorations of the woman's necklace with shields hanging on the tower. The necklace probably went around her neck many times. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# a thousand shields

"1,000 shields." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])

# all the shields of soldiers

"all of the shields belong to mighty warriors"
