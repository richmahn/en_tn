# two breasts

If the word "two" seems unnecessary and so out of place, you could omit it.

# like two fawns, twins of a gazelle

The man implies that the woman's breasts are matching, soft, and perhaps small. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# twins

the babies of a mother who gave birth to two babies at one time

# gazelle

an animal that looks like a deer and moves quickly. Translate as the singular of "gazelles" as in [Song of Songs 2:7](../02/07.md).

# grazing among the lilies

"eating plants among the lilies." While it is clear that the man "grazing among the lilies" is a metaphor for making love ([Song of Songs 2:16](../02/16.md)), it is not clear what these words refer to. It is best to translate them literally.

# lilies

sweet-smelling flowers that grow in places where there is much water. Translate as the plural of "lily" in [Song of Songs 2:1](../02/01.md).
