# spend the night in the villages

Though the words here translated "spends the night" and "villages" appear together in [Song of Songs 1:13-14](../01/12.md) as "spends the night" and "henna flowers," and the context both here and there is lovemaking, the ULB chooses this reading because the immediate metaphor is of the man and woman sleeping in the village, rising in the morning, and going out into the vineyards. The word for "henna plants" and the word for "villages" sound exactly the same.
