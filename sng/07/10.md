# I am my beloved's

Translate "My beloved is mine, and I am his" as in [Song of Solomon 2:16](../02/16.md).

# my beloved's

Some versions such as the UDB understand the word "beloved" to refer to the one who loves the woman, but the ULB understands it to refer to the one whom the woman loves. See how you translated this in [Song of Solomon 1:13](../01/12.md).

# he desires me

"he wants to make love to me" or "he wants me"

# spend the night in the villages

Though the words here translated "spend the night" and "villages" appear together in [Song of Solomon 1:13-14](../01/12.md) as "spends the night" and "henna flowers," and the context both here and there is lovemaking, the ULB chooses this reading because the immediate metaphor is of the man and woman sleeping in the village, rising in the morning, and going out into the vineyards. The word for "henna plants" and the word for "villages" sound exactly the same.
