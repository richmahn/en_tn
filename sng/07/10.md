# I am my beloved's

See how you translated a similar phrase in [Song of Solomon 6:3](../06/01.md).

# my beloved's

This phrase refers to the man whom the woman loves. In some languages it may be more natural for her to refer to him as "my lover." See how you translated this in [Song of Solomon 1:13](./12.md). AT: "my dear one's" or "my lover's"

# he desires me

"he wants to make love to me" or "he wants me"

# spend the night in the villages

Though the words here translated "spends the night" and "villages" appear together in [Song of Solomon 1:13-14](../01/12.md) as "spends the night" and "henna flowers," and the context both here and there is lovemaking, the ULB chooses this reading because the immediate metaphor is of the man and woman sleeping in the village, rising in the morning, and going out into the vineyards. The word for "henna plants" and the word for "villages" sound exactly the same.
