# Your anointing oils

"The oils that you put on your body"

# have a delightful fragrance

"smell wonderful"

# your name is like flowing perfume

Perfume has a good smell that spreads as the air moves. The name is either a metonym for 1) the person's reputation, what other people think of him. Here the speaker says that people always think that the hearer is a good person, or 2) the person himself.
