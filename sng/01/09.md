The man continues speaking to the woman.

# I compare you, my love, to a mare among Pharaoh's chariot horses

The Jews of those days considered horses beautiful, and the Pharaoh's horses would have been the most beautiful he could find. The man considers the young woman beautiful. AT: "My love, you are as beautiful as any of Pharaoh's chariot horses" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# my love

"you whom I love"

# Pharaoh's chariot horses

"the horses that pull Pharaoh's chariots"

# Your cheeks are beautiful with ornaments

These ornaments could be 1) jewels hanging from a band around the head or 2) earrings or 3) a metaphor for her long hair. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# We will make

The man speaks as if he were many people. Some versions change this to singular "I." Other versions take these to be the words of the woman's friends. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pronouns]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
