# my soul loves

The soul is a metonym for the person. AT: "I love" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# feed your flock

"graze your flocks"

# rest your flock

"have your flock lie down"

# Why should I be like someone who wanders beside the flocks of your companions?

The woman asks this question to emphasize that she has a closer relationship to the man than other women do. This question can be translated as a statement. AT: "Tell me so that I will not need to wander around among the flocks of your companions when I am looking for you." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# wanders

"goes all around." She does not want to have to look for the man. Perhaps she is afraid other men will think she is a prostitute looking for business. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# companions

"friends" or "co-workers"
