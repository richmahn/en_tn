The prophet Joel told them to understand it as an expression of the “day of Yahweh,” the occasion on which Yahweh would judge people and punish them for disobedience or reward them for obedience. Joel did not mean that the end of the world had come, but that the people should recognize that Yahweh was acting in judgment as he would at the end of the world. As the book progresses, Joel moves from his spiritual interpretation of the current locust plague to talking about the actual end of the world and final judgment. The apostles of Jesus understood some of Joel’s prophecies to have been fulfilled in their own day. In Acts 2:17 and 2:21, Peter quoted Joel 2:28 and 2:32, where Yahweh says, “I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh” and “everyone who calls on the name of Yahweh will be saved.”\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nThe traditional title of this book is “The Book of Joel” or just “Joel.” Translators may also call it the “The Message from Joel” or “The Sayings of Joel.”\n\n### Who wrote the book of Joel?\n\nThis book contains the prophecies of an Israelite named Joel. The title of the book states that he was the “son of Pethuel,” but it gives no further information about him. The book also does not tell when Joel prophesied.\n\n## Part 2: Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### The locust attack\n\nLocust attacks occurred often in the ancient Near East. Certain kinds of grasshoppers would come in countless numbers. There would be so many that they would darken the sky like a black cloud that blocked the sunlight. They often came after a long period of no rain. They came down on whatever crops were surviving in the fields and stripped them bare of their leaves. The locusts could not be stopped and they caused terrible damage. There are various names for locusts in the original language of the Old Testament. It is uncertain whether these refer to different kinds of locusts or to the same kind of locust in different stages of growth. For this reason, versions of the Bible differ in how they translate these terms. See the note to 1:4 for a suggestion of how you might do this in your translation.\n\n## Part 3: Translation Issues\n\n### Representing the poetry of the Book of Joel in your translation\n\nThe poetry in the book of Joel consists almost entirely of paired phrases that both mean basically the same thing. The second phrase emphasizes the meaning of the first phrase by repeating the same idea in different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. It may be clearer in your language to connect the phrases with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. For example, in 1:2, you might say, “Hear this, you elders! Yes, listen, all of the dwellers of the land!” In 1:5, you might say, “Wake up, drunkards, and weep! Indeed, wail, all of the drinkers of wine.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])\n\n### Litanies\n\nIn two places in the book, 1:4 and 2:9, Joel uses a repetitive series of similarly structured sentences for emphasis. This repetitive style of speaking or writing is called a “litany.” While in each case these brief litanies consist of two lines of poetry, in your translation you may wish to represent them as separate shorter lines, as illustrated here. This would show the rhetorical device that Joel is employing. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litany]])\n\n1:4 The residue of the cutting locust,\n\nthe swarming locust has eaten,\n\nand the residue of the swarming locust,\n\nthe hopping locust has eaten,\n\nand the residue of the hopping locust,\n\nthe destroying locust has eaten.\n\n2:9 Upon the city they rush,\n\non the wall they run,\n\ninto the houses they climb,\n\nthrough the windows they enter like thieves.\n\n### Speakers describe results before giving reasons\n\nThroughout their speeches in the book, Joel and Yahweh typically describe a result before giving the reason for it. If it would be more natural in your language, in all or some of these cases, you could reverse the order and first present the phrase or clause that gives the reason and then present the phrase or clause that presents the result. For example, in 1:17, instead of saying, “The storehouses are desolate, the granaries have been broken down, for the grain has dried up,” you could say, “Because the grain has dried up, the storehouses are desolate, the granaries have been broken down.” In 2:21, rather than saying, “Do not fear, land! Be glad and rejoice, for Yahweh has been great in doing,” you could say, “Yahweh has been great in doing! So do not fear, land. Be glad and rejoice.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])\n\n### Travel descriptions marked for change in elevation\n\nIn several places in the book (1:6, 3:2, 3:9, 3:11, 3:12), the ULT has the terms “up” or “down” in descriptions of travel. That shows how Hebrew marked such descriptions for changes in elevation. If your language does not do that, you can use expressions without “up” and “down,” for example, in 1:6, “a nation has come against my land” rather than “a nation has come up against my land.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1:intro	q2ev				0	# Joel 1 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nIn this chapter, Joel describes the effects of the locust attack and calls the people to mourn.\n\nAfter the book title in 1:1, the ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than its usual text because it is poetry.\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Locusts\n\nThis book starts very dramatically with the imagery of the locusts and the devastation that they produce. There are five different kinds of locusts that appear to come, and they progressively destroy the vegetation including the crops, vineyards, and even the trees. It was common for farmers in the ancient Near East to experience large locust swarms that would come and eat all crops in their fields. Translators should translate simply, presenting the scenes of locusts as Joel describes them.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### “House” meaning “temple”\n\nSeveral times in this chapter (1:9, 1:13, 1:14, 1:16), Joel uses the term “house” to mean Yahweh’s “temple.” He speaks of this temple as if it were a house in which God lived, since God’s presence was there. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1:1	a3b2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Pethuel	1	The word **Pethuel** is the name of a man.
1:1	a3b7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	The word of Yahweh that was	1	Joel is using the term **word** to mean the message that Yahweh gave, by association with the way words are used to communicate messages. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “The message that Yahweh gave”
1:1	ltl4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	The word of Yahweh that was	1	This is an idiom meaning that Yahweh spoke or communicated his message in some way to the prophet Joel. If this phrase does not have that meaning in your language, you could use an idiom from your language that does have this meaning or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “The message of Yahweh that came” or “The message that Yahweh spoke”
1:2	d6e9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	Hear this, you elders, and listen, all of the dwellers of the land	1	See the discussion in the General Introduction to Joel of how Hebrew poetry consisted of paired phrases that meant basically the same thing. Decide as a translation team how you will represent this poetry in your translation throughout the book of Joel. Alternate translation: “Hear this, you elders! Yes, listen, all of the dwellers of the land!”
1:2	q3r8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	Has this been in your days or in the days of your fathers?	1	Joel is using the question form for emphasis. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “This has not happened in your days or in the days of your fathers!”
1:2	c9d2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	in your days or in the days of	1	Joel is using the term **days** to mean a period of time, by association with the way days make up longer periods of time. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “in your time or in the time of”
1:2	j001		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	your fathers	1	Joel is not referring to the literal **fathers** of the Israelites he is addressing. He is using that term to mean their ancestors. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “your ancestors”
1:3	d4e9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	and your sons to their sons, and their sons to the generation after	1	Joel is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “and let your sons recount it to their sons, and let their sons recount it to the generation after”
1:3	f7g5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	to your sons, and your sons to their sons, and their sons	1	Here the masculine term **sons** has a generic sense that includes both male and female children. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use language in your translation that is clearly inclusive of both men and women. Alternate translation: “to your children, and your children to their children, and their children”
1:3	s9t2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	Recount about it to your sons, and your sons	1	The imperative **Recount** and the word **your** are plural here because Joel is addressing the “elders” and “dwellers” mentioned in the previous verse. So use plural forms in your translation if your language marks that distinction.
1:4	h9j4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	The residue of the cutting locust, the swarming locust has eaten, and the residue of the swarming locust, the hopping locust has eaten, and the residue of the hopping locust, the destroying locust has eaten	1	Joel is not referring to specific locusts of these types. He means locusts of these types in general. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using plural forms. Alternate translation: “The residue of the cutting locusts, swarming locusts have eaten, and the residue of the swarming locusts, hopping locusts have eaten, and the residue of the hopping locusts, destroying locusts have eaten”
1:4	m9p2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litany	The residue of the cutting locust, the swarming locust has eaten, and the residue of the swarming locust, the hopping locust has eaten, and the residue of the hopping locust, the destroying locust has eaten	1	See the discussion in the General Introduction to Joel of the litany form and how you might format this verse in your translation to show that Joel is using it.
1:4	r2s6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	The residue of the cutting locust, the swarming locust has eaten, and the residue of the swarming locust, the hopping locust has eaten, and the residue of the hopping locust, the destroying locust has eaten	1	The terms **cutting**, **swarming**, **hopping**, and **destroying** describe different kinds of locusts. Interpreters are not certain specifically what kinds of locusts these were. You may wish to use more general expressions in your translation. Alternate translation: “The residue of one kind of locust, another kind of locust has eaten, and the residue of that kind of locust, yet another kind of locust has eaten, and the residue of that kind of locust, still another kind of locust has eaten”
1:5	f2g7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	Wake up, drunkards, and weep! And wail, all of the drinkers of wine, upon the sweet wine, for it has been cut off from your mouth	1	See the discussion in the General Introduction to Joel of places such as this where the speaker describes a result before giving the reason for it. If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “The sweet wine has been cut off from your mouth, so wail upon it, all of the drinkers of wine”
1:5	q7n2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	it has been cut off from your mouth	1	This is an expression that means that something is no longer available. Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation. Alternate translation: “it is no longer available for you to drink”
1:5	v7w2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	from your mouth	1	Since Joel is referring to a group of people, it might be more natural in your language to use the plural form of **mouth**. Alternate translation: “from your mouths”
1:5	w4x8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	it has been cut off from your mouth	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “the locusts have cut it off from your mouth”
1:6	j003		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	For	1	Joel is using the word **For** to introduce the reason for what he described in the previous verse. Alternate translation: “This has happened because”
1:6	z8a3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	a nation has come up against my land	1	See the discussion in the General Introduction to Joel of travel descriptions marked for change in elevation. Alternate translation: “a nation has come against my land”
1:6	j002		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	a nation	1	Joel is speaking as if this locust swarm were literally a **nation**, meaning in this context an “army.” If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “a great swarm of locusts”
1:6	u3v7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	my land	1	Since Joel and the people he is addressing live in the same land, it may be more natural in your language to say “our” instead of **my**. Alternate translation: “our land”
1:6	j7k9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	and without number	1	Joel is making an overstatement for emphasis. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the emphasis in a different way. Alternate translation: “and in huge numbers”
1:6	e5f8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	Its teeth {are} the teeth of a lion, and the fangs of a lioness {are} to it	1	Joel is describing the locusts as if they literally had the teeth of lions and lionesses. He means that they have strong teeth that can chew even the toughest of plants. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Like a lion or lioness, these locusts have strong teeth that powerfully grind and chew”
1:6	r35y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	Its teeth {are} the teeth of a lion,\nand the fangs of a lioness {are} to it	1	These two phrases, **Its teeth {are} the teeth of a lion,\nand the fangs of a lioness {are} to it**, mean similar things. Joel is using repetition to emphasize the idea that the phrases express. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could combine the phrases and express the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “Its teeth are as strong and sharp as the teeth of a lion” or “Its teeth, like the teeth of a lion, can tear through anything”
1:6	q8r9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	and the fangs of a lioness {are} to it	1	Joel is using a particular possessive form here. A different kind of possessive form may be more natural in your language. Alternate translation: “and it has the fangs of a lioness”
1:7	w9x2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	It has made my vine into a desolation and my fig tree into splinters	1	Since Joel and the people he is addressing eat the same crops, it may be more natural in your language to say “our” instead of **my**. Alternate translation: “It has made our vines into a desolation and our fig trees into splinters”
1:7	g4h8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	It has made my vine into a waste	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **waste**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “It has laid waste my vine” or “It has ruined my vine”
1:7	b5c9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-reduplication	Stripping, it has stripped it	1	Joel is repeating the verb “strip” in order to intensify the idea that it expresses. If your language can repeat words for intensification, it would be appropriate to do that here in your translation. If not, your language may have another way of expressing the emphasis. Alternate translation: “It has stripped it completely”
1:7	g1h4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	thrown {it} away	1	Joel is speaking as if the locusts had literally **thrown … away** the vegetation they had finished eating. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “spit it out”
1:7	j004		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	its branches have become white	1	Joel is using the term **have become white** to mean that the branches have been stripped of their bark, by association with the way the wood underneath the bark is white in color. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “its branches have been stripped of their bark”
1:8	q5r7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	Mourn	1	The imperative **Mourn** is feminine singular because Joel is telling the community to mourn as it would as if it were a young woman whose fiancé had died. It may be more natural in your language to use a plural imperative.
1:8	h7j2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	like a virgin dressed in sackcloth for the husband of her youth	1	The point of this comparison is that just as a virgin dresses in sackcloth to express her grief, so the Israelites should mourn to express their grief. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “like a virgin dressed in sackcloth to express her grief for the husband of her youth”
1:8	g7h3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	like a virgin dressed in sackcloth	1	To wear **sackcloth**, which is clothing made of rough, uncomfortable fabric, is a symbolic action that expresses grief. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action. Alternate translation: “like a virgin dressed in sackcloth to express her grief”
1:8	y6z1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	like a virgin dressed in sackcloth	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “like a virgin who has dressed herself in sackcloth”
1:8	j005		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	the husband of her youth	1	Joel assumes that his listeners will know that by **the husband of her youth**, he means the fiancé to whom a young woman was betrothed. The word **virgin** indicates that this woman was not yet married, but in this culture, engagement was tanatmount to marriage and a fiancé was considered a **husband**. You could express this relationship with your own culture’s characteristic terms if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “the fiancé of her youth”
1:8	j2k6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	the husband of her youth	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **youth**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “the man she became engaged to while young” or “the young man to whom she was engaged”
1:9	j006		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	The grain offering and the drink offering have been cut off	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “The locusts have cut off the grain offering and the drink offering”
1:9	m5db		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	have been cut off from the house	1	The phrase **have been cut off** is an expression that means that something is no longer available. Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation. Alternate translation: “are no longer available for the house”
1:9	t9u2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	from the house of Yahweh	1	As the General Notes to this chapter discuss,  here and often in this chapter, Joel is using the word **house** to mean “temple.” Alternate translation: “from the temple of Yahweh”
1:10	j007		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	The field has been destroyed, the ground mourns, for the grain has been destroyed	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “The locusts have destroyed the field, the ground mourns, for the locusts have destroyed the grain”
1:10	k6l2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	The field has been destroyed	1	Joel is not referring to a specific **field**. He means fields in general. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using a plural form. Alternate translation: “The fields have been destroyed”
1:10	c7d9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	the ground mourns	1	Joel is speaking of **the ground** as if it were a living thing that could **mourn** because it was bare of crops. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the ground is bare”
1:10	j7k2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	the new wine dries up	1	Joel is speaking as if the **new wine** the Israelites would have gotten from this harvest had literally dried up. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the new wine disappears as if it had evaporated” or “the new wine runs out”
1:10	j008		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	the oil is made weak	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “the oil has become weak”
1:10	a6rw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	the oil is made weak	1	Here Joel is speaking of the supply of **oil** as if it had been strong and now was **weak**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the supply of oil is low” or “the oil runs out”
1:11	m8n5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	the field	1	Joel is not referring to a specific **field**. He means fields in general. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using a plural form. Alternate translation: “the fields”
1:12	p3q7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	The vine has dried up and the fig tree has been made weak. The pomegranate tree, also the palm tree and the apple tree	1	Joel is not referring to a specific **vine**, **fig tree**, **pomegranate tree**, **palm tree**, or **apple tree**. He is talking about these kinds of trees in general. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using plural forms. Alternate translation: “The vines have dried up and the fig trees have been made weak. The pomegranate trees, also the palm trees and the apple trees”
1:12	j009		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	has been made weak	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “has become weak”
1:12	kiyn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor		1	Here Joel is speaking of **the fig tree** as if it had been strong and now was **weak**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the fig tree is withered” or “the fig tree is dying”
1:12	m3n5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	all of the trees of the field have dried up	1	Joel is making an overstatement for emphasis. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the emphasis in a different way. Alternate translation: “trees of the field of every kind have dried up”
1:12	l3m6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	joy has dried up from the sons of man	1	Joel is speaking of **joy** as if it were a liquid that had literally **dried up**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “people no longer feel joyful”
1:12	h2j8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	the sons of man	1	Here the masculine terms **sons** and **man** have a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use language in your translation that is clearly inclusive of both men and women. Alternate translation: “human beings”
1:13	j010		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	Dress	1	Joel assumes that his listeners will know that by **Dress**, he means “Dress in sackcloth.” You could say that explicitly if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “Dress in sackcloth”
1:13	i9j5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	lodge in sackcloth	1	To **lodge in sackcloth** is a symbolic action that expresses deep mourning and repentance. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action. Alternate translation: “spend the night wearing sackcloth to show your deep sorrow and repentance”
1:13	j011		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	the grain offering and the drink offering have been withheld	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “the locusts have taken away the grain offering and the drink offering”
1:13	y5z8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	my God	1	Since Joel and the people he is addressing worship the same God, it may be more natural in your language to say “our” instead of **my**. Languages that mark the distinction should use the inclusive form of “our.” Alternate translation: “our God”
1:13	a1b4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	your God	1	Since Joel and the people he is addressing worship the same God, it may be more natural in your language to say “our” instead of **your**. Languages that mark the distinction should use the inclusive form of “our.” Alternate translation: “our God”
1:14	k2l7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	Consecrate a fast	1	A **fast** is a time of going without eating. In this context, not eating would be a symbolic action that expressed sorrow for the sins that had caused Yahweh to punish the Israelites. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action. Alternate translation: “Consecrate a fast to show your sorrow for your sin”
1:14	c7d2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	your God	1	Since Joel and the people he is addressing worship the same God, it may be more natural in your language to say “our” instead of **your**. Languages that mark the distinction should use the inclusive form of “our.” Alternate translation: “our God”
1:15	f9g3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	Alas for the day	1	Joel is using this phrase as an exclamation to express a strong feeling. There may be an equivalent phrase in your language that you can use in your translation to convey this strong feeling. If not, you could say what Joel was feeling. Alternate translation: “Oh, what a terrible day!” or “I am very distressed about this day”
1:15	j013		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	Alas for the day	1	Joel is using the term **day** to mean this particular time of trouble, by association with the way a day is a specific period of time. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Alas for this time”
1:15	j014		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	the day of Yahweh	1	Joel is using the term **day** to mean the time when Yahweh will judge and punish his enemies, by association with the way days make up specific periods of time. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the time when Yahweh will judge and punish his enemies”
1:15	l9m3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	and as destruction it will come from Shaddai	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **destruction**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “when Shaddai will destroy many things”
1:15	j012		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Shaddai	1	The word **Shaddai** is another name for God. Some versions choose to translate the name as “The Almighty,” as in the UST.
1:16	s7t2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	Has not food been cut off before our eyes, joy and gladness from the house of our God?	1	Joel is using the question form for emphasis. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “Food has been cut off before our eyes, and joy and gladness from the house of our God!”

2:intro	j2gp				0	# Joel 2 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n2:1–11 Joel depicts the locust swarm as an army and the attack as the “day of Yahweh”\n2:12–17 Joel and Yahweh call the people of Judah to repentance\n2:18–27 Yahweh promises to have mercy on his people and restore them\n2:28–32 Yahweh says that in the future he will pour out his Spirit\n\nThe ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than its usual text because it is poetry.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### “Face” meaning “in front of”\n\nSeveral times in this chapter (2:3, 2:6, 2:10, 2:11, 2:31), phrases with the word **face** mean “in front of” or “before,” by association with the way people can see what is in front of or before their faces. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])\n\n## Textual Issues in This Chapter\n\nIn 2:7, the traditional Hebrew text reads “they do not pledge their paths.” The ULT follows that reading. Some ancient versions suggest that the original reading may have been “they do not turn from their paths.” If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of the ULT.\n\nIn 2:17, the traditional Hebrew text reads “for the nations to rule over them.” The ULT follows that reading. The consonantal text also permits the reading “for them to become a byword to the nations.” Several modern versions of the Bible follow that reading. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of the ULT.
2:1	j020		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	Blow the shofar in Zion, and shout on the mountain of my holiness	1	Joel assumes that his listeners will know that he wants them to do the things he describes in order to sound an alarm. You could say that explicitly if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “Blow the shofar in Zion, and shout on the mountain of my holiness in order to sound an alarm”
2:1	h3j7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	the shofar	1	A **shofar** is a trumpet made from a ram’s horn. If your readers would not be familiar with what a shofar is, in your translation you could use the name of a similar thing that your readers would recognize, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “a trumpet” or “a ram’s horn”
2:1	gpe1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun		1	The phrase **the shofar** refers to shofars in general, not to any particular shofar. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a more natural expression. Alternate translation: “a shofar” or “shofars”

2:1	j021		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	tremble	1	Joel assumes that his listeners will know that by **tremble**, he means to tremble in fear or awe. You could say that explicitly if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “tremble in fear” or “tremble in awe”

2:2	n8p3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	darkness and gloom	1	The terms **darkness** and **gloom** mean similar things. Joel is using the two terms together for emphasis.

2:2	k4m9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	Like the dawn being spread upon the mountains	1	The point of this comparison is that just as the dawn spreads steadily and inexorably across the mountains, so the army of locusts spreads steadily and inexorably across the land. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “Like the dawn spreading steadily and inexorably upon the mountains”
2:2	j025		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	Like the dawn being spread upon the mountains	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

2:2	p8q2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	Like it there has not been from antiquity, and after it there will not be again to years of generation and generation	1	Joel is making an overstatement for emphasis. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the emphasis in a different way. Alternate translation: “It is worse than anything that has happened in living memory, and nothing like it will happen again for many generations”
2:2	x3m9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	to years of generation and generation	1	This is an expression that means “for a very long time.” Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation. Alternate translation: “for many generations to come”
2:3	j026		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	A fire is devouring to its face, and behind it a flame is burning	1	Joel is speaking of the locusts’ destruction as if it were literally a **fire** consuming everything in front of it and leaving **burning** land behind. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “The locusts eat up the vegetation in front of them as if they were a fire consuming it, and after they have passed, the land looks as if a flame has burned it”
2:3	e3f9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	A fire is devouring to its face, and behind it a flame is burning. To its face the land is like the garden of Eden, but behind it {is} a wilderness of desolation, and indeed {there} is no escape from it	1	The pronouns **its** and **it** refer to the locust swarm, described in the previous verse as a “people,” that is, an “army.” It may be more natural in your language to use plural pronouns. Alternate translation: “A fire is devouring in front of them, and behind them a flame is burning. In front of them the land is like the garden of Eden, but behind them is a wilderness of desolation, and indeed there is no escape from them”
2:3	x1y5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	A fire is devouring to its face	1	See the discussion in the General Notes to this chapter of how several phrases with the word **face** mean “in front of.” Alternate translation: “A fire is devouring in front of it”
2:3	n6p3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	To its face the land is like the garden of Eden	1	The point of this comparison is that just as the garden of Eden was very lush, so the land of Israel ahead of the locust invasion is lush. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “To its face the land is lush, like the garden of Eden”
2:3	q1r4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	{is} a wilderness of desolation	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **desolation**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “is a desolate wilderness”
2:3	r6s4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	and indeed {there} is no escape from it	1	Joel is making an overstatement for emphasis. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the emphasis in a different way. Alternate translation: “and indeed it is extremely difficult to escape from it”
2:3	s8t2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	{there} is no escape from it	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **escape**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “no one can escape from it”
2:4	q8r5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	Like the appearance of horses {is} its appearance	1	The point of this comparison is that just like war horses, the locusts appear to be strong and fearless. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “Like the appearance of strong fearless war horses is their appearance”
2:4	g5h1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	{is} its appearance	1	Since the locust swarm is described in verse 2 as a “people” or “army,” it may be more natural in your language to use a plural pronoun. Alternate translation: “is their appearance”
2:4	s1t7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	and like steeds, thus they run	1	The point of this comparison is that just as galloping steeds travel very quickly and seem to be flying as they are running, so the locusts travels quickly as it flies. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “and like galloping steeds that seem almost to be flying, thus they fly across the land”
2:5	u3v9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	Like the sound of chariots, they leap on the tops of the hills	1	The point of this comparison is that just as chariots make a loud, rumbling noise, so the locusts make a loud noise as they move across the land.

2:5	j027		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	like a mighty people arrayed {for} war	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “like a mighty people who have arrayed themselves for war”
2:5	y7z4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	like a mighty people arrayed {for} war	1	The point of this comparison is that just as a mighty army gives a loud shout once it is arrayed for war, so the locusts are making a loud and terrifying noise. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “making a loud, terrifying sound as a mighty people does when it is arrayed for war”
2:5	w5x2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	like the sound of a flame of fire devouring stubble	1	The point of this comparison is that just as a fire makes a crackling sound as it quickly consumes dry stubble, so the locusts make a similar sound as they quickly consume the vegetation. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “making a crackling sound like a flame of fire devouring stubble”
2:6	j028		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	writhe	1	Joel assumes that his listeners will know that by **writhe**, he means to writhe in agony or fear. You could say that explicitly if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “writhe in agony” or “writhe in fear”
2:6	j029		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	gather beauty	1	Joel is using the term **beauty** to mean paleness, by association with the way pale skin was considered beautiful in that culture. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “become pale”
2:7	b9c6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	They run like warriors	1	The point of this comparison is that the locusts rush forward irresistibly, just as warriors do. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “They rush forward irresistibly like warriors”
2:7	d1e8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	like men of war, they climb the wall	1	The point of this comparison is that just as men of war skillfully scale walls in battle, so the locusts surmount obstacles without difficulty. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “like men of war they swarm over walls without difficulty”
2:7	s1t2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	like men of war	1	Joel is using this possessive form to describe **men** who take part in **war**. Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation. Alternate translation: “warriors”
2:7	v8w5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	the wall	1	Joel is not referring to a specific **wall**. He means walls in general. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using a plural form. Alternate translation: “the walls”
2:7	f5t1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	a man in his ways	1	In this context, **man** means “each one” and **ways** refers to the ways that a locust is traveling. Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation. Alternate translation: “each one in its direction” or “each one according to its pattern”
2:7	j030		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	and they do not pledge their paths	1	Joel is speaking of the locusts staying on their paths as if those paths were literally something they could give in pledge.

2:7	h7j3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	and they do not pledge their paths	1	See the discussion in the General Notes to this chapter of an alternate reading for this phrase. Alternate translation: “and they do not turn from their paths”
2:8	k8p4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	And a man does not crowd his brother	1	Here, **man** means “each one” and **brother** means “another one.” This expression describes how the locusts move in an orderly manner. Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation. Alternate translation: “And they do not crowd each other”
2:8	w2s7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	they walk, a man in his road	1	As in the previous clause, **man** means “each one” and **road** refers to the direction of travel. Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation. Alternate translation: “they move, each one in its own path”
2:8	j031		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	Among the weapons they fall, and they do not break off	1	This could mean: (1) Alternate translation: “They jump in among the weapons without breaking ranks” or (2) Alternate translation: “Even though weapons may kill some of them, the swarm keeps coming”
2:9	s5t1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litany	Upon the city they rush, on the wall they run, into the houses they climb, through the windows they enter like thieves	1	See the discussion in the General Introduction to Joel of the litany form and how you might format this verse in your translation to show that Joel is using it.
2:9	f3g5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	through the windows they enter like thieves	1	The point of this comparison is that just as thieves enter unexpectedly and undetected through windows, so the locusts get into homes in ways that people do not anticipate and so cannot prevent. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “they get into homes in unexpected ways, just as thieves sneak in through windows”
2:10	l5m7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	The earth shakes to their face, the heavens tremble	1	Joel is speaking as if the locust swarm were literally causing the **earth** to shake and the **heavens** to **tremble**. He means that they make such a loud sound and cause such vibration that it seems like this is happening. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “They make such a loud sound and cause such vibration that it is as if the earth is shaking and the heavens are trembling”
2:10	c5d9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	the sun and the moon become dark	1	Joel is speaking as if **the sun and the moon** had literally become **dark**. He means that the locust swarm is blocking their light. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the locust swarm blocks the light of the sun and moon”
2:10	e3f5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	and the stars withdraw their brightness	1	Joel is speaking of **the stars** as if they were living things that could **withdraw their brightness**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the light of the stars is no longer visible”
2:11	j034		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	his voice	1	Joel is using the term **voice** to mean Yahweh’s commands, by association with the way authorities use their voices to give commands. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “his commands”
2:11	j035		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	is his camp	1	Joel is using the term **camp** to mean Yahweh’s army, by association with the way armies stay in camps. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “is his army”
2:11	j032		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	his word	1	Joel is using the term **word** to mean Yahweh’s orders, by association with the way people use words to give orders. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “his orders”
2:11	u9v4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	For the day of Yahweh is great and very fearful, and who will endure it?	1	Joel is using the question form for emphasis. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “For the day of Yahweh is great and very terrible, and no one can endure it!”
2:11	j033		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	the day of Yahweh	1	See how you translated the same expression in [1:15](../01/15.md).
2:12	p9q3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	“Yet even now,” the declaration of Yahweh, “return to me	1	The phrase **the declaration of Yahweh** indicates that this is a direct quotation from Yahweh. You may wish to indicate that in your translation, using a natural way of introducing direct quotations in your language. Alternate translation: “Yahweh declares, ‘Yet even now, return to me”
2:12	u3v8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	return	1	The imperative **return** is plural here because Yahweh is addressing the people of Judah. For the same reason, the imperatives and the word “your” are plural in verses 13–16, in which Joel is speaking. So use plural forms in your translation if your language marks that distinction.
2:13	e7f2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	And tear your heart and not your garments	1	Joel is speaking as if people could literally tear their hearts. He is using the contrast with tearing garments, which was a literal sign of mourning, to emphasize internal repentance. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “And do not only tear your garments; repent in your hearts”
2:12	c0yn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	return to me with all of your heart	1	Here, Yahweh is speaking of people repenting of their sin as a **return** to him, and he is speaking of their **heart** to represent their thoughts and motives. You may have a similar way to talk about these things, or you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “sincerely repent of disobeying me in your thoughts and motives”
2:12	x9y4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	your heart	1	Since Yahweh is referring to a group of people, it might be more natural in your language to use the plural form of **heart**. Alternate translation: “your hearts”
2:13	j036		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	And tear your heart and not your garments, and return to Yahweh your God	1	Some versions end the quotation that begins in verse 12 after this sentence, instead of at the end of verse 12. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to follow the quotation boundaries that it has. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the same boundaries as the ULT.
2:13	rvjd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	long of nostrils	1	Here, **long of nostrils** is an idiom meaning that the person is slow to get angry. If this phrase does not have that meaning in your language, use an idiom from your language that does have that meaning or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “long-tempered” or “slow to become angry”
2:13	u6v9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	and great of kindness	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **kindness**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “and very kind”
2:14	w1x6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	Who knows? He may turn and relent and leave a blessing after him, a grain offering and a drink offering for Yahweh your God	1	Joel is using the question form for emphasis. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “For all anyone knows, he may turn and relent and leave a blessing after him, a grain offering and a drink offering for Yahweh your God”
2:14	j037		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	He may turn and relent	1	The terms **turn** and **relent** mean similar things. Joel is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “He may indeed change his mind”
2:14	w3x7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	and leave a blessing	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **blessing**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “and leave something to bless you”
2:14	j9k6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	your God	1	Since Joel and the people he is addressing worship the same God, it may be more natural in your language to say “our” instead of **your**. Languages that mark the distinction should use the inclusive form of “our.” Alternate translation: “our God”
2:16	g7h8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	assemble the elders, gather the children and the ones sucking the breasts	1	Joel is speaking of two things in order to mean them and everything in between. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “assemble people of all ages”
2:15	zn50		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	a fast	1	Joel assumes that his readers will understand that the purpose of **a fast** was to show repentance for sin. You could include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “a fast to show your repentance”   
2:15	hrux		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	consecrate a fast, call an assembly	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could mention calling the assembly and then telling the people to fast. Alternate translation: “call an assembly, consecrate a fast”
2:16	j038		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	May the bridegroom come out from his chamber and the bride from her room	1	Joel means implicitly that while newlyweds are ordinarily excused from public duties, this is an exceptional circumstance that calls for even their attendance. Alternate translation: “Even newly married men and women should come to the assembly under these exceptional circumstances.”
2:17	i9j1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	between the porch and the altar	1	Joel is speaking of these two things that are at the far extremes of the courtyard of the temple in order to refer to them and to everything in between them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “throughout the entire court of the priests”
2:17	y9z4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	and do not give your inheritance to reproach	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **reproach**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “and do not let other nations reproach your inheritance”
2:17	g1h8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	your inheritance	1	Joel is speaking of the Israelites as if they were literally something that Yahweh had inherited. Joel means that the Israelites are the people whom Yahweh has chosen. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the people whom you have chosen”
2:17	k5m1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	for the nations to rule over them	1	See the discussion in the General Notes to this chapter of an alternate reading for this phrase. Alternate translation: “for the nations to use a proverb against them” or “for them to become a byword to the nations”
2:17	t3u7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	Why should they say among the peoples, ‘Where {is} their God?’	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “Why should the peoples ask where our God is?”
2:17	s4t9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	Why should they say	1	Here, **they** is an indefinite pronoun that refers to people in general. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this with a different expression that does not use an indefinite pronoun. Alternate translation: “Why should it be said”
2:17	j039		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	Why should they say among the peoples	1	Joel is using the question form for emphasis. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “Do not allow the peoples to say“
2:17	d3nn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	Where {is} their God?	1	This example of mockery is also using the question form for emphasis. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “Their God does not care about them“ or “Their God must be far away!”
2:18	g26p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture	Then Yahweh was jealous for his land, and he had pity on his people	1	Joel is using the past tense to describe something that is going to happen in the future, after the people repent. He may be doing this to show that the event will certainly happen. Alternatively, there may have been a gap of time between the writing of verse 17 and verse 18 and in that time, the people repented. If it would be clearer in your language, you could use the future tense in your translation of these two verses and express the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “Then Yahweh will be jealous for his land, and he will have pity on his people”
2:18	g5h7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	for his land	1	Joel is using the term **land** by association to mean the people living on the land. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “for his people”
2:19	nu7z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture	And Yahweh answered and said	1	Joel continues using the past tense here to describe something that is going to happen in the future, after the people repent. Alternatively, the people already repented and so Joel tells Yahweh's response here. If you chose to use the future tense in verse 18, then you should also do so here. Alternate translation: “Then Yahweh will answer and say”
2:19	a1b2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	And Yahweh answered and said	1	This phrase expresses a single idea by using two words connected with **and**. The word **answered** tells for what purpose Yahweh **said** this. Alternate translation: “And Yahweh replied”
2:19	g6h2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	Behold me, sending to you grain and new wine and oil	1	This verse begins a direct quotation from Yahweh. You may wish to indicate that in your translation, using a natural way of introducing direct quotations in your language. Alternate translation: “saying, ‘Behold me, sending to you grain and new wine and oil”
2:19	j6r3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	Behold me sending	1	The expression **Behold me** doing something means “I am going to do” what is described. Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation. Alternate translation: “I am going to send”
2:19	l3m8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	with it	1	Yahweh is using the pronoun **it** to refer to what he will send to the Israelites. But since he lists **grain**, **wine**, and **oil**, it may be more natural in your language to use a plural pronoun. Alternate translation: “of them”
2:19	b5c1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	and I will no longer make you a reproach among the nations	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **reproach**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “and I will no longer make the nations reproach you”
2:20	j1k3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	the northerner	1	Yahweh is using the term **northerner** to refer to an invading army of some kind, by association with the direction from which invasions often came. It seems that this term is purposely vague, so that it can refer to the current locust invasion as well as to a future military invasion on “the day of Yahweh” (verse 11). If possible, use a term that could refer to both. Alternate translation: “the invader”
2:20	d7e3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	a land of dryness and desolation	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **dryness** and **desolation**, you could express the same ideas in another way. Alternate translation: “a dry and desolate land”
2:20	w1x5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	a land of dryness and desolation	1	The terms **dryness** and **desolation** mean similar things. Yahweh is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “a completely barren land”
2:20	j040		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	his face into the eastern sea and his back into the western sea	1	Yahweh is speaking of the invading army or locust swarm as if it were a living thing that had a **face** and a **back**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the invaders at the front of the group will fall into the eastern sea and die, and the invaders at the back of the group will fall into the western sea and die”
2:20	j041		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	his face into the eastern sea and his back into the western sea	1	Yahweh is speaking to the Judeans from the perspective of their own culture and location. By **eastern sea**, he means the Dead Sea, and by **western sea**, he means the Mediterranean Sea. You could say that explicitly if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “his face into the Dead Sea and his back into the Mediterranean Sea”
2:20	rl56		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	And his stench will rise and his odor will rise	1	These two phrases mean the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if this might be unclear in your language, you could connect the phrases with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternatively, you could combine the phrases and express the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “And his stench will rise, yes, his odor will rise”
2:20	h9n5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	he has been great in doing	1	This expression means “he has in some way done more than would be expected.” The implication is that the locust swarm has perhaps destroyed more crops than it ordinarily would, or that the army that will invade will be more destructive than usual. Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation. Alternate translation: “it has caused excessive destruction”
2:20	y5z1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	for he has been great in doing	1	Some versions end the quotation that begins in verse 19 before this clause. Other versions end that quotation after this clause. Some other versions do not end that quotation in this verse, so that it continues through 3:8. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to follow the quotation boundaries that it has. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the same boundaries as the ULT.
2:21	q7r3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe	Do not fear, land! Be glad and rejoice	1	Joel is speaking to the **land** as if it were a person who could hear him. He is doing this to show in a strong way how he feels about what Yahweh will do for the land. Joel is actually speaking to the people who can hear him. If your readers might not understand this kind of figurative speech, you could translate what Joel is saying as if he were speaking directly to the Judeans. Alternate translation: “You Judeans should not be afraid because of what has happened to the land. Be glad and rejoice”
2:21	j042		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	Be glad and rejoice	1	The terms **glad** and **rejoice** mean similar things. Joel is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “Celebrate with great joy”
2:21	a9b2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture	Yahweh has been great in doing	1	Joel is using the past tense to describe something that is going to happen in the future in order to show that the event will certainly happen. If it would be clearer in your language, you could use the future tense. Alternate translation: “Yahweh will be great in doing”
2:21	z4m1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	Yahweh has been great in doing	1	Unlike the use in the previous verse, here this expression means “he has done more good things for us than we would have imagined.” Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation. Alternate translation: “Yahweh has done wonderful things”
2:22	s9t5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe	Do not fear, beasts of the field	1	Joel is once again speaking to the **beasts of the field** as if they were people who could hear him. He is doing this to show his Judean listeners in a strong way how he feels about what Yahweh will do for them by restoring the pastures and the trees. If your readers might not understand this kind of figurative speech, you could translate what Joel is saying as if he were speaking directly to the Judeans. Alternate translation: “You Judeans should also not be afraid of what will happen to the beasts of the field”
2:22	c3d7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture	the pastures of the wilderness have sprouted, for the tree has borne its fruit, the fig tree and the vine have yielded their strength	1	Joel is using the past tense to describe something that is going to happen in the future in order to show that the event will certainly happen. If it would be clearer in your language, you could use the future tense. Alternate translation: “the pastures of the wilderness will sprout, for the tree will bear its fruit, the fig tree and the vine will yield their strength”
2:22	x3y7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	the tree has borne its fruit, the fig tree and the vine have yielded their strength	1	Joel is not referring to a specific **tree**, **fig tree**, or **vine**. He is referring to these plants in general. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using plural forms. Alternate translation: “the trees have borne their fruit, the fig trees and the vines have yielded their strength”
2:22	l9m2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	their strength	1	Joel is using the term **strength** to mean the harvest, by association with the way the land has the capacity to produce crops. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “their harvest”
2:23	n5p2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	sons of Zion	1	Joel is speaking as if **Zion**, meaning Jerusalem, were literally the mother of the people who lived in that city. Alternate translation: “residents of Zion” or “citizens of Jerusalem”
2:23	n7p2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	your God	1	Since Joel and the people he is addressing worship the same God, it may be more natural in your language to say “our” instead of **your**. Languages that mark the distinction should use the inclusive form of “our.” Alternate translation: “our God”
2:23	e5f1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture	he has given to you the early rain for vindication and has brought down the shower to you	1	Joel is using the past tense to describe something that is going to happen in the future in order to show that the event will certainly happen. If it would be clearer in your language, you could use the future tense. Alternate translation: “he will give to you the early rain for vindication and will bring down the shower to you”
2:23	f2g8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	for vindication	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **vindication**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “to vindicate you”
2:23	z9a4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	the shower	1	Joel is not referring to a specific **shower**. He means showers in general. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using a plural form. Alternate translation: “showers”
2:23	j043		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	the early rain and the late rain	1	Joel is speaking from the perspective of his own culture and location. By **early rain**, he means the fall rains, and by **late rain**, he means the spring rains. You could say that explicitly if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “the fall rains and the spring rains”
2:23	j044		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	in the first	1	Joel is speaking from the perspective of his own culture. By **in the first**, he could mean either (1) Alternate translation: “as at first” or “as before” or (2) Alternate translation: “in the first month of the year” 
2:24	t9u7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	and the vats will overflow {with} new wine and oil	1	Joel is making an overstatement for emphasis. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the emphasis in a different way. Alternate translation: “and the vats will be very full of new wine and oil”
2:25	n4p6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	the years	1	Joel is using the term **years** by association to mean the crops produced in those years. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the crops”
2:25	q7r1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	my great army	1	Yahweh is speaking of the locust swarm as if it were literally his **army**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the great swarm”
2:26	d3e7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-reduplication	And eating, you will eat	1	Yahweh is repeating the verb “eat” in order to intensify the idea that it expresses. If your language can repeat words for intensification, it would be appropriate to do that here in your translation. If not, your language may have another way of expressing the emphasis. Alternate translation: “And you will eat abundantly”
2:26	t8u2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	the name of Yahweh your God	1	Yahweh is speaking about himself in the third person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this in the first person. Alternate translation: “my name. I am Yahweh your God”
2:26	q8r1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	the name	1	Yahweh is using the term **name** to mean character or reputation, by association with the way a name represents a person’s identity. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the character” or “the reputation”
2:26	b2c9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	who has done with you, doing wondrously	1	It might seem that the expression **who has done with you, doing wondrously** contains extra information that would be unnatural to express in your language. If so, you can shorten it. Alternate translation: “who has done wondrously with you” or “who has done wonderful things for you”
2:26	w2x5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	and forever my people will not feel shame	1	The word translated as **forever** means “to indefinite futurity.” Alternate translation: “and for as long as anyone can imagine, my people will not feel shame”
2:27	j987		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	While it is not known precisely where or when Joel prophesied, he appears to have lived in the southern kingdom of Judah before the exile or in the province of Judah (Judea) after the exile. So the term **Israel** probably does not mean the northern kingdom of Israel. It seems to be a reference to the people of Judah as Israelites. Alternate translation: “the people of Israel”	1	
2:27	y8z3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	and forever my people will not feel shame	1	The word translated as **forever** means “to indefinite futurity.” Alternate translation: “and for as long as anyone can imagine, my people will not feel shame”
2:28	j045		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	And it will happen after this	1	Yahweh is using this phrase to introduce a new event in the story that he goes on to describe. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event.
2:28	s3t8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh	1	Yahweh is speaking as if he would literally pour out his Spirit like a liquid. He means that he will give his Spirit generously. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly.

2:28	s3t7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	on all flesh	1	Yahweh is using the term **flesh** to mean people, by association with the way human bodies are made of flesh. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “on many people”
2:28	rlys		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	on all flesh	1	Yahweh says **all** here as a generalization for emphasis. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different way to express the emphasis. Alternate translation: “on very many people”
2:28	k2l3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	and your sons and your daughters will prophesy	1	Yahweh is speaking of the two major components of something in order to mean everything it includes. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “all of your children will prophesy”
2:28	m4n5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	your old men will dream dreams, your young men will see visions	1	Yahweh is speaking of two things in order to refer to them and everything in between. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “your men of all ages will see prophetic images”
2:28	j046		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	dreams	1	Joel assumes that his listeners will know that by **dreams**, he means dreams with prophetic significance. You could say that explicitly if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “dreams with prophetic significance”
2:29	o6p7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	And even on male servants and on female servants	1	Yahweh is speaking of two things in order to mean them and everything in between.

2:31	j047		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	The sun will be turned into darkness and the moon into blood	1	Yahweh is speaking as if the sun and moon would literally turn into darkness and blood. He means that they will appear as they do during eclipses. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly.

2:31	j048		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	The sun will be turned into darkness and the moon into blood	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “The sun will become darkness and the moon will become blood”
2:31	j5k2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	and the moon into blood	1	Yahweh is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “and the moon will be turned into blood”
2:31	hqlk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	to the face of the coming of the great and terrible day of Yahweh	1	Here, **to the face of** is an idiom that means “before.” If this phrase does not have that meaning in your language, you could use an idiom from your language that does have that meaning or state the meaning plainly.

2:31	v4w6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	the great and terrible day of Yahweh	1	Yahweh is speaking about himself in the third person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this in the first person. Alternate translation: “my great and terrible day”

2:32	vi9m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	And it will be	1	Yahweh is using this phrase to introduce a new or special event in the story that he goes on to describe. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new or special event. Alternate translation: “And not only that” 
2:32	j049		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	everyone who calls on the name of Yahweh will be saved	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

2:32	j050		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	on the name of Yahweh	1	Yahweh is using one aspect of Yahweh, his **name**, to represent all of Yahweh. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express this meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “on Yahweh”

2:32	a6b2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem	1	The terms **Mount Zion** and **Jerusalem** mean similar things. Yahweh is using the two terms together for emphasis.

3:intro	jcn7				0	# Joel 3 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nIn this chapter, Yahweh declares that he will judge the nations\n\nThe ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than its usual text because it is poetry.\n\n## Textual Issues in This Chapter\n\nIn 3:1, Jewish scribes instructed synagogue readers to say “restore the fortunes” when they got to the phrase in this verse that the ULT translates as “return the captivity.” That suggests that the original reading may have been “restore the fortunes.” Some modern versions follow that reading. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of the ULT.\n\nIn 3:21, the traditional Hebrew text reads “I will acquit their blood … I have not acquitted.” The ULT follows that reading. Some ancient versions suggest that the original reading may have been “I will avenge their blood … I have not avenged.” Some modern versions follow that reading. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of the ULT.
3:1	k4m8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	For behold, in those days and at that time	1	This verse begins a direct quotation from Yahweh.

3:1	y5z7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	For behold	1	Yahweh is using the term **behold** to focus his listeners’ attention on what he is about to say. Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation. Alternate translation: “Now look” or “Now listen”
3:1	c8d4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	in those days and at that time	1	The expressions **in those days** and **at that time** mean similar things. Yahweh is using the two expressions together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “when that wonderful time comes”
3:1	k9l5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	when I return the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **captivity**, you could express the same idea in another way.
