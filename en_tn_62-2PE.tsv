2PE	front	intro	mvk9			0		# Introduction to 2 Peter<br>## Part 1: General Introduction<br><br>#### Outline of the Book of 2 Peter<br><br>1. Introduction (1:1-2)<br>1. Reminder to live good lives because God has enabled us to (1:3-21)<br>1. Warning against false teachers (2:1-22)<br>1. Encouragement to prepare for the second coming of Jesus (3:1-17)<br><br>#### Who wrote the Book of 2 Peter?<br><br>The author identified himself as Simon Peter. Simon Peter was an apostle. He also wrote 1 Peter. Peter probably wrote this letter while in a prison in Rome just before he died. Peter called this letter his second letter, so we can date it after 1 Peter. He addressed the letter to the same audience as his first letter. The audience probably was Christians scattered throughout Asia Minor.<br><br>#### What is the Book of 2 Peter about?<br><br>Peter wrote this letter to encourage believers to live good lives. He warned them about false teachers who were saying Jesus was taking too long to return. He told them that Jesus was not slow in returning. Instead, God was giving people time to repent so that they would be saved.<br><br>#### How should the title of this book be translated?<br><br>Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, "2 Peter" or "Second Peter." Or they may choose a clearer title, such as "The Second Letter from Peter" or "The Second Letter Peter Wrote." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])<br><br>## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts<br><br>#### Who were the people Peter spoke against?<br><br>It is possible that the people Peter spoke against were those who would become known as Gnostics. These teachers distorted the teachings of scripture for their own gain. They lived in immoral ways and taught others to do the same.<br><br>#### What does it mean that God inspired Scripture?<br><br>The doctrine of scripture is a very important one. 2 Peter helps readers to understand that while each writer of scripture had his own distinct way of writing, God is the true author of scripture (1:20-21).<br><br>## Part 3: Important Translation Issues<br><br>##### Singular and plural "you"<br><br>In this book, the word "I" refers to Peter. Also, the word "you" is always plural and refers to Peter's audience. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])<br><br>#### What are the major issues in the text of the Book of 2 Peter?<br><br>For the following verses, some modern versions of the Bible differ from older versions. The ULT text has the modern reading and puts the older reading in a footnote. If a translation of the Bible exists in the general region, translators should consider using the reading found in those versions. If not, translators are advised to follow the modern reading.<br><br>* "to be kept in chains of lower darkness until the judgment" (2:4). Some modern versions and older versions have, "to be kept in pits of lower darkness until the judgment."<br>* "They enjoy their deceitful actions while they are feasting with you" (2:13). Some versions have, "They enjoy their actions while they are feasting with you in love feasts."<br>* "Beor" (2:15). Some other versions read, "Bosor."<br>* "The elements will be burned with fire, and the earth and the deeds in it will be revealed" (3:10). Other versions have, "The elements will be burned with fire, and the earth and the deeds in it will be burned up."<br><br>(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])<br>
2PE	01	intro	wjw5			0		# 2 Peter 01 General Notes<br>#### Structure and formatting<br><br>Peter formally introduces this letter in verses 1-2. Writers often began letters in this way in the ancient Near East.<br><br>#### Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>##### Knowledge of God<br>Having knowledge of God means to belong to him or to have a relationship with him. Here, "knowledge" is more than just mentally knowing about God. It is a knowledge that causes God to save a person and to give him grace and peace. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/know]])<br><br>##### Living godly lives<br>Peter teaches that God has given believers all that they need for living godly lives. Therefore, believers should do everything they can to obey God more and more. If believers continue to do this, then they will be effective and productive through their relationship with Jesus. However, if believers do not continue living godly lives, then it is like they have forgotten what God did through Christ to save them. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/godly]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/save]])<br><br>#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>##### The truth of Scripture<br>Peter teaches that the prophecies in Scripture were not made up by men. The Holy Spirit revealed God's message to the men who spoke them or wrote them down. Also, Peter and the other apostles did not make up the stories they told people about Jesus. They witnessed what Jesus did and heard God call Jesus his son.<br>
