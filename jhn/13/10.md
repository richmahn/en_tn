# He who is bathed has no need, except to wash his feet

Here "bathed" is a metaphor that means that God has cleansed a person spiritually. AT: "If anyone has already received God's forgiveness, he now only needs to receive cleansing from his daily sins" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Not all of you are clean

Jesus implies that the one who will betray him, Judas, has not trusted in him. Therefore God has not forgiven him of his sins. AT: "Not all of you have received God's forgiveness" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
