# Connecting Statement:

Verse 3 continues to tell us background information about what Jesus knew. The action in the story begins in verse 4. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])

# Father

This is an important title for God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])

# had given everything over into his hands

Here "his hands" is a metonym for power and authority. AT: "had given him complete power and authority over everything" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# he had come from God and was going back to God

Jesus had always been with the Father, and would return there after his work on earth was finished.

# He got up from dinner and took off his outer clothing ... began to wash the feet of the disciples

Because the region was very dusty, it was customary for the host of a dinner to provide a servant to wash the feet of the guests.
