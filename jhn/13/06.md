# Lord, are you going to wash my feet?

Peter's question shows that he is not willing for Jesus to wash his feet. AT: "Lord, it is not right for you to wash the feet of me, a sinner!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# If I do not wash you, you have no share with me

Here Jesus states two negatives to convince Peter to allow him to wash his feet. Jesus implies that Peter must let him wash his feet if he wants to continue being a disciple. AT: "If I wash you, you will always belong with me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
