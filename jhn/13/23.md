# One of his disciples, whom Jesus loved

This refers to John.

# lying down at the table

During the time of Christ, Jews would often dine together in the Greek style, in which they lay on their sides on low couches. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# Jesus' side

Lying with one's head against the side of another diner in the Greek style was considered to be the place of greatest friendship with him.

# loved

This kind of love comes from God and focuses on the good of others, even when it does not benefit oneself. This kind of love cares for others, no matter what they do.
