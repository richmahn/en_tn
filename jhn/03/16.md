# God so loved the world

Here "world" is a metonym that refers to everyone in the world. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# loved

This is the kind of love that comes from God and is focused on the good of others, even when it does not benefit oneself. God himself is love and is the source of true love.
