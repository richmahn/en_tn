# God so loved the world

Here "world" is a metonym that refers to everyone in the world. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# loved

This is the kind of love that comes from God and is focused on the good of others, even when it does not benefit oneself. God himself is love and is the source of true love.

# For God did not send the Son into the world in order to condemn the world, but in order to save the world through him

These two clauses mean nearly the same thing, said twice for emphasis, first in the negative and then in the positive. Some languages may indicate emphasis in a different way. AT: God's real reason for sending his Son into the world was to save it" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])

# to condemn

"to punish." Usually "punish" implies that the person who has been punished is then accepted by God. When a person is condemned, he is punished but never accepted by God.

# Son of God

This is an important title for Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
