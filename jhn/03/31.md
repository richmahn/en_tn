## translationNotes

* John the Baptist continues speaking.
* **He who comes from above is above all** - John is speaking about Jesus. AT: "He who comes from heaven rules over everything" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
* **He who is of the earth is from the earth and speaks of earthly things** - John is contrasting himself with Jesus. John does not mean that since he is born on the earth that he is evil. He means that Jesus is greater than he is since Jesus is from heaven and John was born on the earth. AT: "He who is born in this world is like everyone else who lives in the world and he speaks about what happens in this world" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
* **He who comes from heaven is above all** - This means the same thing as the first sentence. John repeats this for emphasis.
* **He testifies to what he has seen and heard** - John is speaking about Jesus. AT: "The one from heaven tells about what he has seen and heard in heaven"
* **no man accepts his testimony** - AT: "very few people believe him" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
* **He who has received his testimony** - "He" refers to any person. "A person who believes what Jesus"
* **has confirmed** - "proves" or "agrees"
