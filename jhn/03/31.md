# He who comes from above is above all

"He who comes from heaven is more important than anyone else"

# He who is from the earth is from the earth and speaks about the earth

John means that Jesus is greater than he is since Jesus is from heaven, and John was born on the earth. AT: "He who is born in this world is like everyone else who lives in the world and he speaks about what happens in this world" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# He who comes from heaven is above all

This means the same thing as the first sentence. John repeats this for emphasis.

# He testifies about what he has seen and heard

John is speaking about Jesus. AT: "The one from heaven tells about what he has seen and heard in heaven"

# no one accepts his testimony

Here John exaggerates to emphasize that only a few people believe Jesus. AT: "very few people believe him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# He who has received his testimony

"Anyone who believes what Jesus says"

# has confirmed

"proves" or "agrees"
