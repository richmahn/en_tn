## as Moses lifted up the serpent ##

Not a real serpent. A made-up serpent; made of bronze - a type of metal.

## in the wilderness ##

The wilderness is a dry, desert place, but here it refers specifically to the place where Moses and the  Israelites walked around for 40 years.

## As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so the Son of Man must be lifted up ##
