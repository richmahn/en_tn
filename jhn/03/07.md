# You must be born again

"You must be born from above"

# The wind blows wherever it wishes

In the source language, wind and Spirit are the same word. The speaker here refers to the wind as if it were a person. AT: "The Holy Spirit is like a wind that blows wherever it wants" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
