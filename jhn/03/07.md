Jesus continues speaking to Nicodemus.

## You must be born again ##

"You must be born from above" or "God must give you life". See notes on [John 3:3](./03.md).

## The wind blows wherever it wishes ##

There's a double meaning here. In the source language, wind and Spirit are the same word. Alternate translation: "The Holy Spirit is like a wind that blows wherever he wants." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
