## translationNotes

* Jesus continues speaking to Nicodemus.
* **You must be born again** - "You must be born from above" or "God must give you life". See notes on [[en:bible:notes:jhn:03:03]].
* **The wind blows wherever it wishes** - There's a double meaning here. In the source language, wind and Spirit are the same word. Alternate translation: "The Holy Spirit is like a wind that blows wherever he wants." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
