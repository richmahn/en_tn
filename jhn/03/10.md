# Are you a teacher of Israel, and yet you do not understand these things?

Jesus knows that Nicodemus is a teacher. He is not looking for information. Alternate translation: "You are a teacher of Israel, so I am surprised you do not understand these things!" or "You are a teacher of Israel, so you should understand these things!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
