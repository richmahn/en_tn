# Connecting Statement:

Jesus continues responding to Nicodemus.

# how will you believe if I tell you about heavenly things?

This question emphasizes the disbelief of Nicodemus. AT: "You certainly will not believe if I tell you about heavenly things!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# how will you believe if I tell you

In both places "you" is singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# heavenly things

spiritual things

# heaven

This means the place where God lives.
