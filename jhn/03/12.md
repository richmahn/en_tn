# Connecting Statement:

Jesus continues responding to Nicodemus.

# I told you ... you do not believe ... how will you believe if I tell you

In all three places "you" is plural and refers to Jews in general. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# how will you believe if I tell you about heavenly things?

This question emphasizes the disbelief of Nicodemus and the Jews. Alternate translation: "you certainly will not believe if I tell you about heavenly things!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# heavenly things

spiritual things
