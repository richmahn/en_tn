# Connecting Statement:

Jesus finishes responding to Nicodemus.

# The light has come into the world

The word "light" is a metaphor for God's truth that is revealed in Jesus. Jesus speaks of himself in the third person. If your language does not allow people to speak of themselves in the first person, you may need to specify who the light is. The "world" is a metonym for all of the people who live in the world. AT: "The one who is like a light has revealed God's truth to all people" or "I, who am like a light, have come into the world" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# men loved the darkness

Here "darkness" is a metaphor for evil. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# so that his deeds will not be exposed

This can be stated in an active form. AT: "so that the light will not show the things he does" or "so that the light does not make clear his deeds" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# plainly seen that his deeds

This can be stated in an active form. AT: "people may clearly see his deeds" or "everyone may clearly see the things he does" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
