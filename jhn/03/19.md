# Connecting Statement:

Jesus finishes responding to Nicodemus.

# The light has come into the world

The word "light" is a metaphor for God's truth that is revealed in Jesus. Jesus speaks of himself in the third person. If your language does not allow people to speak of themselves in the third person, you may need to specify who the light is. The "world" is a metonym for all of the people who live in the world. Alternate translation: "The one who is like a light has revealed God's truth to all people" or "I, who am like a light, have come into the world" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# men loved the darkness

Here "darkness" is a metaphor for evil. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
