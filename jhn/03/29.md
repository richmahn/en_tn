# Connecting Statement:

John the Baptist continues speaking.

# The bride belongs to the bridegroom

Here the "bride" and "bridegroom" are metaphors. Jesus is like the "bridegroom" and John is like the friend of the "bridegroom." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# This, then, is my joy made complete

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "So then I rejoice greatly" or "So I rejoice much" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# my joy

The word "my" refers to John the Baptist, the one who is speaking.
