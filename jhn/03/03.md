# Connecting Statement:

Jesus and Nicodemus continue talking.

# Truly, truly

See how you translated this in [John 1:51](../01/51.md).

# born again

"born from above" or "born of God"

# kingdom of God

The word "kingdom" is a metaphor for the rule of God. AT: "place where God rules" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
