# Truly, truly

See how you translated this in [John 1:51](../01/49.md).

# born again

"born from above" or "born of God"

# kingdom of God

The word "kingdom" is a metaphor for the rule of God. AT: "place where God rules" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# How can a man be born when he is old?

Nicodemus uses this question to emphasize that this cannot happen. AT: "A man certainly cannot be born again when he is old!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# He cannot enter a second time into his mother's womb and be born, can he?

Nicodemus also uses this question to emphasize his belief that a second birth is impossible. "Certainly, he cannot enter a second time into his mother's womb! (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# a second time

"again" or "twice"
