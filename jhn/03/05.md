You can translate this in the same way you did in [John 3:3](./03.md).

There are two possible meanings: 1) "baptized in water and in the Spirit" or 2) "born physically and spiritually" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# kingdom of God

The word "kingdom" is a metaphor for the rule of God in one's life. AT: "he cannot experience the rule of God in his life" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
