# John 03 General Notes #

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Light and darkness #####

The Bible often speaks of unrighteous people, people who do not do what pleases God, as if they were walking around in darkness. It speaks of light as if it were what enables those sinful people to become righteous, to understand what they are doing wrong and begin to obey God. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]])

#### Possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### "Son of Man" #####

Jesus refers to himself as the "Son of Man" in this chapter ([John 3:13](../03/13.md)). Your language may not allow people to speak of themselves as if they were speaking about someone else. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sonofman]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
