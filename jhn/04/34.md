# My food is to do the will of him who sent me and to complete his work

Here "food" is a metaphor that represents "obeying God's will." AT: "Just as food satisfies a hungry person, obeying God's will is what satisfies me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Do you not say

"Is this not one of your popular sayings"

# look up and see the fields, for they are already ripe for harvest

The words "fields" and "ripe for harvest" are metaphors. The "fields" represent the non-Jewish people or Gentiles. The words "ripe for harvest" mean that the Gentiles are ready to receive the message of Jesus, just as fields are ready to be harvested. AT: "look up and see these non-Jewish people! They are ready to accept my message, just like crops in the fields are ready for people to harvest them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# He who is harvesting receives wages and gathers fruit for everlasting life

Jesus indicates that there is a reward for those "work in his fields" and share his message. The ones who receive his message will also receive the eternal life that God offers.
