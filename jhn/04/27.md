# At that moment his disciples returned

"Just as Jesus was saying this, his disciples returned from town"

# Now they were wondering why he was speaking with a woman

It was very unusual for a Jew to speak with a woman he did not know, especially if that woman was a Samaritan.

# no one said, "What ... want?" or "Why ... her?"

Possible meanings are 1) the disciples asked both questions to Jesus or 2) "no one asked the woman, 'What ... want?' or asked Jesus, 'Why ... her?'"
