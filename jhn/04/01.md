## Now when Jesus knew ##

The word "now" here is used to mark a change of topic in the story; the story changes from John the Baptist's words in the previous verses to Jesus' actions here.

## Jesus himself was not baptizing ##

"It was not actually Jesus who was baptizing people." The word "himself" is added to emphasize Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns]])
