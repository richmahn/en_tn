## translationNotes

* **Now when Jesus knew** - The word "now" here is used to mark a change of topic in the story; the story changes from John the Baptist's words in the previous verses to Jesus' actions here.
* **Jesus himself was not baptizing** - "It was not actually Jesus who was baptizing people." The word "himself" is added to emphasize Jesus. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_rpronouns]])
