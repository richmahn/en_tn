# General Information:

John 4:1-6 gives the background to the next event, Jesus' conversation with a Samaritan woman. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])

# Connecting Statement:

A long sentence begins here.

# Now when Jesus knew that the Pharisees had heard that he was making and baptizing more disciples than John

"Now Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John. When he knew that the Pharisees had heard that he was doing this."

# Now when Jesus knew

The word "now" is used here to mark a break in the main events. Here John starts to tell a new part of the narrative.
