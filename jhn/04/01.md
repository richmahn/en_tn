# General Information:

This is the next part of the story which is about Jesus and a Samaritan woman. These verses give background information for this part of the story. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])

# Now when Jesus knew that the Pharisees had heard that he was making ... John (although ... were), he left ... Galilee

"Now Jesus was making ... John (although ... were), and the Pharisees had heard about the success he was having. He learned that the Pharisees had heard, so he left ... Galilee"

# Now when Jesus knew

The word "now" is used here to mark a break in the main events. Here John starts to tell a new part of the narrative.

# Jesus himself was not baptizing

The reflexive pronoun "himself" adds emphasis that it was not Jesus who was baptizing, but his disciples. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns]])
