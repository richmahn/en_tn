# Unless you see signs and wonders, you will not believe

"Unless ... not believe" here is a double negative. In some languages it is more natural to translate this statement in a positive form. Alternate translation: "Only if you see a miracle will you believe" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
