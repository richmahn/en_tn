# he left Judea and went back again to Galilee

You may need to rearrange the entire sentence that begins with the words "Now when Jesus" in verse 1. "Now Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John (although Jesus himself was not baptizing, but his disciples were). When he knew that the Pharisees had heard that this was happening, he left Judea and went back again to Galilee"
