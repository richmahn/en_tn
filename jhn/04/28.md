# Come, see a man who told me everything that I have ever done

The Samaritan woman exaggerates to show that she is impressed by how much Jesus knows about her. AT: "Come see a man who knows very much about me, even though I have never met him before!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# This could not be the Christ, could it?

The woman is not sure that Jesus is the Christ, so she asks a question that expects "no" for an answer, but she also asks a question instead of making a statement because she wants the people to decide for themselves.
