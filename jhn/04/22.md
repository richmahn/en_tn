# You worship what you do not know. We worship what we know

Jesus means that God revealed himself and his commands to the Jewish people, not to the Samaritans. Through the Scriptures the Jewish people know who God is better than the Samaritans.

# for salvation is from the Jews

This means that God has chosen the Jews as his special people who will tell all other people about his salvation. It does not mean the Jewish people will save others from their sins. Alternate translation: "for all people will know about God's salvation because of the Jews"

# salvation is from the Jews

Eternal salvation from sin comes from God the Father, who is Yahweh, the God of the Jews.
