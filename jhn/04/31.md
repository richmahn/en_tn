# In the meantime

"While the woman was going into town"

# the disciples were urging him

"the disciples were telling Jesus" or "the disciples were encouraging Jesus"

# I have food to eat that you do not know about

Here Jesus is not talking about literal "food," but is preparing his disciples for a spiritual lesson in [John 4:34](./34.md).

# No one has brought him anything to eat, have they?

The disciples think Jesus is talking about literal "food." They begin asking each other this question, expecting a "no" response. AT: "Surely no one brought him any food while we were in town!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
