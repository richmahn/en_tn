# Do you not say

"Is this not one of your popular sayings"

# look up and see the fields, for they are already ripe for harvest

The words "fields" and "ripe for harvest" are metaphors. The "fields" represent people. The words "ripe for harvest" mean that people are ready to receive the message of Jesus, like fields that are ready to be harvested. Alternate translation: "look up and see the the people! They are ready to believe my message, like crops in the fields that are ready for people to harvest them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
