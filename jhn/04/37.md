# Connecting Statement:

Jesus continues speaking to his disciples.

# One sows, and another harvests

The words "sows" and "harvests" are metaphors. The one who "sows" shares the message of Jesus. The one who "harvests" helps the people to receive the message of Jesus. AT: "One person plants the seeds, and another person harvests the crops." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# you have entered into their labor

"you are now joining in their work"
