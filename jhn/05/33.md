Jesus continues speaking to the Jewish leaders ([John 5:16](./16.md)).

## the testimony that I receive is not from man ##

"I do not need people's testimony"

## John was a lamp that was burning and shining ##

John displayed God's holiness in the way that a lamp shines light. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
