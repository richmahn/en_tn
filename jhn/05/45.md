Jesus continues speaking to the Jewish leaders ([John 5:16](./16.md)).

## If you do not believe his writings, how are you going to believe my words? ##

"You do not believe his writings, so you will never believe my words!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## my words? ##

"what I say?"
