# The one who accuses you is Moses ... your hopes

"Moses" is a metonym here that stands for the law itself. AT: "Moses accuses you in the Law, the very Law in which you have put your hopes" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# your hopes

"your confidence" or "your trust"

# If you do not believe his writings, how are you going to believe my words?

This remark appears in the form of a question to provide emphasis. AT: "You do not believe his writings, so you will never believe my words!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# my words

"what I say"
