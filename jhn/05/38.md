"You do not believe in the one he has sent. That is how I know that you do not have his word remaining in you"

# You do not have his word remaining in you

Jesus speaks of people living according to God's word as if they were houses and God's word were a person that lived in houses. AT: "You do not live according to his word" or "You do not obey his word" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# his word

"the message he spoke to you"
