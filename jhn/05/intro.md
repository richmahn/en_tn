# John 05 General Notes #

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Healing water #####

Many of the Jews believed that God would heal people who got into some of the pools in Jerusalem when the waters were "stirred up."

##### Testimony #####

Testimony is what one person says about another person. What a person says about himself is not as important as what other people say about that person. Jesus told the Jews that God had told them who Jesus was, so he did not need to tell them who he was. This was because God had told the writers of the Old Testament what his Messiah would do, and Jesus had done everything they had written that he would do.

##### The resurrection of life and the resurrection of judgment #####

God will make some people alive again and because he gives them his grace, they will live with him forever. But he will make some people alive again and because he will treat them justly, they will live apart from him forever.

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### The Son, the Son of God, and the Son of Man #####

Jesus refers to himself in this chapter as the "Son" ([John 5:19](./19.md)), the "Son of God" ([John 5:25](./25.md)), and the "Son of Man" ([John 5:27](./26.md)). Your language may not allow people to speak of themselves as if they were speaking about someone else. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sonofman]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
