# John 05 General Notes #

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Porticos #####
Many of the Jews believed these porticos had healing properties. This happened when the waters were "stirred up." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

##### "The resurrection of judgment" #####
This is a reference to a time after death when all of mankind will be judged. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/death]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/judge]])

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### Son, Son of God #####

Jesus refers to himself as "the Son," the "Son of Man" and the "Son of God." Some languages may struggle having a person refer to himself in the third person. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sonofman]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sonofgod]])

##### "He has testified concerning me" #####
Jesus speaks about the Old Testament testifying concerning himself. The Old Testament gives many prophecies concerning the Messiah which described Jesus before he came to earth. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/christ]])
