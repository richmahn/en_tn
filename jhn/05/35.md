# John was a lamp that was burning and shining, and you were willing to rejoice in his light for a while

Here "lamp" and "light" are metaphors. John taught the people about God and this was like a lamp shining its light into the dark. Alternate translation: "John taught you about God and this was like a lamp shining its light. And for a while what John said made you happy" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
