# you will be amazed

"you will be surprised" or "you will be shocked"

# whatever the Father is doing, the Son does these things also. For the Father loves the Son

Jesus, as the Son of God, followed and obeyed his Father's leadership on earth, because Jesus knew the Father loved him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])

# loves

The kind of love that comes from God is focused on the good of others, even when it does not benefit oneself. God himself is love and is the source of true love.
