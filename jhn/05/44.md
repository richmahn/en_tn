# How can you believe, you who accept praise ... God?

This remark appears in the form of a question in order to add emphasis. Alternate translation: "There is no way you can believe because you accept praise ... God!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# believe

This means to trust in Jesus.
