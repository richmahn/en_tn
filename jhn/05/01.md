## translationNotes

* **After this** - After he had healed the official's son ([[en:bible:notes:jhn:04:46]])
* **went up to Jerusalem** - Jerusalem is located on the top of a hill. Roads to Jerusalem went up and down smaller hills, but if your language has a different word for going up a hill than for walking on level ground, use it here.
* **pool** - a hole in the ground filled with water
* **Bethesda** - "Bethesda" means house of mercy (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
* **roofed porticos** - roofed structures with at least one wall missing attached to buildings
* **a great number** - "many"
* **verse 4** - Some early texts have this verse, but others do not. We suggest you combine verses 3 and 4 with a verse bridge (3-4) as in the ULB and UDB rather than leave and empty verse.
