# the works that the Father has given me to accomplish ... that the Father has sent me

God the Father has sent God the Son, Jesus, to earth. Jesus completes what the Father gives him to do.

# The Father who sent me has himself testified

The reflexive pronoun "himself" emphasizes that it is the Father, not someone less important, who has testified. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns]])

# Father

This is an important title for God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])

# the very works that I do, testify about me

Here Jesus says that the miracles "testify" or "tell the people" about him. AT: "What I do shows the people that God has sent me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# You do not have his word remaining in you, for you are not believing in the one whom he has sent

"You do not believe in the one he has sent. That is how I know that you do not have his word remaining in you"

# You do not have his word remaining in you

Jesus speaks of people living according to God's word as if they were houses and God's word were a person that lived in houses. AT: "You do not live according to his word" or "You do not obey his word" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs-metaphor]])

# his word

"the message he spoke to you"
