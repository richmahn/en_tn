# the works that the Father has given me to accomplish ... that the Father has sent me

God the Father has sent God the Son, Jesus, to earth. Jesus completes what the Father gives him to do.

# The Father who sent me has himself testified

The reflexive pronoun "himself" emphasizes that it is the Father, not someone less important, who has testified. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns]])

# Father

This is an important title for God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])

# the very works that I do, testify about me

Here Jesus says that the miracles "testify" or "tell the people" about him. AT: "What I do shows the people that God has sent me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# You do not have his word ... in you, for you are not believing in the one whom he has sent

"Word" here is a metonym for "message." AT: "You do not believe in the one he has sent. That is how I know that you do not have his message remaining in you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# remaining in you

"living in you"
