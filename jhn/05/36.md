Jesus continues speaking to the Jewish leaders ([John 5:16](./16.md)).

## You do not have his word remaining in you, for you are not believing in the one whom he has sent ##

"You are not believing in the one whom he has sent. That is how I know that you do not have his word remaining in you"

## remaining in you ##

"staying with you"
