# For as the Father raises the dead and gives them life ... the Son also gives life to whomever he wishes

The word "for" marks a comparison. The Son of God (God the Son) gives life just like God the Father gives life.

# Father ... Son

These are important titles that describe the relationship between God and Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])

# life

This refers to "spiritual life."

# For the Father judges no one, but he has given all judgment to the Son

The word "for" marks a comparison. The Son of God carries out judgment for God the Father. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])

# honor the Son just as ... the Father. The one who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father

God the Son must be honored and worshiped just like God the Father. If we fail to honor God the Son, then we also fail to honor God the Father. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
