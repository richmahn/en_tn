# testify about the wrong

"tell me what I said that was wrong"

# if rightly, why do you hit me?

This remark appears in the form of a question to add emphasis to what Jesus is saying. AT: "if I said only what was right, you should not be hitting me!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
