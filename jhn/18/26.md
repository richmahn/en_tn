# Did I not see you in the garden with him?

This remark appears in the form of a question to add emphasis. Here the word "him" refers to Jesus. AT: "I saw you in the olive tree grove with the man they arrested! Did I not?" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
