# Not this man, but Barabbas

This is an ellipsis. You can add the implied words. Alternate translation: "No! Do not release this man! Release Barabbas instead" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# Now Barabbas was a robber

Here John provides background information about Barabbas. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
