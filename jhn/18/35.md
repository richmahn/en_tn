# I am not a Jew, am I?

This remark appears in the form of a question so Pilate can emphasize his complete lack of interest in the cultural affairs of the Jewish people. Alternate translation: "Well I am certainly not a Jew, and I have no interest in these matters!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Your own people

"Your fellow Jews"
