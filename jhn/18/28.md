# General Information:

Here the storyline shifts back to Jesus. The soldiers and Jesus' accusers bring him to Caiaphas. Verse 28 gives us background information about why they did not enter the Praetorium. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])

# Then they led Jesus from Caiaphas

Here it is implied that they are leading Jesus from Caiaphas' house. AT: "Then they led Jesus from Caiaphas' house" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# they did not enter the government headquarters so that they would not be defiled

Pilate was not a Jew, so if the Jewish leaders entered his headquarters, they would be defiled. This would have prevented them from celebrating the Passover. You can translate the double negative in a positive form. AT: "they themselves remained outside Pilate's headquarters because Pilate was a Gentile. They did not want to become defiled" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])

# If this man was not an evildoer, we would not have given him over to you

You can translate this double negative in a positive form. AT: "This man is an evil doer, and we had to bring him to you for punishment" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])

# given him over

This phrase here means to hand over to an enemy.
