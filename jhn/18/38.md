# What is truth?

This remark appears in the form of a question to reflect Pilate's belief that no one really knows what truth is. AT: "No one can know what is true!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# the Jews

Here "Jews" is a synecdoche that refers to the Jewish leaders who opposed Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# Not this man, but Barabbas

This is an ellipsis. You can add the implied words. AT: "No! Do not release this man! Release Barabbas instead" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# Now Barabbas was a robber

Here John provides background information about Barabbas. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
