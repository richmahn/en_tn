# What is truth?

This remark appears in the form of a question to reflect Pilate's belief that no one really knows what truth is. Alternate translation: "No one can know what is true!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# the Jews

Here "Jews" is a synecdoche that refers to the Jewish leaders who opposed Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
