Here "his teaching" refers to what Jesus had been teaching the people. AT: "about his disciples and what he had been teaching the people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# I have spoken openly to the world

You may need to make explicit that the word "world" is a metonym for those people who had heard Jesus teach. Here the exaggeration "the world" emphasizes that Jesus has spoken openly. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# where all the Jews come together

Here "all the Jews" is an exaggeration that emphasizes that Jesus spoke where anyone who wanted to hear him could hear him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# Why did you ask me?

This remark appears in the form of a question to add emphasis to what Jesus is saying. AT: "You should not be asking me these questions!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
