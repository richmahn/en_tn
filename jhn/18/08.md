# General Information:

In verse 9 there is a break from the main story line as John tells us background information about Jesus fulfilling Scripture. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])

# I am

Here the word "he" is not present in the original text, but it is implied. Alternate translation: "I am he" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
