# General Information:

In verse 9 there is a break from the main storyline as John tells us background information about Jesus fulfilling Scripture. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])

# I am

Here the word "he" is not present in the original text, but it is implied. AT: "I am he" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# This was in order to fulfill the word that he said

Here "the word" refers to the words Jesus had prayed. You can translate this in an active form. AT: "This happened in order to fulfill the words that he had said when he was praying to his Father" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
