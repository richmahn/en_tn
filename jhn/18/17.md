# Are you not also one of the disciples of this man?

This appears in the form of a question to enable the servant to express her remark somewhat cautiously. AT: "You are also one of the arrested man's disciples! Are you not?" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Now the servants and the officers were standing there, and they had made a charcoal fire, for it was cold, and they were warming themselves

These were the high priest's servants and the temple guards. AT: "It was cold, so the high priest's servants and temple guards made a charcoal fire and were standing and warming themselves around it" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# Now

This word is used here to mark a break in the main storyline so John can add the information about the people who were warming themselves around the fire. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
