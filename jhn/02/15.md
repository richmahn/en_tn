# So

This word marks an event that happens because of something else that has happened first. In this case, Jesus has seen the money changers sitting in the temple.

# Stop making the house of my Father a marketplace

"Stop buying and selling things in my Father's house"

# the house of my Father

This is a phrase Jesus uses to refer to the temple.

# my Father

This is an important title that Jesus uses for God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
