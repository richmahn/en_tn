# General Information:

Verses 21 and 22 are not part of the main story line, but instead they comment on the story and tell about something that happens later. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-endofstory]])

# forty-six years ... three days

"46 years ... 3 days" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])

# you will raise it up in three days?

This remark appears in the form of a question to show that the Jewish authorities understand that Jesus wants to tear down the temple and build it again in three days. "Raise" is an idiom for "establish." AT: "you will establish it in three days?" or "you cannot possibly rebuild it in three days!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# believed

Here "believe" means to accept something or trust that it is true.

# this statement

This refers back to Jesus' statement in [John 2:19](./17.md).
