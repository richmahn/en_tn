# Now when he was in Jerusalem

The word "now" introduces us to a new event in the story.

# believed in his name

Here "name" is a metonym that represents the person of Jesus. AT: "believed in him" or "trusted in him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# the signs that he did

Miracles can also be called "signs" because they are used as evidence that God is the all-powerful one who has complete authority over the universe.
