# John 02 General Notes #

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Wine #####

The Jews drank wine at many meals and especially when they were celebrating special events. They did not believe that it was a sin to drink wine.

##### Driving out the money changers #####

Jesus drove the money changers out of the temple to show that he had authority over the temple and over all of Israel.

##### "He knew what was in man" #####

Jesus knew what other people were thinking only because he was and is the Son of Man and the Son of God.

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### "His disciples remembered" #####

John used this phrase to stop telling the main history and to tell about something that happened much later. It was right after he scolded the pigeon sellers ([John 2:16](./15.md)) that the Jewish authorities spoke to him. It was after Jesus became alive again that his disciples remembered what the prophet had written long before and that Jesus was talking about the temple of his body ([John 2:17](./17.md) and [John 2:22](./20.md)).
