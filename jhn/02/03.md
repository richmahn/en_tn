# Woman

This refers to Mary. If it is impolite for a son to call his mother "woman" in your language, use another word that is polite, or leave it out.

# why do you come to me?

This question is asked to provide emphasis. AT: "this has nothing to do with me." or "you should not tell me what to do." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# My time has not yet come

The word "time" is a metonym that represents the right occasion for Jesus to show that he is the Messiah by working miracles. AT: "It is not yet the right time for me to perform a mighty act" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
