# were sitting there

The next verse makes it clear that these people are in the temple courtyard. That area was intended for worship and not for commerce.

# sellers of oxen and sheep and pigeons

People are buying animals in the temple courtyard to sacrifice them to God.

# money changers

Jewish authorities required people who wanted to buy animals for sacrifices to exchange their money for special money from the "money changers."
