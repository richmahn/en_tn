# General Information:

Jesus finds the man whom he healed ([John 9:1-7](./01.md)) and begins to speak to him and the crowd.

# believe in

This means to "believe in Jesus," to believe that he is the Son of God, to trust him as Savior, and live in a way that honors him.

# the Son of Man

Here the reader needs to understand that Jesus was speaking as if "the Son of Man" were another person. The man who had been born blind did not realize that Jesus was speaking of himself when he spoke of "the Son of Man." You should translate so that the man does not learn that Jesus is the Son of Man until verse 37.
