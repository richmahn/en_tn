# General Information:

In verse 22 there is a break from the main story line as John provides background information about the man's parents being afraid of the Jews. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])

# they were afraid of the Jews

Here "Jews" is a synecdoche for the "Jewish leaders" who opposed Jesus. Alternate translation: "they were afraid of what the Jewish leaders might do to them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# afraid

This refers to the unpleasant feeling a person has when there is a threat of harm to oneself or others.

# would confess him to be the Christ

"would say that Jesus is the Christ"

# he would be thrown out of the synagogue

Here "be thrown out of the synagogue" is a metaphor for no longer being allowed to go into the synagogue and no longer belonging to the group of people who attend services at the synagogue. Alternate translation: "he would not be allowed to go into the synagogue" or "he would no longer belong to the synagogue" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
