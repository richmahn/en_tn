# We know that God has spoken to Moses

"We are sure that God has spoken to Moses"

# we do not know where this one is from

Here the Jewish leaders are referring to Jesus. They imply that he has no authority to call disciples. Alternate translation: "we do not know where he comes from or where he gets his authority" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
