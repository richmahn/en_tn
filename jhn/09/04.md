# We

This "We" includes both Jesus and the disciples he is talking to. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-inclusive]])

# day ... Night

Here "day" and "night" are metaphors. Jesus is comparing the time when people can do God's work to daytime, the time when people normally work, and nighttime to when they cannot do God's work. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
