# Connecting Statement:

The Jews continue to speak to the man who had been blind.

# Why do you want to hear it again?

This remark appears in the form of a question to express the man's amazement that the Jewish leaders have asked him to tell them again what happened. AT: "I am surprised that you want to hear again what happened to me!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# You do not want to become his disciples too, do you?

This remark appears in the form of a question to add irony to the man's statement. He knows that the Jewish leaders do not want to follow Jesus. Here he ridicules them. AT: "It sounds like you also want to become his disciples!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]]).
