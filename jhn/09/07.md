# wash ... washed

You may need to make explicit that Jesus wanted him to wash the mud off of his eyes in the pool and that that is what the man did. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# which is translated "Sent"

A brief break occurs here in the story line so John can explain to his readers what "Siloam" means. Alternate translation: "which means 'Sent'" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
