The implied information is that Jesus is not alone in his judgment. AT: "I am not alone in how I judge" or "I do not judge alone" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# I am with the Father

The Father and the Son judge together. AT: "the Father also judges with me" or "the Father judges as I do."
