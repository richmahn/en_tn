In verse 20 there is a break in Jesus' speaking where the author give us background information regarding where Jesus had been teaching. Some languages may require the information about the setting to be placed at the beginning of this part of the story in [John 8:12](./12.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])

# You know neither me nor my Father; if you had known me, you would have known my Father also
