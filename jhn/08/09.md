## translationNotes

* **7:53 - 8:11** - 8:11</b>  - Some early texts have these verses, but others do not. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_textvariants]])
* **one by one** - "one after another"
* **Woman, where are your accusers** - When Jesus called her "woman," he was not putting her down or making her feel small. If people would think that he was doing that, this could be translated without the word "Woman."
