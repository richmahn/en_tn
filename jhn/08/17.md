# Connecting Statement:

Jesus continues speaking to the Pharisees and other people about himself.

# Yes, and in your law

The word "Yes" shows that Jesus is adding to what he was saying before.

# it is written

This is a passive phrase. You may translate it in an active form with a personal subject. AT: "Moses wrote" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# the testimony of two men is true

The logic implied here is that one person can verify the words of another. AT: "if two men say the same thing, then people know it is true" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
