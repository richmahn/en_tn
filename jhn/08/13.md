# You bear witness about yourself

"You are just saying these things about yourself"

# your witness is not true

The Pharisees are implying that the witness of only one person is not true because it cannot be verified. AT: "you cannot be your own witness" or "what you say about yourself may not be true" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
