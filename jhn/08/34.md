# Truly, truly

See how you translated this in [John 1:51](../01/49.md).

# is the slave of sin

Here the word "slave" is a metaphor. This implies that "sin" is like a master for the one who sins. AT: "is like a slave to sin" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# in the house

Here "house" is a metonym for "family." AT: "as a permanent member of a family" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# the son remains forever

This is an ellipsis. You may translate it by including the implied words. AT: "the son is a member of the family forever" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# if the Son sets you free, you will be truly free

Only Jesus, as the Son of God, can truly set people free. AT: "if you allow me to set you free, you will truly be free."

# Son

This is an important title for Jesus, the Son of God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
