# Connecting Statement:

Jesus continues speaking to the Jews.

# my word has no place in you

Here "word" is a metonym for the "teachings" or "message" of Jesus, which the Jewish leaders do not accept. AT: "you do not accept my teachings" or "you do not allow my message to change your life" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# I say what I have seen with my Father

"I am telling you about the things I saw when I was with my Father"

# you also do what you heard from your father

The Jewish leaders do not understand that by "your father" Jesus is referring to the devil. AT: "you also continue doing what your father has told you to do."
