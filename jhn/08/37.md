# Connecting Statement:

Jesus continues speaking to the Jews.

# my word has no place in you

Here "word" is a metonym for the "teachings" or "message" of Jesus, which the Jewish leaders do not accept. AT: "you do not accept my teachings" or "you do not allow my message to change your life" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
