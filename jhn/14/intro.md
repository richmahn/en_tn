# John 14 General Notes #

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### "My Father's house" #####

Jesus used these words to speak of heaven, where God lives, not of the temple. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/heaven]]) 

##### The Holy Spirit #####

Jesus told his disciples that he would send the Holy Spirit to them. The Holy Spirit is the Comforter ([John 14:16](./15.md)) who is always with God's people to help them and to speak to God for them, He is also the Spirit of truth ([John 14:17](./15.md)) who tells God's people what is true about God so they know him better and serve him well.
