# John 14 General Notes #

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### "My Father's house" #####
This is not a reference to the temple. Instead, it is a reference to the dwelling place of God in heaven. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/heaven]]) 

##### Comforter #####
This is another name for the Holy Spirit, along with the "Spirit of Truth." He was already present in the world, but would come in a special way, to dwell in Christians, permanently. Jesus and the Holy Spirit are both God; because of this fact, it can be said that Jesus will live in Christians after his death. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/holyspirit]])
