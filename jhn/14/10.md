# Connecting Statement:

Jesus asks Philip a question and then he continues to speak to all of his disciples.

# Do you not believe ... in me?

This remark appears in the form of a question to emphasize Jesus' words to Philip. Alternate translation: "You really should believe ... in me." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Father

This is an important title for God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])

# The words that I say to you I do not speak from my own authority

"What I am telling you is not from me" or "The words I tell you are not from me"

# The words that I say to you

Here "you" is plural. Jesus is now speaking to all of his disciples.
