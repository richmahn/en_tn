# Spirit of truth

This refers to the Holy Spirit who teaches people what is true about God.

# The world cannot receive him

Here the "world" is a metonym that refers to the people who oppose God. Alternate translation: "The unbelieving people in this world will never welcome him" or "Those who oppose God will not accept him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
