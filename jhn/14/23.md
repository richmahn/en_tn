# Connecting Statement:

Jesus responds to Judas (not Iscariot).

# If anyone loves me, he will keep my word

"The one who loves me will do what I have told him to do"

# loves

This kind of love comes from God and focuses on the good of others, even when it does not benefit oneself. This kind of love cares for others, no matter what they do.

# My Father

This is an important title for God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])

# we will come to him and we will make our home with him

The Father and the Son will share life with those who obey what Jesus commands. AT: "we will come to live with him, and will have a personal relationship with him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# The word that you hear is not from me but from the Father who sent me

"The things I have told you are not things that I have decided to say on my own"

# The word

Here the "word" is a metonym for the message that Jesus brings from God. AT: "The message" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# that you hear

Here when Jesus says "you" he is speaking to all of his disciples.
