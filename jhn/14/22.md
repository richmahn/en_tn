# why is it that you will show yourself to us

Here the word "show" refers to revealing how wonderful Jesus is. AT: "Why will you reveal yourself only to us" or "Why will you only let us see how wonderful you are?"

# not to the world

Here "world" is a metonym that represents the people who oppose God. AT: "not to those who do not belong to God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
