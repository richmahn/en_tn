# I am in the Father, and the Father is in me

This is an idiom that means God the Father and Jesus have a unique relationship. Alternate translation: "I am one with the Father, and the Father is one with me" or "my Father and I are just as though we were one" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
