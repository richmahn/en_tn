# Connecting Statement:

The part of the story from the previous chapter continues. Jesus reclines at the table with his disciples and continues to speak to them.

# Do not let your heart be troubled

Here "heart" is a metonym for a person's inner being. Alternate translation: "Stop being so anxious and worried" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
