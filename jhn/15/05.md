# I am the vine, you are the branches

The "vine" is a metaphor that represents Jesus. The "branches" is a metaphor that represent those who trust in Jesus and belong to him. AT: "I am like a vine, and you are like branches that are attached to the vine" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# He who remains in me and I in him

Here Jesus implies that his followers are joined to him as he is joined to God. AT: "He who stays joined to me, as I stay joined to my Father" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# he bears much fruit

The implied metaphor here is the fruitful branch that represents the believer who pleases God. Just as a branch that is attached to the vine will bear much fruit, those who stay joined to Jesus will do many things that please God. AT: "you will bear much fruit" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
