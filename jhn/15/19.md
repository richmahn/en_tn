# If the world hates you ... therefore the world hates you

Jesus uses the term "world" in these verses as a metonym to refer to the people who do not belong to God and are opposed to him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# love

This refers to human, brotherly love or love for a friend or family member.
