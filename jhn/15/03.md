# You are already clean because of the message that I have spoken to you

The implied metaphor here is the "clean branches" that have already been "pruned." Alternate translation: "It is as if you have already been pruned and are clean branches because you have obeyed what I have taught you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# you

The word "you" throughout this passage is plural and refers to the disciples of Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
