# If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have sin, but now they have no excuse for their sin

Jesus implies here that he has shared God's message with those who do not trust him. AT: "Because I have come and told them God's message, they have no excuse when God judges them for their sins" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
