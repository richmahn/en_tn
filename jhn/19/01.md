# Connecting Statement:

The part of the story from the previous chapter continues. Jesus is standing before Pilate as he is being accused by the Jews.

# Then Pilate took Jesus and whipped him

Pilate himself did not whip Jesus. Here "Pilate" is a synecdoche for the soldiers that Pilate ordered to whip Jesus. AT: "Then Pilate ordered his soldiers to whip Jesus" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
