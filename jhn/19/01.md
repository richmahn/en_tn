# Connecting Statement:

The part of the story from the previous chapter continues. Jesus is standing before Pilate as he is being accused by the Jews.

# Then Pilate took Jesus and whipped him

Pilate himself did not whip Jesus. Here "Pilate" is a synecdoche for the soldiers that Pilate ordered to whip Jesus. AT: "Then Pilate ordered his soldiers to whip Jesus" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# Hail, King of the Jews

The greeting "Hail" with a raised hand was only used to greet Caesar. As the soldiers use the crown of thorns and the purple robe to mock Jesus, it is ironic that they do not recognize that he is indeed a king. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])
