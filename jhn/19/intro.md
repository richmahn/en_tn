# John 19 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations of the Old Testament. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 19:24, which is a quotation from the Old Testament.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### "Purple garment" #####
The color purple was a sign of royalty in the ancient Near East. Jesus was mockingly dressed to look like a king.

##### "You are not Caesar's friend" #####
Pilate did not want to sentence Jesus to death, but the Jews forced him. They did this to make it seem as if allowing Jesus to live would betray the Roman government.

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter ####

##### Sarcasm #####
The following phrases are intended to be taken sarcastically: "Hail, King of the Jews," "Should I crucify your king?" and "Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews." Sarcasm is the use of irony to insult someone. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### Gabbatha, Golgotha #####
These are two Hebrew words. After translating the meanings of these words ("The Pavement" and "The Place of a Skull"), the author transliterates their sounds by substituting the Hebrew letters with Greek letters. The translator should do the same thing but transliterate them using letters of the target language.
