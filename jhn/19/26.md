# the disciple whom he loved

This is John, the writer of this Gospel.

# Woman, see, your son

Here the word "son" is a metaphor. Jesus wants his disciple, John, to be like a son to his mother. Alternate translation: "Woman, here is the man who will act like a son to you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
