# I find no guilt in him

Pilate states this twice to say he does not believe Jesus is not guilty of any crime. He does not want to punish him. AT: "I see no reason to punish him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# crown of thorns ... purple garment

The crown and the purple robe are things only kings wear. The soldiers dressed Jesus in this manner to mock him. See [John 19:2](./01.md).
