# If anyone hears my words but does not keep them, I do not judge him; for I have not come to judge the world, but to save the world

Here "to judge the world" implies condemnation. Jesus did not come to condemn people. Alternate translation: "If anyone hears my teaching and rejects it, I do not condemn him. I have not come to condemn people. Instead, I have come to save those who trust in me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
