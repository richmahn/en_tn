# The light will still be with you for a short amount of time. Walk while you have the light, so that darkness does not overtake you. He who walks in the darkness does not know where he is going

Here "light" is a metaphor for Jesus' teachings which reveal the truth of God. To "walk in darkness" is a metaphor that means to live without God's truth. AT: "My words are like a light to you, to help you understand how to live as God wants you to. I will not be with you much longer. You need to follow my instructions while I am still with you. If you reject my words, it will be like walking in darkness and you cannot see where you are going" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
