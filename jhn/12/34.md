## translationNotes

* ** Jesus then said to them, "Yet a little while longer is the light among you. Walk while you have the light, so that darkness does not overtake you. He who walks in the darkness does not know where he is going." -  ** - ** AT: "Jesus then spoke to them this parable: 'My words are like a light to you, to help you understand how to live as God wants you to. I will not be with you much longer. You need to follow my instructions while I am still with you. If you reject my words, it will be as if darkness suddenly falls on you and you can't see where you are going.'"
