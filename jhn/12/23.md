# General Information:

Jesus begins to respond to Philip and Andrew.

# The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified

Jesus implies that it is now the right time for God to honor the Son of Man through his upcoming suffering, death and resurrection. AT: "God will soon honor me when I die and rise again" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# Truly, truly, I say to you

Translate this the way your language emphasizes that what follows is important and true. See how you translated "Truly, truly" in [John 01:51](../01/49.md).

# unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies ... it will bear much fruit

Here "a grain of wheat" or "seed" is a metaphor for Jesus' death, burial and resurrection. Just as a seed is planted and grows again into a plant that will bear much fruit, so will many people trust in Jesus after he is killed, buried, and raised back to life. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
