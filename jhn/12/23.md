## Truly, truly ##

<b>Truly, truly<b></b> I say to you,, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it will remain by itself alone; but if it dies, it will bear much fruit. <b>- AT: "Pay close attention to this parable that I tell to you. My life is like a seed that is planted in the earth and dies. Unless it is planted, it remains as only one seed. But when it is planted, it changes and grows to produce a harvest of many seeds."
