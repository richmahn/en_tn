# Allow her to keep what she has for the day of my burial

Jesus implies that the woman's actions can be understood as anticipating his death and burial. Alternate translation: "Allow her to show how much she appreciates me! In this way she has prepared my body for burial" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
