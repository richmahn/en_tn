# what should I say? 'Father, save me from this hour'?

This remark appears in the form of a rhetorical question. Although Jesus desires to avoid crucifixion, he chooses to be obedient to God and to be killed. Alternate translation: "I will not pray, 'Father, save me from this hour!'" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Father

This is an important title for God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])

# this hour

Here "this hour" is a metonym that represents when Jesus would suffer and die on the cross. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
