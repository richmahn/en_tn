# what should I say? 'Father, save me from this hour'?

This remark appears in the form of a rhetorical question. Although Jesus desires to avoid crucifixion, he chooses to be obedient to God and to be killed. AT: "I will not pray, 'Father, save me from this hour!'" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Father

This is an important title for God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])

# this hour

Here "this hour" is a metonym that represents when Jesus would suffer and die on the cross. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# glorify your name

Here the word "name" is a metonym that refers to God. AT: "make your glory known" or "reveal your glory" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# a voice came from heaven

This represents God speaking. Sometimes people avoid referring directly to God because they respect him. AT: "God spoke from the heavens" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
