# glorify your name

Here the word "name" is a metonym that refers to God. AT: "make your glory known" or "reveal your glory" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# a voice came from heaven

This represents God speaking. Sometimes people avoid referring directly to God because they respect him. AT: "God spoke from the heavens" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
