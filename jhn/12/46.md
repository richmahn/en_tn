Here the "light" is a metaphor for Jesus' example. AT: "I have come to show the truth" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# may not remain in the darkness

Here "darkness" is a metaphor for living in ignorance of God's truth. AT: "may not continue to be spiritually blind" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# If anyone hears my words but does not keep them, I do not judge him; for I have not come to judge the world, but to save the world

Here "to judge the world" implies condemnation. Jesus did not come to condemn people. AT: "If anyone hears my teaching and rejects it, I do not condemn him. I have not come to condemn people. Instead, I have come to save those who trust in me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# the world

Here "the world" is a metonym that represents all of the people in the world. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
