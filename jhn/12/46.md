## translationNotes

* **I have come as a light** - Jesus again contrasts himself as the light with the darkness of the world. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
* **remain in the darkness** - "continue in a state of spiritual blindness" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **If anyone hears my words but does not keep them, I do not judge him; for I have come, not to judge the world, but to save the world.** - AT: "If anyone hears my teaching and rejects it, I have no need to condemn him. My teaching, which he has rejected, has condemned him. As for me, I have come not to condemn but to save those who believe in me." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
