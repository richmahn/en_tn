## I have come as a light ##

Jesus again contrasts himself as the light with the darkness of the world. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

## remain in the darkness ##

"continue in a state of spiritual blindness" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## If anyone hears my words but does not keep them, I do not judge him; for I have come, not to judge the world, but to save the world. ##

AT: "If anyone hears my teaching and rejects it, I have no need to condemn him. My teaching, which he has rejected, has condemned him. As for me, I have come not to condemn but to save those who believe in me." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
