# unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies ... it will bear much fruit

Here "a grain of wheat" or "seed" is a metaphor for Jesus' death, burial and resurrection. Just as a seed is planted and grows again into a plant that will bear much fruit, so will many people trust in Jesus after he is killed, buried, and raised back to life.
