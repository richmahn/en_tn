# Truly, truly

See how you translated this in [John 1:51](../01/49.md).

# eternal life which the Son of Man will give you, for God the Father has set his seal on him

God the Father has given his approval to Jesus, the Son of Man, to give eternal life to those who believe in him.

# Son of Man ... God the Father

These are important titles that describe the relationship between Jesus and God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])

# has set his seal on him

To "set a seal" on something means to place a mark on it to show to whom it belongs. This means that the Son belongs to the Father and that the Father approves of him in every way. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
