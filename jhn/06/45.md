# It is written in the prophets

This is a passive statement that can be translated in an active form. Alternate translation: "The prophets wrote" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# Everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to me

The Jews thought Jesus was the "son of Joseph" (See: [John 6:42](./42.md)), but he is the Son of God because his Father is God, not Joseph. Those who truly learn from God the Father believe in Jesus, who is God the Son.
