# Connecting Statement:

Jesus continues speaking to all those listening to him.

# Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has everlasting life

The phrases "eats my flesh" and "drinks my blood" are a metaphor for trusting Jesus. Just as people need food and drink in order to live, people need to trust Jesus in order to have eternal life.  However, the Jews did not understand this. Do not make the meaning of this metaphor more clear than Jesus did. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# raise him up

Here to raise up is an idiom for causing someone who has died to become alive again. Alternate translation: "cause him to live again" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# at the last day

"on the day when God judges everyone"

# my flesh is true food ... my blood is true drink

The phrases "true food" and "true drink" are a metaphor that means Jesus gives life to those who trust in him. However, the Jews did not understand this. Do not make the meaning of this metaphor more clear than Jesus did. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
