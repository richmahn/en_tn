# Connecting Statement:

Jesus continues speaking to all those listening to him.

# Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has everlasting life

The phrases "eats my flesh" and "drinks my blood" are metaphors. Just as one requires food and drink in order to have physical life, those who trust in Jesus will have spiritual life. AT: "whoever trusts me for their spiritual food and drink will have eternal life" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# raise him up

Here to raise up is an idiom for causing someone who has died to become alive again. AT: "cause him to live again" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# at the last day

"on the day when God judges everyone"

# my flesh is true food ... my blood is true drink

The words "true food" and "true drink" are metaphors that mean Jesus provides spiritual food and drink to those who trust in him. Receiving Jesus in faith provides everlasting life the same way food and drink nourish the physical body. AT: "I am truly spiritual food and drink" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
