Jesus continues speaking to the people ([John 6:32](./32.md)).

## I am the bread of life ##

Jesus is comparing himself to bread. Just as bread is necessary for our physical life, Jesus is necessary for our spiritual life. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## he who comes to me I will absolutely not drive away ##

"I will keep everyone who comes to me." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
