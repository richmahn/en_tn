# I am the bread of life

Through metaphor, Jesus compares himself with bread. Just as bread is necessary for our physical life, Jesus is necessary for our spiritual life. Alternate translation: "Just as food keeps you alive physically, I can give you spiritual life" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# believes in

This means to believe that Jesus is the Son of God, to trust him as Savior, and to live in a way that honors him.
