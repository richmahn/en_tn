# Connecting Statement:

Some Jews who are present begin to argue among themselves and Jesus responds to their question.

# How can this man give us his flesh to eat?

This remark appears in the form of a question to emphasize that the Jewish leaders are reacting negatively to what Jesus has said about "his flesh." AT: "There is no way that this man can give us his flesh to eat!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
