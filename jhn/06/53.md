# Truly, truly

See how you translated this in [John 1:51](../01/51.md).

# eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood

Here the phrases "eat the flesh" and "drink his blood" are a metaphor that shows how trusting in Jesus, the Son of Man, is like receiving spiritual food and drink. However, the Jews did not understand this. Do not make the meaning of this metaphor more clear than Jesus did. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# you will not have life in yourselves

"you will not receive eternal life"
