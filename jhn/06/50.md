# This is the bread

Here "bread" is a metaphor that points to Jesus who is the one who gives spiritual life just as bread sustains physical life. Alternate translation: "I am like the true bread" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# not die

"live forever." Here the word "die" refers to spiritual death.
