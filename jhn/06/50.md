Jesus continues speaking to all those listening to him ([John 6:32](./32.md)).

## This is the bread ##

See [John 6:35](./35.md).

## living bread ##

This can mean 1) the same as "the bread of life" ([John 6:35](./35.md)) or 2) "bread that is alive," as people or animals are alive, the opposite of "dead."
