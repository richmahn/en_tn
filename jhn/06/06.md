# But Jesus said this to test Philip, for he himself knew what he was going to do

John briefly stops telling about the events in the story in order to explain why Jesus asked Philip where to buy bread. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])

# for he himself knew

The reflexive pronoun "himself" makes it clear that the word "he" refers to Jesus. Jesus knew what he would do. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns]])
