# Connecting Statement:

Jesus finishes speaking to the crowd.

# For Jesus knew from the beginning who were the ones ... who it was who would betray him

Here John gives background information about what Jesus knew would happen. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])

# no one can come to me unless it is granted to him by the Father

Whoever wants to believe must come to God through the Son. Only God the Father allows people to come to Jesus.

# Father

This is an important title for God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])

# come to me

"follow me and receive eternal life"
