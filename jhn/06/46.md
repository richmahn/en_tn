# Connecting Statement:

Jesus now continues speaking to the crowd and the Jewish leaders.

# Truly, truly

See how you translated this in [John 1:51](../01/49.md).

# Not that anyone has seen the Father, except he who is from God

Although no human who is alive on earth has seen God the Father, Jesus, the Son of God, has seen the Father.

# Father

This is an important title for God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])

# he who believes has eternal life

God gives "eternal life" to those who trust in Jesus, the Son of God.
