## translationNotes

* **Now** - This word is used here to mark a break in the main storyline.
* **(Now the Passover, the feast of the Jews, was near.)** - John briefly stops telling about the events in the story in order to give background information about when the events happened. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]])
* **(Now Jesus said this to test Philip, for he himself knew what he was going to do.)** - John briefly stops telling about the events in the story in order to explain why Jesus asked Philip where to buy bread. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]])
* **for he himself knew** - The word "himself" here makes it clear that the word "he" refers to Jesus. Jesus knew what he would do. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_rpronouns]])
