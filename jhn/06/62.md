Jesus continues speaking to all those listening to him ([John 6:32](./32.md)).

## what if you should see the Son of Man ascending to where he was before? ##

"Perhaps you will believe my message if you see me, the one who came from heaven, ascending there to where I was before!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## words ##

"message." Possible meanings: 1) his words in [John 6:32](./32.md) or 2) everything he teaches (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## are spirit, and they are life ##

These two words have very similar meanings. AT: "What I have told you brings spiritual life" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
