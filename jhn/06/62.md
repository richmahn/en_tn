# Then what if you should see the Son of Man going up to where he was before?

Jesus offers this remark in the form of a question to emphasize that his disciples will see other things that are also hard to understand. AT: "Then you will not know what to think when you see me, the Son of Man, going up into heaven!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
