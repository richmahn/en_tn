# no longer walked with him

Jesus went from one place to another by walking, so it is literally true that they did not walk where and when he walked, but the reader should also be able to understand that this metaphor indicates that they no longer wanted to hear what he had to say. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs-metaphor]])

# his disciples

Here "his disciples" refers to the general group of people who followed Jesus.
