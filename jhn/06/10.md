# sit down

"lie down"

# Now there was a lot of grass in the place

John briefly stops telling about the events in the story in order to give background information about the place where this event happens. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])

# So the men sat down, about five thousand in number

While the crowd probably included women and children ([John 6:4-5](./04.md)), here John is counting only the men.
