# Connecting Statement:

Some of the disciples ask a question and Jesus responds, as he continues speaking to the crowd.

# who can accept it?

This remark appears in the form of a question to emphasize that the disciples have difficulty understanding what Jesus has said. Alternate translation: "no one can accept it!" or "it is too hard to understand!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
