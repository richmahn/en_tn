# my flesh is true food ... my blood is true drink

The phrases "true food" and "true drink" are a metaphor that means Jesus gives life to those who trust in him. However, the Jews did not understand this. Do not make the meaning of this metaphor more clear than Jesus did. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
