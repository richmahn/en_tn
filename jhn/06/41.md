# Connecting Statement:

The Jewish leaders interrupt Jesus as he is speaking to the crowd.

# grumbled

talked unhappily

# I am the bread

Just as bread is necessary for our physical life, Jesus is necessary for our spiritual life. See how you translated this in [John 6:35](./35.md). Alternate translation: "I am the one who is like true bread" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
