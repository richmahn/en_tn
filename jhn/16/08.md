* **regarding righteousness, because I am going to the Father, and you will see me no more;** - "He will tell people that because I am going back to my Father, and you will no longer see me, you will know that I am the one who was truly righteous."
* **the prince of this world** - Satan, the ruler of the corrupt things in the world. You should translate "the prince of this world" in the same manner as you did in [[en:bible:notes:jhn:12:30]])
