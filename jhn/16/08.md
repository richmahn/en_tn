## regarding righteousness, because I am going to the Father, and you will see me no more; ##

"He will tell people that because I am going back to my Father, and you will no longer see me, you will know that I am the one who was truly righteous."

## the prince of this world ##

Satan, the ruler of the corrupt things in the world. You should translate "the prince of this world" in the same manner as you did in [John 12:30](../12/30.md))
