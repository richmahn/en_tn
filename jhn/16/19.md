# Connecting Statement:

Jesus continues speaking to his disciples.

# Is this what you are asking yourselves, what I meant by saying, ... see me'?

Jesus uses this question so his disciples will focus on what he has just told them, so he can explain further. Alternate translation: "You are asking yourselves what I meant when I said, ... see me.'" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
