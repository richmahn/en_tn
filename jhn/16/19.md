# Connecting Statement:

Jesus continues speaking to his disciples.

# Is this what you are asking yourselves, what I meant by saying, ... see me'?

Jesus uses this question so his disciples will focus on what he has just told them, so he can explain further. AT: "You are asking yourselves what I meant when I said, ... see me.'" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Truly, truly, I say to you

Translate this the way your language emphasizes that what follows is important and true. See how you translated this in [John 1:51](../01/49.md).

# but the world will be glad

Here the "world" is a metonym for the people who oppose God. AT: "but the people who oppose God will be glad" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# but your sorrow will be turned into joy

You can translate this in an active form. AT: "but your sadness will turn into joy" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
