# Connecting Statement:

The part of the story from the previous chapter continues. Jesus reclines at the table with his disciples and continues to speak to them.

# you will not fall away

Here the phrase "fall away" implies to stop putting one's trust in Jesus. You can translate this in an active form. Alternate translation: "you will not stop trusting in me because of the difficulties you must face" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
