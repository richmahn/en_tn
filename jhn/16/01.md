# Connecting Statement:

The part of the story from the previous chapter continues. Jesus reclines at the table with his disciples and continues to speak to them.

# you will not fall away

Here the phrase "fall away" implies to stop putting one's trust in Jesus. You can translate this in an active form. AT: "so that you would not stop trusting in me because of the difficulties you must face." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# the hour is coming when everyone who kills you will think that he is offering a service to God

"it will someday happen that a person will kill you and think he is doing something good for God."
