# the Father himself loves you because you have loved me

When a person loves Jesus, the Son, they also love the Father, because the Father and Son are one.

# I came from the Father ... I am leaving the world and I am going to the Father

After his death and resurrection, Jesus will return to God the Father.

# I came from the Father ... going to the Father

Here "Father" is an important title for God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
