# about judgment, because the ruler of this world has been judged

"God will hold them accountable and will punish them for their sins, just as he will punish Satan, the one who rules this world"

# the ruler of this world

Here "ruler" refers to Satan. See how you translated this in [John 12:31](../12/31.md). AT: "Satan who rules this world"
