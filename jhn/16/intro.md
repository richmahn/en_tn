# John 16 General Notes #

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Comforter #####
This is another name for the Holy Spirit, who is also called the "Spirit of truth." He was already present in the world, but would come in a special way, to dwell in Christians, permanently. Jesus and the Holy Spirit are both God; because of this fact, it can be said that Jesus will live in Christians after his death. This is one of the reasons why it is "better for you that I go away." (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/holyspirit]])

##### "The hour is coming" #####
This is a phrase that can also be translated as "the time is coming." Jesus refers to the time after his death as this coming hour. When used, it can be seen as a prophecy. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]])

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter ####

##### Metaphor #####
Jesus compares his death to the pains of a woman giving birth. It is through pain that new life comes. It is doubtful that the audience would have understood the metaphor when it was spoken. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
