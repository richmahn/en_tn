# John 17 General Notes

#### Structure and formatting

This chapter forms one long prayer.

#### Special concepts in this chapter

##### Glory

Scripture often speaks of God's glory as a great, brilliant light. When people see this light, they are afraid. In this chapter Jesus asks God to show his followers his true glory ([John 17:1](../../jhn/17/01.md)).

##### Jesus is eternal

Jesus existed before God created the world ([John 17:5](../../jhn/17/05.md)). John wrote about this in [John 1:1](../../jhn/01/01.md).

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter

##### Prayer

Jesus is God's one and only Son ([John 3:16](../../jhn/03/16.md)), so he could pray differently from the way other people pray. He used many words that sounded like commands. Your translation should make Jesus sound like a son speaking with love and respect to his father and telling him what the father needs to do so that the father will be happy.
