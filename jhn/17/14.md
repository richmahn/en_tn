# I have given them your word

"I have spoken your message to them"

# the world ... because they are not of the world ... I am not of the world

Here "the "world" is a metonym that refers to the people who oppose God. AT: "The people who oppose you have hated my followers because they do not belong to those who do not believe, just as I do not belong to them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
