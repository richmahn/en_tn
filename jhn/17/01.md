# he lifted up his eyes to the heavens

This is an idiom that means to look upward. Alternate translation: "he looked up to the sky" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# heavens

This refers to the sky.

# Father ... glorify your Son so that the Son will glorify you

Jesus asks God the Father to honor him so that he can give honor to God.

# Father ... Son

These are important titles that describe the relationship between God and Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])

# the hour has come

Here the word "hour" is a metonym that refers to the time for Jesus to suffer and die. Alternate translation: "it is time for me to suffer and die" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
