# Jesus answered them, "I have shown you many good works from the Father

Jesus performed the miracles by the power of God. The word "Father" is an important title for God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])

# For which of those works are you stoning me?

This question uses irony. Jesus knows the Jewish leaders do not want to stone him because he has done good works. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])

# The Jews answered him

The word "Jews" is a synecdoche that represents the Jewish leaders who opposed Jesus. AT: "The Jewish opponents replied" or "The Jewish leaders answered him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
