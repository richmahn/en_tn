# does not come if he would not steal

This is a double negative. In some languages it is more natural to use a positive statement. AT: "comes only to steal" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])

# steal and kill and destroy

Here the implied metaphor is "sheep," which represents God's people. AT: "steal and kill and destroy the sheep" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# so that they will have life

The word "they" refers to the sheep. "Life" refers to eternal life. AT: "so that they will really live, lacking nothing"
