# The Father knows me, and I know the Father

God the Father and God the Son know each other unlike anyone else knows them. "Father" is an important title for God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])

# I lay down my life for the sheep

This is a mild way for Jesus to say that he will die to protect his sheep. Alternate translation: "I die for the sheep" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
