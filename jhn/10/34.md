# Is it not written ... gods"'?

This remark appears in the form of a question to add emphasis. AT: "You should already know that it is written in your law that I said, 'you are gods.'" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# You are gods

Here Jesus quotes a scripture where God calls his followers "gods," perhaps because he has chosen them to represent him on earth.

# the word of God came

This idiom is used to explain that God gave a message to someone. AT: "Yahweh gave his message" or "Yawheh spoke a message" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# the scripture cannot be broken

Possible meanings are 1) "no one can change the scripture" or 2) "the scripture will always be true."

# do you say to him whom the Father set apart and sent into the world, 'You are blaspheming,' because I said, 'I am the Son of God'?

Jesus used this question to rebuke his opponents for saying that he was blaspheming when he called himself "the Son of God." AT: "you should not say to the very one whom the Father set apart to send into the world, 'You are blaspheming,' when I say that I am the Son of God!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# You are blaspheming

"You are insulting God." Jesus' opponents understood that when said that he is the Son of God, he was implying that he is equal with God.

# Father ... Son of God

These are important titles that describe the relationship between God and Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
