# Is it not written ... gods"'?

This remark appears in the form of a question to add emphasis. AT: "You should already know that it is written in your law that I said, 'you are gods.'" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# You are gods

Here Jesus quotes a scripture where God calls his followers "gods," perhaps because he has chosen them to represent him on earth.
