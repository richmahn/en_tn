# this parable

This is an illustration from the work of shepherds, using metaphors. The "shepherd" is a metaphor for Jesus. The "sheep" represent those who follow Jesus, and the "strangers" are the Jewish leaders, including the Pharisees, who try to deceive the people. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
