# do you say to him whom the Father set apart and sent into the world, 'You are blaspheming,' because I said, 'I am the Son of God'?

Jesus used this question to rebuke his opponents for saying that he was blaspheming when he called himself "the Son of God." AT: "you should not say to the very one whom the Father set apart to send into the world, 'You are blaspheming,' when I say that I am the Son of God!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# You are blaspheming

"You are insulting God." Jesus' opponents understood that when said that he is the Son of God, he was implying that he is equal with God.

# Father ... Son of God

These are important titles that describe the relationship between God and Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
