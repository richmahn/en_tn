## Festival of the Dedication ##

This is an eight day winter holiday Jews use to remember a miracle where God made a small amount of oil remain lit in a lampstand until they got more oil eight days later. The lampstand was lit to dedicate the Jewish temple to God. To dedicate something is to promise to use it for a certain purpose.
