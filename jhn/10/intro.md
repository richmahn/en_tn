# John 10 General Notes #

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Sheep #####
Sheep is a common image used to refer to people. In this passage, it specifically refers to people who believe in Jesus and follow him. The Pharisees are likewise compared to wolves coming to steal and destroy the sheep.

##### Blasphemy #####
If someone falsely claims to be God, then it is considered blasphemy. In the law of Moses, the punishment for blasphemy was stoning to death. They did not believe Jesus, so they took up stones to kill him. Jesus was not guilty of blasphemy because he is God. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/blasphemy]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]])

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter ####

##### Sheepfold #####
The illustration used here involves the place where sheep are kept. There would have been a door or gate that the shepherd would have normally entered into the sheepfold. The sheep immediately recognize him. On the other hand, a robber would have entered into the sheepfold through another way where he may not be caught. The sheep would likely run from the thief because they did not recognize him. Jesus uses this as a metaphor for his ministry. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

##### "I lay down my life that I may take it again" #####
Although this is not set apart in any way, it is certainly a prophecy concerning Jesus' coming death. It emphasizes that he willingly died for the sins of man. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])
