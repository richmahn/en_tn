Jesus continues talking to the crowd.

## I lay down my life that I may take it again ##

This is a mild way for Jesus to say he will die and then bring himself back to life. Alternate translation: "I allow myself to die in order that I may bring myself back to life" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
