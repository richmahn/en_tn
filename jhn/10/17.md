## translationNotes

* Jesus continues talking to the crowd.
* **I lay down my life that I may take it again** - This is a mild way for Jesus to say he will die and then bring himself back to life. Alternate translation: "I allow myself to die in order that I may bring myself back to life" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
