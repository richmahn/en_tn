* **I am the door of the sheep** - "I am the way the sheep enter into the sheepfold" Jesus is saying he is the one who allows entry. The word "sheep" is used to refer to God's people.(See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **All who came before me are thieves and robbers** - <b>All who came before me are thieves and robbers<b>- The phrase "All who came before me" refers to the other teachers who had taught before Jesus. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]]) Jesus calls them "thieves and robbers" because their teachings were false and they were trying to lead God's people while not understanding the truth.
