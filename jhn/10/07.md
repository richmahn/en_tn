# Connecting Statement:

Jesus begins to explain the meaning of the parables he had spoken.

# Truly, truly

See how you translated this in [John 1:51](../01/51.md).

# I am the gate of the sheep

Here "gate" is a metaphor that means Jesus provides access into the sheepfold where God's people dwell in his presence. Alternate translation: "I am like the gate that the sheep use to enter into the sheepfold" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
