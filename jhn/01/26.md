# General Information:

Verse 28 tells us background information about the setting of the story. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])

# who comes after me

You may need to make explicit what he will do when he has come. AT: "who will preach to you after I am gone" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# me, the strap of whose sandal I am not worthy to untie

Untying sandals was the work of a slave or servant. These words are a metaphor for the most unpleasant work of a servant. AT: "me, whom I am not worthy to serve in even the most unpleasant way" or "me. I am not even worthy to untie the strap of his sandal" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
