# General Information:

Verse 28 tells us background information about the setting of the story. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])

# the one who comes after me

"he will preach to you after I am gone"

# the strap of whose sandal I am not worthy to untie

The task of "untying his sandals," which is the work of a slave or servant, is a metaphor. John is saying that he does not deserve to do even the most unpleasant work of a servant for Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
