# In him was life

Here "life" is a metaphor for causing everything to live. AT: "The one who is called the Word is the one who caused everything to live" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# life

Here use a general term for "life." If you must be more specific, translate as "spiritual life."

# the life was the light of men

"Light" is a metaphor that means God's revelation. AT: "he revealed to us the truth about God as a light reveals what is in the darkness" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not overcome it

Just as darkness cannot put out light, evil people have never prevented the one who is like a light from revealing God's truth. AT: "God's revelation shows the truth even in the midst of evil people, and evil people have not been able to stop it." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
