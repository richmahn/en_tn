## In him was life ##

"This one who is called the Word - he is the one who caused everything to live." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## that life was the light of all mankind ##

"he revealed to us the truth about God as a light reveals what is in the darkness."

## The light shines in the darkness and the darkness did not extinguish it ##

"People do not want him to reveal that what they do is evil, just like darkness is evil, but just like darkness cannot put out light, evil people have never prevented the one who is like a light from revealing God's truth."
