## translationNotes

* **He freely stated, and did not deny** - The second phrase says in negative terms the same thing that the first phrase says in positive terms. This emphasizes that John was telling the truth. AT: "He told them the truth freely" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
* **What are you then?** - "What then is the case, if you are not the Messiah?" or "What then is going on?" or "What then are you doing?"
