# He was in the world, and the world was made through him, and the world did not know him

"Even though he was in this world, and God created everything through him, people still did not recognize him"

# the world did not know him

The "world" is a metonym that stands for all the people who live in the world. AT: "the people did not know who he really was" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
