# Again, the next day

This is another day. It is the second day that John saw Jesus.

# Lamb of God

This is a metaphor that represents God's perfect sacrifice. Jesus is called the "Lamb of God" because he was sacrificed to pay for people's sins. See how you translated this same phrase in [John 1:29](./29.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
