# In the beginning

This refers to the very earliest time before God created the heavens and the earth.

# the Word

"Word" here is a metonym for "Jesus." Translate as "the Word" if possible. If "Word" is feminine in your language, it could be translated as "the one who is called the Word." AT: "God's Message to mankind" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# All things were made through him

This can be translated with an active verb. AT: "God made all things through him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# without him there was not one thing made that has been made

This can be translated with an active verb. If your language does not permit double negatives, these words should communicate that the opposite of "all things were made through him" is false. AT: "God did not make anything without him" or "with him there was every thing made that has been made" or "God made with him every thing that God has made" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
