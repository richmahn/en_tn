## translationNotes

* **In the beginning** - This refers to the very earliest time before God created the heavens and the earth.
* **the Word** - This refers to Jesus. Translate as "the Word" if possible. If the "Word" is feminine in your language it could be translated as "the one who is called the Word."
* **All things were made through him** - This could be translated with an active verb: "God made all things through him." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
* **without him there was not one thing made that has been made** - "God did not make anything without him" or "God made everything with him." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]] and [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
