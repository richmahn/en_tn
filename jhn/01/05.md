# The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not overcome it

Here "light" is a metaphor for what is true and good. Here "darkness" is a metaphor what is false and evil. AT: "The truth is like a light shining into a dark place, and no one in the dark place could put out the light" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
