## translationNotes

* **full of grace** - "always acts kindly toward us in ways we do not deserve"
* **The one who comes after me** - John is speaking about Jesus. The phrase "comes after me" means that John's ministry has already started and Jesus' will start after him.
* **ranks before me** - "is greater than I am" or "is more important than I am"
* **for he was before me** - Be careful not to translate this in a way that suggests Jesus is more important just because he is older than John. Jesus is greater and more important than John because he is God the son who has always been alive and rules over everything along with God the Father.
