# Connecting Statement:

John continues to speak with the priests and Levites.

# they said to him

"the priests and Levites said to John"

# we ... us

the priests and Levites, not John (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

# He said

"John said"

# I am a voice, crying in the wilderness

John is saying that Isaiah's prophecy is about himself. The word "voice" here refers to the person who is crying out in the wilderness. AT: "I am the one calling out in the wilderness" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# Make the way of the Lord straight

Here the word "way" is used as a metaphor. AT: "Prepare yourselves for the Lord's arrival like people prepare the road for an important person to use" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
