# He confessedâ€”he did not deny, but confessed

The phrase "he did not deny" says in negative terms the same thing that "He confessed" says in positive terms. This emphasizes that John was telling the truth and was strongly stating that he was not the Christ. Your language may have a different way of doing this.
