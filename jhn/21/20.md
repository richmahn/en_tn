# the disciple whom Jesus loved

John refers to himself in this way throughout the book, rather than mentioning his name.

# loved

This is the kind of love that comes from God and always desires the good of others, even when it does not benefit oneself. This kind of love cares for others, no matter what they do.

# at the dinner

This is a reference to the Last Supper. (See: [John Chapter 13](../13/01.md))
