# Jesus said to him

"Jesus said to Peter"

# If I want him to stay

Here "him" refers to the "disciple whom Jesus loved" in [John 21:20](./20.md).

# I come

This refers to Jesus' second coming, his return to earth from heaven.

# what is that to you?

This remark appears in the form of a question to express a mild rebuke. AT: "that is not your concern." or "you should not be concerned about that." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
