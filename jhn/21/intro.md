##### The metaphor of sheep #####

Before Jesus died, he spoke of himself taking care of his people as if he were a good shepherd taking care of sheep ([John 10:11](../10/11.md)). After he became alive again, he told Peter that Peter would be the one who took care of Jesus' sheep. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
