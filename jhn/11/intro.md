# John 11 General Notes #

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Light and darkness #####

The Bible often speaks of unrighteous people, people who do not do what pleases God, as if they were walking around in darkness. It speaks of light as if it were what enables those sinful people to become righteous, to understand what they are doing wrong and begin to obey God. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]])

##### Passover #####

After Jesus made Lazarus become alive again, the Jewish leaders were trying hard to kill him, so he started traveling from place to place in secret. Now the Pharisees knew that he would probably come to Jerusalem for the Passover because God had commanded all Jewish men to celebrate the Passover in Jerusalem, so they planned to catch him and kill him then. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/passover]])

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter ####

##### "One man dies for the people" #####

The law of Moses commanded the priests to kill animals so that God would forgive the people's sins. The high priest Caiaphas said, "It is better for you that one man dies for the people than that the whole nation perishes" ([John 10:50](./49.md)). He said this because he loved his "place" and "nation" ([John 10:48](./47.md)) more than he loved the God who had made Lazarus become alive again. He wanted Jesus to die so that the Romans would not destroy the temple and Jerusalem, but God wanted Jesus to die so that he could forgive all of his people's sins.

##### Hypothetical situation #####

When Martha said, "If you had been here, my brother would not have died," she was speaking of a situation that could have happened but did not happen. Jesus had not come, and her brother had died.
