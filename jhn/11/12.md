# General Information:

In verse 13 there is a break in the story line as John comments on the disciples' misunderstanding about what Jesus meant when he said Lazarus was asleep. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])

# if he has fallen asleep

The disciples misunderstand Jesus to mean that Lazarus is resting and will recover.

# Then Jesus said to them plainly

"So Jesus told them in words that they could understand"
