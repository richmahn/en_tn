# General Information:

Because so many people have told them that Lazarus is alive again, the chief priests and Pharisees gather the Jewish council for a meeting.

# Then the chief priests

"Then the leaders among the priests"

# Then

The author uses this word to tell the reader that the events that begin in verse 47 are a result of the events of [John 11:45-46](./45.md).

# What will we do?

It is implied here that the council members are talking about Jesus. AT: "What are we going to do about Jesus?" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# all will believe in him

The Jewish leaders were afraid that the people would try to make Jesus their king. AT: "everyone will trust in him and rebel against Rome" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# the Romans will come

This is a synecdoche for the Roman army. AT: "the Roman army will come" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# take away both our place and our nation

"destroy both our temple and our nation"
