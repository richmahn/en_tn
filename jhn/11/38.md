# Now it was a cave, and a stone lay against it

John pauses the story briefly to describe the tomb where the people had buried Lazarus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])

# Martha, the sister of Lazarus

Martha and Mary were older sisters of Lazarus. AT: "Martha, the older sister of Lazarus" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# by this time the body will be decaying

"by this time there will be a bad smell" or "the body is already stinking"

# Did I not say to you that, if you believed, you would see the glory of God?

This remark appears in the form of a question to add emphasis to the point that God is about to do something wonderful. AT: "I told you that if you trusted me, you would see what God can do!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
