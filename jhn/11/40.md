# Did I not say to you that, if you believed, you would see the glory of God?

This remark appears in the form of a question to add emphasis to the point that God is about to do something wonderful. AT: "I told you that if you trusted me, you would see what God can do!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
