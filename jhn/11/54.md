# General Information:

Jesus leaves Bethany and goes to Ephraim. In verse 55 the story shifts to telling about what many of the Jews are doing now that Passover is near.

# walk openly among the Jews

Here "Jews" is a synecdoche for the Jewish leaders and "walk openly" is a metaphor for "live where everyone could see him." Alternate translation: "live where all the Jews could see him" or "walk openly among the Jewish leaders who opposed him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the country

the rural area outside cities where fewer people live

# There he stayed with the disciples

Jesus and his disciples stayed in Ephraim for a while. Alternate translation: "There he stayed with his disciples for a short period of time" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
