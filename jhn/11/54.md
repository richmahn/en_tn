the rural area outside cities where fewer people live

# There he stayed with the disciples

Jesus and his disciples stayed in Ephraim for a while. AT: "There he stayed with his disciples for a short period of time" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# went up to Jerusalem

The phrase "went up" is used here because Jerusalem is higher in elevation than the surrounding areas.
