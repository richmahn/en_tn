# fell down at his feet

Mary lay down or knelt at the feet of Jesus to show respect.

# my brother would not have died

Lazarus was Mary's younger brother. See how you translated this in [John 11:21](../11/21.md). Alternate translation: "my younger brother would still be alive" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
