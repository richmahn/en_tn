# a certain man among them

This is a way to introduce a new character to the story. If you have a way to do this in your language, you can use it here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])

# You know nothing

This is an exaggeration that Caiaphas uses to insult his hearers. AT: "You do not understand what is happening!" or "You speak as though you know nothing!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# than that the whole nation perishes

Caiaphas implies that the Roman army would kill all of the people of the Jewish nation if Jesus is allowed to live and cause a rebellion. The word "nation" here is a synecdoche that represents all of the Jewish people. AT: "than that the Romans kill all the people of our nation" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
