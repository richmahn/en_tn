## translationNotes

* **You know nothing at all** - Caiaphas does not use this phrase because he thinks they know nothing but because they haven't thought of the same solution he has. Alternate translation: "You talk as if you do not know what to do." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
