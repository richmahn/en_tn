# Are there not twelve hours of light in a day?

This remark appears in the form of a question to add emphasis. AT: "You know that the day has twelve hours of light!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# If someone walks in the daytime, he will not stumble, because he sees by the light of this world

People who walk in the light of the day can see well and do not stumble. "Light" is a metaphor for "truth." Jesus is implying that people who live according to truth will be able to successfully do the things that God wants them to do" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
