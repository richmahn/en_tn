# They were looking for Jesus

The word "they" refers to the Jewish people who had traveled to Jerusalem.

# What do you think? That he will not come to the festival?

These are rhetorical questions that express a strong element of doubt that Jesus will come to the Passover Festival. The second question is an ellipsis that leaves out the words "do you think." The speakers here were wondering if Jesus would come to the festival since there was the danger of his being arrested. AT: "Jesus will probably not come to the festival. He might be afraid of getting arrested!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
