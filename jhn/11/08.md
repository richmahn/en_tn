# Rabbi, right now the Jews are trying to stone you, and you are going back there again?

This remark appears in the form of a question to emphasize that the disciples do not want Jesus to go to Jerusalem. Alternate translation: "Teacher, you surely do not want to go back there! The Jews were trying to stone you the last time you were there!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# the Jews

This is a synecdoche for the Jewish leaders who opposed Jesus. Alternate translation: "the Jewish leaders" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
