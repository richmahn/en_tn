# the other disciple

John apparently expresses his humility by referring to himself as "the other disciple," rather than including his name in this book.

# he saw and believed

When he saw that the tomb was empty, he believed that Jesus had risen from the dead. AT: "he saw these things and began to believe that Jesus had risen from the dead" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# they still did not know the scripture

Here the word "they" refers to the disciples who did not understand the scripture that said Jesus would rise again. AT: "the disciples still did not understand the scripture" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# that he should rise from the dead ones

"that said Jesus must rise from the dead"

# went back home again

The disciples continued to stay in Jerusalem. AT: "went back to where they were staying in Jerusalem" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
