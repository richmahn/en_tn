# the other disciple

John apparently expresses his humility by referring to himself as "the other disciple," rather than including his name in this book.

# he saw and believed

When he saw that the tomb was empty, he believed that Jesus had risen from the dead. AT: "he saw these things and began to believe that Jesus had risen from the dead" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
