# Do not be unbelieving, but believe

Jesus uses the double negative "Do not be unbelieving" to emphasize the words that follow, "but believe." If your language does not allow double negatives or the reader would not understand that Jesus is emphasizing the words that follow, you can leave these words untranslated. AT: "This is what is most important for you to do: you must believe" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])

# believe

Here "believe" means to trust in Jesus. AT: "put your trust in me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
