# the other disciple

John apparently shows his humility by referring to himself here as "the other disciple," rather than including his name.

# went out

John implies that these disciples were going to the tomb. Alternate translation: "rushed out to the tomb" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
