# Connecting Statement:

Jesus continues speaking to the Jews.

# Did not Moses give you the law?

This remark appears in the form of a question to add emphasis. AT: "It was Moses who gave you the law" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# keeps the law

"obeys the law"

# Why do you seek to kill me?

Jesus questions the motives of the Jewish leaders who want to kill him for breaking the law of Moses. He implies that the leaders themselves do not keep that same Law. AT: "You break the Law yourselves and yet you want to kill me!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
