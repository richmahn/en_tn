# General Information:

Jesus is in Galilee speaking to his brothers. These verses tell about when this event occurred. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])

# After these things

These words tell the reader that the writer will begin talking about a new event. "After he finished speaking with the disciples" (See: [John 6:66-71](../06/66.md)) or "Some time later"

# traveled

The reader should understand that Jesus probably walked rather than riding an animal or in a vehicle.

# the Jews were seeking to kill him

Here "the Jews" is a synecdoche for "the Jewish leaders." Alternate translation: "the Jewish leaders were making plans to kill him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
