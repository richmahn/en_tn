# For even his brothers did not believe in him

This sentence is a break from the main storyline as John tells us some background information about the brothers of Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])

# his brothers

"his younger brothers"

# My time has not yet come

The word "time" is a metonym. Jesus is implying that it is not the right time for him to bring his ministry to a close. AT: "It is not the right time for me to end my work" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# your time is always ready

"any time is good for you"

# The world cannot hate you

Here the "world" is a metonym for the people who live in the world. AT: "All the people in the world cannot hate you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# I testify about it that its works are evil

"I tell them that what they are doing is evil"
