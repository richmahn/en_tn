# General Information:

The setting of the story has changed, Jesus and his brothers are now at the festival.

# when his brothers had gone up to the festival

These "brothers" were the younger brothers of Jesus.

# he also went up

Jerusalem is at a higher elevation than Galilee where Jesus and his brothers were previously.

# not publicly but in secret

These two phrases mean the same thing. The idea is repeated for emphasis. Alternate translation: "very secretly" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
