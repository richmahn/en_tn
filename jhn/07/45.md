The officers exaggerate to show how impressed they are by what Jesus said. You may need to make explicit that the officer were not claiming to know everything that every person in all times and places had ever said. "We have never heard anyone say such amazing things as this man!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
