# General Information:

The best early texts do not have 7:53 - 8:11. The ULB has set them apart in square brackets ([ ]) to show that John probably did not include them in his original text. Translators are encouraged to translate them, to set them apart with square brackets, and to include a footnote like the one written on [John 7:53](../07/53.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
