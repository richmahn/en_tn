## 7:53 - 8:11 ##

8:11** - Some early texts do not have these verses. The ULB has set them apart in square brackets ([ ]) to show that John probably did not write them.  Translators are encouraged to translate them, to set them apart with square brackets, and to include a footnote at the end like the one written on [John 8:9](../08/09.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])

## every man ##

This refers to all the men mentioned in [John 7:45](./45.md).
