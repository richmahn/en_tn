# Do not judge according to appearance, but judge righteously

Jesus implies that the people should not decide what is right, based only on what they can see. Behind the action is a motive that cannot be seen. AT: "Stop judging people according to what you see! Be more concerned with what is right according to God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
