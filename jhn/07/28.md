# cried out

"spoke in a loud voice"

# in the temple

Jesus and the people were actually in the courtyard of the temple. AT: "in the temple courtyard" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# You both know me and know where I come from

John uses irony in this statement. The people believe that Jesus is from Nazareth. They do not know that God sent him from heaven and that he was born in Bethlehem. AT: "You all know me and you think you know where I come from" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])

# of myself

"on my own authority." See how you translated "of himself" in [John 5:19](../05/19.md).

# he who sent me is true

"God is the one who sent me and he is true"
