# his hour had not yet come

The word "hour" is a metonym that represents the right time for Jesus to be arrested, according to God's plan. AT: "it was not the right time to arrest him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# When the Christ comes, will he do more signs than what this one has done?

This remark appears in the form of a question to add emphasis. AT: "When the Christ comes, surely he will not be able to do more signs than this man has done!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# signs

This refers to the miracles that prove that Jesus is the Christ.
