# Are you also from Galilee?

The Jewish leaders know that Nicodemus is not from Galilee. They ask this question as a way of scoffing at him. AT: "You must also be one of those inferior persons from Galilee!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# Search and see

This is an ellipsis. You may wish to include the information that does not appear. AT: "Search carefully and read what is written in the Scriptures" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# no prophet comes from Galilee

This probably refers to the belief that Jesus was born in Galilee.
