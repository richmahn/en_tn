# So the Pharisees

"Because they said that, the Pharisees"

# answered them

"answered the officers"

# Have you also been deceived?

The remark appears in the form of a question to add emphasis. The Pharisees are shocked at the response of the officers. Alternate translation: "You have been deceived too!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
