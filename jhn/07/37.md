# General Information:

Some time has passed. It is now the last day of the festival and Jesus speaks to the crowd.

# great day

It is "great" because it is the last, or most important, day of the festival.

# If anyone is thirsty

Here the word "thirsty" is a metaphor that means one's great desire for the things of God, just as one "thirsts" for water. Alternate translation: "Those who desire the things of God like a thirty man desires water" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# let him come to me and drink

The word "drink" is a metaphor that means to receive the spiritual life that Jesus provides. Alternate translation: "let him come to me and quench his spiritual thirst" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
