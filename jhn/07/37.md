## translationNotes

* **Now** - The word "now" is used here to mark a break in the main storyline.
* **great day** - It is "great" because it is the last, or most-important day of the festival.
* **If anyone is thirsty** - desire for the things of God, just as one desires or "thirsts" for water. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **let him come to me and drink** - The word "him" refers to "anyone." The word "drink" here represents finding spiritual fulfillment in Christ. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **the Scripture** - "Scripture" stands for the Messianic prophecies concerning Christ. This is not a direct quote from any one Old Testament passage. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
* **flow rivers of living water** - Christ will provide relief for spiritually "thirsty" people in a great amount that flows out helping everyone around. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **living water** - This means 1) "water that gives life" or "water that causes people to live" (UDB) or 2) natural water that flows from a spring, as opposed to water that needs to be taken from a well (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]).
