# one of the Pharisees, who came to him earlier

John provides this information to remind us of who Nicodemus is. Your language may have a special way to mark background information. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])

# Does our law judge a man ... what he does?

This remark appears in the form of a question to add emphasis. This can be translated as a statement. AT: "Our Jewish law does not allow us to judge a man ... what he does!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Does our law judge a man

Here Nicodemus speaks of the law as if it were a person. If this is not natural in your language, you may translate it with a personal subject. AT: "Do we judge a man" or "we do not judge a man" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# Are you also from Galilee?

The Jewish leaders know that Nicodemus is not from Galilee. They ask this question as a way of scoffing at him. AT: "You must also be one of those inferior persons from Galilee!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# Search and see

This is an ellipsis. You may wish to include the information that does not appear. AT: "Search carefully and read what is written in the Scriptures" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# no prophet comes from Galilee

This probably refers to the belief that Jesus was born in Galilee.
