# My time has not yet come

The word "time" is a metonym. Jesus is implying that it is not the right time for him to bring his ministry to a close. AT: "It is not the right time for me to end my work" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# your time is always ready

"any time is good for you"
