LUK	front	intro	uk55			0		# Introduction to the Gospel of Luke<br><br>## Part 1: General Introduction<br><br>### Outline of the book of Luke<br><br>1. Dedication to Theophilus (1:1-4)<br>2. Prologue<br>    * The birth of John the Baptist (1:5-80)<br>   * The birth and youth of Jesus (2:1-51)<br>   * The ministry of John the Baptist (3:1-20)<br>   * The baptism, genealogy, and temptation of Jesus (3:21-4:13)<br>3. The teaching and healing ministry of Jesus in Galilee (4:14-9:50)<br>4. Jesus teaches along his journey to Jerusalem<br>    * Judgment by God, and people’s judgments about Jesus (9:51-13:21)<br>   * Who will be part of the kingdom of God (13:22-17:10)<br>   * Responding to Jesus by welcoming or rejecting him (17:11-19:27)<br>5. Jesus in Jerusalem<br>    * Jesus’ entry into Jerusalem (19:28-44)<br>   * Jesus teaches in the temple: conflict over his identity and authority (19:45-21:38)<br>   * Jesus’ death, burial, and resurrection (22:1-24:53)<br><br>### What is the Gospel of Luke about?<br><br>The Gospel of Luke is one of four books in the New Testament that describe the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. These books are called “Gospels,” which means “good news.” Their authors wrote about different aspects of who Jesus was and what he did. Luke wrote his Gospel for a person named Theophilus and dedicated it to him. Luke wrote an accurate description of the life and teachings of Jesus so that Theophilus would be certain that what he had been taught about Jesus was true. However, Luke expected that what he wrote would encourage all followers of Jesus.<br><br>### How should the title of this book be translated?<br><br>Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “The Gospel of Luke” or “The Gospel According to Luke.” Or they may choose a different title, such as “The Good News About Jesus that Luke Wrote.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])<br><br>### Who wrote the book of Luke?<br><br>This book does not give the name of its author. However, the same person who wrote this book also wrote the book of Acts, which is also dedicated to Theophilus. In parts of the book of Acts, the author uses the word “we.” This indicates that the author traveled with Paul. Most scholars think that Luke was this person traveling with Paul. Therefore, since early Christian times, most Christians have recognized Luke as the author of both the Gospel of Luke and the book of Acts.<br><br>Luke was a medical doctor. His way of writing shows that he was an educated man. He was probably a Gentile. Luke himself probably did not witness what Jesus said and did. But he tells Theophilus in his dedication that he talked to many people who did.<br><br>## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts<br><br>### The kingdom of God<br><br>“The kingdom of God” is a major concept in the Gospel of Luke. It is very rich in meaning. It includes the idea of eternal life in the presence of God, but it also includes the idea of what the earth will be like in the future when God rules everything, and the idea of life on earth right now, when and where God’s wishes are carried out fully. The unifying concept behind all of these ideas is that of God ruling and of people embracing God’s rule over their lives. Wherever the expression “the kingdom of God” occurs, translation notes will suggest communicating the idea behind the abstract noun “kingdom” with some phrase that uses the verb “rule.” UST models this approach consistently. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])<br><br>### Why does Luke write so much about the final week of Jesus’ life?<br><br>Luke wrote much about Jesus’ final week. He wanted his readers to think deeply about Jesus’ final week and his death on the cross. He wanted people to understand that Jesus willingly died on the cross so that God could forgive them for sinning against him. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])<br><br>### What are the roles of women in the Gospel of Luke?<br><br>Luke described women in a very positive way in his Gospel. For example, he often showed women being more faithful to God than most men. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faithful]])<br><br>## Part 3: Important Translation Issues<br><br>### What are the Synoptic Gospels?<br><br>The Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke are called the Synoptic Gospels because they tell the story of many of the same events. The word “synoptic” means to “see together.”<br><br>Passages are considered “parallel” when they are the same or almost the same among two or three Gospels. When translating parallel passages, translators should use the same wording and make them as similar as possible.<br><br>### Why does Jesus refer to himself as the “Son of Man”?<br><br>In the Gospels, Jesus calls himself the “Son of Man.” This is a reference to [Daniel 7:13-14](../dan/07/13.md). In that passage, there is a person who is described as like a “son of man.” That means that the person was someone who looked like a human being. God gave authority to this “son of man” to rule over the nations forever. All people will worship him forever.<br><br>Jews of Jesus’ time did not use “Son of Man” as a title for anyone. But Jesus used it for himself to help them understand who he truly was. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sonofman]])<br><br>Translating the title “Son of Man” can be difficult in many languages. Readers may misunderstand a literal translation. Translators can consider alternatives, such as “The Human One.” It may also be helpful to include a footnote to explain the title.<br><br>### Major issues in the text of the book of Luke<br><br>ULT follows the readings of the most accurate ancient manuscripts of the Bible. However, there may already be older versions of the Bible in the translators’ regions that follow the readings of other manuscripts. In the most significant cases, the General Notes to the chapters in which these differences occur will discuss them and recommend approaches. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
LUK	1	intro	f1b5			0		# Luke 1 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>1. Dedication to Theophilus (1:1-4)<br>2. The angel Gabriel announces to Zechariah that his wife Elizabeth is going to bear a son, John the Baptist (1:5-25)<br>3. The angel Gabriel announces to Mary that she is going to become the mother of Jesus (1:26-38)<br>4. Mary goes to visit Elizabeth (1:39-56)<br>5. John the Baptist is born (1:57-80)<br><br>Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. ULT does this with the poetry in Mary’s song about becoming the mother of Jesus in 1:46-55 and Zechariah’s song about the birth of his son John the Baptist in 1:68-79.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### “He will be called John”<br><br>Most people in the ancient Near East would give a child the same name as someone in their families. People were surprised that Elizabeth and Zechariah named their son John because there was no one else in their family with that name.
LUK	1	1	qhd9	figs-activepassive	περὶ τῶν πεπληροφορημένων ἐν ἡμῖν πραγμάτων	1	concerning the things that have been fulfilled among us	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “about those things that have happened among us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	1	1	hyp6	figs-exclusive	ἐν ἡμῖν	1	among us	Luke dedicates this book to a man named Theophilus. It is no longer known exactly who he was. But since Luke says in [1:4](../01/04.md) that he wants Theophilus to know that the things he has been taught are reliable, it appears that he was a follower of Jesus. So here the word **us** would include him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
LUK	1	2	hud2	figs-metonymy	οἱ…αὐτόπται…γενόμενοι	1	who … were eyewitnesses	The term **eyewitness** describes someone who saw something happen personally, “with their own eyes.” The term describes such a person figuratively by reference to something associated with sight, the eye. Alternate translation: “who … saw these things personally” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	1	2	z9dq	figs-metonymy	ὑπηρέται…τοῦ λόγου	1	servants of the word	Here, **word** figuratively describes the things that the people who brought the message conveyed by using words. Alternate translation: “servants of the message” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	1	2	l000	figs-metaphor	ὑπηρέται…τοῦ λόγου	1	servants of the word	The people who brought this message were actually serving God by doing that. But Luke describes them figuratively as **servants of the word**, as if they were serving the message from God. Alternate translation: “served God by telling people his message” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	1	3	fud1	writing-background	παρηκολουθηκότι ἄνωθεν πᾶσιν ἀκριβῶς	1	having carefully investigated everything from the beginning	Luke provides this background information to explain that he was careful to find out exactly what happened. He probably talked to different people who saw what happened to make sure that what he wrote down about these events was correct. Alternate translation: “because I have conducted careful research and interviews” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
LUK	1	3	l001	figs-youformal	σοι…κράτιστε Θεόφιλε	1	you … most excellent Theophilus	If your language has a formal form of **you** that it uses to address a superior respectfully, it would be appropriate to use that form here. There are many other places in the book of Luke where your language might use formal **you**, and these notes will not address all of them. Rather, as you translate, use formal and informal **you** in the way that would be most natural in your language. The notes will address a few cases where a careful decision should be made between the two forms. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youformal]])
LUK	1	3	nr63		κράτιστε Θεόφιλε	1	most excellent Theophilus	Luke is dedicating this work to Theophilus, and within his dedication, this is the conventional personal greeting. If it would be more customary in your language and culture, you could put this greeting in [1:1](../01/01.md) at the start of the dedication, at the very beginning of the book. Alternate translation: “To most excellent Theophilus”
LUK	1	3	vhj8		κράτιστε	1	most excellent	Luke uses the term **most excellent** to address Theophilus in a way that shows honor and respect. This may mean that Theophilus was an important government official. In your translation, it would be appropriate to use the form of address that your culture uses for people of high status. Alternate translation: “Honorable”
LUK	1	3	h7q1	translate-names	Θεόφιλε	1	Theophilus	This name means “friend of God.” It may describe this man’s character, or it may have been his actual name. Most translations treat it as a name. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	1	4	l002	figs-activepassive	ὧν κατηχήθης λόγων	1	the things that you have been taught	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who did the action. Alternate translation: “what people have taught you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	1	4	l003	figs-explicit	ὧν κατηχήθης λόγων	1	the things that you have been taught	Luke assumes that Theophilus will know that he means what he has been **taught** about Jesus. Alternate translation: “what people have taught you about Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	1	5	gb16	writing-newevent	ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις Ἡρῴδου βασιλέως τῆς Ἰουδαίας	1	In the days of Herod, king of Judea	This time reference introduces a new event. Alternate translation: “During the time when King Herod ruled over Judea” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
LUK	1	5	l004	figs-idiom	ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις	1	In the days of	Here, Luke uses the term **days** figuratively to refer to a particular period of time. Alternate translation: “During the time when” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	1	5	l005	translate-names	Ἡρῴδου	1	Herod	This is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	1	5	l006	translate-names	Ἰουδαίας	1	Judea	**Judea** is the name of a kingdom. (It was not an independent kingdom at this time. Herod ruled it as a vassal of the Roman Empire.) (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	1	5	a4q9	writing-participants	ἐγένετο…ἱερεύς τις	1	there was a certain priest	This phrase introduces a new character in a story. If your language has an expression of its own that serves this purpose, you can use it here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
LUK	1	5	l007	translate-names	Ζαχαρίας	1	Zechariah	**Zechariah** is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	1	5	l228	figs-explicit	ἐξ ἐφημερίας Ἀβιά	1	from the division of Abijah	Luke assumes that his readers will know that this expression refers one of the different groups of priests who each served in the temple for a certain number of days at a time, and that the name of the group means that Abijah was the ancestor of these priests. Alternate translation: “who belonged to the group of priests who were descended from Abijah” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	1	5	gzw1	translate-names	Ἀβιά	1	Abijah	**Abijah** is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	1	5	d3ua	figs-metaphor	γυνὴ αὐτῷ ἐκ τῶν θυγατέρων Ἀαρών	1	his wife was from the daughters of Aaron	Here, the word **daughters** figuratively means “descendants.” Alternate translation: “his wife was a descendant of Aaron” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	1	5	nnu9	figs-explicit	ἐκ τῶν θυγατέρων Ἀαρών	1	from the daughters of Aaron	This means implicitly that she, like Zechariah, was descended from the line of priests going back to Aaron, the first high priest. Alternate translation: “his wife also came from the line of priests” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	1	5	l008	translate-names	Ἐλεισάβετ	1	Elizabeth	**Elizabeth** is the name of a woman. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	1	6	uu87	figs-metaphor	ἐναντίον τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	in front of God	Luke uses this expression to mean “where God could see them.” Seeing, in turn, figuratively means attention and judgment. Alternate translation: “in God’s judgment” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	1	6	l009	figs-metaphor	πορευόμενοι ἐν πάσαις ταῖς ἐντολαῖς καὶ δικαιώμασιν τοῦ Κυρίου	1	walking … in all the commandments and statutes of the Lord	The term **walking** figuratively means “obeying.” Alternate translation: “obeying … everything that the Lord had commanded” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	1	6	csc9	figs-doublet	πάσαις ταῖς ἐντολαῖς καὶ δικαιώμασιν τοῦ Κυρίου	1	in all the commandments and statutes of the Lord	The words **commandments** and **statutes** mean similar things. Luke uses the two terms together to make a comprehensive statement. You do not need to repeat both words in your translation if that might be confusing for your readers. Alternate translation: “everything that the Lord had commanded” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
LUK	1	7	c7cj	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	καὶ	1	But	This word indicates a contrast, showing that what follows is the opposite of what would be expected. People expected that if they did what was right, God would allow them to have children. Although this couple did what was right, they did not have any children. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
LUK	1	7	l010	figs-idiom	ἀμφότεροι προβεβηκότες ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις αὐτῶν	1	they had both advanced in their days	To have moved forward or to have **advanced** means figuratively to have aged. Alternate translation: “they had both grown old” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	1	7	l011	figs-idiom	ἀμφότεροι προβεβηκότες ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις αὐτῶν	1	they had both advanced in their days	Here, Luke uses the term **days** figuratively to refer to a particular time, the lifetimes of Zechariah and Elizabeth. Alternate translation: “they had both grown old” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	1	8	jr7f	writing-newevent	ἐγένετο δὲ	1	And it happened that	This phrase marks a shift from the background information that Luke has been providing about the participants to the first event in their story. If your language has a similar expression that it uses to introduce an event, you can use it here in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
LUK	1	8	l012	grammar-connect-logic-result	ἐν τῷ ἱερατεύειν αὐτὸν, ἐν τῇ τάξει τῆς ἐφημερίας αὐτοῦ	1	in his performing as priest in the order of his division	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the results that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “because it was his group’s turn, Zechariah was serving as a priest” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
LUK	1	8	vyl8	figs-metaphor	ἐν τῷ ἱερατεύειν αὐτὸν…ἔναντι τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	in his performing as priest before God	The expression **before God**, that is, “in front of God,” means that Zechariah was offering his service as a priest in the presence of God.

LUK	1	8	wed9	writing-background	ἐν τῇ τάξει τῆς ἐφημερίας αὐτοῦ	1	in the order of his division	This is background information that explains why Zechariah was serving as a priest at this time. Alternate translation: “because it was his group’s turn to serve” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
LUK	1	9	vq5g	writing-background	κατὰ τὸ ἔθος τῆς ἱερατείας, ἔλαχε	1	according to the custom of the priesthood, he came up by lot	Luke is providing background information about how the priests selected members of their group to perform specific duties. Alternate translation: “The priests chose him in their customary way, by casting a lot” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
LUK	1	9	pa9c	translate-unknown	ἔλαχε	1	came up by lot	A **lot** was a marked stone that was thrown or rolled on the ground in order to help decide something. The priests believed that God would guide the lot and show them which priest he wanted them to choose for a particular duty. If your culture has a similar object, you can use the word for that in your language here. Alternate translation: “by casting a marked stone” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	1	9	l013	grammar-connect-logic-result	τοῦ θυμιᾶσαι, εἰσελθὼν εἰς τὸν ναὸν τοῦ Κυρίου	1	to enter into the temple of the Lord to burn incense	ULT puts these phrases in the chronological order of what Zechariah needed to do. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could put them in logical order instead. Alternate translation: “to burn incense, and so he went into the temple to do that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
LUK	1	9	ph9z	translate-unknown	τοῦ θυμιᾶσαι	1	to burn incense	The word **incense** describes a substance that gives off a sweet smell when it is burned. The priests were to burn it as an offering to God each morning and evening on a special altar inside the temple. If your language has a word for this substance, you can use it here. Alternate translation: “to burn a substance that would create a sweet smell as an offering to God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	1	10	bjl6	figs-hyperbole	πᾶν τὸ πλῆθος…τοῦ λαοῦ	1	the whole crowd of the people	This expression, if taken literally, could mean every single one of the Jews, but it is actually a generalization that Luke is using to emphasize how big this crowd was. Alternate translation: “A large number of people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
LUK	1	10	ntl8	figs-explicit	ἔξω	1	outside	This word refers implicitly to the enclosed area or courtyard that surrounded the temple. Alternate translation: “in the courtyard outside the temple building” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	1	10	uwu7	figs-metaphor	τῇ ὥρᾳ τοῦ θυμιάματος	1	at the hour of the incense offering	The word **hour** figuratively means “time.” This could mean either the morning or evening time for the incense offering. Alternate translation: “when it was time to offer the incense” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	1	11	b8b7	grammar-connect-time-simultaneous	δὲ	1	Then	This word indicates that the event it introduces took place at the same time as the event the story has just related. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could show this relationship by using a phrase such as “right at that time.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous]])
LUK	1	11	c8ss	figs-idiom	ὤφθη…αὐτῷ	1	appeared to him	When Luke says that the angel **appeared**, this does not mean that Zechariah simply saw the angel in a vision. Rather, this expression indicates that the angel was actually present with Zechariah. Alternate translation: “suddenly was there with Zechariah” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	1	12	r3aa	figs-parallelism	ἐταράχθη Ζαχαρίας…φόβος ἐπέπεσεν ἐπ’ αὐτόν	1	Zechariah was troubled … fear fell on him	These two phrases mean similar things. Luke is using them together to emphasize how afraid Zechariah was. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could combine these phrases. Alternate translation: “Zechariah became very afraid” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
LUK	1	12	d1zm	figs-explicit	ἰδών	1	when he saw him	The implication is that Zechariah was afraid because the angel appeared glorious and powerful. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. (Luke has just said that Zechariah was righteous and blameless, so it would be good not to leave your readers with the impression that he had done something wrong and was afraid that the angel was going to punish him for it.) Alternate translation: “when he saw how glorious and powerful the angel was” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	1	12	l014	figs-metaphor	φόβος ἐπέπεσεν ἐπ’ αὐτόν	1	fear fell upon him	Luke is using the expression **fell upon** figuratively to speak of fear as if it attacked and overcame Zechariah. Alternate translation: “this made him very afraid” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	1	12	sfb1	figs-personification	φόβος ἐπέπεσεν ἐπ’ αὐτόν	1	fear fell upon him	Luke describes Zechariah’s **fear** figuratively as if it were something that could actively attack and overpower him. Alternate translation: “this made him very afraid” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
LUK	1	13	ki8l	figs-imperative	μὴ φοβοῦ	1	Do not be afraid	While the angel speaks these words in the form of a command, he is actually telling Zechariah something to help and encourage him. Alternate translation: “You do not need to be afraid” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
LUK	1	13	es4l	figs-activepassive	εἰσηκούσθη ἡ δέησίς σου	1	your prayer has been heard	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who has done the action. Alternate translation: “God has heard your prayer” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	1	13	l015	figs-idiom	εἰσηκούσθη ἡ δέησίς σου	1	your prayer has been heard	This is an idiom that means that God is going to give Zechariah what he has been asking for. Alternate translation: “God is going to give you what you have been asking for” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	1	13	l016	figs-declarative	καὶ καλέσεις τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ Ἰωάννην	1	you will call his name John	The angel is using a statement as a command in order to tell Zechariah what to do. Alternate translation: “and you are to name him John” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative]])
LUK	1	13	l017	figs-idiom	καλέσεις τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ Ἰωάννην	1	call his name John	The expression **call his name** is an idiom that means to give a child a name. Alternate translation: “name him John” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	1	13	l018	translate-names	Ἰωάννην	1	John	**John** is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	1	14	n654	figs-doublet	ἔσται χαρά σοι καὶ ἀγαλλίασις	1	there will be joy and gladness to you	The words **joy** and **gladness** mean the same thing. The angel uses them together for emphasis. Alternate translation: “you will be very happy” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
LUK	1	14	q1p8	grammar-connect-logic-result	ἐπὶ τῇ γενέσει αὐτοῦ	1	at his birth	The word **at** introduces the reason why many people will rejoice. Alternate translation: “because he has been born” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
LUK	1	15	td57	grammar-connect-logic-result	ἔσται γὰρ μέγας	1	For he will be great	The word **for** introduces the reason why people will rejoice at John's birth. Alternate translation: “This will be because they will be able to tell that he is going to be a great man” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
LUK	1	15	sz79	figs-metaphor	ἔσται γὰρ μέγας ἐνώπιον τοῦ Κυρίου	1	For he will be great before the Lord	This expression means “in front of the Lord,” that is, “where the Lord can see him.” Sight, in turn, figuratively represents attention and judgment. Alternate translation: “God will consider him to be very important” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	1	15	abc2	figs-doublenegatives	οὐ μὴ πίῃ	1	he must never drink	The phrase **must never** translates two negative words in Greek. The angel uses them together to emphasize how important it is that the child not drink wine or strong drink. If your language can use two negatives together for emphasis without them cancelling each other to create a positive meaning, it would be appropriate to use that construction here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
LUK	1	15	hgb9	figs-activepassive	Πνεύματος Ἁγίου πλησθήσεται	1	he will be filled with the Holy Spirit	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “the Holy Spirit will fill him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	1	15	l019	figs-metaphor	Πνεύματος Ἁγίου πλησθήσεται	1	he will be filled with the Holy Spirit	The angel speaks figuratively as if John would be a container that the Holy Spirit would fill. He means that the Holy Spirit will empower and influence John. Be sure that in your translation, this does not sound similar to what an evil spirit might do to in taking control of a person. Alternate translation: “the Holy Spirit will empower him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

LUK	1	16	l020	figs-metaphor	πολλοὺς τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ	1	many of the sons of Israel	Here, the word **sons** figuratively means “descendants.” This expression envisions all of the Israelites as if they were their ancestor Jacob, who was also known as Israel. Alternate translation: “many of the people of Israel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	1	16	l021	translate-names	Ἰσραὴλ	1	Israel	**Israel** is the name of a man. Luke uses it many times in this book. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

LUK	1	17	p472	figs-doublet	ἐν πνεύματι καὶ δυνάμει Ἠλεία	1	in the spirit and power of Elijah	In this context, the words **spirit** and **power** mean similar things. The angel may be using them together for emphasis. Alternate translation: “with the same great power that Elijah had” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
LUK	1	17	l022	figs-hendiadys	ἐν πνεύματι καὶ δυνάμει Ἠλεία	1	in the spirit and power of Elijah	Alternatively, the angel may be expressing a single idea by using two words connected with **and.** The term **power** may tell what kind of **spirit** Elijah had. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express the meaning with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “in the powerful spirit of Elijah” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
LUK	1	17	l023	translate-names	Ἠλεία	1	Elijah	**Elijah** is the name of a man, a great prophet of Israel. It occurs several times in this book. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

Luke relates in [3:10-14](../03/10.md) how John encouraged reconciliation in a variety of different relationships. Alternate translation: “to restore broken relationships” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
LUK	1	17	l024	figs-explicit	ἐπιστρέψαι καρδίας πατέρων ἐπὶ τέκνα	1	to turn the hearts of fathers back to their children	It is assumed that readers will know that this is what the prophet Malachi had said Elijah would do before the Lord came. The implication in context is that John will fulfill this prophecy by using the same empowerment that Elijah had. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express this explicitly. Alternate translation: “to restore broken relationships, just as the prophet Malachi said Elijah would do before the Lord came” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	1	17	l025	figs-explicit	ἀπειθεῖς ἐν φρονήσει δικαίων	1	to turn … the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous	Gabriel is using the term **wisdom** in the Old Testament sense as a moral term that refers to choosing the way in life that God has shown to be best. The people who make this choice are **righteous**, meaning that God considers them to be living in the right way. Alternate translation: “to lead people who are disobeying God to choose his ways and become people who live right” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	1	17	j49j	figs-nominaladj	ἀπειθεῖς…δικαίων	1	the disobedient … of the righteous	Gabriel is using the adjectives **disobedient** and **righteous** as nouns in order to indicate groups of people.

LUK	1	18	asn2	figs-explicit	κατὰ τί γνώσομαι τοῦτο	1	How will I know this	Zechariah is implicitly asking for a sign as proof. Alternate translation: “What sign can you show me to prove that this will happen” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	1	18	l026	grammar-connect-logic-result	γάρ	1	For	This word introduces the reason why Zechariah wants a sign. He and his wife are both too old to have children, so he is finding it hard to believe what the angel has told him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
LUK	1	18	l027	figs-idiom	προβεβηκυῖα ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις αὐτῆς	1	my wife is advanced in her days	Zechariah is using two idioms. As in [1:7](../01/07.md), to be **advanced** means figuratively to have aged, and **days** figuratively refers a particular period of time, in this case the lifetime of Elizabeth. Alternate translation: “my wife has also grown old” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	1	19	l028	figs-hendiadys	ἀποκριθεὶς ὁ ἄγγελος εἶπεν	1	answering the angel said	Together the words **answering** and **said** mean that the angel responded to the question that Zechariah asked. Alternate translation: “the angel responded” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
LUK	1	19	p3jn	figs-declarative	ἐγώ εἰμι Γαβριὴλ, ὁ παρεστηκὼς ἐνώπιον τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	I am Gabriel, the one standing before God	Gabriel says this in the form of a statement, but he means it as a rebuke to Zechariah. The presence of an angel coming directly from God should be enough proof for him. Alternate translation: “You should have believed me, Gabriel, coming to you straight from God!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative]])
LUK	1	19	l029	translate-names	Γαβριὴλ	1	Gabriel	**Gabriel** is the name of an angel. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

LUK	1	19	pd7h	figs-activepassive	ἀπεστάλην λαλῆσαι πρὸς σὲ	1	I was sent to speak to you	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who did the action. Alternate translation: “God sent me to speak to you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	1	20	x9qk	figs-metaphor	καὶ ἰδοὺ	1	and behold	The term **behold** focuses the attention of the listener on what the speaker is about to say. Though it literally means “look” or “see,” in this case seeing figuratively means giving notice and attention. Alternate translation: “Pay attention!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	1	20	l030	figs-explicit	ἔσῃ σιωπῶν καὶ μὴ δυνάμενος λαλῆσαι	1	you will be silent, and not able to speak	The implication is that God will make this happen, to show that Zechariah should have believed what Gabriel told him. Alternate translation: “God will make you completely unable to speak” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	1	20	g5t1	figs-doublet	σιωπῶν καὶ μὴ δυνάμενος λαλῆσαι	1	silent, and not able to speak	These two phrases mean the same thing. Gabriel uses the repetition to emphasize how complete the silence of Zechariah will be. Alternate translation: “completely unable to speak” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
LUK	1	20	q6y3	figs-metonymy	οὐκ ἐπίστευσας τοῖς λόγοις μου	1	you did not believe my words	Gabriel uses the term **words** figuratively to describe the content of his message by reference to something associated with it, the words he used to communicate it.

LUK	1	22	h6vt	grammar-connect-logic-result	ἐπέγνωσαν ὅτι ὀπτασίαν ἑώρακεν ἐν τῷ ναῷ. καὶ αὐτὸς ἦν διανεύων αὐτοῖς, καὶ διέμενεν κωφός	1	they concluded that he had seen a vision in the temple; and he was making signs to them, and remained unable to speak	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the action that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “He kept on making signs to them but said nothing. So they concluded that he must have seen a vision while he was in the temple” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
LUK	1	22	r2ak	figs-explicit	ἐπέγνωσαν ὅτι ὀπτασίαν ἑώρακεν ἐν τῷ ναῷ	1	they perceived that he had seen a vision	Gabriel was actually present with Zechariah in the temple. He explains in [1:19](../01/19.md) that God sent him there. The people, not knowing this, assumed that Zechariah had seen a vision. While the Greek says that they “perceived” this, it means that they thought they recognized what had happened. Alternate translation: “they thought that he had seen a vision” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	1	23	duy9	writing-newevent	καὶ ἐγένετο	1	And it happened that	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
LUK	1	23	l032	figs-activepassive	ὡς ἐπλήσθησαν αἱ ἡμέραι τῆς λειτουργίας αὐτοῦ	1	when the days of his priestly service were fulfilled	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who did the action. Alternate translation: “when Zechariah had finished his time of service at the temple” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	1	23	l033	figs-idiom	αἱ ἡμέραι τῆς λειτουργίας αὐτοῦ	1	the days of his priestly service	Here, Luke uses the term **days** figuratively to refer to a particular time. Alternate translation: “his time of service at the temple” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	1	23	sa5y	figs-explicit	ἀπῆλθεν εἰς τὸν οἶκον αὐτοῦ	1	he went away to his home	This expression indicates implicitly that Zechariah did not live in Jerusalem, where the temple was located. Luke indicates in [1:39](../01/39.md) that Zechariah and Elizabeth lived instead in a city in the hill country of Judah, the area to the south of Jerusalem. Alternate translation: “he traveled back to his hometown” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	1	24	l034	grammar-connect-time-sequential	δὲ	1	And	This word indicates that the events the story will now relate came after the events it has just described. Alternate translation: “Then” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
LUK	1	24	cda2	figs-idiom	μετὰ δὲ ταύτας τὰς ἡμέρας	1	after these days	Here, Luke uses the term **days** to refer figuratively to a particular period of time, specifically, the time when Zechariah was serving in the temple. Alternate translation: “after Zechariah had finished serving at the temple” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	1	24	kpw1	figs-explicit	περιέκρυβεν ἑαυτὴν μῆνας πέντε	1	she hid herself for five months	This expression means that Elizabeth did not leave her house during that time. She seems to state the reason for this in the next verse. She had felt disgraced because she was not able to have children. But if she stayed in her house for **five months**, the next time people saw her, her pregnancy would show, and it would be clear that she was able to have children. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “She did not leave her house for five months so that by the next time people saw her, it would be clear that she was going to have a baby” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	1	25	w8yq	figs-exclamations	οὕτως μοι πεποίηκεν Κύριος	1	Thus the Lord has done for me	This is a positive exclamation. Elizabeth is very happy with what the Lord has done for her. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could show this by making it a separate sentence and indicating with the conventions of your language that it is an exclamation. Alternate translation: “What a marvelous thing the Lord has done for me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations]])
LUK	1	25	z1xr	figs-explicit	οὕτως μοι πεποίηκεν Κύριος	1	Thus the Lord has done for me	It is implicit that Elizabeth is referring to the fact that the Lord has allowed her to become pregnant.

LUK	1	25	pn2a	figs-idiom	ἐπεῖδεν	1	he looked upon me	Here, the expression **looked upon** is an idiom that means “shown regard for” or “treated well.” Alternate translation: “he treated me kindly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	1	25	lx3p	figs-explicit	ἀφελεῖν ὄνειδός μου ἐν ἀνθρώποις	1	to take away my disgrace among people	By **disgrace**, Elizabeth means the shame she felt because she was not able to have children. Alternate translation: “so that I no longer have to feel ashamed when I am around other people because I cannot have children” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	1	26	v9w2	figs-explicit	ἐν…τῷ μηνὶ τῷ ἕκτῳ	1	in the sixth month	Luke assumes that readers will recognize that this does not mean the sixth month of the year, but the sixth month of Elizabeth’s pregnancy. If you think there could be some confusion about this, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “after Elizabeth had been pregnant for six months” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	1	26	l035	translate-ordinal	τῷ μηνὶ τῷ ἕκτῳ	1	the sixth month	If your language does not use ordinal numbers, you can use a cardinal number here. Alternate translation: “month 6” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
LUK	1	26	rl4c	figs-activepassive	ἀπεστάλη ὁ ἄγγελος Γαβριὴλ ἀπὸ τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	the angel Gabriel was sent from God	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form.

LUK	1	26	l036	translate-names	Γαλιλαίας	1	Galilee	**Galilee** is the name of a region. It occurs many times in this book. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

LUK	1	27	l038	writing-participants	ἀνδρὶ, ᾧ ὄνομα Ἰωσὴφ	1	a man whose name was Joseph	This introduces Joseph as a new character in the story. If your language has an expression of its own that serves this purpose, you can use it here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])

LUK	1	27	tzh2	figs-metaphor	ἐξ οἴκου Δαυεὶδ	1	of the house of David	In this expression, the word **house** describes all the people descended from a particular person. The term views all of those descendants figuratively as if they were one household living together. Alternate translation: “who was a descendant of King David” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	1	27	l040	writing-background	ἐξ οἴκου Δαυεὶδ	1	of the house of David	This is background information that helps identify Joseph further. It is important for readers to know because it means that as [1:32](../01/32.md) indicates, Jesus, as the adoptive son of Joseph, will be an eligible successor to King David as the Messiah. Alternate translation: “who came from the royal line of David” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
LUK	1	27	w9tm	writing-participants	τὸ ὄνομα τῆς παρθένου Μαριάμ	1	the name of the virgin was Mary	This introduces Mary as a new character in the story.

Alternate translation: “God is showing you his kindness, Mary, so you do not need to be afraid” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
LUK	1	30	d3rx	figs-imperative	μὴ φοβοῦ	1	Do not be afraid	While the angel speaks these words in the form of a command, he is actually telling Mary something that he thinks will help and encourage her.

LUK	1	31	fi5q	figs-explicitinfo	συνλήμψῃ ἐν γαστρὶ, καὶ τέξῃ υἱόν	1	you will conceive in your womb and bear a son	The phrase **conceive in your womb** might seem to express unnecessary extra information, and so if you represent all of it in your language, that might not seem natural. However, the details are important here. The expression emphasizes that Jesus was a human son born of a human mother. So be sure to translate this expression in a way that conveys that. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo]])
LUK	1	31	l045	figs-declarative	καλέσεις τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ Ἰησοῦν	1	you will call his name Jesus	As in [1:13](../01/13.md), Gabriel is using a statement as a command in order to tell Mary what to do. Alternate translation: “you are to name him Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative]])
LUK	1	31	l046	figs-idiom	καλέσεις τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ Ἰησοῦν	1	call his name Jesus	As in [1:13](../01/13.md), **call his name** is an idiom that means to give a child a name. Alternate translation: “name him Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

LUK	1	32	l048	figs-idiom	Υἱὸς Ὑψίστου κληθήσεται	1	He … will be called the Son of the Most High	To **be called** is an idiom that means “to be.” (This idiom occurs three times in this episode and in a few other places in the book, such as [1:76](../01/76.md), [2:23](../02/23.md), and [15:19](../15/19.md).) Alternate translation: “He will be the Son of the Most High” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	1	32	hl55	guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	Υἱὸς Ὑψίστου κληθήσεται	1	He … will be called the Son of the Most High	Gabriel is not saying only that **Son of the Most High** is a title by which Jesus will be known. Instead, just as the previous verse described how Jesus was a human son born of a human mother, his statement here indicates that Jesus was also the divine Son of a divine Father. You may want to show this by employing capitalization or whatever other convention your language uses to indicate divinity. Alternate translation: “He will be the Son of the Most High” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
LUK	1	32	ip26	figs-activepassive	Υἱὸς Ὑψίστου κληθήσεται	1	He … will be called the Son of the Most High	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “He will be the Son of the Most High” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	1	32	z74z	figs-idiom	Ὑψίστου	1	the Most High	This is an idiomatic way of referring to God, as the fuller expression “the Most High God” in [8:38](../08/38.md) shows. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate the phrase that way in order to explain its meaning. Or, you could simply reproduce the phrase in the simpler form in which it occurs here in order to show your readers one of the ways in which the people of this time referred to God. Alternate translation: “the Most High God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	1	32	lwd9	figs-metonymy	δώσει αὐτῷ…τὸν θρόνον Δαυεὶδ, τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ	1	will give to him the throne of his father David	The **throne** figuratively represents a king’s authority to rule. Alternate translation: “will give him authority to rule as king as his ancestor David did” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	1	32	l049	figs-metaphor	δώσει αὐτῷ…τὸν θρόνον Δαυεὶδ, τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ	1	will give to him the throne of his father David	Here, the term **father** figuratively means “ancestor,” but since a line of kings is in view, it also indicates that Jesus will be a successor to David. Alternate translation: “will give him authority to rule as a successor to his ancestor David” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	1	33	l050	figs-parallelism	βασιλεύσει…εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας; καὶ τῆς βασιλείας αὐτοῦ, οὐκ ἔσται τέλος	1	he will reign … to the ages, and there will be no end of his kingdom	These two phrases mean similar things. Gabriel uses them together to emphasize how certain it is that Jesus will always rule. Because Gabriel is making a proclamation, he is speaking in a form much like poetry. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if the repetition might be confusing, you could connect the phrases with a word other than **and**, in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: “he will rule … forever, yes, his kingship will always continue” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
LUK	1	33	l051	figs-metaphor	τὸν οἶκον Ἰακὼβ	1	the house of Jacob	In this expression, the word **house** figuratively describes all the people descended from a particular person, in this case Jacob, who was also known as Israel. Alternate translation: “the people descended from Jacob” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	1	33	l052	translate-names	Ἰακὼβ	1	Jacob	**Jacob** is the name of a man. Luke uses it a few more times in this book. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	1	33	l053	figs-idiom	εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας	1	to the ages	This is an idiom. The term **ages** means long periods of time. Alternate translation: “forever” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	1	33	q516	figs-litotes	τῆς βασιλείας αὐτοῦ, οὐκ ἔσται τέλος	1	there will be no end of his kingship	This is a figure of speech that expresses a strong positive meaning by using a negative word together with a word that is the opposite of the intended meaning. Alternate translation: “his kingship will always continue” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
LUK	1	33	l054	figs-abstractnouns	τῆς βασιλείας αὐτοῦ, οὐκ ἔσται τέλος	1	there will be no end of his kingship	The abstract noun **kingship** refers to the action of a king reigning. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express the idea behind this word with a verb such as “reign.” Alternate translation: “he will always reign” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
LUK	1	34	cf3b	figs-explicit	πῶς ἔσται τοῦτο	1	How will this be	The implication is that even though Mary did not understand how this could happen, she did not doubt that it would happen. This is clear from the way that Gabriel responds positively and encouragingly to her, by contrast to the way he rebuked Zechariah in [1:18](../01/18.md) for his similar-sounding question. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this explicitly. Alternate translation: “I believe you, though I do not understand how this could happen” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	1	34	fqt7	figs-euphemism	ἄνδρα οὐ γινώσκω	1	I have not known a man	Mary uses a polite expression to say that she had not engaged in sexual activity. Alternate translation: “I have never had sexual relations with a man” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
LUK	1	35	l055	figs-hendiadys	ἀποκριθεὶς ὁ ἄγγελος εἶπεν	1	answering the angel said	Together the words **answering** and **said** mean that the angel responded to the question that Mary asked. Alternate translation: “the angel responded” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
LUK	1	35	l056	figs-parallelism	Πνεῦμα Ἅγιον ἐπελεύσεται ἐπὶ σέ, καὶ δύναμις Ὑψίστου ἐπισκιάσει σοι	1	The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you	These two phrases mean similar things. Once again Gabriel is speaking in a form much like Hebrew poetry. It would be good here as well to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if the repetition might be confusing, you could connect the phrases with a term other than **and**, in order to show that the second phrase is repeating and clarifying the meaning of the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: “The Holy Spirit will come to you, yes, the power of God will cover you like a shadow” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
LUK	1	35	x53s	figs-metaphor	δύναμις Ὑψίστου ἐπισκιάσει σοι	1	the power of the Most High will overshadow you	It was the **power** of God that would supernaturally cause Mary to become pregnant even while she still remained a virgin. It is not clear exactly how this happened, since Gabriel speaks figuratively as if God’s power had a shadow in order to describe it. But make sure that your translation does not imply that there was any physical or sexual union involved. This was a miracle. It might work well to retain Gabriel’s language and change the metaphor to a simile. Alternate translation: “the power of the Most High will cover you like a shadow” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	1	35	l057	figs-idiom	Ὑψίστου	1	the Most High	See how you translated the expression **the Most High** in [1:32](../01/32.md). Alternate translation: “the Most High God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	1	35	l058	figs-idiom	διὸ καὶ τὸ γεννώμενον Ἅγιον κληθήσεται, Υἱὸς Θεοῦ	1	Therefore, the holy one who will be born will be called the Son of God	As in [1:32](../01/32.md), to **be called** is an idiom that means “to be.” Alternate translation: “Therefore, this holy baby will be the Son of God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	1	35	k866	guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	διὸ καὶ τὸ γεννώμενον Ἅγιον κληθήσεται, Υἱὸς Θεοῦ	1	Therefore, the holy one who will be born will be called the Son of God	Gabriel is not saying only that **Son of God** is a title by which Jesus will be known. Instead, this is a further statement that Jesus would be the divine Son of a divine Father. (Gabriel says **therefore**, indicating that this will be the result of the process he has just described.) You may want to show this by employing capitalization or whatever other convention your language uses to indicate divinity. Alternate translation: “Therefore, this holy baby will be the Son of God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
LUK	1	35	vrz6	figs-activepassive	τὸ γεννώμενον Ἅγιον κληθήσεται, Υἱὸς Θεοῦ	1	the holy one who will be born will be called the Son of God	If your readers would misunderstand these two passive forms, you could express the meaning of each with an active form. Alternate translation: “people will call this holy baby whom you will bear the Son of God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	1	35	l059	figs-parallelism	τὸ γεννώμενον Ἅγιον κληθήσεται, Υἱὸς Θεοῦ	1	the holy one who will be born will be called the Son of God	Depending on how the Greek is understood, this could be another parallel statement. Alternate translation: “The one who will be born will be holy. Yes, he will be the Son of God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
LUK	1	36	lx9k	figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	Behold	**Behold** focuses the attention of the listener on what the speaker is about to say. Alternate translation: “Consider this” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	1	36	f88l		καὶ αὐτὴ συνείληφεν υἱὸν ἐν γήρει αὐτῆς	1	she also has conceived a son in her old age	Make sure that your translation does not make it does not sound as if both Mary and Elizabeth were old when they conceived. Alternate translation: “she has also become pregnant with a son, even though she is already very old”
LUK	1	36	hck2	figs-idiom	οὗτος μὴν ἕκτος ἐστὶν αὐτῇ	1	this is the sixth month for her	This is an idiom. Alternate translation: “she is now in the sixth month of her pregnancy” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

Alternate translation: “God is able to do anything he says” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
LUK	1	37	l061	figs-metonymy	οὐκ ἀδυνατήσει παρὰ τοῦ Θεοῦ πᾶν ῥῆμα	1	every word will not be impossible for God	Here, the term **word** could mean: (1) since Mary uses the same term figuratively in the next verse to describe the message that Gabriel has brought from God, Gabriel may be using it to mean that message as well. Alternate translation: “God is able to do anything he says” (2) Gabriel may be using the term in a general sense to mean “thing.” Alternate translation: “everything is possible with God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	1	38	tef1	figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	Behold	Here, **behold** means more literally “look,” that is, “Look at me,” by which Mary means, “This is who I am.” Alternate translation (not followed by a comma): “I am” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

LUK	1	38	l062	figs-metonymy	κατὰ τὸ ῥῆμά σου	1	according to your word	Here, the term **word** figuratively describes the message that Gabriel has brought. Alternate translation: “just as you have said” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

LUK	1	39	l063	figs-idiom	ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ταύταις	1	in those days	Here, Luke uses the term **days** figuratively to refer to a particular time. Alternate translation: “Around that same time” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	1	39	wj5i	figs-idiom	ἀναστᾶσα	1	arose	This is an idiom that means not just that Mary stood up, but that she took action to get an enterprise under way. Alternate translation: “started out” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

LUK	1	41	bx82	writing-newevent	καὶ ἐγένετο	1	And it happened that	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. One method that is natural in some languages is to introduce this event without such a phrase. UST often models this approach. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
LUK	1	41	v99g	writing-pronouns	ἐν τῇ κοιλίᾳ αὐτῆς	1	in her womb	The pronoun **her** refers to Elizabeth. Alternate translation: “in Elizabeth’s womb” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])

Alternate translation: “that the Lord would do everything he sent the angel to tell you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

LUK	1	79	s3eb	figs-metaphor	κατευθῦναι τοὺς πόδας ἡμῶν εἰς ὁδὸν εἰρήνης	1	to guide our feet into the path of peace	Zechariah is using the word **guide** figuratively to mean “teach,” and the expression **the path of peace** figuratively to represent living at peace with God.

LUK	1	80	qu12		ἕως ἡμέρας ἀναδείξεως αὐτοῦ	1	until the day of his public appearance	The term **until** does not indicate a stopping point. John continued to live out in the wilderness even after he started preaching publicly. In your translation, be sure that this is clear to your readers.

LUK	2	intro	dw6t			0		# Luke 2 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>1. Jesus is born in the city of Bethlehem (2:1-20)<br>2. Joseph and Mary dedicate Jesus, and Simeon and Anna speak about him (2:21-40)<br>3. Jesus goes to Jerusalem with his parents for Passover (2:41-52)<br><br>Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. ULT does this with the poetry in the song of the angels about Jesus’ birth in 2:14 and in Simeon’s song about Jesus in 2:29-32.<br><br>## Important textual issues in this chapter<br><br>### “his father and mother”<br><br>In [2:33](../02/33.md), the most accurate ancient manuscripts read “his father and mother.” ULT follows that reading. Some other ancient manuscripts read “Joseph and his mother.” That reading indicates that Joseph was not the biological father of Jesus, since Mary conceived him as a virgin. However, Joseph was the adoptive father of Jesus, and so the reading “his father and mother” is not incorrect. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it has. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading in ULT.

LUK	2	1	gda6	figs-personification	ἐξῆλθεν δόγμα παρὰ	1	a decree went out from	The **decree** did not go out by itself, even though Luke speaks figuratively as if it did.

Luke includes this detail because it indicates why Bethlehem was important, even though it was a small town. Not only had the line of David’s dynasty originated there, the prophet Micah had said that the future Messiah would be born there.

LUK	2	7	s97r	translate-unknown	ἀνέκλινεν αὐτὸν ἐν φάτνῃ	1	laid him in a manger	A **manger** was a box or frame in which people put hay or other food for animals to eat. It was most likely clean, and it may have had something soft and dry like hay in it that would have provided a cushion for the baby. In this culture, animals were often kept near a home to keep them safe and so that their owners could feed them easily. Mary and Joseph stayed in a space that was ordinarily used for animals for those reasons. Alternate translation: “put him in a box that held hay for animals” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

LUK	2	42	g8aa	figs-explicit	τῆς ἑορτῆς	1	the feast	Implicitly this means the Feast of Passover. It was called a **feast** because it involved eating a ceremonial meal. Alternate translation: “of the Feast of Passover” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

LUK	2	44	l163	figs-explicit	καὶ ἀνεζήτουν αὐτὸν	1	and they sought him	The implication is that Jesus’ parents looked for him among their friends and relatives once the whole group that was traveling together had stopped for the night.

Alternate translation: “and once the group had stopped for the night, then they looked for him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	2	46	llz4	writing-newevent	καὶ ἐγένετο	1	And it happened that	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
LUK	2	46	yy11	figs-synecdoche	ἐν τῷ ἱερῷ	1	in the temple	Since only priests could enter the **temple** building, this implicitly means the **temple** courtyard.

LUK	2	47	pgu4	figs-hendiadys	ἐπὶ τῇ συνέσει καὶ ταῖς ἀποκρίσεσιν αὐτοῦ	1	at his understanding and his answers	Luke may be expressing a single idea by using two words connected with **and.** The term **understanding** may tell what characterized Jesus’ **answers**. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express the meaning with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “at his wise answers” or “at the understanding with which he answered” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
LUK	2	48	llk9	writing-pronouns	καὶ ἰδόντες αὐτὸν	1	And when they saw him	Alternate translation: “When Mary and Joseph found Jesus there” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])

LUK	2	49	l165	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	καὶ	1	And	Luke uses this word to draw a contrast between how readers might have expected Jesus to respond in this situation and how he actually responded.

LUK	2	49	r8eh	figs-rquestion	τί ὅτι ἐζητεῖτέ με?	1	Why is it that you were searching for me?	Jesus is making a statement, not really asking a question.

Alternate translation: “You should have known that I would be involved in my Father’s business” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	2	49	p6aj		ἐν τοῖς τοῦ πατρός μου	1	in the things of my Father	This could mean: (1) Jesus is saying that he needed to be involved in the things that God was concerned about.

LUK	2	51	h2i9	figs-idiom	καὶ κατέβη μετ’ αὐτῶν	1	he went down with them	Jerusalem was on top of a mountain, so Israelites customarily spoke of going **down** when they traveled from Jerusalem to some other place. Alternate translation: “Jesus went back home with Mary and Joseph” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	2	51	zl2q	figs-activepassive	ἦν ὑποτασσόμενος αὐτοῖς	1	he was subjected to them	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “he obeyed them” or “he was obedient to them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	2	51	ceu3	figs-metaphor	διετήρει πάντα τὰ ῥήματα ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ αὐτῆς	1	kept all these things in her heart	As in [2:19](../02/19.md), the **heart** here figuratively represents the thoughts and emotions. Alternate translation: “carefully remembered all these things” or “reflected carefully on what all these things meant” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	2	52	gb25	figs-abstractnouns	Ἰησοῦς προέκοπτεν τῇ σοφίᾳ, καὶ ἡλικίᾳ	1	Jesus was increasing in wisdom and stature	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate the ideas behind the abstract nouns **wisdom** and **stature** with adjectives. These two terms refer to mental and physical growth. Alternate translation: “Jesus steadily became wiser and stronger” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
LUK	2	52	y5qk	figs-abstractnouns	χάριτι παρὰ Θεῷ καὶ ἀνθρώποις	1	in favor with God and people	If your readers would misunderstand the abstract noun **favor**, you could express the idea behind it with verbs. The phrase **in favor with God and people** refers to spiritual and social growth. Alternate translation: “God blessed him more and more, and people admired him more and more” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
LUK	3	intro	tkg5			0		# Luke 3 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>1. John the Baptist begins preaching and baptizing (3:1-22)<br>2. The list of Jesus’ ancestors (3:23-38)<br><br>Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. ULT does this with the poetry in 3:4-6, which Luke is quoting from the Old Testament about John the Baptist.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Justice<br><br>John’s instructions to the soldiers and tax collectors in Luke 3:12-15 are things that a person who wanted to live rightly would find reasonable and willingly do. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/justice]] and Luke [3:12-15](./12.md))<br><br>### Genealogy<br><br>A genealogy is a list that records a person’s ancestors or descendants. Such lists were very important in determining who had the right be king, because the king’s authority was usually passed down or inherited from his father. It was also common for other important people to have a recorded genealogy.<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Metaphor<br><br>Prophecy often involves the use of metaphors to express its meaning. Spiritual discernment is needed for proper interpretation of the prophecy. The prophecy that Luke quotes in 3:4-6 from Isaiah 40:3-5 is an extended metaphor that describes the ministry of John the Baptist. See the individual notes to 3:4-6 for recommendations about how to translate this passage. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### “Herod locked up John in prison”<br><br>This statement could cause confusion because Luke says that John was imprisoned, and then he implies that John was still able to baptize Jesus. But Luke makes this statement in anticipation of Herod’s imprisonment of John. It describes something that was still in the future at the time of the other events in the narrative. See the first note to 3:19 for a further explanation.
LUK	3	1	l167	writing-newevent	ἐν ἔτει δὲ πεντεκαιδεκάτῳ τῆς ἡγεμονίας Τιβερίου Καίσαρος	1	in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar	This verse and the beginning of the next one are an extended time reference that introduces a new event. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “Everything that the angels and inspired people had said about John and Jesus began to come true during the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
LUK	3	1	l168	translate-ordinal	ἐν ἔτει δὲ πεντεκαιδεκάτῳ	1	in the fifteenth year	If your language does not use ordinal numbers, you can use a cardinal number here. Alternate translation: “in year 15” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
LUK	3	1	l169	writing-participants	Τιβερίου Καίσαρος	1	Tiberius Caesar	As in [2:1](../02/01.md), **Caesar** is the title of the emperor of the Roman Empire. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express this explicitly. Alternate translation: “King Tiberius, who ruled the Roman Empire” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
LUK	3	1	l170	translate-names	Τιβερίου	1	Tiberius	**Tiberius** is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	3	1	v22w	translate-names	Ποντίου Πειλάτου…Ἡρῴδου…Φιλίππου…Λυσανίου	1	Pontius Pilate … Herod … Philip … Lysanias	These are the names of men. Here, the **Herod** mentioned is not the same one as in [1:5](../01/05.md). Rather, it is his son. Luke makes further mention of him many times in this book. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	3	1	uv8h	translate-names	τῆς Ἰουδαίας…τῆς Γαλιλαίας…τῆς Ἰτουραίας καὶ Τραχωνίτιδος…τῆς Ἀβειληνῆς	1	Judea … Galilee … Ituraea and Trachonitis … Abilene	These are names of territories. Like **Galilee**, the name **Judea** occurs many times in this book. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	3	1	l171	translate-unknown	τετραρχοῦντος	1	tetrarch	In the Roman Empire, a **tetrarch** was the governor of one of four divisions of a country or province. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could use a general term. Alternate translation: “ruler” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	3	2	d3m8	figs-explicit	ἐπὶ ἀρχιερέως Ἅννα καὶ Καϊάφα	1	during the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas	Usually there would only have been one high priest, but at this point the Romans were appointing the high priests for Judea, and there had been some intrigue surrounding Annas. One Roman official had appointed him some years earlier, but ten years after that, another official deposed him and named his son-in-law Caiaphas high priest instead. However, the Jews still recognized Annas’ claim to the position. It would probably be best to state the matter as simply as possible for your readers. Alternate translation: “while Annas and Caiaphas were both serving as the high priest” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	3	2	dg8p	figs-personification	ἐγένετο ῥῆμα Θεοῦ	1	the word of God came	Luke speaks of God’s message figuratively as if it were a living thing that could come to a person at God's bidding. Alternate translation: “God gave a message” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
LUK	3	2	l172	figs-metonymy	ἐγένετο ῥῆμα Θεοῦ	1	the word of God came	The term **word** figuratively describes the message that God gave John to say by using words. Alternate translation: “God gave a message” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	3	3	l173	grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ	1	And	Luke uses this word to introduce the results of what the previous sentence described. Alternate translation: “As a result” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
LUK	3	3	l174	translate-names	τοῦ Ἰορδάνου	1	the Jordan	**Jordan** is the name of a river. Alternate translation: “the Jordan River” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	3	3	w2pu	figs-abstractnouns	κηρύσσων βάπτισμα μετανοίας εἰς ἄφεσιν ἁμαρτιῶν	1	preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate the ideas behind the abstract nouns **baptism**, **repentance**, and **forgiveness** with other phrases. Alternate translation: “preaching that people should let him immerse them in the river to show that they wanted to live a new life and that they wanted God to forgive their sins” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
LUK	3	4	zf6m	figs-activepassive	ὡς γέγραπται ἐν βίβλῳ λόγων Ἠσαΐου τοῦ προφήτου	1	As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “As the book says that records the sayings of the prophet Isaiah” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	3	4	l175	figs-metonymy	λόγων Ἠσαΐου τοῦ προφήτου	1	the words of Isaiah the prophet	Luke is using the term **words** figuratively to refer to the sayings that Isaiah used words to articulate. Alternate translation: “the sayings of the prophet Isaiah” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	3	4	b86g	figs-quotemarks	φωνὴ βοῶντος ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ	1	A voice of one calling out in the wilderness	From this phrase through to the end of [3:6](../03/06.md), Luke quotes from the book of Isaiah. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by setting off all of this material with quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
LUK	3	4	l176	figs-metonymy	φωνὴ βοῶντος ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ	1	A voice of one calling out in the wilderness	The term **voice** refers figuratively to what this person is saying by association with the means they are using to say it. Alternate translation: “Someone is calling out in the wilderness and saying” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	3	4	l177	figs-quotesinquotes	ἑτοιμάσατε τὴν ὁδὸν Κυρίου; εὐθείας ποιεῖτε τὰς τρίβους αὐτοῦ	1	Make ready the way of the Lord, make his paths straight	Everything from this phrase through to the end of [3:6](../03/06.md) is a quotation within a quotation. Luke is quoting from the book of Isaiah, and Isaiah is quoting the words of the person calling out in the wilderness. It would be best to indicate that by punctuating this material as a second-level quotation, since Luke is quoting from Scripture. However, if your language does not put one direct quotation within another, you could translate this material as an indirect quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	3	4	rzv1	figs-parallelism	ἑτοιμάσατε τὴν ὁδὸν Κυρίου; εὐθείας ποιεῖτε τὰς τρίβους αὐτοῦ	1	Make ready the way of the Lord, make his paths straight	These two phrases mean similar things. They are both telling people to make a good road for the Lord to travel on. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be helpful to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if the repetition might be confusing, you could connect the phrases with another phrase that would show the relationship between them. Alternate translation: “Prepare a good road for the Lord to travel on, and do this by making sure that it follows a straight path” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
LUK	3	4	h9xl	figs-metaphor	ἑτοιμάσατε τὴν ὁδὸν Κυρίου	1	Make ready the way of the Lord	This is a figurative way of telling people to get ready to listen to the Lord’s message when it comes. They are to do this by giving up their sins. Alternate translation: “Give up your sins so that you will be ready to listen to the Lord’s message when it comes” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	3	5	wk8m	figs-metaphor	πᾶσα φάραγξ πληρωθήσεται, καὶ πᾶν ὄρος καὶ βουνὸς ταπεινωθήσεται	1	Every valley will be filled, and every mountain and hill will be made low	This is a continuation of the figurative description of making a good road that began in the previous verse. When people prepare the road for an important person who is coming, they make sure that the road is level by taking material from high places and using it to fill in low places. However, this is also a description of the effects that the coming of the Lord will have on people. It is a statement similar to the one Mary makes in [1:52](../01/52.md), “He has thrown down rulers from their thrones and he has raised up the lowly.” Metaphors in Scripture can have more than one reference like this. So we recommend that you translate the words directly and not provide a non-figurative explanation, even if your language does not customarily use such figures of speech. If you want to explain the meanings of the metaphor, we recommend that you do that in a footnote rather than in the Bible text. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	3	5	e52x	figs-activepassive	πᾶσα φάραγξ πληρωθήσεται	1	Every valley will be filled	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form. Since people would be doing this action in one sense of the metaphor, but God would be doing the action in another sense of the metaphor, it might be best not to be specific about who will do the action. Alternate translation: “Someone will fill in every valley” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	3	5	s66m	figs-activepassive	καὶ πᾶν ὄρος καὶ βουνὸς ταπεινωθήσεται	1	and every mountain and hill will be made low	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form, following the same principle as for the previous phrase. Alternate translation: “and someone will make every mountain and hill low” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	3	5	l178	figs-metaphor	ἔσται τὰ σκολιὰ εἰς εὐθείαν, καὶ αἱ τραχεῖαι εἰς ὁδοὺς λείας	1	the crooked roads will become straight, and the rough roads will become smooth	This too is both a continuation of the figurative description of making a good road and a description of the effects that the coming of the Lord will have on people. Something that is **crooked** becoming **straight** and something that is **rough** becoming **smooth** can be seen as metaphors for repentance and a change in a person’s way of life. And so we recommend once again that you translate the words directly and not provide a non-figurative explanation in the text of your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	3	6	l179	figs-metonymy	πᾶσα σὰρξ	1	all flesh	Luke is describing people figuratively by reference to something associated with them, the flesh they are made of. Alternate translation: “all people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	3	6	l180	figs-metaphor	ὄψεται	1	will see	The term **see** is a figurative way of referring to recognition and understanding. Alternate translation: “will recognize” or “will understand” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	3	6	du1b	figs-abstractnouns	ὄψεται…τὸ σωτήριον τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	will see the salvation of God	If your readers would misunderstand the abstract noun **salvation**, you could express the idea behind it with a verb such as “save.” Alternate translation: “will understand how God saves people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
LUK	3	6	l181	figs-quotesinquotes	τὸ σωτήριον τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	the salvation of God	After this phrase, Isaiah ends his quotation from the person who is calling out in the wilderness. If you decided in [3:4](../03/04.md) to mark these words as a second-level quotation, indicate the end of that quotation here with whatever convention your language uses. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	3	6	l182	figs-quotemarks	τὸ σωτήριον τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	the salvation of God	After this phrase, Luke also ends his quotation from the book of Isaiah. If you decided in [3:4](../03/04.md) to mark this as a first-level quotation, indicate that ending here with whatever punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the end of a first-level quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
LUK	3	7	sxn9	figs-activepassive	βαπτισθῆναι ὑπ’ αὐτοῦ	1	to be baptized by him	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “for him to baptize them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	3	7	b724	figs-idiom	γεννήματα ἐχιδνῶν	1	Offspring of vipers	The expression **offspring of** is an idiom that means a person shares the qualities of something. John is using dangerous poisonous snakes to represent evil. Alternate translation: “You evil people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	3	7	l183	translate-unknown	γεννήματα ἐχιδνῶν	1	Offspring of vipers	If your readers would not recognize the name **vipers**, which refers to dangerous poisonous snakes, you could state something more general. Alternate translation: “You are evil, like poisonous snakes” or “You are evil, like poisonous animals” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	3	7	mcq5	figs-rquestion	τίς ὑπέδειξεν ὑμῖν φυγεῖν ἀπὸ τῆς μελλούσης ὀργῆς?	1	Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?	John is making a statement, not asking a question. He does not expect the people in the crowds to tell him who warned them. Instead, he is using the question form to challenge the people to think about what they believe baptism will do for them. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate his words as a statement or exclamation. Alternate translation: “You cannot escape from God’s wrath just by being baptized!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	3	7	g7tw	figs-metonymy	ἀπὸ τῆς μελλούσης ὀργῆς	1	from the coming wrath	John is using the word **wrath** to refer figuratively to God’s punishment. This is by association with the way that punishment is an expression of God’s **wrath** or displeasure over sin. Alternate translation: “from the punishment that God is sending” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	3	8	pz16	figs-metaphor	ποιήσατε…καρποὺς ἀξίους τῆς μετανοίας	1	produce fruits worthy of repentance	John is figuratively comparing a person’s behavior to fruit. Just as a plant is expected to produce fruit that is appropriate for that kind of plant, a person who says that he has repented is expected to live righteously. Alternate translation: “do the good things that will show that you have stopped sinning” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	3	8	l184	figs-abstractnouns	ἀξίους τῆς μετανοίας	1	worthy of repentance	If your readers would misunderstand the abstract noun **repentance**, you could express the idea behind it with an equivalent phrase.

LUK	3	8	l185	figs-quotesinquotes	μὴ ἄρξησθε λέγειν ἐν ἑαυτοῖς, πατέρα ἔχομεν τὸν Ἀβραάμ	1	do not begin to say within yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father’	**We have Abraham as our father** is a quotation within a quotation. Luke is quoting John’s words to the crowd, and John is quoting something that the crowds might wrongly think. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “do not try to reassure yourselves with the thought that Abraham is your father” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	3	8	l186	figs-metaphor	πατέρα ἔχομεν τὸν Ἀβραάμ	1	We have Abraham as our father	Here, **Father** figuratively means “ancestor.” Alternate translation: “Abraham is our ancestor” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	3	8	l187	figs-exclusive	πατέρα ἔχομεν τὸν Ἀβραάμ	1	We have Abraham as our father	John is suggesting something the people might say about themselves, as opposed to others, so if your language distinguishes between exclusive and inclusive “we” and “us,” use the exclusive form here.

LUK	3	8	pft3	figs-explicit	πατέρα ἔχομεν τὸν Ἀβραάμ	1	We have Abraham as our father	If it would be unclear to your readers why they would say this, you may also add the implied information: Alternate translation: “Abraham is our ancestor, so God would not punish us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	3	8	gbp2	figs-metaphor	δύναται ὁ Θεὸς ἐκ τῶν λίθων τούτων ἐγεῖραι τέκνα τῷ Ἀβραάμ	1	God is able to raise up children for Abraham from these stones	The expression **raise up** is a spatial metaphor. It envisions that if God did turn the stones into people who were descendants of Abraham, then the people would be standing up in front of everyone, no longer lying in the riverbed as the stones were. Alternate translation: “God is able create descendants for Abraham out of these stones” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	3	8	l189	figs-metaphor	τέκνα τῷ Ἀβραάμ	1	children for Abraham	Here, the word **children** figuratively means “descendants.” Alternate translation: “descendants for Abraham” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

LUK	3	9	l8it	figs-activepassive	πᾶν…δένδρον μὴ ποιοῦν καρπὸν καλὸν, ἐκκόπτεται καὶ εἰς πῦρ βάλλεται	1	every tree that does not produce good fruit is chopped down and thrown into the fire	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with active forms. Alternate translation: “this person will chop down every tree that does not produce good fruit and throw it into the fire” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	3	9	l191	figs-metaphor	πᾶν…δένδρον μὴ ποιοῦν καρπὸν καλὸν, ἐκκόπτεται καὶ εἰς πῦρ βάλλεται	1	every tree that does not produce good fruit is chopped down and thrown into the fire	This is a figurative way of describing punishment. Alternate translation: “God will certainly punish every person who does not do what is right” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	3	10	ak6i	figs-quotemarks	ἐπηρώτων αὐτὸν…λέγοντες	1	kept asking him, saying	Luke uses the word **saying** to introduce his quotation of what the crowds were asking John. Here and throughout the book, if you indicate the quotation in some other way, such as with quotation marks or with some other punctuation or convention that your language uses, you do not need to represent this word in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
LUK	3	11	g3ip	figs-hendiadys	ἀποκριθεὶς δὲ ἔλεγεν αὐτοῖς	1	So answering he said to them	Together the words **answering** and **said** mean that John responded to the question that the crowds asked. Alternate translation: “So he responded to them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
LUK	3	11	vuk3	figs-explicit	ὁ ἔχων βρώματα, ὁμοίως ποιείτω	1	let him do the same	The implication is that anyone who has extra food should share it, just as a person with an extra tunic should share that. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “if anyone has extra food, he should share that as well” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	3	12	pp3s	figs-activepassive	ἦλθον…βαπτισθῆναι	1	came to be baptized	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who did the action.

LUK	3	12	l192		Διδάσκαλε	1	Teacher	This is a respectful title. You can translate it with an equivalent term that your language and culture would use,
LUK	3	13	v9ls	figs-explicit	μηδὲν πλέον…πράσσετε	1	Collect nothing more	The implication is that tax collectors had been demanding more money than they should have been collecting. John tells them to stop doing that. Alternate translation: “Do not demand extra money” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	3	13	m136	figs-activepassive	παρὰ τὸ διατεταγμένον ὑμῖν	1	than what you have been ordered	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who did the action. Alternate translation: “beyond what the Romans have authorized you to collect” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	3	14	w2d8	figs-exclusive	τί ποιήσωμεν καὶ ἡμεῖς?	1	And us, what should we do?	The soliders are speaking about themselves, as opposed to others, so if your language distinguishes between exclusive and inclusive **we** and “us,” use the exclusive form here. You could make this two sentences. Alternate translation: “How about us soldiers? What must we do?” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
LUK	3	14	l3mz	figs-explicit	μηδὲ συκοφαντήσητε	1	do not accuse falsely	The implication is that soldiers were making false charges against people in order to extort money from them.

LUK	3	14	bvy5	figs-activepassive	καὶ ἀρκεῖσθε τοῖς ὀψωνίοις ὑμῶν	1	and be contented with your wages	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “instead, let the amount you are paid satisfy you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	3	14	l193	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	καὶ	4	and	This word introduces draws a contrast between what the soldiers had been doing and what they should have been doing.

LUK	3	15	pgp3	grammar-connect-time-background	προσδοκῶντος δὲ τοῦ λαοῦ	1	And the people were expecting	Luke is providing this background information to help readers understand what happens next.

LUK	3	15	l194	figs-explicit	προσδοκῶντος δὲ τοῦ λαοῦ	1	And the people were expecting	The implication is that the people were expecting the Messiah. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “Now the people were expecting the Messiah” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	3	15	czb7	figs-metaphor	διαλογιζομένων…ἐν ταῖς καρδίαις αὐτῶν	1	wondering in their hearts	Here, Luke uses the term **hearts** figuratively to represent the people’s minds. Alternate translation: “wondering in their minds” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	3	16	fn1u	figs-explicit	ἀπεκρίνατο λέγων πᾶσιν ὁ Ἰωάννης	1	John answered, saying to them all	John’s statement clearly implies that John himself is not the Messiah. It may be helpful to state this explicitly for your readers.

LUK	3	16	l195	figs-hendiadys	ἀπεκρίνατο λέγων…ὁ Ἰωάννης	1	John answered, saying	Together the words **answered** and **saying** mean that John responded to what the people were wondering about him. Alternate translation: “John responded” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
LUK	3	16	wj3h		ἐγὼ…ὕδατι βαπτίζω ὑμᾶς	1	I … baptize you with water	Alternate translation: “I … baptize you using water” or “I … baptize you by means of water”
LUK	3	16	k3hg	figs-explicit	οὐκ εἰμὶ ἱκανὸς λῦσαι τὸν ἱμάντα τῶν ὑποδημάτων αὐτοῦ	1	I am not worthy to untie the strap of his sandals	Untying the straps of sandals was a duty of a slave. John is saying implicitly that the one who is coming will be so great that he is not even worthy to be his slave. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “I am not even worthy to be his slave” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	3	16	jjp1	figs-metaphor	αὐτὸς ὑμᾶς βαπτίσει ἐν Πνεύματι Ἁγίῳ, καὶ πυρί	1	He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire	John is using literal baptism, which puts a person under water, to speak figuratively of spiritual baptism, which puts people under the influence of the Holy Spirit, who purifies them. Alternate translation: “He will put you under the influence of the Holy Spirit, who will purify you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	3	16	c1an	figs-metaphor	αὐτὸς ὑμᾶς βαπτίσει…πυρί	1	He will baptize you … with fire	The word **fire** is intended figuratively, and it suggests a fuller metaphor. Jesus will not immerse people in actual fire. Be sure that this is clear to your readers. Alternate translation: “He will baptize you … to purify you, as precious metals are purified in fire” or “He will baptize you … to clear away your sins, as fire clears away underbrush” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	3	17	jzm4	figs-metaphor	οὗ τὸ πτύον ἐν τῇ χειρὶ αὐτοῦ	1	whose winnowing fork is in his hand	John is saying figuratively that the Messiah will come prepared to judge people right away. You could express this metaphor as a simile in your translation. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here in your translation. Alternate translation: “He will already be prepared to judge people, just like a farmer who is ready to thresh grain” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	3	17	l196	figs-idiom	οὗ τὸ πτύον ἐν τῇ χειρὶ αὐτοῦ	1	whose winnowing fork is in his hand	The phrase **in his hand** is an idiom that means he has the tool all ready to use. Alternate translation: “He has his winnowing fork ready to use” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	3	17	b1ap	translate-unknown	πτύον	1	winnowing fork	This is a tool for tossing wheat into the air to separate the wheat grain from the chaff. The heavier grain falls back down, and the wind blows away the unwanted chaff. This tool is similar to a pitchfork. If you have a similar tool in your culture, you can use the word for it here. Otherwise, you can use a phrase that would express the meaning. Alternate translation: “tool for threshing grain” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	3	17	gf8n	translate-unknown	διακαθᾶραι τὴν ἅλωνα αὐτοῦ	1	to thoroughly clear off his threshing floor	The threshing floor was the place where wheat was stacked in preparation for threshing.

The wheat is the part of the crop that is useful. It represents people who are obedient to God, who will be welcomed into his presence. You could express this metaphor as a simile in your translation. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “He will welcome those who are obedient to God, just as a farmer stores good grain in his barn” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])
LUK	3	17	ky8j	figs-exmetaphor	τὸ δὲ ἄχυρον κατακαύσει πυρὶ ἀσβέστῳ	1	but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire	John continues to speak figuratively to describe how the coming Messiah will judge people. The chaff is the husk that surrounds the grain. It is not useful for anything, so people burn it up. You could express this metaphor as a simile in your translation. Alternate translation: “but he will punish those who are disobedient to God, just as a farmer burns up the useless chaff” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])
LUK	3	18	tyj9		πολλὰ…καὶ ἕτερα παρακαλῶν	1	also exhorting many other things	Alternate translation: “saying many other things to warn them”
LUK	3	19	l197	writing-background	δὲ	1	But	Luke uses the term **but** to introduce some background information to the story. In this verse and the next one, he tells what later happened to John. This had not yet happened at this time. When Luke says in [3:21](../03/21.md) that Jesus was baptized, he means that John was still there and that John baptized Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
LUK	3	19	jj3q	translate-unknown	ὁ…Ἡρῴδης ὁ τετράρχης	1	Herod the tetrarch	See how you translated the term **tetrarch** in [3:1](../03/01.md) Alternate translation: “Herod, who ruled the region of Galilee” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

Alternate translation: “because John had rebuked him for marrying Herodias, his brother’s former wife” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	3	19	cu4v	figs-explicit	ἐλεγχόμενος ὑπ’ αὐτοῦ περὶ Ἡρῳδιάδος, τῆς γυναικὸς τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ αὐτοῦ	1	having been rebuked by him concerning Herodias, the wife of his brother	The implication is that Herod’s brother was still alive. That made this marriage a violation of the law of Moses. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “because John had rebuked him for marrying Herodias, his brother’s former wife, while his brother was still alive. That was something which the law of Moses forbade” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	3	20	p2xw	figs-synecdoche	κατέκλεισεν τὸν Ἰωάννην ἐν φυλακῇ	1	he locked John up in prison	Herod did not do this by himself, Rather, as a ruler, he probably ordered his soldiers to lock John up. Luke is speaking figuratively of Herod, one person who was involved in this action, to mean everyone who was involved. Alternate translation: “He had his soldiers lock John up in prison” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
LUK	3	21	l199	figs-events	ἐγένετο δὲ	1	and it happened that	The previous verse says that Herod put John in prison. It might be helpful to make it clear that the account that starts in this verse happened before John was arrested. UST does that by starting this verse with “but before Herod did that.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-events]])
LUK	3	21	phe6	writing-newevent	ἐγένετο δὲ	1	and it happened that	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
LUK	3	21	r2x1	figs-activepassive	βαπτισθῆναι ἅπαντα τὸν λαὸν	1	when all the people were being baptized	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who did the action. Alternate translation: “while John was baptizing all the people who came to him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	3	21	l200	figs-hyperbole	ἅπαντα τὸν λαὸν	1	all the people	The phrase **all the people** is a generalization for emphasis. Alternate translation: “all the people who came to him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
LUK	3	21	nw1s	figs-activepassive	καὶ Ἰησοῦ βαπτισθέντος	1	Jesus also was baptized	you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “John also baptized Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	3	21	i5zg	figs-activepassive	ἀνεῳχθῆναι τὸν οὐρανὸν	1	the heavens were opened	you could express this with an active form. This was more than a simple clearing of the clouds, but it is not clear exactly what the expression means, so it may be best not to try to specify what happened too exactly. Alternate translation: “the sky opened up” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	3	22	q2yh	figs-personification	φωνὴν ἐξ οὐρανοῦ γενέσθαι	1	a voice came from heaven	Luke speaks figuratively of this **voice** as if it were a living thing that could come from heaven to earth. Alternate translation: “God spoke from heaven and said” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
LUK	3	22	h7tn	guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	ὁ Υἱός μου	1	my … Son	This is an important title for Jesus, the Son of God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
LUK	3	23	uvm3	writing-background	καὶ	1	And	Luke uses this word to introduce background information about Jesus’ age and ancestors. Alternate translation: “Now” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
LUK	3	23	d3sh	figs-idiom	αὐτὸς ἦν Ἰησοῦς ἀρχόμενος ὡσεὶ ἐτῶν τριάκοντα	1	Jesus himself was beginning about 30 years old	This idiomatic expression could mean: (1) the word **beginning** is a reference to Jesus starting his own ministry. UST follows this interpretation. Alternate translation: “Jesus himself was about 30 years old when he began his ministry” (2) Luke is saying that Jesus had just turned 30 was when he was baptized. Alternate translation: “Jesus himself was just 30 years old at this time” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	3	23	z2xa	figs-activepassive	ὢν υἱός, ὡς ἐνομίζετο, Ἰωσὴφ	1	He was the son (as it was assumed) of Joseph	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who did the action.

Consider how people normally list ancestors in your language. Use the same wording throughout the whole list. Possible formats are: (1) “He was the son … of Joseph, the son of Heli, the son of Matthat, the son of Levi, the son of Melchi, the son of Jannai, the son of Joseph” (2) “He was the son … of Joseph. Joseph was the son of Heli. Heli was the son of Matthat. Matthat was the son of Levi. Levi was the son of Melchi. Melchi was the son of Jannai. Jannai was the son of Joseph” or (3) “His father … was Joseph. Joseph’s father was Heli. Heli’s father was Matthat. Matthat’s father was Levi. Levi’s father was Melchi. Melchi’s father was Jannai.

LUK	4	1	n1xx	writing-newevent	Ἰησοῦς δὲ	1	Then Jesus	Luke uses this expression to return to the story after providing background information about Jesus’ ancestors.

LUK	4	2	hg5p	figs-activepassive	ἡμέρας τεσσεράκοντα πειραζόμενος ὑπὸ τοῦ διαβόλου	1	for 40 days being tempted by the devil	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here.

If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “The devil picked up a stone and said” or “The devil pointed to a stone and said” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	4	3	l202	grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical	εἰ Υἱὸς εἶ τοῦ Θεοῦ, εἰπὲ τῷ λίθῳ τούτῳ, ἵνα γένηται ἄρτος	1	If you are the Son of God, speak to this stone so that it might become bread	The devil is suggesting that this is a hypothetical condition, that the **stone** will only become **bread** if Jesus is the **Son of God**. The devil is speaking as if it is uncertain who Jesus is in order to challenge him to do this miracle to prove that he really is the **Son of God**. Alternate translation: “Prove that you are the Son of God by commanding this stone to become bread” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical]])
LUK	4	3	y7yf	guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	Υἱὸς…τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	the Son of God	This is an important title for Jesus. Even the devil knew its significance. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])

LUK	4	4	hr5a	figs-activepassive	γέγραπται	1	It is written	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form, and you could state what is doing the action. Alternate translation: “The Scriptures say” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	4	4	ek2z	figs-synecdoche	οὐκ ἐπ’ ἄρτῳ μόνῳ ζήσεται ὁ ἄνθρωπος	1	Man will not live on bread alone	The word **bread** refers to food in general. Jesus quotes this scripture to explain why he will not turn the stone into bread. It means that food by itself, without God, is not enough to sustain a person in life. Alternate translation: “It is not just having food that makes a person truly alive” or “God says there are more important things than food” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
LUK	4	4	l205	figs-gendernotations	ὁ ἄνθρωπος	1	Man	Here, **man** has a generic sense that refers to all people. Alternate translation: “People” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])

LUK	4	5	jxi9	figs-explicitinfo	ἐν στιγμῇ χρόνου	1	in an instant of time	In your language, it might seem that the phrase **an instant of time** expresses unnecessary extra information. If so, you can abbreviate it. Alternate translation: “in an instant” or “in a short time” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo]])
LUK	4	6	l206	figs-activepassive	ἐμοὶ παραδέδοται	1	it has been handed over to me	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who did the action. Alternate translation: “God has given me authority over all these kingdoms” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	4	6	dcx6	figs-explicit	ἐμοὶ παραδέδοται	1	it has been handed over to me	The word **it** likely refers back to the singular antecedent **all this authority**, that is, the authority over these kingdoms. So the word you use to translate **it** should agree with **authority** in gender and number and in any other distinctions that your language marks. Alternate translation: “God has given me authority over all these kingdoms” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	4	7	g7h9	figs-explicit	ἐὰν προσκυνήσῃς ἐνώπιον ἐμοῦ	1	if you will bow in worship before me	The implication is that the devil wants visible, direct worship that will be an official act of submission.

LUK	4	7	uca7		ἔσται σοῦ πᾶσα	1	it will all be yours	Alternate translation: “I will give you all of these kingdoms”
LUK	4	8	v8ca	figs-hendiadys	ἀποκριθεὶς ὁ Ἰησοῦς εἶπεν αὐτῷ	1	answering, Jesus said to him	Together the words **answering** and **said** mean that Jesus responded to the offer that the devil made. Alternate translation: “Jesus responded to him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])

Alternate translation: “It is written that one must worship the Lord his God and serve only him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	4	8	m4tc	figs-explicit	γέγραπται	1	It is written	Jesus clearly implies in his answer that he is rejecting the devil’s challenge.

LUK	4	8	q8ni	figs-youcrowd	προσκυνήσεις	1	You will worship	Here, it may not be clear whether to use the singular or plural form of **you** because this is a short quotation from the Scriptures and the context is not given. The word is actually singular because, even though Moses said this to the Israelites as a group, each individual person was supposed to obey this command. So in your translation, use the singular form of **you**, if your language marks that distinction. In general these notes will not discuss whether **you** is singular or plural when this should be clear from the context. But they will address ambiguous cases such as this one. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd]])
LUK	4	9	j8r6	translate-unknown	τὸ πτερύγιον	1	the highest point	The term **pinnacle** refers to the highest point or very top of something. If you have a similar term in your language, you could use it here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

The devil is speaking as if it is uncertain who Jesus is in order to challenge him to do this miracle to prove that he really is the **Son of God**. Alternate translation: “Prove that you are the Son of God by jumping safely from this great height” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical]])
LUK	4	9	j9nx	guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	Υἱὸς…τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	the Son of God	This is an important title for Jesus. Even the devil knew its significance. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
LUK	4	9	i81s	figs-explicit	βάλε σεαυτὸν ἐντεῦθεν κάτω	1	throw yourself down from here	The exact location of the part of the temple that Luke describes is uncertain. However, the implication is that it was one of the places on the temple roof from which people would fall several hundred feet into the Kidron Valley if they jumped or slipped off. Make sure it is clear in your translation that this would ordinarily have been a deadly fall. Alternate translation: “jump from this great height” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	4	10	l209	figs-quotesinquotes	γέγραπται γὰρ, ὅτι τοῖς ἀγγέλοις αὐτοῦ ἐντελεῖται περὶ σοῦ, τοῦ διαφυλάξαι σε	1	For it is written, ‘He will give orders to his angels regarding you, to protect you’	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation.

Alternate translation: “and that they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])

Alternate translation: “It is said that one must not put the Lord his God to the test” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	4	12	fy8d	figs-explicit	εἴρηται	1	It is said	Jesus clearly implies in his answer that he is rejecting the devil’s challenge.

LUK	4	13	nc2c	figs-explicit	συντελέσας πάντα πειρασμὸν	1	when he had finished every temptation	This does not imply that the devil was successful in his temptation. Jesus resisted every attempt.

LUK	4	13	qqd7	figs-explicit	ἄχρι καιροῦ	1	until an opportune time	New Testament Greek had two words for time. The first referred to chronological time, that is, the passage of time. The second word referred to the right time to do something. ULT is using the phrase **an opportune time** to translate that second word. If your language makes this same distinction, use the corresponding word in your own translation. Alternate translation: “until the time was right to try again” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	4	14	yfc3	writing-newevent	καὶ	1	And	Luke uses this word to introduce a new event in the story. Alternate translation: “Then” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])

LUK	5	intro	axr7			0		# Luke 5 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>1. Jesus calls Peter and his fellow fishermen to be his disciples (5:1-11)<br>2. Jesus travels to various towns teaching and healing (5:12-26)<br>3. Jesus calls Levi to be his disciple (5:27-32)<br>4. Jesus teaches about fasting (5:33-39)<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### “You will catch men”<br><br>Peter, James, and John were fishermen. When Jesus told them that they would catch men, he was using a metaphor to tell them he wanted them to help people believe the good news about him. See the last note to 5:10. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/disciple]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])<br><br>### Sinners<br><br>When the people of Jesus’ time spoke of “sinners,” they were talking about people who did not obey the law of Moses. But when Jesus said that he came to call “sinners,” he meant that only people who understand that they are sinners who have disobeyed God can be his followers. This is true even if they are not what most people think of as “sinners.” (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])<br><br>### Fasting and feasting<br><br>People would fast, or not eat food for a long time, when they were sad or in order to show God that they were sorry for their sins. When they were happy, such as during weddings, they would have feasts, or meals where they would eat much food. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/fast]])<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Healthy and sick people<br><br>To correct the Pharisees, Jesus speaks of healthy people who do not need a doctor. This does not mean that there are people who do not need Jesus. Rather, Jesus was explaining why he spent time with people whom the Pharisees considered to be “sinners.” See the notes to 5:31-32. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Implicit information<br><br>In several parts of this chapter, as in other places in the book, Luke does not explain information that his original readers would already have understood. Modern readers might not know some of those things, so they might have trouble understanding all that Luke is communicating. The alternate translations in these notes and the readings in UST often illustrate how that information can be presented so that modern readers will be able to understand these passages. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])<br><br>### Past events<br><br>Parts of this chapter are sequences of events that have already happened. In a given passage, Luke sometimes writes as if the events have already happened while other events are still in progress (even though they are complete at the time he writes). This can cause difficulty in translation by creating an illogical order of events. It may be necessary to make these consistent by writing as if all the events have already happened.
LUK	5	1	zc8q	writing-newevent	ἐγένετο δὲ	1	And it happened that	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
LUK	5	1	wsf8	figs-metonymy	ἀκούειν τὸν λόγον τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	the word of God	Here, Luke uses **word** figuratively to describe the things that Jesus said by using words. Alternate translation: “listening to the message Jesus was bringing from God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	5	1	p6im	translate-names	τὴν λίμνην Γεννησαρέτ	1	the lake of Gennesaret	**Lake of Gennesaret** is another name for the body of water also known as the Sea of Galilee. Galilee was on the west side of this lake, and the land of Gennesaret was on the east side, so it was called by both names. Some English versions translate this as the proper name of the body of water. Alternate translation: “Lake Gennesaret” or “the Sea of Galilee” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	5	2	t96r	figs-explicit	ἔπλυνον τὰ δίκτυα	1	were washing their nets	The implication is that they were cleaning their fishing nets to maintain them so that they could keep using them to catch fish. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “and were washing their nets to keep them clean and in good working order” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	5	3	f7z8		ὃ ἦν Σίμωνος	1	which was Simon’s	Alternate translation: “the one that belonged to Simon”
LUK	5	3	liq1		ἠρώτησεν αὐτὸν ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς ἐπαναγαγεῖν ὀλίγον	1	asked him to put out a little from the land	Alternate translation: “and asked Simon to move the boat away from the shore”
LUK	5	3	rc1z	figs-explicit	καθίσας	1	he sat down	As in [4:20](../04/20.md), sitting was the customary position for teaching in this culture. Alternate translation: “he sat down, as teachers did” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	5	3	vbx7		ἐδίδασκεν ἐκ τοῦ πλοίου τοὺς ὄχλους	1	was teaching the crowds from the boat	Jesus was in the boat a short distance from the shore and he was speaking to the people who were on the shore. Alternate translation: “and was teaching the people while he sat in the boat”
LUK	5	4	rk9p	figs-explicit	ὡς δὲ ἐπαύσατο λαλῶν	1	when he stopped speaking	The implication is that Jesus had been **speaking** in order to teach the people. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “When Jesus had finished teaching the people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	5	5	l245	figs-hendiadys	ἀποκριθεὶς Σίμων εἶπεν	1	answering Simon said	Together the words **answering** and **said** mean that Simon responded to Jesus’ instructions to take the boat out and let down the nets.

LUK	5	5	wbb1	figs-metonymy	ἐπὶ δὲ τῷ ῥήματί σου	1	at your word	Here Peter uses **word** figuratively to refer to what Jesus commanded him by using words. Alternate translation: “but because you have told me to do this” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	5	7	n2fp		κατένευσαν τοῖς μετόχοις	1	they signaled to their partners	The Greek text does not specify how they **signaled**, but since they were some distance from the shore, it may have been by waving their arms rather than by calling out. You can use a general expression here. Alternate translation: “they summoned their partners”
LUK	5	7	pr7m	figs-explicit	βυθίζεσθαι αὐτά	1	they began to sink	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state the reason for this explicitly. Alternate translation: “they began to sink because the fish were so heavy” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	5	8	r8j9	translate-symaction	προσέπεσεν τοῖς γόνασιν Ἰησοῦ	1	he fell down at the knees of Jesus	Be sure that it is clear in your translation that Peter did not fall down accidentally. Rather, bowing or lying down in front of Jesus was a sign of humility and respect. Alternate translation: “he bowed down in front of Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
LUK	5	8	j67m	figs-gendernotations	ἀνὴρ ἁμαρτωλός	1	a sinful man	Here, **man** means “adult male,” not the more general “human being.” So Peter is not saying generally, “I am a sinful person.” He really does mean, “I personally am a sinful man.” Be sure that this is clear in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
LUK	5	9	l246	figs-personification	θάμβος…περιέσχεν αὐτὸν καὶ πάντας τοὺς σὺν αὐτῷ	1	amazement had seized him and all those with him	Luke describes Peter’s **amazement** figuratively as if it were something that could actively take hold of him.

LUK	5	11	abca		τὴν γῆν	1	the land	Alternate translation: “the shore”
LUK	5	12	j1xy	writing-newevent	καὶ ἐγένετο	1	and it happened that	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
LUK	5	12	l248	figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	behold	Luke uses **behold** to call the reader’s attention to what he is about to say. Your language may have a similar expression that you can use here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	5	12	r35h	writing-participants	ἀνὴρ πλήρης λέπρας	1	a man full of leprosy	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new character into the story. If your language has its own way of doing that, you can use it here in your translation. Alternate translation: “there was a man there who was covered with leprosy” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
LUK	5	12	i3zk	figs-idiom	πεσὼν ἐπὶ πρόσωπον	1	fell on his face	This phrase is an idiom that means that he bowed down. Make sure that it is clear in your translation that the man did not fall down accidentally. Alternate translation: “he knelt down and touched the ground with his face” or “he bowed down to the ground” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	5	12	m4k2		ἐὰν θέλῃς	1	if you are willing	Alternate translation: “if you want to”
LUK	5	12	x7ss	figs-declarative	δύνασαί με καθαρίσαι	1	you can make me clean	The man is actually using this statement to make a request. Alternate translation: “please make me clean” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative]])
LUK	5	12	ys5f	figs-explicit	με καθαρίσαι	1	make me clean	The man talks about becoming **clean** ceremonially, but it is implicit that he has become unclean because of his leprosy, so he is really asking Jesus to heal him of this disease. Alternate translation: “heal me from leprosy” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	5	13	ziz1	figs-imperative	καθαρίσθητι	1	Be clean	This was not a command that the man was capable of obeying. Instead, this was a command that directly caused the man to be healed. Alternate translation: “I heal you from your leprosy” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
LUK	5	13	l48a	figs-personification	ἡ λέπρα ἀπῆλθεν ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ	1	the leprosy went away from him	Luke speaks figuratively of the man’s **leprosy** as if it were something that could actively go **away from him**. Alternate translation: “the man no longer had leprosy” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
LUK	5	14	q18t	figs-quotations	αὐτὸς παρήγγειλεν αὐτῷ, μηδενὶ εἰπεῖν, ἀλλὰ ἀπελθὼν	1	he instructed him to tell no one, but, “Go”	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate all of Jesus’ instructions as a direct quotation. Alternate translation: “he instructed him, ‘Do not tell anyone, but go’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
LUK	5	14	l249	figs-explicit	μηδενὶ εἰπεῖν	1	to tell no one	The implication is that the man is not to tell anyone that Jesus healed him.

LUK	5	14	v1wn	figs-explicit	προσένεγκε περὶ τοῦ καθαρισμοῦ σου καθὼς προσέταξεν Μωϋσῆς	1	offer a sacrifice for your cleansing, as Moses commanded	Jesus assumes that the man will know that the law required a person who had been healed from a skin disease to make a specific sacrifice. This made the person ceremonially clean and they could participate once again in community religious activities. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “offer the sacrifice that Moses commanded so that you can become ceremonially clean once again” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	5	14	jk14	figs-explicit	εἰς μαρτύριον αὐτοῖς	1	for a testimony to them	A priest would have to examine the man and certify that he had been healed before he would be allowed to offer this sacrifice.

LUK	5	14	nz37	writing-pronouns	αὐτοῖς	1	them	**Them** could mean either “the priests,” which is the interpretation that UST follows, or “all the people.” You could express either as an alternate translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
LUK	5	15	ng3z	figs-personification	διήρχετο…μᾶλλον ὁ λόγος περὶ αὐτοῦ	1	the word about him spread even more	Luke speaks figuratively of this **word** as if it were something that could spread around actively by itself. This expression means that more and more people told others about what Jesus was doing. Alternate translation: “people spread the news about Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
LUK	5	15	q4t2	figs-metonymy	ὁ λόγος περὶ αὐτοῦ	1	the word about him	Luke uses the term **word** figuratively to describe the news about Jesus that people spread by using words. Alternate translation: “the news about Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	5	15	l250	figs-activepassive	θεραπεύεσθαι	1	to be healed	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who did the action. Alternate translation: “for Jesus to heal them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	5	16	l251		αὐτὸς…ἦν ὑποχωρῶν ἐν ταῖς ἐρήμοις καὶ προσευχόμενος	1	he was withdrawing into the deserted places and praying	This expression **was withdrawing** indicates habitual action. Alternate translation: “he often withdrew to places where there were no other people so that he could pray”
LUK	5	16	sv6f		ταῖς ἐρήμοις	1	deserted places	Alternate translation: “places where there were no other people”
LUK	5	17	mb8m	writing-newevent	καὶ ἐγένετο	1	And it happened that	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
LUK	5	17	l252	figs-hyperbole	ἐκ πάσης κώμης τῆς Γαλιλαίας, καὶ Ἰουδαίας	1	from every village of Galilee and Judea	Luke generalizes by saying **every** in order to emphasize from how many different villages these religious leaders came. Alternate translation: “from villages throughout Galilee and Judea” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
LUK	5	17	l253	figs-metaphor	δύναμις Κυρίου ἦν εἰς τὸ ἰᾶσθαι αὐτόν	1	power from the Lord was upon him to heal	As often in this book, **upon** is a spatial metaphor. In this case, it means that the power of the Lord was with Jesus in a special way, specifically, to enable him to heal people. Alternate translation: “the Lord was giving Jesus special power to heal people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	5	18	l254	figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	behold	Luke uses the term **behold** to calls the reader’s attention to what he is about to say. Your language may have a similar expression that you can use here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	5	18	cl7s	writing-participants	ἄνδρες φέροντες ἐπὶ κλίνης ἄνθρωπον ὃς ἦν παραλελυμένος	1	men carrying on a mat a man who was paralyzed	Luke uses this phrase to introduce these new characters into the story. If your language has its own way of doing that, you can use it here in your translation. Alternate translation: “there were some men who were carrying a paralyzed man on a mat” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
LUK	5	18	l9q8	translate-unknown	κλίνης	1	a mat	**A mat** was a portable bed that could also be used to transport a person. Alternate translation: “a stretcher” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

Alternate translation: “But because the crowd of people had filled the house, they could not find a way to bring the man inside” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
LUK	5	19	rkm6	figs-explicit	διὰ τὸν ὄχλον	1	because of the crowd	The implication is that they could not enter because the crowd was so large that there was no room for them. Alternate translation: “because the crowd of people had filled the house” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	5	19	s7bm	figs-explicit	ἀναβάντες ἐπὶ τὸ δῶμα	1	they went up onto the roof	In this culture, houses had flat roofs, and many houses had a staircase outside that provided access to **the housetop**.

LUK	5	19	l85u		ἔμπροσθεν τοῦ Ἰησοῦ	1	before Jesus	Here, the term **before** means “in front of.” Alternate translation: “in front of Jesus” or “where Jesus could see him”
LUK	5	20	l83a	figs-explicit	καὶ ἰδὼν τὴν πίστιν αὐτῶν	1	And seeing their faith	The implication is that Jesus recognized that the friends of this paralyzed man strongly believed that he could heal him. Their actions proved that. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “When Jesus recognized that the man’s friends were convinced that he could heal him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	5	20	z4ek		ἄνθρωπε	1	Man	**Man** was a general word that people used in this culture when speaking to a man whose name they did not know. If your language has a term that it uses for this same purpose, you can use it in your translation here. Alternate translation: “Friend”
LUK	5	20	c7r7	figs-activepassive	ἀφέωνταί σοι αἱ ἁμαρτίαι σου	1	your sins are forgiven you	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who did the action. Alternate translation: “I forgive your sins” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	5	21	l256	translate-unknown	οἱ γραμματεῖς	1	the scribes	Here and elsewhere in the book, the term **the scribes** does not refer to people who make copies of documents. Rather, it refers to people who were teachers of the Jewish law, which they had studied extensively. Alternate translation: “the teachers of the Jewish law” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	5	21	l257	translate-names	οἱ Φαρισαῖοι	1	the Pharisees	**Pharisees** is the name of an important and powerful group of Jewish religious leaders in Jesus’ time. The name occurs many times in this book. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	5	21	ie5h	figs-explicit	διαλογίζεσθαι	1	to debate	These men were not debating or arguing out loud, since the next verse shows that this was rather something they were thinking. So this implicitly means that they were wondering. Alternate translation: “to wonder” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	5	21	l258	figs-quotemarks	λέγοντες	1	saying	Luke uses the word **saying** to introduce his quotation of what the religious leaders were thinking. If you indicate the quotation in some other way, such as with quotation marks or with some other punctuation or convention that your language uses, you do not need to represent this word in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
LUK	5	21	a86c	figs-rquestion	τίς ἐστιν οὗτος ὃς λαλεῖ βλασφημίας?	1	Who is this who speaks blasphemies?	These religious leaders do not expect someone to tell them who Jesus is. Instead, they are using the question form to emphasize how inappropriate they think it is for Jesus to tell someone that he forgives their sins. As the next sentence explains, they think this means Jesus was claiming to be God, and so in their view, he would be speaking **blasphemies**. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate their words as a statement or exclamation. Alternate translation: “This man is speaking blasphemies!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	5	21	s21n	figs-rquestion	τίς δύναται ἀφιέναι ἁμαρτίας εἰ μὴ μόνος ὁ Θεός?	1	Who can forgive sins but God alone?	Once again the religious leaders are using a question form for emphasis, and you can translate their words as a statement or exclamation. Alternate translation: “No one can forgive sins but God alone!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	5	22	z4k5	figs-explicit	ἐπιγνοὺς…τοὺς διαλογισμοὺς αὐτῶν	1	knowing their thoughts	This phrase indicates that they were reasoning silently, so the implication is that Jesus sensed what they were thinking. Alternate translation: “sensing what they were thinking” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	5	22	l259	figs-hendiadys	ἀποκριθεὶς εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτούς	1	answering said to them	Together the words **answering** and **said** mean that Jesus responded to what the religious leaders were thinking. Alternate translation: “responded to them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
LUK	5	22	et8f	figs-rquestion	τί διαλογίζεσθε ἐν ταῖς καρδίαις ὑμῶν?	1	Why are you debating in your hearts?	Jesus does not expect the religious leaders to explain why they are thinking these things. Instead, he is using the question form to emphasize that they should not be thinking them. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate his words as a statement or exclamation. Alternate translation: “You should not be thinking these things!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	5	22	p2hj	figs-metaphor	διαλογίζεσθε ἐν ταῖς καρδίαις ὑμῶν	1	debating in your hearts	The term **hearts** figuratively represents the thoughts of these people. Alternate translation: “are you thinking these things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	5	23	zid2	figs-rquestion	τί ἐστιν εὐκοπώτερον, εἰπεῖν, ἀφέωνταί σοι αἱ ἁμαρτίαι σου, ἢ εἰπεῖν, ἔγειρε καὶ περιπάτει?	1	Which is easier, to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven you,’ or to say, ‘Get up and walk?’	Jesus is using the form of a question in order to teach. He wants to make the scribes and Pharisees reflect on the situation and realize something. There are many implications. For example, these religious leaders may take the question in the sense, “Which is easier to get away with saying?” The answer would be, “Your sins are forgiven,” because people don’t expect visual proof of that, whereas if someone says, “Get up and walk,” and nothing happens, that proves the speaker doesn’t have the power to heal. Jesus likely intends the question in a different sense: “Which is the easier way to deal with a situation like this?” It appears that the man’s sickness has something to do with his sins, because Jesus forgives them. In such a situation, it would not be sufficient to say, “Get up and walk,” since that would address the effect but not the cause. To say, “Your sins are forgiven,” would deal with both the cause and the effect, so that would be the easier way to deal with the situation. There are many other implications that could also be drawn out as well—too many to include in the text of a translation. Since the question form is intrinsic to Jesus’ teaching method, you may wish simply to retain it in your translation. However, to show that he is teaching, not asking for information, you could introduce his question with a phrase that indicates its purpose. Alternate translation: “Think about this. Which is easier, to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven you,’ or to say, ‘Get up and walk'?” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	5	23	l260	figs-quotesinquotes	τί ἐστιν εὐκοπώτερον, εἰπεῖν, ἀφέωνταί σοι αἱ ἁμαρτίαι σου, ἢ εἰπεῖν, ἔγειρε καὶ περιπάτει?	1	Which is easier, to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven you,’ or to say, ‘Get up and walk?’	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “Is it easier to tell someone that his sins are forgiven, or to tell him to get up and walk?” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	5	24	f1lu	figs-123person	ὅτι ὁ Υἱὸς τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου ἐξουσίαν ἔχει	1	that the Son of Man has authority	Jesus is referring to himself in the third person. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this in the first person. Alternate translation: “that I, the Son of Man, have authority” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
LUK	5	24	l261	figs-explicit	ὅτι ὁ Υἱὸς τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου	1	that the Son of Man	The title **Son of Man** is equivalent to “Messiah.” Jesus uses it to claim that role subtly and implicitly. You may want to translate this title directly into your language. On the other hand, if you think it would be helpful to your readers, you could state what it means. Alternate translation: “that the Messiah” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	5	24	l262	figs-imperative	ἔγειρε	1	get up	As in [5:13](../05/13.md), this was not a command that the man was able to obey. Instead, this was a command that directly caused the man to be healed. Alternate translation: “I heal you, so you can get up” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
LUK	5	25	agg3	figs-explicit	καὶ παραχρῆμα ἀναστὰς	1	And immediately he got up	The implication is that the man was able to get up because Jesus had healed him. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “And all at once the man was healed, so he got up” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	5	25	l263		ἐνώπιον αὐτῶν	1	before them	Here, the term **before** means “in front of.” Alternate translation: “in front of everyone” or “where everyone could see him”
LUK	5	26	l264	figs-personification	ἔκστασις ἔλαβεν ἅπαντας	1	amazement seized of them all	Luke describes the **amazement** of the crowd figuratively as if it were something that could actively take hold of the people. Alternate translation: “they were all completely amazed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
LUK	5	26	f6tp	figs-activepassive	ἐπλήσθησαν φόβου λέγοντες	1	they were filled with fear, saying	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “fear filled them and they said” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	5	26	l265	figs-personification	ἐπλήσθησαν φόβου	1	they were filled with fear	Luke describes the **fear** of the crowd figuratively as if it were something that could actively fill the people. Alternate translation: “they became very afraid” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
LUK	5	27	k6r2	writing-newevent	καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα	1	And after these things	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new event. The expression **these things** refers to what the previous verses describe. Alternate translation: “After that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
LUK	5	27	abc8	writing-pronouns	ἐξῆλθεν	1	he went out	The pronoun **he** refers to Jesus. Alternate translation: “Jesus left that house” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
LUK	5	27	xf15		ἐθεάσατο τελώνην	1	saw a tax collector	The Greek word that Luke uses for **saw** indicates that Jesus gave careful attention to this man when he saw him. Alternate translation: “observed a tax collector” or “looked carefully at a tax collector”
LUK	5	27	l266	figs-idiom	ἀκολούθει μοι	1	Follow me	In this context, to **follow** someone means to become that person’s disciple. Alternate translation: “Become my disciple” or “Come, follow me as your teacher” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	5	27	b3tr	figs-imperative	ἀκολούθει μοι	1	Follow me	**Follow me** is not a command, but an invitation. Jesus is encouraging Levi to do this if he wants. Alternate translation: “I want you to become my disciple” or “I invite you to come and follow me as your teacher” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
LUK	5	28	phw9	figs-hyperbole	καταλιπὼν πάντα	1	leaving everything behind	Here, **everything** is a generalization that refers to Levi’s position as a tax collector and the advantages that came with it. Alternate translation: “leaving his work as a tax collector” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
LUK	5	28	abc0	figs-events	καταλιπὼν πάντα, ἀναστὰς	1	leaving everything behind, he got up	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could reverse the order of these phrases. Alternate translation: “he got up and left everything behind” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-events]])
LUK	5	29	l267	grammar-connect-time-sequential	καὶ	1	And	Luke uses this word to indicate that the event he will now relate came after the event he has just described. Alternate translation: “Then” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
LUK	5	29	g6yt	writing-pronouns	ἐν τῇ οἰκίᾳ αὐτοῦ	1	in his house	The pronoun **his** refers to Levi, not to Jesus. Alternate translation: “in his own house” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
LUK	5	29	ip2m	translate-unknown	κατακείμενοι	1	reclining to eat	In this culture, the manner of eating at a feast was to lie on a couch and prop oneself up with the left arm on some pillows. Alternate translation: “lying on banqueting couches” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	5	30	n82u	writing-pronouns	πρὸς τοὺς μαθητὰς αὐτοῦ	1	to his disciples	In this case, the pronoun **his** refers to Jesus, not to Levi. Alternate translation: “to Jesus’ disciples” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
LUK	5	30	tmm5	figs-rquestion	διὰ τί μετὰ τῶν τελωνῶν καὶ ἁμαρτωλῶν ἐσθίετε καὶ πίνετε?	1	Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?	The Pharisees and scribes are using the question form to express their disapproval. They believed that religious people should separate themselves from people whom they considered to be sinners. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate their words as a statement or exclamation. Alternate translation: “You should not eat and drink with sinful tax collectors!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	5	30	pi2x	figs-you	ἐσθίετε καὶ πίνετε	1	you eat and drink	The word **you** is plural, since the Pharisees are speaking to the disciples as a group, not to one particular disciple. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
LUK	5	30	l268	figs-merism	ἐσθίετε καὶ πίνετε	1	eat and drink	The Pharisees are figuratively using the two components of a meal to mean an entire meal. Alternate translation: “share meals” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
LUK	5	30	ze7y	figs-hendiadys	μετὰ τῶν τελωνῶν καὶ ἁμαρτωλῶν	1	with tax collectors and sinners	The Pharisees may be expressing a single idea by using two words connected with **and.** The previous verse says that there were many **tax collectors** at this banquet. So the term **sinners** may tell what the Pharisees thought these **tax collectors** were. Alternate translation: “with sinful tax collectors” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
LUK	5	31	l269	figs-hendiadys	ἀποκριθεὶς ὁ Ἰησοῦς εἶπεν	1	answering Jesus said	Together the words **answering** and **said** mean that Jesus responded to what the religious leaders were complaining about. Alternate translation: “Jesus responded” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
LUK	5	31	t6iv	writing-proverbs	οὐ χρείαν ἔχουσιν οἱ ὑγιαίνοντες ἰατροῦ, ἀλλὰ οἱ κακῶς ἔχοντες	1	People who are well do not have need of a physician, but those who have sickness	Jesus begins his response by quoting or creating a proverb, a short saying about something that is generally true in life. This proverb draws a figurative comparison. Just as sick people need to see a doctor to be healed, so sinners need to see Jesus in order to be forgiven and restored. But since Jesus explains the comparison in the next verse, you do not need to explain it here. Rather, you can translate the proverb itself in a way that will be meaningful in your language and culture. Alternate translation: “People who are well do not need to see a doctor; people who are sick do” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-proverbs]])
LUK	5	31	i9gn	figs-ellipsis	ἀλλὰ οἱ κακῶς ἔχοντες	1	but those who have sickness	The proverb expresses the idea compactly, and so it leaves out some words. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could supply those words. Alternate translation: “rather, it is people who are sick who need a doctor” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
LUK	5	32	g993	figs-nominaladj	δικαίους	1	the righteous	Luke is using the adjective **righteous** as a noun in order to indicate a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this with a noun phrase. Alternate translation: “righteous people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
LUK	5	32	l270	figs-ellipsis	ἀλλὰ ἁμαρτωλοὺς εἰς μετάνοιαν	1	but sinners to repentance	Once again Jesus expresses the idea compactly and leaves out some words. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could supply those words. Alternate translation: “rather, I came to call sinners to repentance” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
LUK	5	32	l271	figs-abstractnouns	εἰς μετάνοιαν	1	to repentance	If your readers would misunderstand the abstract noun **repentance**, you could express the idea behind it with a verb. Alternate translation: “to repent” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
LUK	5	33	f6g6	writing-pronouns	οἱ δὲ εἶπαν	1	Then they said	The pronoun **they** refers to the Pharisees and scribes. Alternate translation: “Then the religious leaders said” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
LUK	5	33	l272	figs-explicit	Ἰωάννου	1	John	The Pharisees and scribes assume that Jesus will know that they are referring to **John** the Baptist. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “John the Baptist” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	5	33	l273	figs-explicit	οἱ δὲ σοὶ ἐσθίουσιν καὶ πίνουσιν	1	But those of yours eat and drink	There is an implied challenge and question in this observation. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state it explicitly. Alternate translation: “But your disciples do not fast, and we want you to tell us why” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	5	33	l274	figs-merism	ἐσθίουσιν καὶ πίνουσιν	1	eat and drink	The Pharisees are figuratively using the two components of a meal to mean an entire meal. Alternate translation: “continue to have meals” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
LUK	5	34	l275	figs-doublenegatives	μὴ δύνασθε τοὺς υἱοὺς τοῦ νυμφῶνος ἐν ᾧ ὁ νυμφίος μετ’ αὐτῶν ἐστιν ποιῆσαι νηστεύειν?	1	You cannot make the sons of the bridal chamber fast while the bridegroom is with them, can you	The first word of this sentence in Greek is a negative word that can be used to turn a negative statement into a question that expects a negative answer. ULT shows this by adding **are you?** Your language may have other ways of asking a question that expects a negative answer, for example, by changing the word order of a positive statement. Translate this in the way that would be clearest in your language. Alternate translation: “Can you actually make the groom’s party at a wedding fast while the groom is still with them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
LUK	5	34	hxe1	figs-rquestion	μὴ δύνασθε τοὺς υἱοὺς τοῦ νυμφῶνος ἐν ᾧ ὁ νυμφίος μετ’ αὐτῶν ἐστιν ποιῆσαι νηστεύειν?	1	You cannot make the sons of the bridal chamber fast while the bridegroom is with them, can you?	Jesus is using the question form to teach. He wants the scribes and Pharisees to reflect on the actions of his disciples in light of a situation they are already familiar with. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate his words as a statement or exclamation. Alternate translation: “No one tells the groom’s party at a wedding to fast while the groom is still with them!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	5	34	q9k2	figs-idiom	τοὺς υἱοὺς τοῦ νυμφῶνος	1	the sons of the bridal chamber	The expression **sons of** is a Hebrew idiom that means a person shares the qualities of something. In this case, Jesus is describing people who share the quality of being an integral part of a wedding. These are the male friends who attend the groom during the ceremony and the festivities. Alternate translation: “the groom’s party” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	5	35	z8ex	figs-idiom	ἐλεύσονται δὲ ἡμέραι καὶ	1	But the days will indeed come	Here Jesus is using **days** figuratively to refer to a particular time. Alternate translation: “But there will certainly be a time” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	5	35	he9p	figs-metaphor	ἀπαρθῇ ἀπ’ αὐτῶν ὁ νυμφίος	1	the bridegroom will be taken away from them	Jesus is speaking of himself figuratively as the **bridegroom**, and of his disciples as the groom’s party. He does not explain the metaphor, so you do not need to explain it in your translation unless you think your readers will not understand it. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	5	35	l276	figs-activepassive	ἀπαρθῇ ἀπ’ αὐτῶν ὁ νυμφίος	1	the bridegroom will be taken away from them	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “someone will take the bridegroom away from them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	5	35	l277	figs-idiom	ἐν ἐκείναις ταῖς ἡμέραις	1	in those days	Jesus is again using the term **days** figuratively to refer to a particular time. Alternate translation: “at that time” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

Alternate translation: “Then he gave them this illustration to help them understand better” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])
LUK	5	36	qz5e		ἐπιβάλλει ἐπὶ ἱμάτιον παλαιόν	1	sews it onto an old garment	Alternate translation: “uses it to patch an old garment”
LUK	5	36	xj2y	figs-hypo	εἰ δὲ μή γε	1	But if not	Jesus uses this expression to introduce a hypothetical situation that explains the reason why a person would not actually mend a garment in that way. It may be helpful to make this a separate sentence. Alternate translation: “Suppose someone did do that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
LUK	5	37	n35t	translate-unknown	ἀσκοὺς	1	wineskins	These were bags made out of animal skins. They were used for holding wine. If your readers would not be familiar with **wineskins**, you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “leather bags” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	5	37	l278	figs-hypo	εἰ δὲ μή γε	1	But if not	Jesus uses this expression once again to introduce a hypothetical situation that explains the reason why a person would not put new wine in an old wineskin. Alternate translation: “Suppose someone did do that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
LUK	5	37	ac7w	figs-explicit	ῥήξει ὁ οἶνος ὁ νέος τοὺς ἀσκούς	1	the new wine would burst the wineskins	When the new wine fermented and expanded, it would break the old skins because they could no longer stretch. Jesus’ audience would have understood this information about wine fermenting and expanding and about old leather losing its suppleness. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “the new wine would burst the old wineskins because they would no longer be able to expand when the wine fermented” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	5	37	dw18	figs-activepassive	αὐτὸς ἐκχυθήσεται	1	it would be spilled out	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “the wine would spill out of the bags” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	5	37	l279	figs-activepassive	οἱ ἀσκοὶ ἀπολοῦνται	1	the wineskins would be destroyed	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “the leather bags would tear and become useless” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	5	38	ijm3		ἀσκοὺς καινοὺς	1	new wineskins	See how you translated the term **wineskins** in [5:37](../05/37.md). Alternate translation: “fresh leather bags”
LUK	5	39	l280	figs-ellipsis	οὐδεὶς πιὼν παλαιὸν θέλει νέον	1	No one, after drinking the old, wants the new	Jesus is leaving out some of the words. You may want to supply these words in your translation if not having them would be confusing in your language. Alternate translation: “No one who is used to drinking old wine wants to try new wine” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
LUK	5	39	pvn9	figs-metaphor	οὐδεὶς πιὼν παλαιὸν θέλει νέον	1	No one, after drinking the old, wants the new	Jesus is figuratively contrasting the old teaching of the religious leaders with his own new teaching. The point is that people who are used to the old teaching are not receptive to the new things that he is bringing. Jesus does not explain the metaphor, so you do not need to explain it in your translation unless you think your readers will not understand it. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	6	intro	vv2y			0		# Luke 6 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>1. Jesus teaches about the Sabbath (6:1-11)<br>2. Jesus chooses twelve apostles (6:12-16)<br>3. Jesus teaches about being his disciple (6:17-49)<br><br>The long teaching in Luke 6:20-49 begins with blessings and woes that are similar to the beginning of the long teaching in Matthew 5-7. That part of Matthew has traditionally been called the “Sermon on the Mount.” The teaching here in Luke has many other similarities with the one in Matthew’s Gospel. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/kingdomofgod]])<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### “Eating the grain”<br><br>When the disciples plucked and ate the grain in a field they were walking through on the Sabbath (Luke 6:1), the Pharisees said that they were breaking the law of Moses. The Pharisees said this because they thought that the disciples were doing work by picking the grain, and so they were disobeying God’s command to rest and not work on the Sabbath. The Pharisees did not think the disciples were stealing. That is because the law of Moses told farmers to allow travelers to pluck and eat small amounts of grain from plants in fields that they traveled through or near. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/works]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sabbath]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### The twelve disciples<br><br>The following are the lists of the twelve disciples:<br><br>In Matthew:<br><br>Simon (Peter), Andrew, James son of Zebedee, John son of Zebedee, Philip, Bartholomew, Thomas, Matthew, James son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot.<br><br>In Mark:<br><br>Simon (Peter), Andrew, James the son of Zebedee and John the son of Zebedee (to whom he gave the name Boanerges, that is, sons of thunder), Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot.<br><br>In Luke:<br><br>Simon (Peter), Andrew, James, John, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Simon (who was called the Zealot), Judas the son of James, and Judas Iscariot.<br><br>The man whom Luke calls Judas the son of James is probably the same man whom Matthew and Mark call Thaddaeus. However, you do not need to explain that in your translation or give both names. You can translate Luke’s list as he wrote it, and allow Bible teachers to explain the reason for the difference.
LUK	6	1	c4sa	writing-newevent	ἐγένετο δὲ	1	And it happened that	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
LUK	6	1	x5zk	translate-unknown	σπορίμων	1	the grainfields	These were large sections of land where people had scattered wheat seed in order to grow more wheat.

Alternate translation: “the areas where people were growing plants with edible seeds” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	6	1	rl46	translate-unknown	στάχυας	1	heads of grain	The **heads** are the topmost part of the **grain** plant. They hold the mature, edible seeds. Alternate translation: “parts that held the seeds” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	6	1	h9fy	figs-explicit	ψώχοντες ταῖς χερσίν	1	rubbing them in their hands	The implication is that they did this to separate out the grain seeds. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “rubbing them in their hands to separate the seeds from the other parts of the plant” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	6	2	z32z	figs-rquestion	τί ποιεῖτε ὃ οὐκ ἔξεστιν τοῖς Σάββασιν?	1	Why are you doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath?	The Pharisees are using the question form to make an accusation. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate their words as a statement or exclamation. Alternate translation: “You are doing something that the law does not permit you to do on the Sabbath!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	6	2	m76z	figs-explicit	τί ποιεῖτε ὃ οὐκ ἔξεστιν τοῖς Σάββασιν?	1	Why are you doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath?	The Pharisees considered even the small action of plucking and rubbing heads of grain to be harvesting, and therefore work. You could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “You are harvesting grain, and that is work that the law does not permit you to do on the Sabbath!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	6	2	dum1	figs-you	τί ποιεῖτε	1	Why are you doing	Here, **you** is plural. It refers to the disciples. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

LUK	6	3	vih6	figs-rquestion	οὐδὲ τοῦτο ἀνέγνωτε, ὃ ἐποίησεν Δαυεὶδ ὅτε ἐπείνασεν αὐτὸς, καὶ οἱ μετ’ αὐτοῦ ὄντες	1	Have you not read this, what David did when he was hungry, he and those who were with him	Jesus does not expect the Pharisees to tell him whether they have read this passage in the Scriptures. Instead, he is using the question form to emphasize that the Pharisees should have learned a principle from that passage that indicates that they are wrong to criticize the disciples. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate his words as a statement. It may be helpful to make this a separate sentence. Alternate translation: “The Scriptures suggest otherwise, in the passage that tells what David did when he and those who were with him were hungry.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	6	4	l282		ὡς εἰσῆλθεν εἰς τὸν οἶκον τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	how he entered into the house of God	If you made the first part of the quotation in [6:3](../06/03.md) a separate sentence, begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “He entered into the house of God”
LUK	6	4	l283	figs-metaphor	τὸν οἶκον τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	the house of God	Jesus is figuratively describing the tabernacle as the **house of God**.

LUK	6	4	yyh2	translate-unknown	τοὺς ἄρτους τῆς Προθέσεως	1	the bread of the presence	The phrase **the bread of the presence** refers to loaves of bread that were placed on a table in the temple as an offering to God. They represented how the people of Israel lived in the **presence** of God. Alternate translation: “the bread that was offered to God” or “the bread that showed God lived among the people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	6	4	l284		οὓς οὐκ ἔξεστιν φαγεῖν, εἰ μὴ μόνους τοὺς ἱερεῖς	1	which is not lawful to eat, except only for the priests	It may be helpful to make this a separate sentence. Alternate translation: “The law says that only the priests can eat that bread”
LUK	6	5	h453	figs-123person	ἐστιν…ὁ Υἱὸς τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου	1	the Son of Man is	Jesus is speaking of himself in the third person. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this in the first person. Alternate translation: “I, the Messiah, am” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
LUK	6	5	l285	figs-explicit	ἐστιν…ὁ Υἱὸς τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου	1	the Son of Man is	See how you translated this title in [5:24](../05/24.md). Alternate translation: “I, the Messiah, am” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	6	5	xy9h	figs-metaphor	Κύριός ἐστιν τοῦ Σαββάτου	1	is Lord of the Sabbath	The title **Lord** figuratively describes Jesus’ authority over the Sabbath. Alternate translation: “has authority over the Sabbath” or, if you translated in the first person, “have authority over the Sabbath” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	6	6	p1ee	writing-newevent	ἐγένετο δὲ	1	And it happened that	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
LUK	6	6	d44q	writing-participants	ἦν ἄνθρωπος ἐκεῖ	1	there was a man there	This expression introduces a new character into the story. If your language has an expression of its own that serves this purpose, you can use it here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
LUK	6	6	t77y	translate-unknown	ἡ χεὶρ αὐτοῦ ἡ δεξιὰ ἦν ξηρά	1	his right hand was withered	This means that the man’s **hand** was damaged in such a way that he could not stretch it out. It was probably bent almost into a fist, making it look smaller. Alternate translation: “his right hand was shriveled” or “his right hand was atrophied” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	6	7	q3sh	writing-pronouns	παρετηροῦντο…αὐτὸν	1	were watching him	The pronoun **him** refers to Jesus, not to the man with the withered hand. Alternate translation: “were watching Jesus carefully” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
LUK	6	7	c1qe	figs-ellipsis	ἵνα εὕρωσιν κατηγορεῖν αὐτοῦ	1	so that they might find to accuse him	Luke is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete.

Jesus asks this question to get the Pharisees to admit that it is legitimate to heal on the Sabbath. The intent of the question is therefore rhetorical. Jesus is not trying to obtain information; he wants someone to admit that something is true. However, Jesus says, “I ask you,” so this question is not like other rhetorical questions that might appropriately be translated as statements. This one should be translated as a question. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	6	9	dc6f		ἀγαθοποιῆσαι ἢ κακοποιῆσαι	1	to do good or to do harm	Alternate translation: “to help someone or to harm someone”

LUK	6	10	x77k	figs-imperative	ἔκτεινον τὴν χεῖρά σου	1	Stretch out your hand	This was not a command that the man was capable of obeying.

LUK	6	10	hce1	figs-activepassive	ἀποκατεστάθη ἡ χεὶρ αὐτοῦ	1	his hand was restored	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “his hand became healthy again” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

LUK	6	12	e4s7	writing-newevent	ἐγένετο δὲ	1	And it happened that	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])

Alternate translation: “and he appointed them to be apostles”

LUK	6	24	cs2e	figs-explicit	ἀπέχετε τὴν παράκλησιν ὑμῶν	1	you have received your comfort	Jesus is drawing a series of contrasts between what the poor and the rich have now and what they will have later.

LUK	6	27	pz5r	figs-parallelism	ἀγαπᾶτε τοὺς ἐχθροὺς ὑμῶν, καλῶς ποιεῖτε τοῖς μισοῦσιν ὑμᾶς	1	love your enemies and do good to those who hate you	These two phrases mean similar things. Jesus is using repetition to emphasize the importance of what he is saying. You do not need to repeat both phrases in your translation if that would be confusing for your readers.

The second phrase specifies in what way followers of Jesus are to **love** their enemies. They are to do this in a practical way by helping them.

Instead, you could combine them into a single phrase. However, there is a slight difference in meaning, and you could also choose to bring that out in your translation. The second phrase specifies one way in which followers of Jesus can **bless** people who mistreat them. They can pray for them. Alternate translation: “Ask God to bless people who say and do bad things to you” or “Say good things to people who say bad things to you, and even if someone treats you badly, pray that God will help them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

LUK	6	29	l308	figs-youcrowd	σε…σου	1	you … your	Even though Jesus is still speaking to his disciples and the crowd, he is now addressing an individual situation, so **you** and **your** are singular in this verse. But if the singular forms of these pronouns would not be natural in your language for someone who was speaking to a group of people, you could use the plural forms in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd]])
LUK	6	29	d5qi		ἐπὶ τὴν σιαγόνα	1	on the cheek	Alternate translation: “on one side of your face”

LUK	6	29	ic4n	figs-litotes	καὶ τὸν χιτῶνα μὴ κωλύσῃς	1	also do not withhold your tunic	Here Jesus uses a figure of speech that expresses a positive meaning by using a negative word together with a word that is the opposite of the intended meaning.

LUK	6	30	l310	figs-youcrowd	σε…σὰ	1	you … yours	Even though Jesus is speaking to his disciples and the crowd, he is addressing another individual situation here, so **you** and **yours** are singular in this verse. If the singular forms of these pronouns would not be natural in your language, you can use the plural forms in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd]])
LUK	6	30	ts8c	figs-hypo	ἀπὸ τοῦ αἴροντος τὰ σὰ, μὴ ἀπαίτει	1	from the one who takes away what is yours, do not ask for it back	Jesus is using another hypothetical situation to teach.

Alternate translation: “what you wish people would do for you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
LUK	6	31	l312	figs-you	ὑμῖν	1	you	Jesus now returns to speaking to his disciples and the crowd about general situations, so **you** is plural here and in the following verses. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
LUK	6	32	qh81	figs-rquestion	ποία ὑμῖν χάρις ἐστίν?	1	what credit is that to you?	Here Jesus is using the question form as a teaching tool.

LUK	6	33	l313	figs-rquestion	ποία ὑμῖν χάρις ἐστίν?	1	what credit is that to you?	Once again Jesus is using the question form as a teaching tool.

LUK	6	34	l314	figs-rquestion	ποία ὑμῖν χάρις ἐστίν?	1	what credit is that to you?	Jesus is using the question form once again as a teaching tool.

LUK	6	34	kgc9	figs-nominaladj	ἵνα ἀπολάβωσιν τὰ ἴσα	1	so that they may receive back the same things	Here the adjective **same** functions as a noun. It is plural, and ULT supplies the noun **things** to show that. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this with an equivalent phrase. The adjective is also neuter, and this is a use of the neuter plural in Greek to refer to a single thing in order to describe it in its entirety. Alternate translation: “expecting that everything they lend will be repaid” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
LUK	6	35	s8j7		μηδὲν ἀπελπίζοντες	1	expecting nothing in return	Alternate translation: “without expecting the person to pay you back”

LUK	6	35	zw5k	figs-metaphor	υἱοὶ Ὑψίστου	1	sons of the Most High	This is a figurative expression. Even so, it would probably be best to translate **sons** with the same word that your language would naturally use to refer to a human son or child. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	6	35	l316	figs-gendernotations	υἱοὶ Ὑψίστου	1	sons of the Most High	Jesus is using the word **sons** in a generic sense that includes all people. Alternate translation: “children of the Most High” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
LUK	6	35	qr5x		υἱοὶ Ὑψίστου	1	sons of the Most High	Make sure that the word **sons** or “children” in your translation is plural and not capitalized, if your language uses that convention for titles, so that readers do not confuse this expression with the title for Jesus, “the Son of the Most High,” which occurs in [1:32](../01/32.md) and [8:28](../08/28.md).
LUK	6	35	l317	figs-idiom	Ὑψίστου	1	the Most High	See how you translated the expression **the Most High** in [1:32](../01/32.md). Review the note there if that would be helpful. Alternate translation: “of the Most High God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

LUK	6	36	n28w	figs-metaphor	ὁ Πατὴρ ὑμῶν	1	your Father	This is a figurative expression. God is not the **Father** of humans in the same actual way that he is the **Father** of Jesus. Even so, it would probably be best to translate **Father** with the same word that your language would naturally use to refer to a human father. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that this means God. Alternate translation: “God your Father” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	6	37	a8c7		μὴ κρίνετε	1	do not judge	Your language may require you to specify the object of **judge**. Alternate translation: “do not judge other people”
LUK	6	37	e8fb	figs-activepassive	οὐ μὴ κριθῆτε	1	you will certainly not be judged	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who would do the action. Jesus does not say exactly who would not judge. This could mean: (1) “God will not judge you.” (2) “other people will not judge you.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	6	37	vkl8		καὶ μὴ καταδικάζετε	1	do not condemn	Your language may require you to specify the object of **condemn**. Alternate translation: “Do not condemn other people”
LUK	6	37	gz37	figs-activepassive	οὐ μὴ καταδικασθῆτε	1	you will certainly not be condemned	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who would do the action. Jesus does not say exactly who would not condemn. This could mean: (1) “God will not condemn you.” (2) “other people will not condemn you.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	6	37	l319		ἀπολύετε	1	Forgive	Your language may require you to specify the object of **release**. Alternate translation: “Forgive other people”
LUK	6	37	ls01	figs-metaphor	ἀπολύετε	1	Release	Jesus is using the word **release** figuratively to mean “forgive.” Alternate translation: “Forgive” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	6	37	a22w	figs-activepassive	ἀπολυθήσεσθε	1	you will be released	Jesus does not say exactly who would **release**. This could mean: (1) “God will forgive you.” (2) “other people will forgive you.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	6	38	ryf8	figs-activepassive	δοθήσεται ὑμῖν	1	it will be given to you	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who would do the action. Jesus does not say exactly who will give. This could mean: (1) “God will give to you.” (2) “other people will give to you.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	6	38	q8sq	figs-metaphor	μέτρον καλὸν, πεπιεσμένον σεσαλευμένον ὑπερεκχυννόμενον, δώσουσιν εἰς τὸν κόλπον ὑμῶν	1	a good measure—pressed down, shaken together, spilling over—they will pour into your lap	Jesus is comparing someone to a grain merchant who measures out very generously. He could mean either God or other people. The word **they** is indefinite, so it does not necessarily refer to people rather than to God. You could represent this metaphor as a simile in your translation. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “Like a generous grain merchant who presses down the grain and shakes it together and pours in so much that it fills a container and spills over, God will give you a generous amount” or “Like a generous grain merchant who presses down the grain and shakes it together and pours in so much that it fills a container and spills over, people will give you a generous amount” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	6	38	l320	figs-activepassive	πεπιεσμένον σεσαλευμένον ὑπερεκχυννόμενον, δώσουσιν εἰς τὸν κόλπον ὑμῶν	1	pressed down, shaken together, spilling over—they will pour into your lap	These are all passive verb forms in Greek. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate them with active verbal phrases. See the alternate translation in the previous note. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	6	38	l321	translate-unknown	τὸν κόλπον ὑμῶν	1	your lap	This is a reference to the way people in this culture would form a pocket or carrying pouch from the folds of the front of their robes. If you readers would not be familiar with this practice, you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “the folds of your robe” or “a container” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	6	38	fp26	figs-activepassive	ᾧ…μέτρῳ μετρεῖτε, ἀντιμετρηθήσεται ὑμῖν	1	with the measure by which you measure, it will be measured back to you	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who would do the action. Jesus does not say exactly who will measure. This could mean: (1) “God will give to you in just as generous or stingy a way as you give to others.” (2) “people will give to you in just as generous or stingy a way as you give to others.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	6	39	bw7f	figs-parables	εἶπεν δὲ καὶ παραβολὴν αὐτοῖς	1	Then he also told them a parable	Jesus is giving a brief illustration that teaches something true in a way that is easy to understand and remember. Alternate translation: “Then he gave them this illustration to help them understand better” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])
LUK	6	39	l322	figs-gendernotations	μήτι δύναται τυφλὸς τυφλὸν ὁδηγεῖν?	1	A blind man is not able to guide a blind man, is he?	Here the word translated **blind man** is masculine, but Jesus is using it in a generic sense that includes all people. Alternate translation: “Can one person who is blind guide another person who is blind?” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
LUK	6	39	l323	figs-doublenegatives	μήτι δύναται τυφλὸς τυφλὸν ὁδηγεῖν?	1	A blind man is not able to guide a blind man, is he?	The first word of this sentence in Greek is a negative word that can be used to turn a negative statement into a question that expects a negative answer. ULT shows this by adding **is he?** Your language may have other ways of asking a question that expects a negative answer, for example, by changing the word order of a positive statement. Translate this in the way that would be clearest in your language. Alternate translation: “Can one person who is blind really guide another person who is blind?” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
LUK	6	39	kyt1	figs-rquestion	μήτι δύναται τυφλὸς τυφλὸν ὁδηγεῖν?	1	A blind man is not able to guide a blind man, is he?	Jesus is not expecting the people in the crowd to tell him whether one **blind** person can guide another. He is using the question form as a teaching tool to make a point and get his listeners to reflect on it. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate his words as a statement. Alternate translation: “We all know that one blind person cannot guide another blind person” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	6	39	nm4v	figs-metaphor	τυφλὸς	1	blind man	The **blind** person figuratively represents someone who has not yet been fully trained and taught as a disciple. But since Jesus explains this figure in the next three verses, you do not need to explain it explicitly here in your own translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	6	39	f4xj	figs-rquestion	οὐχὶ ἀμφότεροι εἰς βόθυνον ἐμπεσοῦνται?	1	Would not both fall into a pit?	Jesus is using this question as well as a teaching tool. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate his words as a statement. Alternate translation: “Both of them would certainly fall into a ditch” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	6	40	ipr9	figs-metaphor	οὐκ ἔστιν μαθητὴς ὑπὲρ τὸν διδάσκαλον	1	A disciple is not above his teacher	The word **above** creates a spatial metaphor. Alternate translation: “A disciple is not better than his teacher” or “A disciple is not greater than his teacher” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	6	40	l324	figs-explicit	οὐκ ἔστιν μαθητὴς ὑπὲρ τὸν διδάσκαλον	1	A disciple is not above his teacher	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state what this implicitly means. Alternate translation: “A disciple does not know more than his teacher” or “A disciple is not wiser than his teacher” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	6	40	a6ym	figs-activepassive	κατηρτισμένος…πᾶς	1	everyone having been fully trained	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “every disciple whose teacher has fully taught him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	6	41	l7vj	figs-rquestion	τί…βλέπεις τὸ κάρφος τὸ ἐν τῷ ὀφθαλμῷ τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ σου, τὴν δὲ δοκὸν τὴν ἐν τῷ ἰδίῳ ὀφθαλμῷ οὐ κατανοεῖς?	1	why do you look at the speck of wood that is in the eye of your brother, but you do not notice the log that is in your own eye?	Jesus is using this question as a teaching tool. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate his words as a statement. Alternate translation: “do not look at the speck in your brother’s eye while ignoring the log in your own eye” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	6	41	jpt3	figs-metaphor	τί…βλέπεις τὸ κάρφος τὸ ἐν τῷ ὀφθαλμῷ τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ σου	1	why do you look at the speck of wood that is in the eye of your brother	This is a metaphor. Alternate translation: “you should not criticize the less important faults of a fellow believer” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	6	41	l325	figs-youcrowd	βλέπεις…σου…τῷ ἰδίῳ…οὐ κατανοεῖς	1	you look … your … you do not notice … your own	Even though Jesus is still speaking to his disciples and the crowd, he is addressing an individual situation here, so **you** and **your** are singular in this verse. But if the singular forms of these pronouns would not be natural in your language, you can use the plural forms in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd]])
LUK	6	41	j1r5	translate-unknown	τὸ κάρφος	1	the speck of wood	If your readers would not be familiar with **wood**, in your translation you can use a phrase that describes the smallest thing that commonly falls into a person’s eyes in your culture, or you can use a general expression. Alternate translation: “the grain of sand” or “the tiny object” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	6	41	ud6q	figs-metaphor	τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ σου	1	of your brother	The term **brother** figuratively refers to a fellow believer in Jesus. Alternate translation: “of a fellow believer” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	6	41	l326	figs-gendernotations	τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ	1	your brother	This fellow believer could be either a man or a woman, so be sure that this is clear in your translation, for example, by using both the masculine and feminine forms of the word for “believer.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
LUK	6	41	ssu3	figs-metaphor	τὴν δὲ δοκὸν τὴν ἐν τῷ ἰδίῳ ὀφθαλμῷ οὐ κατανοεῖς	1	but you do not notice the log that is in your own eye	This phrase is a metaphor. Alternate translation: “while ignoring your own serious faults” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	6	41	l327	figs-hyperbole	τὴν…δοκὸν τὴν ἐν τῷ ἰδίῳ ὀφθαλμῷ	1	the log that is in your own eye	A log could not literally go into a person’s eye. Jesus is exaggerating to emphasize his point and make it memorable. Alternate translation: “your own serious faults” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
LUK	6	41	h9a4	translate-unknown	δοκὸν	1	the log	You could translate this with the term for the kind of long, large piece of **wood** that people in your culture would encounter. Or if your readers would not be familiar with **wood**, you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “beam” or “plank” or “large object” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	6	42	l345	figs-youcrowd	πῶς δύνασαι λέγειν τῷ ἀδελφῷ σου	1	How can you say to your brother	Jesus is speaking to his disciples and the crowd, but he is addressing an individual situation, so **you** and **your** are singular here. (The terms **you**, **your**, and **yourself** are also singular throughout the rest of this verse, because either Jesus is addressing an individual situation, or one person is addressing another in fictional dialogue.) If the singular forms of these pronouns would not be natural in your language, you can use the plural forms in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd]])
LUK	6	42	rkk6	figs-rquestion	πῶς δύνασαι λέγειν	1	How can you say	Jesus is using this question as a teaching tool, not to ask for information. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate his words as a statement. Alternate translation: “You should not say” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	6	42	l346	figs-metaphor	τῷ ἀδελφῷ σου, ἀδελφέ, ἄφες	1	to your brother, ‘Brother, let me’	The term **brother** figuratively means a fellow believer in Jesus. So in its first instance here, you could translate the term the way you did in [6:41](../06/41.md). But since it is realistic that in dialogue one believer might address another believer as **Brother** or “Sister,” you could retain the figurative term in its second instance. Alternate translation: “to a fellow believer, ‘Brother,’ or ‘Sister, let’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	6	42	l328	figs-metaphor	ἄφες ἐκβάλω τὸ κάρφος τὸ ἐν τῷ ὀφθαλμῷ σου	1	let me take out the speck of wood that is in your eye	This is a metaphor. Alternate translation: “let me help you correct some of your faults” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	6	42	l329	figs-metaphor	αὐτὸς τὴν ἐν τῷ ὀφθαλμῷ σοῦ δοκὸν οὐ βλέπων	1	you yourself do not see the log that is in your own eye	This phrase is a metaphor. Alternate translation: “you yourself are not correcting your own serious faults” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	6	42	l330	figs-hyperbole	τὴν ἐν τῷ ὀφθαλμῷ σοῦ δοκὸν	1	the log that is in your own eye	A log could not literally go into a person’s eye. Jesus is continuing to exaggerate to emphasize his point and make it memorable. Alternate translation: “your own serious faults” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
LUK	6	42	l331	figs-metaphor	ἔκβαλε πρῶτον τὴν δοκὸν ἐκ τοῦ ὀφθαλμοῦ σοῦ	1	first take out the log from your own eye	This phrase is a metaphor. Alternate translation: “First recognize and correct your own serious faults” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	6	42	l332	figs-metaphor	τὸ κάρφος τὸ ἐν τῷ ὀφθαλμῷ τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ σου ἐκβαλεῖν	1	take out the speck of wood that is in the eye of your brother	This phrase is a metaphor. Alternate translation: “to help a fellow believer correct his or her faults” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	6	43	ezb4	grammar-connect-logic-result	γάρ	1	For	Jesus uses the word **for** to introduce the reason for what he said in the previous sentence. Alternate translation: “This is because” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
LUK	6	43	u159	figs-litotes	οὐ γάρ ἐστιν δένδρον καλὸν ποιοῦν καρπὸν σαπρόν; οὐδὲ πάλιν δένδρον σαπρὸν ποιοῦν καρπὸν καλόν	1	For there is no good tree that produces rotten fruit, nor, on the other hand, any rotten tree that produces good fruit	Jesus is twice using a figure of speech that expresses a positive meaning by using a negative word together with a word that is the opposite of the intended meaning. Alternate translation: “For a healthy tree naturally produces good fruit and, on the other hand, an unhealthy tree naturally produces bad fruit” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
LUK	6	43	pi3u	figs-metaphor	οὐ γάρ ἐστιν δένδρον καλὸν ποιοῦν καρπὸν σαπρόν; οὐδὲ πάλιν δένδρον σαπρὸν ποιοῦν καρπὸν καλόν	1	For there is no good tree that produces rotten fruit, nor, on the other hand, any rotten tree that produces good fruit	This is a metaphor. Alternate translation: “For a person of good character naturally says and does helpful things but, on the other hand, a person of bad character naturally says and does harmful things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	6	44	z1vz	figs-activepassive	ἕκαστον…δένδρον ἐκ τοῦ ἰδίου καρποῦ γινώσκεται	1	each tree is known by its own fruit	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who does the action. Alternate translation: “people recognize a tree by the fruit that it bears” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	6	44	l335	figs-metaphor	ἕκαστον…δένδρον ἐκ τοῦ ἰδίου καρποῦ γινώσκεται	1	each tree is known by its own fruit	This phrase is a metaphor. Alternate translation: “each person’s words and actions reveal his or her character” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	6	44	l336	figs-parallelism	οὐ γὰρ ἐξ ἀκανθῶν συλλέγουσιν σῦκα, οὐδὲ ἐκ βάτου σταφυλὴν τρυγῶσιν	1	they do not gather figs from a thornbush, nor do they gather grapes from a briar bush	These two phrases mean the same thing. Jesus is using repetition for emphasis and to capture the interest of his listeners. You do not need to put both phrases in your translation if that might be confusing for your readers. Instead, you could combine them into a single general expression. Alternate translation: “people do not collect the kind of fruit that grows on a tree or a vine from a small, thorny bush” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
LUK	6	44	ns81	translate-unknown	ἀκανθῶν	1	a thornbush	The word **thornbush** refers to a kind of plant that has sharp protective spines on its stem. If your readers would not know what a **thornbush** is, in your translation you could use the name of another plant that does not produce edible fruit. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	6	44	ux87	translate-unknown	βάτου	1	a briar bush	The term **briar bush** refers to a kind of plant that has thorny stems growing in dense clusters. If your readers would not know what a **briar bush** is, in your translation you could use the name of another plant that does not produce edible fruit. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	6	45	fd19	figs-gendernotations	ὁ ἀγαθὸς ἄνθρωπος	1	The good man	Here, the word **man** refers to any person, male or female. Alternate translation: “A righteous person” or “A moral person” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
LUK	6	45	kz5k	figs-metaphor	ἐκ τοῦ ἀγαθοῦ θησαυροῦ τῆς καρδίας	1	from the good treasure of his heart	Jesus is speaking figuratively of the good thoughts of a righteous person as if they were treasures stored deep inside that person. Alternate translation: “from the good things that he keeps deep inside himself” or “from the good things that he values deeply” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	6	45	i93l	figs-metaphor	τῆς καρδίας	1	of his heart	In this expression, the **heart** figuratively represents the thoughts and emotions. Alternate translation: “that he keeps deep inside himself” or “that he values deeply” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	6	45	gpn9	figs-metaphor	προφέρει τὸ ἀγαθόν	1	produces what is good	Producing what is good, the way a tree would produce fruit, is a metaphor for doing what is good. Alternate translation: “does what is good” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	6	45	l337	figs-ellipsis	ἐκ τοῦ πονηροῦ	1	from evil	For rhetorical purposes, Jesus is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would ordinarily need in order to be complete. The meaning can be inferred from earlier in the sentence. Alternate translation: “from the evil treasure of his heart” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
LUK	6	45	y2cj	figs-metaphor	ἐκ τοῦ πονηροῦ	1	from evil	Once the meaning is inferred, it is clear that Jesus is speaking figuratively of the evil thoughts of a wicked person as if they were treasures stored deep inside that person, and of the **heart** figuratively to represent the thoughts and emotions. Alternate translation: “from the evil things that he keeps deep inside himself” or “from the evil things that he values deeply” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	6	45	l338	figs-metaphor	ἐκ…περισσεύματος καρδίας λαλεῖ τὸ στόμα αὐτοῦ	3	out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks	In this expression as well, the **heart** figuratively represents the thoughts and emotions. Alternate translation: “what a person is thinking and feeling is expressed in what he says” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	6	45	jc6z	figs-synecdoche	ἐκ…περισσεύματος καρδίας λαλεῖ τὸ στόμα αὐτοῦ	3	out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks	The phrase **his mouth** represents the person as a whole, in the action of speaking. Alternate translation: “what a person is thinking and feeling comes out in what he says” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
LUK	6	46	a4av		τί δέ με καλεῖτε Κύριε, Κύριε, καὶ οὐ ποιεῖτε ἃ λέγω?	1	And why do you call me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ but not do what I say?	The repetition of these words indicates that these people regularly called Jesus **Lord**. Alternate translation: “And why are you always calling me ‘Lord’ when you do not do what I tell you?’”
LUK	6	47	wwu5		πᾶς ὁ ἐρχόμενος πρός με, καὶ ἀκούων μου τῶν λόγων καὶ ποιῶν αὐτούς, ὑποδείξω ὑμῖν τίνι ἐστὶν ὅμοιος	1	Everyone who is coming to me and hearing my words, and doing them, I will show you what he is like	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could move the last phrase to the beginning of the verse. Alternate translation: “I will tell you what every person is like who comes to me and hears my words and puts them into practice”
LUK	6	47	l339	figs-metonymy	μου τῶν λόγων	1	my words	Jesus uses the term **words** figuratively to refer to the teachings he is giving by using words. Alternate translation: “my teachings” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	6	47	i3tg	figs-simile	ὑποδείξω ὑμῖν τίνι ἐστὶν ὅμοιος	1	I will show you what he is like	Jesus says this to introduce the simile in the next verse. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
LUK	6	48	l340	figs-gendernotations	ἀνθρώπῳ οἰκοδομοῦντι οἰκίαν	1	a man building a house	Here Jesus is using **man** in the generic sense. Alternate translation: “a person building a house” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
LUK	6	48	cw41	translate-unknown	ἔσκαψεν καὶ ἐβάθυνεν καὶ ἔθηκεν θεμέλιον ἐπὶ τὴν πέτραν	1	dug down and dug deep and laid a foundation on the rock	The **foundation** is the part of a **house** that connects it to the ground. People in Jesus’ time dug down into the ground until they reached a layer of solid **rock**, and then they began to build **on the rock**. You could describe this more fully in your translation. Alternatively, if the people of your culture would not be familiar with laying the **foundation** of a **house** on bedrock, you could instead describe how they would ensure that a dwelling was safe and stable. Alternate translation: “dug down deep enough to reach a layer of solid rock and set the foundation of the house on it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	6	48	l341	figs-hendiadys	ἔσκαψεν καὶ ἐβάθυνεν	1	dug down and dug deep	This phrase expresses a single idea by using two words connected with **and.** The expression **dug deep** tells what goal the person had when he or she **dug down**. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express the meaning with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “dug down deep enough” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
LUK	6	48	dp2a	translate-unknown	τὴν πέτραν	1	the rock	This means the layer of hard **rock** that lies deep under the soil. Alternate translation: “bedrock” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	6	48	qc2z		ποταμὸς	1	torrent of water	Alternate translation: “floodwaters”
LUK	6	48	d3gs		προσέρηξεν	1	flowed against	Alternate translation: “crashed against”
LUK	6	48	h75u	figs-metonymy	οὐκ ἴσχυσεν σαλεῦσαι αὐτὴν	1	could not shake it	Jesus is figuratively describing what the waters would do at first to represent what they would ultimately do if they could. This meaning is clear from what he says in the next verse. Alternate translation: “it could not destroy it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	6	48	tu5j	figs-activepassive	διὰ τὸ καλῶς οἰκοδομῆσθαι αὐτήν	1	because it had been built well	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who did the action.

LUK	6	49	sjf5	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	δὲ	1	But	Jesus uses this word to draw a strong contrast to the previous person who built with a foundation. Alternate translation: “However” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
LUK	6	49	l347	figs-ellipsis	ὁ…ἀκούσας καὶ μὴ ποιήσας	1	the one who hears and does not do	Jesus is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. These words can be supplied from [6:47](../06/47.md). Alternate translation: “anyone who hears my teachings but does not put them into practice” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
LUK	6	49	wg4w	figs-simile	ὅμοιός ἐστιν	1	he is like	Jesus says this to introduce the simile that follows in the rest of the verse. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
LUK	6	49	l342	figs-gendernotations	ἀνθρώπῳ οἰκοδομήσαντι οἰκίαν	1	a man who built a house	Here Jesus is using **man** in the generic sense. Alternate translation: “a person who built a house” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
LUK	6	49	yu5r	translate-unknown	ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν χωρὶς θεμελίου	1	on the ground without a foundation	The phrase **on the ground without a foundation** refers to the same method of building as in [6:48](../06/48.md). You could describe this more fully in your translation. Alternatively, if the people of your culture would not be familiar with that building method, you can use the same image for creating a stable building that you used there in your translation. Alternate translation: “without digging down first to create a foundation” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	6	49	bs8c		ᾗ προσέρρηξεν ὁ ποταμός	1	against which the torrent of water flowed	In this context, the word **flowed** indicates violent impact. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “The floodwaters crashed against it”

LUK	7	intro	u8gj			0		# Luke 7 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>1. Jesus does miracles in Capernaum and Nain (7:1-17)<br>2. Jesus responds to messengers from John the Baptist and then teaches about John (7:18-35)<br>3. A woman anoints Jesus with perfume (7:36-50)<br><br>Some translations set quotations from the Old Testament farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text. ULT does this with the quoted material in 7:27.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Centurion<br><br>A centurion was a Roman military commander. The centurion who asked Jesus to heal his slave (Luke 7:2) was doing some unusual things. A Roman soldier, especially an officer, would almost never go to a Jew for help, and most wealthy people did not love or care for their slaves. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/centurion]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]])<br><br>### John’s Baptism<br><br>This chapter refers again to the baptism of John (7:29). John baptized people who wanted to show that they knew they were sinners and that they were sorry for their sin. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/repent]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])<br><br>### “Sinners”<br><br>In 7:34, Jesus describes how the Pharisees said he was a friend of “sinners.” That was the name that the Pharisees used for people whom they thought were disobeying the law of Moses. In reality, it was the Pharisees who were sinful, since they rejected Jesus, the Savior whom God had sent. This situation can be understood as irony. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])<br><br>### Washing feet<br><br>The feet of the people in the ancient Near East were very dirty because they wore sandals and the roads and trails were dusty in the dry season and muddy in the wet season. Only slaves washed other people’s feet. The woman who washed Jesus’ feet was showing him great honor.

LUK	7	5	cny7	figs-exclusive	τὸ ἔθνος ἡμῶν	1	our nation	Here, **our nation** refers to the Jewish people.

LUK	7	6	ez29	figs-idiom	ὑπὸ τὴν στέγην μου εἰσέλθῃς	1	that you would come under my roof	**Come under my roof** is an idiom that means “come into my house.” If your language has an idiom that means “come into my dwelling,” consider using it here in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	7	7	m9ue	figs-metonymy	εἰπὲ λόγῳ	1	speak with a word	The centurion recognized that Jesus could heal the servant just by speaking. He understood Jesus did not need to travel all the way to his home. The term **word** expresses the means by which Jesus would speak. Alternate translation: “just give a command” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	7	7	m6v8		ὁ παῖς μου	1	my servant	This is not the same word for **servant** that Luke and the centurion use in the rest of this passage. This word ordinarily means “boy.” This may indicate that the servant was young, or it may show the centurion’s affection for him. Alternate translation: “my young servant” or “my dear servant”

LUK	7	9	j76u	figs-explicit	οὐδὲ ἐν τῷ Ἰσραὴλ τοσαύτην πίστιν εὗρον	1	not even in Israel have I found such faith	The implication is that Jesus expected Jewish people to have this kind of **faith**, but they did not. He did not expect Gentiles to have this kind of **faith**, yet this man did. It may be helpful to say this explicitly in your translation. Alternate translation: “I have not found anyone among the Israelites who trusts me as much as this Gentile does” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	7	9	l351	figs-metonymy	οὐδὲ ἐν τῷ Ἰσραὴλ	1	not even in Israel	Jesus used the name of the nation, **Israel**, to represent the people who belong to that nation. Alternate translation: “not even in any Israelite” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	7	9	l352	figs-idiom	τοσαύτην πίστιν εὗρον	1	have I found such faith	Here, **found** is an idiom. The word does not suggest that Jesus was searching for something he had lost. Alternate translation: “have I encountered such faith” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	7	10	g4ny	figs-activepassive	οἱ πεμφθέντες	1	those who had been sent	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who did the action.

LUK	7	11	l353	writing-newevent	καὶ ἐγένετο	1	And it happened	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
LUK	7	11	l354	figs-idiom	ἐν τῷ ἑξῆς	1	on the next day	Luke may be using the term **day** figuratively to refer a particular time, as UST suggests by saying “soon after that.” However, this could also mean literally **the next day**. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

LUK	7	12	l357	writing-participants	ἐξεκομίζετο τεθνηκὼς	1	one who had died was being carried out	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new character into the story. If your language has its own way of doing that, you can use it here in your translation. Alternate translation: “there was a man who had died, and he was being carried out of the city” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
LUK	7	12	zr69	figs-activepassive	ἐξεκομίζετο τεθνηκὼς μονογενὴς υἱὸς τῇ μητρὶ αὐτοῦ	1	one who had died was being carried out, the only son of his mother	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who was doing the action. It may be helpful to break the sentence here. Alternate translation: “people were carrying a man who had died out of the city. He was his mother's only son” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

LUK	7	12	i5iv	figs-explicit	μονογενὴς υἱὸς τῇ μητρὶ αὐτοῦ; καὶ αὐτὴ ἦν χήρα	1	the only begotten son of his mother (and she was a widow)	The implication is that in this culture, when her son died, the woman lost her only means of support, since her husband had also died. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “Now he was his mother’s only son, and she was a widow, so he had been her only means of support” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	7	13	l359		ὁ Κύριος	1	the Lord	Here Luke refers to Jesus by a respectful title. Alternate translation: “the Lord Jesus”

LUK	7	16	rf1k	figs-personification	ἔλαβεν…φόβος πάντας	1	fear seized all of them	Luke speaks of this **fear** figuratively as if it were something that could actively take hold of everyone in the crowd.

LUK	7	17	g4zt	figs-personification	ἐξῆλθεν ὁ λόγος οὗτος…περὶ αὐτοῦ	1	this word about him went out	Luke speaks figuratively of this **word** (that is, those sayings) as if it were something that could spread around actively by itself. His expression means that people said these things about Jesus to other people, and those people then repeated them to still more people. Alternate translation: “people spread these sayings about Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
LUK	7	18	r11g	writing-newevent	ἀπήγγειλαν Ἰωάννῃ οἱ μαθηταὶ αὐτοῦ περὶ πάντων τούτων	1	his disciples reported to John concerning all these things	This sentence introduces a new event in the story.

LUK	7	18	r11x	writing-newevent	οἱ μαθηταὶ αὐτοῦ	1	his disciples	The term **his** refers to John the Baptist, not to Jesus. Alternate translation: “the disciples of John” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])

LUK	7	18	jf5m	figs-explicit	πάντων τούτων	1	all these things	The implication is that **all these things** refers to Jesus healing the centurion’s servant and restoring the life of the widow’s son.

LUK	7	19	l400	figs-explicit	ὁ ἐρχόμενος	1	the one who is coming	This expression implicitly means “the Messiah.” If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “the Messiah” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	7	20	ftb7	figs-quotesinquotes	οἱ ἄνδρες εἶπαν, Ἰωάννης ὁ Βαπτιστὴς ἀπέστειλεν ἡμᾶς πρὸς σὲ λέγων, σὺ εἶ ὁ ἐρχόμενος ἢ ἄλλον προσδοκῶμεν?	1	the men said, “John the Baptist has sent us to you to say, ‘Are you the one who is coming, or should we expect another?’”	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “the men told Jesus that John the Baptist had sent them to him to ask, ‘Are you the one who is coming, or should we expect someone else?’” or “the men said, ‘John the Baptist has sent us to you to ask if you are the one who is coming, or whether we should expect someone else.’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	7	20	l366	translate-names	Ἰωάννης ὁ Βαπτιστὴς	1	John the Baptist	Here John’s disciples use the term **Baptist** as a title to identify the man named John who had sent them. The term means “one who baptizes.” Because the word “Baptist” is associated with a group of churches in many parts of the world, if your readers would misunderstand this, you could use a different form of the word as a title, as UST does. Alternatively, you could use a phrase. Alternate translation: “John the Baptizer” or “John, the one who baptizes” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	7	20	l367		λέγων	1	to say	Alternate translation: “to ask”

LUK	7	21	a7sm	figs-ellipsis	ἐθεράπευσεν πολλοὺς ἀπὸ νόσων, καὶ μαστίγων, καὶ πνευμάτων πονηρῶν	1	healed many from sicknesses and afflictions and evil spirits	Here Luke is telling the story in a compressed way, and he does not distinguish clearly between healing of sickness and deliverance from evil spirits. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could make that distinction more explicitly. Alternate translation: “he healed many people of sicknesses that they were suffering from, and he drove evil spirits out of many people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
LUK	7	21	l370	figs-hendiadys	νόσων, καὶ μαστίγων	1	sicknesses and afflictions	The phrase **sicknesses and afflictions** expresses a single idea by using two words connected with **and.** The word **afflictions** describes the effect of the **sicknesses** on the people who had them.

LUK	7	22	l372	figs-youdual	πορευθέντες…εἴδετε	1	you have gone … you have seen	Since Jesus is speaking to two men, **you** would be dual, if your language uses that form. Otherwise, the word would be plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
LUK	7	22	fvz7	figs-activepassive	λεπροὶ καθαρίζονται…νεκροὶ ἐγείρονται, πτωχοὶ εὐαγγελίζονται	1	lepers are being cleansed … the dead are being raised back to life, the poor are being told the gospel	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express all of these things with active forms. Alternate translation: “people who had leprosy no longer have that disease … people who were dead are coming back to life, poor people are hearing the good news” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	7	22	l373	figs-explicit	λεπροὶ καθαρίζονται	1	lepers are being cleansed	As in [5:12](../05/12.md), since the lepers were unclean because of their leprosy, the implication is that Jesus healed them from the disease. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “people who had leprosy no longer have that disease” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	7	22	qbe3	figs-nominaladj	κωφοὶ…νεκροὶ…πτωχοὶ	1	the deaf … the dead … the poor	Luke is using these adjectives as nouns.

Alternate translation: “people who were deaf … people who were dead … poor people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
LUK	7	23	y4px	figs-activepassive	μακάριός ἐστιν ὃς ἐὰν μὴ σκανδαλισθῇ ἐν ἐμοί	1	blessed is anyone who is not offended by me	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form.

LUK	7	24	abcd	writing-pronouns	ἤρξατο λέγειν	1	he began to say	Here the pronoun **he** refers to Jesus. Alternate translation: “Jesus began to say” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])

Jesus is using these questions as a teaching tool. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could show that consequently he expects a negative answer. You could also translate these words as a statement. Alternate translation: “Did you go out into the desert just to see a reed that the wind was shaking? Of course not!” or “Surely you did not go out into the desert just to see a reed that the wind was shaking.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	7	24	l374	figs-activepassive	κάλαμον ὑπὸ ἀνέμου σαλευόμενον	1	A reed shaken by the wind	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “A reed that the wind was shaking” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	7	24	gbv9	figs-explicit	κάλαμον ὑπὸ ἀνέμου σαλευόμενον	1	A reed shaken by the wind	The implication seems to be that a reed swaying in the breeze by the banks of the Jordan River is a commonplace sight that no one would make a trip out into the desert just to see. Alternate translation: “An ordinary thing such as a reed that the wind was shaking” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	7	25	tcp3	figs-rquestion	ἀλλὰ τί ἐξήλθατε ἰδεῖν? ἄνθρωπον ἐν μαλακοῖς ἱματίοις ἠμφιεσμένον?	1	But what did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothes?	Jesus is using these questions as a teaching tool. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could show that consequently he expects a negative answer. You could also translate these words as a statement. Alternate translation: “Did you go out to see a man wearing splendid clothing? Of course not!” or “You certainly did not go out to see a man wearing splendid clothing.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	7	25	a1wu	figs-explicit	ἄνθρωπον ἐν μαλακοῖς ἱματίοις ἠμφιεσμένον?	1	A man dressed in soft clothes?	Luke assumes that readers will know that John wore crude, rugged clothing. Like his residence in the desert, his clothing was a symbolic protest against the established order. As such, it would have been offensive rather than attractive. So no one would have gone out to see a person dressed that way. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “A man wearing splendid clothing? You would not have gone to hear John if that was what you wanted to see” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	7	25	l375	figs-explicit	ἐν μαλακοῖς ἱματίοις ἠμφιεσμένον	1	dressed in soft clothes	The term **soft clothes** refers to luxurious clothes, since normal clothing was rough. Alternate translation: “wearing splendid clothing” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	7	25	l376	figs-activepassive	ἐν μαλακοῖς ἱματίοις ἠμφιεσμένον	1	dressed in soft clothes	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “wearing splendid clothing” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	7	25	l377	figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	behold	Jesus uses the term **behold** to get the crowd to focus their attention on what he is about to say. Alternate translation: “Listen carefully now” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	7	25	nn75	figs-explicit	τοῖς βασιλείοις	1	king’s palaces	**Palaces** are large, elaborate houses where kings or queens would live. The implication is that a celebrity watcher might go to a palace to try to catch a glimpse of royalty. But certainly no one would go out into the desert to try to see someone famous. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	7	26	ym8l	figs-rquestion	ἀλλὰ τί ἐξήλθατε ἰδεῖν? προφήτην?	1	But what did you go out to see? A prophet?	Jesus is giving the answer to the repeated question that he has been using as a teaching tool. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could show that this time the question leads to a positive answer. You could also translate this as a statement. Alternate translation: “Did you go out to see a prophet? Yes, that was why!” or “You actually went out to see a prophet.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	7	26	ix16		ναί, λέγω ὑμῖν	1	Yes, I say to you	Jesus says this to emphasize the importance of what he will say next. Alternate translation: “Now listen carefully”
LUK	7	26	r7ud	figs-idiom	περισσότερον προφήτου	1	more than a prophet	This phrase is an idiom that means that John was indeed a prophet, but that he was even greater than a typical prophet. Alternate translation: “not just an ordinary prophet” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	7	27	cg3r	figs-activepassive	οὗτός ἐστιν περὶ οὗ γέγραπται	1	This is he concerning whom it is written	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who did the action. Alternate translation: “This is the one about whom one of the prophets wrote” or “John is the one about whom the prophet Malachi wrote” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	7	27	wt2m	figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	Behold	God, speaking through the prophet Malachi, uses the term **behold** to emphasize the importance of what he is about to say. Alternate translation: “Now pay attention” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	7	27	s8hg	figs-metaphor	πρὸ προσώπου σου	1	before your face	Here, **face** figuratively means the front of a person. Alternate translation, as in UST: “ahead of you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	7	27	cc5u	figs-you	σου…σου	1	your … you	The words **your** and **you** are singular in both cases because God is speaking to the Messiah individually in the quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
LUK	7	27	l378	figs-metaphor	ὃς κατασκευάσει τὴν ὁδόν σου ἔμπροσθέν σου	1	who will prepare your way before you	As in [3:4](../03/04.md), to make a **way** or a road is a figurative expression that means to help people get ready for the coming of the Messiah. Alternate translation: “who will help people get ready for you to come” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	7	28	yz6b		λέγω ὑμῖν	1	I say to you	Jesus uses this phrase to focus the crowd’s attention on what he will say next. Alternate translation: “Now listen carefully”
LUK	7	28	rr11	figs-idiom	ἐν γεννητοῖς γυναικῶν	1	among those born of women	The phrase **those born of women** is an idiom that refers to all people. Alternate translation: “of all the people who have ever lived” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	7	28	hfqf	figs-activepassive	ἐν γεννητοῖς γυναικῶν	1	among those born of women	If you would like to retain the idiom but your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “among those whom women have borne” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	7	28	gfz7	figs-litotes	μείζων…Ἰωάννου οὐδείς ἐστιν	1	no one is greater than John	Here Jesus is using a figure of speech that expresses a strong positive meaning by using a negative term together with a word that is the opposite of the intended meaning. Alternate translation: “John is the greatest” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
LUK	7	28	c33u	figs-nominaladj	ὁ…μικρότερος	1	the least	Jesus is using the adjective **least** as a noun in order to indicate a kind of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “the least important person” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
LUK	7	28	l379	figs-abstractnouns	ἐν τῇ Βασιλείᾳ τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	in the kingdom of God	See how you decided to translate the phrase **the kingdom of God** in [4:43](../04/43.md). If your readers would misunderstand the abstract noun **kingdom**, you could express the idea behind it with a verb such as “rule.” Alternate translation: “whose life God is ruling” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
LUK	7	28	r81b	figs-explicit	μείζων αὐτοῦ ἐστιν	1	is greater than he	The implication is that being part of the kingdom of God is greater than any human distinctive. So anyone who is part of God’s kingdom is greater than even John, whom Jesus said was the greatest person who had ever lived before the coming of the kingdom. Alternate translation: “is greater than John is because they are part of something greater than anything that is human” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	7	29	idv8	grammar-connect-logic-result	ἐδικαίωσαν τὸν Θεόν, βαπτισθέντες τὸ βάπτισμα Ἰωάννου	1	declared God to be righteous, having been baptized with the baptism of John	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the action that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “because they had come to John for baptism, declared God to be righteous” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
LUK	7	29	m5cn	figs-explicit	ἐδικαίωσαν τὸν Θεόν	1	declared God to be righteous	The implication is that the people agreed that God had been right to send John to tell them to repent of their sins. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “agreed that God had been right to send John to tell them to repent of their sins” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	7	29	s9v6	figs-activepassive	βαπτισθέντες τὸ βάπτισμα Ἰωάννου	1	having been baptized with the baptism of John	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “because they had come to John for baptism” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	7	30	l380	translate-unknown	νομικοὶ	1	lawyers	Here and elsewhere in the book, the term **lawyers** does not mean people who would represent clients and argue cases in court or draw up legal documents. Rather, it refers to experts in the law of Moses and its application to various situations. Alternate translation: “experts in the Jewish law” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	7	30	v8f5	grammar-connect-logic-result	τὴν βουλὴν τοῦ Θεοῦ ἠθέτησαν εἰς ἑαυτούς, μὴ βαπτισθέντες ὑπ’ αὐτοῦ	1	rejected the purpose of God for themselves, not having been baptized by him	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the action that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “because they had not come to John for baptism, rejected what God wanted them to do” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
LUK	7	30	wqc3	figs-activepassive	μὴ βαπτισθέντες ὑπ’ αὐτοῦ	1	not having been baptized by him	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “because John had not baptized them” or “because they had not come to John for baptism” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	7	31	cs1j	figs-rquestion	τίνι οὖν ὁμοιώσω τοὺς ἀνθρώπους τῆς γενεᾶς ταύτης, καὶ τίνι εἰσὶν ὅμοιοι?	1	To what, then, will I compare the men of this generation? And what are they like?	Jesus is using these questions as a teaching tool, to introduce a comparison. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate them as statements. Alternate translation: “This is what I compare the people of this time to. This is what they are like” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	7	31	ix8z	figs-parallelism	τίνι οὖν ὁμοιώσω τοὺς ἀνθρώπους τῆς γενεᾶς ταύτης, καὶ τίνι εἰσὶν ὅμοιοι?	1	To what, then, will I compare the men of this generation? And what are they like?	These two phrases mean the same thing. Jesus is using repetition for emphasis and to capture the interest of his listeners. You do not need to put both phrases in your translation if that might be confusing for your readers. Alternate translation: “What should I compare the people of this time to?” or “This is what I compare the people of this time to” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
LUK	7	31	ec4k	figs-gendernotations	τοὺς ἀνθρώπους τῆς γενεᾶς ταύτης	1	the men of this generation	Jesus is using the term **men** in a generic sense that includes all people. Alternate translation: “the people of this generation” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
LUK	7	32	n8yp	figs-simile	ὅμοιοί εἰσιν	1	They are like	These words are the beginning of Jesus’ comparison. His opponents complain about John being too austere, and they complain about him not being austere enough, just like children who complain when other children don’t dance with them, and then complain again when they don’t cry with them. Since Jesus explains this comparison in the next two verses, you do not need to explain it here in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
LUK	7	32	f7hg	translate-unknown	ἀγορᾷ	1	marketplace	This means a large, open-air area where people come to sell their goods. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	7	32	l381	figs-metonymy	ηὐλήσαμεν ὑμῖν	1	We played a flute for you	The children are referring to the **flute** to indicate that they played a happy, upbeat tune, for which the **flute** was well suited. Alternate translation: “We played a happy tune for you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	7	32	xgg9	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	καὶ	1	and	The children are expressing a contrast between what they expected their playmates to do and what those playmates actually did. Alternate translation: “but” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
LUK	7	32	m2k3	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	καὶ	1	and	Once again the children are expressing a contrast between what they expected their playmates to do and what those playmates actually did. Alternate translation: “but” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
LUK	7	33	kbc7	figs-synecdoche	μὴ ἐσθίων ἄρτον	1	neither eating bread	This could mean one of two things. Either way, Jesus is using one kind of food, **bread**, figuratively to represent all kinds of food. (1) It could refer to the way that John lived on whatever he could find to eat in the desert. Alternate translation: “not eating regular food” (2) It could mean that John often went without eating as a devotional practice. Alternate translation: “frequently fasting” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
LUK	7	33	wka1	figs-quotesinquotes	λέγετε, δαιμόνιον ἔχει	1	you say, ‘He has a demon’	Luke is quoting Jesus, and Jesus is quoting what the Pharisees were saying about John. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “you say that he has a demon” or “you accuse him of having a demon” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	7	34	k33e	figs-123person	ὁ Υἱὸς τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου	1	the Son of Man	Here Jesus is referring to himself in the third person. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this in the first person. Alternate translation: “I, the Son of Man” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
LUK	7	34	l382	figs-explicit	ὁ Υἱὸς τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου	1	the Son of Man	See how you translated this title in [5:24](../05/24.md). In this case the title highlights Jesus’ identification with humanity in the special role that God has given him. Alternate translation: “I, the Messiah” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	7	34	s1um	figs-quotesinquotes	λέγετε, ἰδοὺ, ἄνθρωπος φάγος καὶ οἰνοπότης, φίλος τελωνῶν καὶ ἁμαρτωλῶν	1	you say, ‘Behold, a man, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and of sinners!’	Luke is quoting Jesus, and Jesus is quoting what the Pharisees were saying about him. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “you say that he eats and drinks too much and that he is a friend of tax collectors and sinners” or (if you used the first person for the title “Son of Man”) “you say that I eat and drink too much and that I am a friend of tax collectors and sinners” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	7	34	l383	figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	Behold	**Behold** focuses the attention of the listener on what the speaker is about to say. Alternate translation: “Now this is” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	7	34	am9s		ἄνθρωπος φάγος	1	a man, a glutton	Alternate translation: “a man who is a glutton” or “a man who eats too much”
LUK	7	34	chu4		ἄνθρωπος…οἰνοπότης	1	a man, … a drunkard	Alternate translation: “a man who is a drunkard” or “a man who drinks too much alcohol”
LUK	7	35	ba4g	writing-proverbs	ἐδικαιώθη ἡ σοφία ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν τέκνων αὐτῆς	1	wisdom is justified by all her children	This appears to be a proverb, a short popular saying of the culture, that Jesus applied to this situation. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “the saying is true that wisdom is justified by all her children” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-proverbs]])
LUK	7	35	l384	figs-idiom	ἐδικαιώθη ἡ σοφία ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν τέκνων αὐτῆς	1	wisdom is justified by all her children	This proverb likely uses a Hebrew idiom in which the “sons” or **children** of a thing share its qualities. Alternate translation: “wisdom is justified by people who are wise themselves” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	7	35	l385	figs-activepassive	ἐδικαιώθη ἡ σοφία ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν τέκνων αὐτῆς	1	wisdom is justified by all her children	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “wise people recognize when someone else is following a wise course” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	7	36	fd2c	writing-newevent	ἠρώτα δέ τις αὐτὸν τῶν Φαρισαίων, ἵνα φάγῃ μετ’ αὐτοῦ	1	Then one of the Pharisees requested him to eat with him	This phrase introduces a new event. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
LUK	7	36	lhd4	writing-participants	τις…τῶν Φαρισαίων	1	one of the Pharisees	This phrase also introduces the Pharisee into the story. In [7:40](../07/40.md), Jesus addresses him as Simon. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could give his name here, as UST does. Alternate translation: “a Pharisee named Simon” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
LUK	7	36	dy31	translate-unknown	κατεκλίθη	1	he reclined to eat	See how you translated this in [5:29](../05/29.md). It was the custom in this culture for dinner guests to eat while lying comfortably around the table on banqueting couches. Alternate translation: “he took his place at the table” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	7	37	l386	figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	behold	Luke uses the term **behold** to calls the reader’s attention to what he is about to say. Your language may have a similar expression that you can use here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	7	37	a9iu	writing-participants	γυνὴ ἥτις ἦν ἐν τῇ πόλει	1	there was a woman in the city	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new character into the story. If your language has its own way of doing that, you can use it here in your translation. Alternate translation: “there was woman who lived in that city” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
LUK	7	37	x4sk	figs-explicit	ἁμαρτωλός	1	who was a sinner	Luke is speaking from the perspective of the Pharisee when he says that the woman was a **sinner**. Since the Pharisee would likely not have known her personally, this is an implicit reference to her reputation. She may have been a prostitute, as UST suggests. Alternate translation: “who had a reputation for living a sinful life” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	7	37	l387	figs-explicit	κομίσασα	1	she brought	In this culture, if people wanted to hear what someone’s special dinner guest had to say, they were allowed to come and stand around the walls of the banqueting hall and listen, even if they had not been invited to share in the meal. And so this woman was allowed to enter and listen to Jesus. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that specifically. Alternate translation: “she came into the banquet hall as a visitor, bringing” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	7	37	apx8	translate-unknown	ἀλάβαστρον	1	an alabaster jar	The word **alabaster** is the name of a soft, white stone. People stored precious and valuable items in jars made from alabaster. Alternate translation: “a jar made of soft, white stone” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	7	37	a954	translate-unknown	μύρου	1	of perfumed oil	This oil had fragrant additives. To make a nice smell, people would rub the oil on themselves or sprinkle their clothing with it. Alternate translation: “that contained oil with perfume in it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	7	38	v5xh	figs-explicitinfo	ταῖς θριξὶν τῆς κεφαλῆς αὐτῆς	1	with the hair of her head	In your language, it might seem that this phrase expresses unnecessary extra information. If so, you can abbreviate it. Alternate translation: “with her hair” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo]])
LUK	7	38	i93v		ἤλειφεν τῷ μύρῳ	1	anointing them with the perfumed oil	Alternate translation: “pouring perfume on them”
LUK	7	39	u455	figs-quotemarks	εἶπεν ἐν ἑαυτῷ λέγων	1	he said to himself, saying	As noted in [3:10](../03/10.md), Luke often uses the word **saying** to introduce a quotation. Particularly in cases like this one, if you indicate the quotation in some other way, such as with quotation marks, you do not need to represent this word in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
LUK	7	39	xc9v	grammar-connect-condition-contrary	οὗτος εἰ ἦν προφήτης, ἐγίνωσκεν ἂν τίς καὶ ποταπὴ ἡ γυνὴ, ἥτις ἅπτεται αὐτοῦ, ὅτι ἁμαρτωλός ἐστιν	1	If this man were a prophet, he would know who and of what type the woman is who is touching him, that she is a sinner	This Pharisee is making a conditional statement that sounds hypothetical, but he is already convinced that the condition is not true. He has concluded that Jesus must not be a prophet, because he allowed this sinful woman to touch him, and a prophet would have known she was sinful and not allowed that. Alternate translation: “Jesus must not be a prophet, because if he were, he would know that the woman who is touching him is a sinner” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-contrary]])
LUK	7	39	tbq3	figs-explicit	τίς καὶ ποταπὴ ἡ γυνὴ, ἥτις ἅπτεται αὐτοῦ, ὅτι ἁμαρτωλός ἐστιν	1	who and of what type the woman is who is touching him, that she is a sinner	Simon assumed that a prophet would never allow a sinner to touch him. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state his assumption explicitly. Alternate translation: “that this woman is a sinner, and he would not allow her to touch him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	7	40	l388	figs-hendiadys	ἀποκριθεὶς ὁ Ἰησοῦς εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτόν	1	answering Jesus said to him	Together the words **answering** and **said** mean that Jesus responded to what the Pharisee was thinking. Alternate translation: “Jesus responded to him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
LUK	7	40	u3cg	translate-names	Σίμων	1	Simon	This was the name of the Pharisee who invited Jesus into his home. This was not Simon Peter. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	7	40	l389		ὁ δέ, Διδάσκαλε, εἰπέ, φησίν	1	And he says, “Say it, Teacher!”	To call attention to a development in the story, Luke uses the present tense in past narration. If it would not be natural to do that in your language, you can use the past tense in your translation. Alternate translation: “And he said, ‘Say it, Teacher!’”
LUK	7	40	l390	figs-imperative	Διδάσκαλε, εἰπέ	1	Say it, Teacher!	Simon is inviting Jesus to speak, not ordering him to speak. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could translate his words as more of an invitation. You could also translate them as a question, as UST does. Alternate translation: “Go ahead and say it.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
LUK	7	40	l391		Διδάσκαλε	1	Teacher	This was a respectful title. You can translate it with an equivalent term that your language and culture would use.
LUK	7	41	sv92	figs-parables	δύο χρεοφιλέται ἦσαν: δανιστῇ τινι	1	There were two debtors	To help Simon the Pharisee understand what he wants to teach him, Jesus tells him a story. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “Then Jesus told him this story to help him understand. ‘There were two debtors’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])
LUK	7	41	fcq6		δύο χρεοφιλέται ἦσαν: δανιστῇ τινι	1	There were two debtors to a certain moneylender	Alternate translation: “Two different people owed money to the same moneylender”
LUK	7	41	snz6	translate-bmoney	δηνάρια πεντακόσια	1	500 denarii	The word **denarii** is the plural of “denarius.” A denarius was a silver coin equivalent to a day’s wage. You could try to express this amount in terms of current monetary values, but that might cause your Bible translation to become outdated and inaccurate, since those values can change over time. So instead you might state something more general or give the equivalent in wages. Alternate translation: “500 silver coins” or “an amount equivalent to a year and a half’s wages” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney]])
LUK	7	41	i92j	translate-bmoney	ὁ δὲ ἕτερος πεντήκοντα	1	and the other 50	Alternate translation: “the other person owed 50 silver coins” or “the other person owed an amount equal to 50 days’ wages” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney]])
LUK	7	42	l392	figs-ellipsis	μὴ ἐχόντων αὐτῶν ἀποδοῦναι	1	When they did not have to repay	Jesus is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages in order to be complete. He is not saying that the men no longer needed to repay these debts. Rather, he is saying that they did not have enough money to repay the lender what they owed him. Alternate translation: “When they were not able to repay their debts” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
LUK	7	42	lbq6	figs-idiom	ἀμφοτέροις ἐχαρίσατο	1	he forgave them both	This does not mean literally that the lender decided he would not hold their failure to repay against them. Rather, it is an idiom that means that he told them they did not have to repay the money. Alternate translation: “he canceled both of their debts” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	7	43	l393	figs-hendiadys	ἀποκριθεὶς Σίμων εἶπεν	1	Simon answering said	Together the words **answering** and **said** mean that Simon responded to the question that Jesus asked him. Alternate translation: “Simon responded” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
LUK	7	43	l394	figs-ellipsis	ὑπολαμβάνω ὅτι ᾧ τὸ πλεῖον ἐχαρίσατο	1	I suppose that the one to whom he forgave the most	Simon leaves out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages in order to be complete. Alternate translation: “I suppose that the one to whom he forgave the most will love him the most” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
LUK	7	43	uyj6		ὑπολαμβάνω	1	I suppose	Simon was cautious about his answer. Alternate translation: “Probably”
LUK	7	43	zqz4		ὀρθῶς ἔκρινας	1	You have judged correctly	Alternate translation: “You are right”
LUK	7	44	s7g6	translate-symaction	στραφεὶς πρὸς τὴν γυναῖκα	1	he turned to the woman	Jesus **turned to the woman** in order to direct Simon’s attention to her.

Alternate translation: “Jesus turned to the woman so that Simon would look at her” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
LUK	7	44	l395	figs-rquestion	βλέπεις ταύτην τὴν γυναῖκα?	1	Do you see this woman?	Jesus does not expect Simon to tell him whether he can **see** the **woman**. Rather, he is using the question as a teaching tool, to focus Simon’s attention on her as an example of showing love and gratitude. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate Jesus’ words as a statement. Alternate translation: “I want you to consider this woman.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	7	44	mw7d	figs-explicit	ὕδωρ μοι ἐπὶ πόδας οὐκ ἔδωκας	1	You did not give me water for my feet	It was a basic responsibility of a host to provide **water** and a towel for guests to wash and dry their **feet** after walking on dusty roads. Alternate translation: “You did not provide me with anything to wash my feet, as a considerate host would have done” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	7	44	mw58	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	οὐκ ἔδωκας; αὕτη δὲ	1	You did not give … but she	In this verse and the next two verses, Jesus uses such phrases to contrast Simon’s lack of courtesy with the woman’s extreme actions of gratitude. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
LUK	7	44	am5z	figs-explicit	αὕτη…τοῖς δάκρυσιν ἔβρεξέν μου τοὺς πόδας	1	she has wet my feet with her tears	The woman used **her tears** in place of the missing water.

LUK	7	44	ld62	figs-explicit	καὶ ταῖς θριξὶν αὐτῆς ἐξέμαξεν	1	and wiped them with her hair	The woman used **her hair** in place of the missing towel.

Alternate translation: “and she has dried my feet with her hair in place of the towel you did not provide” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	7	45	xj92	figs-explicit	φίλημά μοι οὐκ ἔδωκας	1	You did not give me a kiss	It was customary in this culture for a host to greet a guest with a **kiss** on the cheek. Simon did not do this for Jesus. Alternate translation: “You did not greet me with a kiss on the cheek, as a welcoming host would have done” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	7	45	r2jj	figs-doublenegatives	οὐ διέλιπεν καταφιλοῦσά μου τοὺς πόδας	1	has not stopped kissing my feet	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could use a positive expression to translate this double negative that consists of the negative particle **not** and the negative verb **stopped**. Alternate translation: “has continued to kiss my feet” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
LUK	7	45	u3er	translate-symaction	οὐ διέλιπεν καταφιλοῦσά μου τοὺς πόδας	1	has not stopped kissing my feet	The woman kissed the **feet** of Jesus, rather than his cheek, as a sign of extreme repentance and humility. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “has continued to kiss my feet to show her repentance and humility” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
LUK	7	46	j8wj	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	οὐκ ἤλειψας; αὕτη δὲ	1	You did not anoint … but she	Jesus continues to contrast Simon’s poor hospitality with the actions of the woman. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
LUK	7	46	le9a	figs-explicit	ἐλαίῳ τὴν κεφαλήν μου οὐκ ἤλειψας	1	You did not anoint my head with oil	It was the custom in this culture to welcome an honored guest by pouring refreshing olive **oil** on his **head**.

LUK	7	47	clu2	figs-activepassive	ἀφέωνται αἱ ἁμαρτίαι αὐτῆς αἱ πολλαί	1	her sins, which were many, have been forgiven	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who has done the action. Alternate translation: “God has forgiven her many sins” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	7	47	l396	figs-explicit	ὅτι ἠγάπησεν πολύ	1	for she loved much	The implication is that her display of love was the evidence that her sins were forgiven. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “We can tell this because she has shown that she greatly loves the one who forgave her” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	7	47	jql4		ὅτι ἠγάπησεν πολύ	1	for she loved much	Your language may require you to state the object of **loved**. Alternate translation: “because she greatly loves the one who forgave her”
LUK	7	47	qd9q	figs-explicit	ᾧ δὲ ὀλίγον ἀφίεται, ὀλίγον ἀγαπᾷ	1	the one to whom little is forgiven loves little	In this sentence Jesus states a general principle. However, he is saying implicitly that Simon specifically has shown very little love for him. A further implication is that **one to whom little is forgiven** is actually someone who thinks he is better than others and mistakenly thinks he does not need to be forgiven for very much. Alternate translation: “a person like you who thinks that God has only had to forgive him for a few things does not show much love” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	7	47	l397	figs-activepassive	ᾧ…ὀλίγον ἀφίεται	1	the one to whom little is forgiven	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who has done the action.

LUK	7	48	c7hj	writing-pronouns	εἶπεν δὲ αὐτῇ	1	Then he said to her	The pronoun **he** refers to Jesus, not to Simon. The word **her** refers to the woman. Alternate translation: “Then Jesus said to the woman” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
LUK	7	48	lq5v	figs-activepassive	ἀφέωνταί σου αἱ ἁμαρτίαι	1	Your sins are forgiven	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who has done the action.

LUK	7	49	ie4z	figs-rquestion	τίς οὗτός ἐστιν ὃς καὶ ἁμαρτίας ἀφίησιν?	1	Who is this who even forgives sins?	The religious leaders knew that only God could forgive sins. They did not believe that Jesus was God. So they are using the question form to make an accusation. Alternate translation: “This man is not God, so he cannot forgive sins!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	7	50	lje8	figs-abstractnouns	ἡ πίστις σου σέσωκέν σε	1	Your faith has saved you	If your readers would misunderstand the abstract noun **faith**, you could express the idea behind it with a verb such as “trust.” Alternate translation: “you have trusted in God, and God has saved you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
LUK	7	50	l398	figs-personification	ἡ πίστις σου σέσωκέν σε	1	Your faith has saved you	Jesus speaks figuratively of the woman’s **faith** as if it had actively **saved** her. He means that it provided the conditions for her to receive salvation from God. Alternate translation: “you have trusted in God, and God has saved you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
LUK	7	50	sp2u	figs-explicit	πορεύου εἰς εἰρήνην	1	Go in peace	This was a way of saying goodbye while giving a blessing at the same time. It also reassured the woman, despite the disapproval of the religious leaders. Alternate translation: “May God give you peace as you go” or “You may go now, and do not worry about your sins anymore” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	8	intro	ba3i			0		# Luke 8 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>1. Jesus teaches the crowds with parables (8:1-21)<br>2. Jesus calms a storm on the Sea of Galilee (8:22-25)<br>3. Jesus drives out many demons from a man (8:26-39)<br>4. Jesus heals a woman and restores a dead girl to life (8:40-55)<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Miracles<br><br>In this chapter, Jesus makes a storm stop by speaking to it, he makes a dead girl alive by speaking to her, and he makes evil spirits leave a man by speaking to them. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/miracle]])<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Parables<br><br>Parables were short stories that Jesus told so that people who wanted to believe in him could easily understand the lesson he was trying to teach them. But people who did not want to believe in him would not be able to understand the message (Luke 8:4-15).<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Brothers and sisters<br><br>Most people use the terms “brother” and “sister” for those who have the same parents as they do. They think of them as some of the most important people in their lives. Some people also call those with the same grandparents “brother” and “sister.” In this chapter, Jesus says that the most important people to him are those who obey his Father in heaven. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/brother]])<br><br>## Important textual issues in this chapter<br><br>### “having spent all her living on doctors”<br><br>In [8:43](../08/43.md), some ancient manuscripts of the Bible have the phrase “having spent all her living on doctors,” but other manuscripts do not. ULT includes the phrase in its text, but it mentions in a footnote that scholars are divided as to whether it was an original part of the book of Luke. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to include the phrase if it does, but leave it out if it does not include it. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to follow the example of ULT. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
LUK	8	1	i6mi	writing-newevent	καὶ ἐγένετο	1	And it happened that	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
LUK	8	1	l399	figs-idiom	κατὰ πόλιν καὶ κώμην	1	through city and village	This is an idiom. Alternate translation: “around to different cities and villages” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	8	1	l401	figs-abstractnouns	τὴν Βασιλείαν τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	the kingdom of God	See how you decided to translate this phrase in [4:43](../04/43.md). If your readers would misunderstand the abstract noun **kingdom**, you could express the idea behind it with a verb such as “rule.” Alternate translation: “how God would rule” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
LUK	8	1	l402	figs-nominaladj	οἱ δώδεκα	1	the Twelve	Luke is using the adjective **Twelve** as a noun in order to indicate a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “his 12 apostles” or “the 12 men whom he had appointed to be apostles” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
LUK	8	1	l403	translate-names	οἱ δώδεκα	1	the Twelve	Alternatively, even if your language does not ordinarily use adjectives as nouns, you may be able to do that in this case, since this is a title by which the apostles were known. Even though it is a number, if you translate it as a title, as ULT does, follow the conventions for titles in your language. For example, capitalize main words and write out numbers rather than use digits. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	8	2	g99l	figs-activepassive	αἳ ἦσαν τεθεραπευμέναι ἀπὸ πνευμάτων πονηρῶν καὶ ἀσθενειῶν	1	who had been healed from evil spirits and diseases	If your language does not use this passive form, you can state this in active form. Alternate translation: “whom Jesus had set free from evil spirits and healed of diseases” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	8	2	jq4g	translate-names	Μαρία ἡ καλουμένη Μαγδαληνή	1	Mary who was called Magdalene	**Mary** is the name of a woman, and **Magdalene** is a distinguishing term that most likely means that she came from the town of Magdala. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	8	2	n4x6	figs-activepassive	Μαρία ἡ καλουμένη Μαγδαληνή	1	Mary who was called Magdalene	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “Mary, who people called Magdalene” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	8	2	l404	figs-explicit	ἀφ’ ἧς δαιμόνια ἑπτὰ ἐξεληλύθει	1	from whom seven demons had gone out	The **demons** did not go **out** on their own. It may be helpful to say explicitly that Jesus drove them out. Alternate translation: “from whom Jesus had driven out seven demons” or “whom Jesus had set free from seven demons” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	8	3	tfz5	translate-names	Ἰωάννα…Σουσάννα	1	Joanna … Susanna	These are the names of two women. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

LUK	8	3	k9m5	figs-idiom	διηκόνουν αὐτοῖς	1	serving them out of their possessions	This is an idiom. Alternate translation: “were personally providing what Jesus and his 12 apostles needed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	8	4	r1qk	writing-pronouns	ἐπιπορευομένων πρὸς αὐτὸν	1	coming to him	Here the pronoun **him** refers to Jesus. Alternate translation: “coming to Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
LUK	8	4	l406	figs-idiom	κατὰ πόλιν	1	by city	This is an idiom. Alternate translation: “from different towns” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	8	4	l407	figs-parables	εἶπεν διὰ παραβολῆς	1	he spoke in a parable	This means that Jesus told a brief story to teach something true in an understandable and memorable way.

Alternate translation: “people walked on it” or “people walked on them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	8	5	n8bw	figs-explicitinfo	τὰ πετεινὰ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ	1	the birds of the sky	In your language, it might seem that this phrase expresses unnecessary extra information. If so, you could abbreviate it. However, you could also use an action clause to keep the sense of **sky**. Alternate translation: “birds” or “birds flew down and” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo]])
LUK	8	5	lt8n		κατέφαγεν αὐτό	1	devoured it	Alternate translation: “ate it all” or “ate them all”
LUK	8	6	k6a4		ἐξηράνθη	1	it withered away	Continue to use either the singular or the plural, whichever would be more natural in your language. Alternate translation: “each plant dried out and shriveled up” or “the plants dried out and shriveled up”
LUK	8	6	ktz7		διὰ τὸ μὴ ἔχειν ἰκμάδα	1	because it had no moisture	Alternate translation: “because there was no water for it in the rock” or “because there was no water for them in the rock”
LUK	8	7	xzq2		ἀπέπνιξαν αὐτό	1	choked it	The thorn plants took all the nutrients, water, and sunlight, so the farmer’s plants could not grow well. Continue to use either the singular or the plural, whichever would be more natural in your language. Alternate translation: “crowded it out” or “crowded them out” or “kept it from growing well” or “kept them from growing well”
LUK	8	8	q12t		ἐποίησεν καρπὸν ἑκατονταπλασίονα	1	it produced fruit a hundred times greater	Here the word translated **fruit** has the specific sense of “a crop.” Since the farmer is sowing wheat seeds, this crop would be more seeds. Alternate translation: “it produced a hundred times as much seed as had landed in this soil” or “they produced a hundred times as many seeds as had landed in this soil”
LUK	8	8	b92z	figs-metonymy	ὁ ἔχων ὦτα ἀκούειν, ἀκουέτω	1	The one who has ears to hear, let him hear	Jesus uses this phrase to emphasize that what he has just said is important and that it may take some effort to understand and put into practice. The phrase **ears to hear** figuratively represents the willingness to understand and obey by association with the part of the body by which his listeners would have been taking in his teaching. Alternate translation: “If anyone is willing to understand, let him understand and obey” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	8	8	l408	figs-123person	ὁ ἔχων ὦτα ἀκούειν, ἀκουέτω	1	The one who has ears to hear, let him hear	Since Jesus is speaking directly to his audience, you may prefer to use the second person here. Alternate translation: “If you are willing to listen, then listen” or “If you are willing to understand, then understand and obey” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
LUK	8	8	l409	figs-you	ὁ ἔχων ὦτα ἀκούειν, ἀκουέτω	1	The one who has ears to hear, let him hear	If you choose to translate this in the second person, **you** would be plural, since Jesus is speaking to the crowd. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

LUK	8	10	l411	figs-abstractnouns	τῆς Βασιλείας τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	the kingdom of God	See how you decided to translate this phrase in [4:43](../04/43.md). If your readers would misunderstand the abstract noun **kingdom**, you could express the idea behind it with a verb such as “rule.” Alternate translation: “of how God will rule” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
LUK	8	10	l6sk	figs-ellipsis	τοῖς δὲ λοιποῖς ἐν παραβολαῖς	1	but to the rest in parables	Jesus is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would ordinarily need in order to be complete. Alternate translation: “but I speak in parables to the people who are not my disciples” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
LUK	8	10	l412	figs-quotesinquotes	ἵνα βλέποντες μὴ βλέπωσιν, καὶ ἀκούοντες μὴ συνιῶσιν	1	so that, ‘Seeing, they may not see; and hearing, they may not understand’	Luke is quoting Jesus, and Jesus is quoting the prophet Isaiah. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. For clarity, you could also indicate the source of the words that Jesus is quoting. Alternate translation: “so that as the prophet Isaiah said, though they see, they will not perceive, and though they hear, they will not understand” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	8	10	xtu6		βλέποντες μὴ βλέπωσιν	1	Seeing, they may not see	Some languages may need to state the object of the verb. Alternate translation: “though they see things, they will not understand them” or “though they see things happen, they will not understand what they mean”
LUK	8	10	k4es		ἀκούοντες μὴ συνιῶσιν	1	hearing, they may not understand	Some languages may need to state the object of the verb. Alternate translation: “though they hear instruction, they will not understand the truth”

LUK	8	11	hb1t	figs-metonymy	ὁ σπόρος ἐστὶν ὁ λόγος τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	The seed is the word of God	Jesus uses the term **word** figuratively to refer to the message from God that people share by using words. Alternate translation: “The seed represents the message from God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	8	12	xsa7	figs-metaphor	οἱ…παρὰ τὴν ὁδόν εἰσιν οἱ ἀκούσαντες	1	the ones along the path are those who have heard	Jesus begins to explain the figurative meanings of the seeds that fell in different places. Alternate translation: “The seeds that fell along the path represent people who hear the message” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	8	12	h969	figs-metaphor	εἶτα ἔρχεται ὁ διάβολος καὶ αἴρει τὸν λόγον ἀπὸ τῆς καρδίας αὐτῶν	1	but then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts	The parable represented this figuratively as a bird snatching away seeds. Try to use words in your language that retain that image. Alternate translation: “but then the devil comes and snatches the message away from them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	8	12	jb9t	figs-metaphor	εἶτα ἔρχεται ὁ διάβολος καὶ αἴρει τὸν λόγον ἀπὸ τῆς καρδίας αὐτῶν	1	but then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts	The word **hearts** figuratively represents the thoughts and emotions. Alternate translation: “the devil comes and keeps them from understanding and appreciating the message” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	8	12	l413	figs-explicit	εἶτα ἔρχεται ὁ διάβολος καὶ αἴρει τὸν λόγον ἀπὸ τῆς καρδίας αὐτῶν	1	but then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts	Based on the figurative meaning of the parable, the implication is that these people did not appreciate the message deeply, just as seeds could not go down deep into the hard-packed soil of the path. And so the devil would be able to break up their superficial awareness and concentration by distracting them with everyday concerns. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “the devil distracts them and they forget about the message they heard” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	8	12	l414	figs-metonymy	τὸν λόγον	1	the word	Jesus is using the term **word** figuratively to refer to the message that people share by using words. Alternate translation: “the message” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	8	12	g7r7	figs-activepassive	ἵνα μὴ πιστεύσαντες σωθῶσιν	1	so they may not believe and be saved	This phrase explains the devil’s purpose. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who would do the action. Alternate translation: “because the devil does not want them to trust in God so that God will save them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	8	13	juq1	figs-metaphor	οἱ δὲ ἐπὶ τῆς πέτρας, οἳ	1	And the ones on the rock are those	Jesus continues to explain the figurative meanings of the seeds that fell in different places.

LUK	8	13	e5rw	figs-metonymy	ἀφίστανται	1	they go away	Jesus is using the way such people **go away** from the community of believers to mean figuratively that they stop believing. Alternate translation: “they stop believing” or “they stop being disciples” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

Alternate translation: “the cares and riches and pleasures of this life choke them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	8	14	uut6		μεριμνῶν	1	cares	Alternate translation: “things that people worry about”

LUK	8	14	xhv7	figs-metaphor	οὐ τελεσφοροῦσιν	1	they do not produce mature fruit	The phrase **mature fruit** figuratively means spiritual maturity that is evidenced by godly character and loving actions. Alternate translation: “they do not mature into people of godly character who act out of love” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	8	15	m2hb	figs-metaphor	τὸ δὲ ἐν τῇ καλῇ γῇ, οὗτοί εἰσιν οἵτινες	1	But the ones on the good soil, these are the ones	Jesus continues to explain the figurative meanings of the seeds that fell in different places.

LUK	8	15	l62d	figs-metonymy	ἀκούσαντες τὸν λόγον	1	having heard the word	Jesus uses the term **word** figuratively to refer to the message that people share by using words. Alternate translation: “when they hear the message” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	8	15	l416	figs-doublet	ἐν καρδίᾳ καλῇ καὶ ἀγαθῇ	1	with an honest and good heart	The terms **honest** and **good** mean similar things. Jesus uses the two terms together for emphasis and clarity. You do not need to repeat both words in your translation if that might be confusing for your readers. Alternate translation: “with genuine intentions” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
LUK	8	15	pbi7	figs-metaphor	ἐν καρδίᾳ καλῇ καὶ ἀγαθῇ	1	with an honest and good heart	In this expression, the **heart** figuratively represents the thoughts and emotions. Alternate translation: “with genuine intentions” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express this explicitly in your translation. Alternate translation: “Then Jesus gave them another example. ‘No one lights a lamp’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])
LUK	8	16	l417	figs-ellipsis	οἱ εἰσπορευόμενοι	1	those who enter	Jesus is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would ordinarily need in order to be complete. Alternate translation: “those who enter the room” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
LUK	8	17	n5ca	figs-doublenegatives	οὐ…ἐστιν κρυπτὸν ὃ οὐ φανερὸν γενήσεται	1	nothing is hidden that will not become visible	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this double negative as a positive statement. Alternate translation: “everything that is hidden will become visible” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
LUK	8	17	iv9q	figs-doublenegatives	οὐδὲ ἀπόκρυφον ὃ οὐ μὴ γνωσθῇ καὶ εἰς φανερὸν ἔλθῃ	1	nor secret that will not be known and come into visibility	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could also translate this double negative as a positive statement. Alternate translation: “and everything that is secret will be known and become visible” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
LUK	8	17	l418	figs-activepassive	οὐδὲ ἀπόκρυφον ὃ οὐ μὴ γνωσθῇ καὶ εἰς φανερὸν ἔλθῃ	1	nor secret that will not be known and come into visibility	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who will do the action. Alternate translation: “and God will reveal every secret and make it visible” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	8	17	l419	figs-doublet	οὐδὲ ἀπόκρυφον ὃ οὐ μὴ γνωσθῇ καὶ εἰς φανερὸν ἔλθῃ	1	nor secret that will not be known and come into visibility	The phrases **be known** and **come into visibility** mean similar things. Jesus is likely using repetition for emphasis. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could combine these phrases. Alternate translation: “and God will clearly reveal every secret” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
LUK	8	18	l420		βλέπετε οὖν πῶς ἀκούετε	1	so be careful how you listen	The phrase **be careful** does not mean that listening is dangerous. Rather, it means that people should listen carefully, because, as Jesus has just said, God wants to reveal spiritual secrets. Alternate translation: “so make sure that you listen well” or “so listen carefully and reflect on what you hear”
LUK	8	18	l421	figs-explicit	ὃς ἂν…ἔχῃ, δοθήσεται αὐτῷ	1	whoever has, it will be given to him	The implication in context is that the phrase **whoever has, it will be given to him** refers to understanding and believing. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “whoever seeks sincerely to understand will be given more understanding” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	8	18	bq9f	figs-activepassive	ὃς ἂν…ἔχῃ, δοθήσεται αὐτῷ	1	whoever has, it will be given to him	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “whoever seeks sincerely to understand will understand better” or “God will give greater understanding to anyone who seeks sincerely to understand” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	8	18	l422	figs-explicit	καὶ ὃς ἂν μὴ ἔχῃ, καὶ ὃ δοκεῖ ἔχειν ἀρθήσεται ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ	1	whoever does not have, even what he thinks he has will be taken away from him	The implication once again is that the phrase **whoever does not have, even what he thinks he has will be taken away from him** refers to understanding and believing. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “But whoever does not have understanding, even what understanding he thinks he has will be taken away from him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	8	18	ihh9	figs-activepassive	καὶ ὃς ἂν μὴ ἔχῃ, καὶ ὃ δοκεῖ ἔχειν ἀρθήσεται ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ	1	whoever does not have, even what he thinks he has will be taken away from him	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “whoever presumes that he already understands will understand less and less” or “God will not give greater understanding to anyone who presumes that he already understands” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	8	19	l423	grammar-connect-time-sequential	δὲ	1	Then	Luke uses **then** to introduce a new event and to indicate that it came after the event he has just described. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
LUK	8	19	dw3m	translate-kinship	οἱ ἀδελφοὶ	1	his brothers	These were Jesus' younger brothers. They were sons of Mary and Joseph. Since the Father of Jesus was God, and their father was Joseph, they were actually his half-brothers. That detail is not normally translated, but if your language has a specific word for “younger brother,” you can use it here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship]])
LUK	8	20	wr4t	figs-activepassive	ἀπηγγέλη…αὐτῷ	1	it was reported to him	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who did the action. The subject should be plural, since in the next verse Jesus responds to “them.” Alternate translation: “people told him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	8	20	l424	figs-you	σου…σου…σε	1	your … your … you	Since the person who said this was speaking to Jesus alone, **your** and **you** are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
LUK	8	20	un5d		ἰδεῖν θέλοντές σε	1	wanting to see you	Alternate translation: “and they would like to see you”
LUK	8	21	l425	figs-hendiadys	ὁ δὲ ἀποκριθεὶς εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτούς	1	But answering he said to them	Together the two words **answering** and **said** mean that Jesus responded to the information that people gave him. Alternate translation: “But Jesus responded to them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
LUK	8	21	b97u	figs-metaphor	μήτηρ μου καὶ ἀδελφοί μου, οὗτοί εἰσιν οἱ τὸν λόγον τοῦ Θεοῦ ἀκούοντες καὶ ποιοῦντες	1	My mother and my brothers are those who hear and do the word of God	Jesus means figuratively that people who believe and obey the message from God become like a family to one another. Alternate translation: “Those who hear the word of God and obey it are like a mother and brothers to me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	8	21	edk3	figs-metonymy	τὸν λόγον τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	the word of God	Jesus uses the term **word** figuratively to refer to the message from God that people share by using words. Alternate translation: “the message from God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	8	22	l426	writing-newevent	ἐγένετο δὲ	1	And it happened that	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
LUK	8	22	l427	figs-idiom	ἐν μιᾷ τῶν ἡμερῶν	1	on one of those days	Luke uses the term **days** figuratively to refer to a particular time. Alternate translation: “around that time” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	8	22	l428	grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ αὐτὸς ἐνέβη εἰς πλοῖον καὶ οἱ μαθηταὶ αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτούς, διέλθωμεν εἰς τὸ πέραν τῆς λίμνης	1	both he and his disciples got into a boat, and he said to them, “Let us go over to the other side of the lake”	It seems unlikely that Jesus and his disciples would have gotten into a boat before they were planning to sail somewhere. So here Luke is probably describing the result before the reason. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the action that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “Jesus said to his disciples, ‘Let us go over to the other side of the lake.’ So they all got into a boat together” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
LUK	8	22	w1pk	translate-names	τῆς λίμνης	1	the lake	This means the Lake of Genneseret, which is also called the Sea of Galilee. But since Jesus would have referred to it simply as “the lake” while he and his disciples were on it, you do not need to use the proper name in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	8	22	btk8	figs-idiom	ἀνήχθησαν	1	they put out	This expression means that they began to travel across the lake in their boat. Alternate translation: “they headed out across the lake” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	8	23	vh2v		πλεόντων…αὐτῶν	1	as they voyaged	The term **voyaged** means that Jesus and the disciples traveled by water. Alternate translation: “as they traveled across the lake”
LUK	8	23	sf8z	writing-pronouns	ἀφύπνωσεν	1	he fell asleep	The pronoun **he** refers to Jesus. Alternate translation: “Jesus began to sleep” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
LUK	8	23	mdb5	figs-idiom	κατέβη λαῖλαψ ἀνέμου εἰς τὴν λίμνην	1	a windstorm came down on the lake	Luke says **came down** because these winds blew down from the hills surrounding the lake. Alternate translation: “very strong winds suddenly began to blow on the lake” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	8	23	l429	figs-metonymy	συνεπληροῦντο	1	they were being filled	Luke says **they**, meaning the disciples, to refer figuratively by association to the boat they were in. Alternate translation: “the boat was being filled” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	8	23	l430	figs-activepassive	συνεπληροῦντο	1	they were being filled	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form, and you could state what was doing the action. Alternate translation: “water started to fill up their boat” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	8	23	uki7	figs-explicit	συνεπληροῦντο	1	they were being filled	The implication is that the strong winds were causing high waves that pushed water over the sides of the boat, and that this water was filling the boat. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “the strong winds were causing high waves that pushed water over the sides of their boat, so that the water began to fill it up” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	8	24	l432		Ἐπιστάτα	1	Master	**Master** is the title by which disciples addressed their teacher in this culture. If your language and culture have a similar term, you can use it here in your translation.
LUK	8	24	l431		λέγοντες, Ἐπιστάτα, Ἐπιστάτα, ἀπολλύμεθα!	1	saying, “Master! Master! We are perishing!”	The repetition indicates that the disciples called to Jesus urgently and continually. Alternate translation: “crying out continually, ‘Master! We’re going to die!’”
LUK	8	24	l433	figs-exclusive	ἀπολλύμεθα	1	We are perishing	Since the disciples want Jesus to understand that he is in danger too, the word **we** would include him. Alternate translation: “We’re all going to die” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
LUK	8	24	uhe4		ἐπετίμησεν	1	rebuked	Alternate translation: “spoke sharply to”
LUK	8	24	t1yy	figs-explicitinfo	τῷ κλύδωνι, τοῦ ὕδατος	1	the waves of the water	In your language, it might seem that the wording here expresses unnecessary extra information. If so, you can abbreviate it. However, you could also translate this as expressing emphasis. Alternate translation: “the waves” or “the violent waves” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo]])
LUK	8	24	v1c3	figs-parallelism	ἐπαύσαντο καὶ ἐγένετο γαλήνη	1	they ceased, and there was a calm	These two phrases mean similar things. Luke uses the repetition to emphasize what great power Jesus demonstrated. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could combine these phrases. However, you could also translate both phrases and show how the second expresses the results of the first. Alternate translation: “the storm ended” or “the storm ended, so that the lake became calm again” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
LUK	8	25	d8c3	figs-rquestion	ποῦ ἡ πίστις ὑμῶν?	1	Where is your faith?	Jesus does not expect his disciples to tell him where their faith is. Rather, he is using the question form to correct them. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate his words as a statement or exclamation. Alternate translation: “You should have trusted God!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	8	25	wjv3		τίς ἄρα οὗτός ἐστιν, ὅτι καὶ τοῖς ἀνέμοις ἐπιτάσσει καὶ τῷ ὕδατι, καὶ ὑπακούουσιν αὐτῷ?	1	Who then is this, that he commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him?	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could turn this into two sentences, one asking the question, and the other giving the reason for the question. Alternate translation: “Who then is this? He commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him!”
LUK	8	25	f2wp		τίς ἄρα οὗτός ἐστιν	1	Who then is this	This is a genuine question, not a statement in question form. The disciples are looking for information about what kind of person Jesus could be if he can do this. Alternate translation: “What kind of man is this”
LUK	8	25	l434	figs-metonymy	τῷ ὕδατι	1	the water	The disciples are figuratively describing the violent waves that had threatened the boat by reference to the water that these waves arose from. Alternate translation: “the waves” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	8	26	f17p	translate-names	τὴν χώραν τῶν Γερασηνῶν	1	the region of the Gerasenes	The name **Gerasenes** refers to people from the city of Gerasa. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	8	26	p9zp		ἀντιπέρα τῆς Γαλιλαίας	1	opposite Galilee	Alternate translation: “on the other side of the lake from Galilee”
LUK	8	27	l435	figs-ellipsis	ἐξελθόντι…αὐτῷ	1	when he came out	Here Luke is writing in a compact way. He means that Jesus **came out** of the boat. Alternate translation: “when Jesus got out of the boat” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
LUK	8	27	hjh5	writing-participants	ἀνήρ τις ἐκ τῆς πόλεως	1	a certain man from the city	This phrase introduces a new character in a story. If your language has an expression of its own that serves this purpose, you can use it here. Alternate translation: “a man who was from the city of Gerasa” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
LUK	8	27	ji6p		ἔχων δαιμόνια	1	who had demons	Alternate translation: “who was controlled by demons” or “whom demons controlled”
LUK	8	27	xhw7	writing-background	καὶ χρόνῳ ἱκανῷ	1	And for a long time	Luke uses this phrase to introduce background information about the man who had demons. Alternate translation: “Now for a long time” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
LUK	8	27	we6n	translate-unknown	τοῖς μνήμασιν	1	the tombs	The term **the tombs** refers to places in which people laid to rest the bodies of loved ones who have died. In this context it may possibly mean caves cut into the rock or small buildings that the man could use for shelter. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	8	28	ip59	writing-pronouns	ἰδὼν…τὸν Ἰησοῦν	1	when he saw Jesus	The pronoun **he** refers to the man who had demons. Alternate translation: “when the man whom the demons controlled saw Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
LUK	8	28	n4ex		ἀνακράξας	1	he cried out	Alternate translation: “he screamed” or “he shrieked”
LUK	8	28	fak9	translate-symaction	προσέπεσεν αὐτῷ	1	fell down before him	Be sure that it is clear in your translation that the man did not fall down accidentally. Rather, bowing or lying down in front of Jesus was a sign of humility and respect for him. Alternate translation: “respectfully bowed down at Jesus’ feet” or “respectfully lay down on the ground in front of Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
LUK	8	28	m21e	figs-idiom	φωνῇ μεγάλῃ εἶπεν	1	said in a loud voice	This is an idiom that means the man raised the volume of his voice. Alternate translation: “shouted out” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	8	28	lv2b	figs-idiom	τί ἐμοὶ καὶ σοί	1	What to me and to you	This is an idiom. Alternate translation: “What do you and I have in common” or “What reason do you have to get involved with me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	8	28	l436	figs-rquestion	τί ἐμοὶ καὶ σοί	1	What to me and to you?	The man is using the question form to insist on something urgently. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate his words as a statement or exclamation. Alternate translation: “You and I have nothing in common!” or “You have no reason to get involved with me!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	8	28	ptt1	guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	Υἱὲ τοῦ Θεοῦ τοῦ Ὑψίστου	1	Son of the Most High God	**Son of the Most High God** is an important title for Jesus. See how you translated the expression **the Most High** in [1:32](../01/32.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
LUK	8	29	l437	grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	For	Luke is giving the reason for the result he described in the previous verse. Alternate translation: “The man said this because” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
LUK	8	29	l438	translate-versebridge	παρήγγειλεν γὰρ τῷ πνεύματι τῷ ἀκαθάρτῳ ἐξελθεῖν ἀπὸ τοῦ ἀνθρώπου	1	he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out from the man	If your language would put the reason before the result, you could create a verse bridge and put this sentence in [8:28](../08/28.md), after the man bows down to Jesus but before he speaks, changing the tense of the verb to fit the context. You could also put the next sentence in this verse at the end of [8:27](../08/27.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge]])
LUK	8	29	l439	writing-background	πολλοῖς γὰρ χρόνοις	1	For many times	Luke uses this phrase to introduce further background information about what the demon had done to the man before Jesus met him. Alternate translation: “Many times in the past” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
LUK	8	29	j3yj	figs-events	πολλοῖς γὰρ χρόνοις συνηρπάκει αὐτόν, καὶ ἐδεσμεύετο ἁλύσεσιν καὶ πέδαις, φυλασσόμενος	1	For many times it had seized him, and he was bound with chains and shackles and kept under guard	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could reverse the order of these phrases. Luke appears to be describing how the demon would seize the man after he was bound and while he was being guarded. Alternate translation: “For though he was bound with chains and shackles and kept under guard, many times it had seized him” (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-events)
LUK	8	29	bxz4	figs-activepassive	ἐδεσμεύετο ἁλύσεσιν καὶ πέδαις, φυλασσόμενος, καὶ διαρήσσων τὰ δεσμὰ	1	he was bound with chains and shackles and kept under guard, and breaking his bonds	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who did the action. Alternate translation (no comma following): “though the people in the area had bound him with chains and shackles and kept him under guard, he would break his bonds and” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	8	29	bey5	figs-activepassive	ἠλαύνετο ὑπὸ τοῦ δαιμονίου	1	he would be driven by the demon	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “the demon would make him go” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	8	30	l440	figs-you	σοι	1	your	Since Luke indicates in the previous verse that Jesus is speaking to the unclean spirit here, **your** is singular, even though the demon responds that he is speaking for “many,” and even though in the following verses Luke says **they** and **them** for the multiple demons. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
LUK	8	30	p31w	translate-names	λεγεών	1	Legion	Translate the word **Legion** with a word in your language that refers to a large number of soldiers. Show that this was the name of the demon by using the convention in your language for proper names. Alternate translation: “Army” or “Battalion” or “Brigade” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	8	31	qcn1		παρεκάλουν αὐτὸν	1	they were begging him	Alternate translation: “the demons kept begging Jesus”
LUK	8	31	l441	translate-unknown	τὴν Ἄβυσσον	1	the abyss	The term **abyss** literally means a bottomless pit, and here it describes a place of punishment. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could translate the term with an explanatory phrase, as UST does, saying “the deep pit where God punishes demons.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	8	32	b3vt	writing-background	ἦν δὲ ἐκεῖ ἀγέλη χοίρων ἱκανῶν βοσκομένη ἐν τῷ ὄρει	1	Now a large herd of pigs was there feeding on the hillside	Luke supplies this background information to help readers understand what happens next. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
LUK	8	32	q8w5		ἦν…ἐκεῖ…βοσκομένη ἐν τῷ ὄρει	1	was there feeding on the hillside	Alternate translation: “was nearby eating grass on the side of a hill”
LUK	8	32	l442	writing-pronouns	παρεκάλεσαν αὐτὸν ἵνα ἐπιτρέψῃ αὐτοῖς εἰς ἐκείνους εἰσελθεῖν	1	they begged him to permit them go into them	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could clarify who and what these pronouns refer to. Alternate translation: “the demons begged Jesus to let them go into the pigs” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
LUK	8	32	l443		καὶ ἐπέτρεψεν αὐτοῖς	1	And he gave them permission	Luke does not say specifically why Jesus allowed the demons to go into the pigs. But Jesus did not necessarily do so because the demons begged him. He may have had other reasons of his own. So it would probably be best to translate this in a neutral way, as ULT and UST both do, rather than beginning with a word such as “So,” which would imply that Jesus agreed to this because the demons begged him.
LUK	8	33	na38	grammar-connect-logic-result	ἐξελθόντα δὲ τὰ δαιμόνια	1	Then the demons came out	The term translated as **then** could mean that the demons came of out the man because Jesus told them they could go into the pigs. You could begin this sentence with the word **so**, as UST does, to show that. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
LUK	8	33	gz5x		ὥρμησεν	1	rushed	Alternate translation: “ran very fast”
LUK	8	33	ja6x	figs-activepassive	καὶ ἀπεπνίγη	1	and was drowned	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form. You do not need to specify someone who did this action to the pigs, because no one caused them to drown once they were in the water. Alternate translation: “and drowned” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	8	34	l444	figs-merism	εἰς τὴν πόλιν καὶ εἰς τοὺς ἀγρούς	1	in the city and in the countryside	Here Luke uses a figure of speech to refer to that whole region by naming the two constituent parts of it. Alternate translation: “throughout the whole area” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
LUK	8	34	l445	figs-explicit	εἰς τὴν πόλιν καὶ εἰς τοὺς ἀγρούς	1	in the city and in the countryside	You could also translate this more literally. The implication is that this means the city of Gerasa, since Luke says in [8:29](../08/29.md) that Jesus and his disciples came to the region where this city was located. Alternate translation: “in the city of Gerasa and in the surrounding countryside” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	8	35	l446	figs-explicit	ἐξῆλθον	1	they went out	Here, as well as in the other two instances in this verse, **they** refers to the people of that region, as in [8:37](../08/37.md).

Alternate translation: “someone came”
LUK	8	49	deu3	figs-metonymy	τις παρὰ τοῦ ἀρχισυναγώγου	1	someone from the synagogue leader	This does not mean someone whom Jairus sent, since Jairus was with Jesus.

LUK	8	49	id9v	figs-explicit	μηκέτι σκύλλε τὸν διδάσκαλον	1	Do not trouble the Teacher any longer	This statement implies that Jesus will not be able to do anything to help, since the girl is dead.

The term that ULT translates as **mourning** could mean that the people were pounding on their chests as a sign of grief, although Luke uses a much more specific expression to say that directly in [18:13](../18/13.md). If you think your readers might not understand the significance of these actions, you could explain generally what the people were doing. Or you could describe the actions and say why the people were doing them. Alternate translation: “they were all loudly expressing their grief” or “all the people there were wailing and pounding on their chests to show how sad they were that the girl had died” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])

LUK	8	54	l469	figs-imperative	ἔγειρε	1	arise	This was not a command that the girl was capable of obeying. Instead, this was a command that directly caused her to be raised from the dead. Alternate translation: “your life is restored, so get up” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
LUK	8	55	k6w2	figs-explicit	ἐπέστρεψεν τὸ πνεῦμα αὐτῆς	1	her spirit returned	The people of this time considered life to be the result of the spirit coming into a person.

LUK	9	intro	uc1r			0		# Luke 9 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>1. Jesus sends his 12 apostles to teach and heal (9:1-9)<br>2. Jesus miraculously feeds 5,000 people (9:10-17)<br>3. Jesus speaks with his disciples about who he is (9:18-27)<br>4. The glory of Jesus is revealed on a mountaintop (9:28-36)<br>5. Jesus drives a demon out of a boy (9:37-43)<br>6. Jesus speaks about being his disciple (9:44-50)<br>7. Jesus begins to travel to Jerusalem (9:51-62)<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Elijah<br><br>God had promised the Jews that the prophet Elijah would return before the Messiah came. So some people who saw Jesus do miracles thought Jesus was Elijah (9:9, 9:19). He was not. However, Elijah did come to earth to speak with Jesus (9:30). (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/christ]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/elijah]])<br><br>### Glory<br><br>Scripture often speaks of God’s glory as a great, brilliant light. When people see this light, they are afraid. Luke says in this chapter that Jesus’ clothing shone with this glorious light so that his followers could see that Jesus truly was God’s Son. At the same time, God told them that Jesus was his Son. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/glory]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/fear]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Paradox<br><br>A paradox is a statement that describes two things that seem as if they cannot both be true at the same time, but which actually are both true. Jesus speaks a paradox in this chapter: “Whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will save it” (9:24).<br><br>### “Receiving”<br><br>This word appears several times in this chapter and means different things. When Jesus says, “If someone receives a little child like this in my name, he also is receiving me, and if someone receives me, he is also receiving the one who sent me” (9:48), he is speaking of people serving the child. When Luke says, “the people there did not receive him” (9:53), he means that the people did not believe in or accept Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/believe]])

LUK	9	3	m7c5		καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτούς	1	And he said to them	It may be helpful to state that Jesus said these things to the disciples before they went out. Alternate translation: “Before the 12 disciples left, Jesus said to them”

LUK	9	3	l475	figs-litotes	μήτε δύο χιτῶνας ἔχειν	1	nor have two tunics	Here Jesus is using a figure of speech that expresses a positive meaning by using a negative word together with a word that is the opposite of the intended meaning. When he says that these men should not each have two tunics, he means that they each should only have one tunic. Alternate translation: “and do not bring an extra tunic” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
LUK	9	4	kyw3	figs-explicit	εἰς ἣν ἂν οἰκίαν εἰσέλθητε	1	whatever house you enter into	The implication is that the disciples can **enter** a house because the people living there have welcomed them.

When John sends messengers to Jesus in [7:18-19](../07/18.md), he does this from prison. But by this point in the story, John is dead, because Herod has executed him. Luke assumes that his readers will know that. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could tell them explicitly. Alternate translation: “that John the Baptist, whom Herod had executed, had risen from the dead” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

LUK	9	10	p7gf	figs-explicit	ὑποστρέψαντες, οἱ ἀπόστολοι	1	when the apostles returned	The implication is that the apostles returned to where Jesus was. Alternate translation: “when the apostles came back to where Jesus was” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

LUK	9	12	l484	figs-nominaladj	οἱ δώδεκα	1	the Twelve	See how you translated this in [8:1](../08/01.md). You may have decided to translate the nominal adjective **Twelve** with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “his 12 apostles” or “the 12 men whom he had appointed to be apostles” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
LUK	9	12	l485	translate-names	οἱ δώδεκα	1	the Twelve	You may have decided instead in [8:1](../08/01.md) to translate this as a title, **the Twelve**, even if your language does not ordinarily use adjectives as nouns. If so, you can do the same thing here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	9	13	l486	figs-litotes	οὐκ εἰσὶν…πλεῖον ἢ	1	There are not more than	The disciples are figuratively expressing a positive meaning by using a negative word together with a word that is the opposite of the intended meaning.

They actually mean to communicate the opposite of the literal meaning of their words. Alternate translation: “and we certainly cannot go and buy food for all these people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])
LUK	9	14	c9z5	figs-explicit	ὡσεὶ ἄνδρες πεντακισχίλιοι	1	about 5,000 men	Luke assumes that readers will know that this number does not include the women and children who were likely also present. (This is not a case where a masculine term includes women.) If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “about 5,000 men, not counting the women and children” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

LUK	9	16	gm2v		εὐλόγησεν αὐτοὺς	1	he blessed them	The word **them** refers to the loaves of bread and the fish, not to the people who had sat down to eat. Alternate translation: “he gave thanks for the food”

LUK	9	18	y5a5	writing-newevent	καὶ ἐγένετο	1	And it happened that	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])

LUK	9	22	l493	figs-idiom	καὶ τῇ τρίτῃ ἡμέρᾳ ἐγερθῆναι	1	and to be raised on the third day	In the idiom of this culture, today was the “first day,” tomorrow was the “second day,” and the day after tomorrow was the**third day**. To make sure that this is clear to your readers, you may wish to use a different expression than “the third day” or “day three,” especially if, in your culture, this would mean one day longer than Jesus intends. Otherwise, your readers may be confused when they read later in the book that Jesus died on a Friday and came back to life on a Sunday, if that would be “the second day” or “day two” according to the way your culture reckons time. Alternate translation: “and he will spend the next full day in the grave, but on the day after that, he will come back to life” or (if you translated in the first person) “and I will spend the next full day in the grave, but on the day after that, I will come back to life” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

Jesus does not expect his disciples to tell him what benefit this would be. Rather, he is using the question form as a teaching tool.

Alternate translation: “It would not benefit a person to get everything he wanted in this world and yet be lost eternally.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

Alternate translation: “will see the kingdom of God before they die” or (if you are translating in the second person) “will see the kingdom of God before you die” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
LUK	9	27	gj8t	figs-idiom	γεύσωνται θανάτου	1	taste death	This is an idiom. Alternate translation: “die” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	9	27	l499	figs-abstractnouns	τὴν Βασιλείαν τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	the kingdom of God	See how you decided to translate this phrase in [4:43](../04/43.md). If your readers would misunderstand the abstract noun **kingdom**, you could express the idea behind it with a verb such as “rule.” Alternate translation: “God ruling as king” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
LUK	9	28	l500	writing-newevent	ἐγένετο δὲ	1	And it happened that	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
LUK	9	28	si9j	figs-metonymy	μετὰ τοὺς λόγους τούτους	1	after these words	The phrase **these words** refers to what Jesus said to his disciples in the preceding verses. Luke uses the term **words** figuratively to describe the things that Jesus said by using words. Alternate translation: “after Jesus said these things to his disciples” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	9	29	l501	writing-newevent	καὶ ἐγένετο	1	And it happened that	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new development within this episode. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for this purpose. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
LUK	9	30	p3cd	figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	behold	Here, Luke uses the word **behold** to alert readers to pay attention to the surprising information that follows. Alternate translation: “suddenly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	9	31	g28p	figs-activepassive	οἳ ὀφθέντες ἐν δόξῃ	1	who were seen in glory	This phrase gives information about how Moses and Elijah looked. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “who appeared in glorious splendor” or “who were shining brightly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	9	31	cur1	figs-euphemism	τὴν ἔξοδον αὐτοῦ	1	his departure	Luke is using a polite way of referring to Jesus’ death. Alternate translation: “how Jesus would leave this world” or “how Jesus would die” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
LUK	9	31	l502		ἣν ἤμελλεν πληροῦν ἐν Ἰερουσαλήμ	1	which he was about to fulfill in Jerusalem	Alternate translation: “which was soon going to happen in Jerusalem”
LUK	9	32	i29n	writing-background	δὲ	1	And	Luke uses this word to introduce background information about what Peter, James, and John were doing while Jesus was speaking with Moses and Elijah. Alternate translation: “Now” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
LUK	9	32	f8ip	figs-activepassive	ὁ…Πέτρος καὶ οἱ σὺν αὐτῷ ἦσαν βεβαρημένοι ὕπνῳ	1	Peter and those with him were weighted with sleep	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “sleep was weighing heavily upon Peter and James and John” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	9	32	l503	figs-personification	ὁ…Πέτρος καὶ οἱ σὺν αὐτῷ ἦσαν βεβαρημένοι ὕπνῳ	1	Peter and those with him were weighted with sleep	Luke speaks of **sleep** figuratively as if it were something that could be like a weight pressing down on a person. Alternate translation: “Peter and James and John all felt very sleepy” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
LUK	9	32	tw7e	figs-explicit	εἶδον τὴν δόξαν αὐτοῦ	1	they saw his glory	As in [2:9](../02/09.md), the implication is that this **glory** manifested visibly as a bright light. Alternate translation: “they saw brilliant light shining around Jesus” or “they saw a very bright light coming from Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

LUK	9	33	l504	writing-newevent	καὶ ἐγένετο	1	And it happened that	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new development within this episode. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for this purpose. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
LUK	9	33	npk9	writing-pronouns	ἐν τῷ διαχωρίζεσθαι αὐτοὺς ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ	1	as they were going away from him	The pronoun **they** refers to Moses and Elijah, not to the disciples. Alternate translation: “as Moses and Elijah were about to leave Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
LUK	9	33	l505	figs-exclusive	ἡμᾶς…ποιήσωμεν	1	for us … let us make	Since Peter wants to make it possible for Moses and Elijah to stay, when he says **for us**, he likely means “all six of us.” So if your language distinguishes between exclusive and inclusive “us,” use the inclusive form in that case. However, when Peter says **let us**, he is likely referring to himself and to James and John, so use the exclusive form of “us” in that case. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
LUK	9	33	mby6	translate-unknown	σκηνὰς	1	tents	The term **tents** means simple, temporary places in which to sit or sleep. Peter probably had in mind that he and the other two disciples would build them from the materials available on the mountain such as tree branches. Alternate translation: “shelters” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	9	33	l506		μὴ εἰδὼς ὃ λέγει	1	not knowing what he says	To call attention to a development in the story, Luke uses the present tense in past narration. See how you decided to approach this usage in [7:40](../07/40.md). If it would not be natural to use the present tense in your language, you can use the past tense in your translation. It may be helpful to make this a separate sentence. Alternate translation: “He did not know what he was saying”
LUK	9	34	ct1w	writing-pronouns	ταῦτα δὲ αὐτοῦ λέγοντος	1	as he was saying this	Alternate translation: “While Peter was saying these things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
LUK	9	34	e75d	figs-explicit	ἐφοβήθησαν	1	they were afraid	These adult disciples were not afraid of clouds. Rather, given all the unusual things that had already taken place on this mountain, they were afraid of what might happen to them once the cloud came completely over them. Alternate translation: “they were very apprehensive” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	9	34	asa6		εἰσελθεῖν αὐτοὺς εἰς τὴν νεφέλην	1	they entered into the cloud	This can be expressed in terms of what the cloud did. Alternate translation: “the cloud surrounded them”
LUK	9	35	q8xy	figs-explicit	φωνὴ ἐγένετο ἐκ τῆς νεφέλης	1	there was a voice from the cloud	Luke expects readers to understand that this voice could only have belonged to God. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “God spoke to them from the cloud” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	9	35	c3gt	guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	ὁ Υἱός μου	1	my Son	This is an important title for Jesus, the **Son** of God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])

LUK	9	36	l508	figs-idiom	εὑρέθη Ἰησοῦς μόνος	1	Jesus was found alone	The term **found** is an idiom that means “could be found” or “was there.” Alternate translation: “only Jesus was there” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	9	36	l509	figs-activepassive	εὑρέθη Ἰησοῦς μόνος	1	Jesus was found alone	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could state **Jesus was found alone** with an active form. Alternate translation: “only Jesus was there” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	9	36	v9uy	figs-doublet	αὐτοὶ ἐσίγησαν, καὶ οὐδενὶ ἀπήγγειλαν	1	they were silent and told no one	These two phrases mean the same thing. (The Greek verb in the first phrase does not always mean to make no sound. It can also mean to keep a secret.) Luke uses the two phrases together for emphasis. In your translation, you could also use repetition for emphasis, or, if your readers would misunderstand this, you could combine the phrases. Alternate translation: “they kept it a secret and did not tell anyone” or “they said nothing about it to anyone” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
LUK	9	36	l510	figs-doublenegatives	οὐδενὶ ἀπήγγειλαν…οὐδὲν	1	told no one … anything	Luke uses a double negative in Greek for emphasis here, “told no one … nothing.” The second negative does not cancel the first to create a positive meaning, “told someone … something.” If for emphasis your language uses double negatives that do not cancel one another, it would be appropriate to use that construction here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
LUK	9	36	l511	figs-idiom	ἐν ἐκείναις ταῖς ἡμέραις	1	in those days	Here Luke uses the term **days** figuratively to refer to a particular time. Alternate translation: “at that time” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	9	37	q5f5	writing-newevent	ἐγένετο δὲ	1	And it happened that	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
LUK	9	38	l512	figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	behold	Luke uses the term **behold** to calls the reader’s attention to what he is about to say. Your language may have a similar expression that you can use here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	9	38	k35b	writing-participants	ἀνὴρ ἀπὸ τοῦ ὄχλου	1	a man from the crowd	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new character into the story. If your language has its own way of doing that, you can use it here in your translation. Alternate translation: “there was a man in the crowd who” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
LUK	9	38	l513		Διδάσκαλε	1	Teacher	**Teacher** is a respectful title. You can translate it with an equivalent term that your language and culture would use.
LUK	9	38	l514	figs-idiom	ἐπιβλέψαι ἐπὶ	1	look upon	This is an idiom. Alternate translation: “help” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	9	39	l515	figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	behold	The man uses the term **behold** to calls Jesus’ attention to what he is about to say. Your language may have a similar expression that you can use here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	9	39	ka7j	writing-participants	πνεῦμα	1	a spirit	The man uses this phrase to introduce the spirit into his story. If your language has its own way of doing that, you can use it here in your translation. Alternate translation: “there is an evil spirit that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
LUK	9	39	abm3	translate-unknown	μετὰ ἀφροῦ	1	with foam	When a person is having convulsions, they can have trouble breathing or swallowing. This causes white foam to form around their mouths. Alternate translation: “and foam comes out of his mouth” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	9	39	l516	figs-litotes	μόγις ἀποχωρεῖ ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ	1	it departs from him with difficulty	The man is figuratively expressing a positive meaning by using a negative word together with a word that is the opposite of the intended meaning. Alternate translation: “it attacks him very often” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
LUK	9	39	l517	figs-metaphor	συντρῖβον αὐτόν	1	crushing him	The man speaks figuratively of the spirit as if it were a heavy weight whose attacks crush the boy. This is a reference to the injuries that the spirit causes. Alternate translation: “injuring him badly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	9	41	sdu1	figs-hendiadys	ἀποκριθεὶς δὲ ὁ Ἰησοῦς εἶπεν	1	Then answering Jesus said	Together **answering** and **said** mean that Jesus responded to the man’s request. Alternate translation: “Then Jesus responded” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
LUK	9	41	bi9m	figs-apostrophe	ὦ γενεὰ ἄπιστος καὶ διεστραμμένη, ἕως πότε ἔσομαι πρὸς ὑμᾶς καὶ ἀνέξομαι ὑμῶν?	1	O unbelieving and perverted generation, until when will I be with you and bear with you?	Jesus is speaking figuratively to something that he knows cannot hear him. He is addressing the entire **generation** of people who were living at that time, and they are not all present to hear him. He is doing this to show in a very strong way how he feels about this generation. He is actually speaking to the people who can hear him, the crowd that has gathered there. If your readers might not understand this kind of figurative speech, you could translate Jesus’ words as if he were speaking directly to the crowd, since they are included in the generation that Jesus is figuratively addressing. Alternate translation: “You have all gone wrong because you do not believe, so I hope I do not have to stay here and put up with you for very long!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe]])
LUK	9	41	l518	figs-rquestion	ὦ γενεὰ ἄπιστος καὶ διεστραμμένη, ἕως πότε ἔσομαι πρὸς ὑμᾶς καὶ ἀνέξομαι ὑμῶν?	1	O unbelieving and perverted generation, until when will I be with you and bear with you?	Jesus is using the question form for emphasis. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate his words as a statement or exclamation. Alternate translation: “You have all gone wrong because you do not believe, so I hope I do not have to stay here and put up with you for very long!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	9	41	apa3	figs-doublet	ἄπιστος καὶ διεστραμμένη	1	O unbelieving and perverted generation	The terms **unbelieving** and **perverted** mean similar things. Jesus uses them together for emphasis. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could combine them into a single phrase. Alternate translation: “You have all gone wrong because you do not believe” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
LUK	9	41	qk1w	figs-you	ἕως πότε ἔσομαι πρὸς ὑμᾶς καὶ ἀνέξομαι ὑμῶν?	1	until when will I be with you and bear with you?	In both cases here, **you** is plural in Greek because Jesus is addressing a **generation** that is made up of many people. However, **generation** is a collective noun, and if your language would treat a collective noun as singular in a context like this, you could use the singular form of **you**. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
LUK	9	41	ls7b	figs-you	προσάγαγε ὧδε τὸν υἱόν σου	1	Bring your son here	Jesus is now speaking to the father of the boy, and so **your** is singular here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
LUK	9	42	l519	writing-pronouns	ἔτι…προσερχομένου αὐτοῦ	1	while he was coming	The pronoun **he** refers to the boy, not to the father. Alternate translation: “while the boy was coming” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
LUK	9	43	hz1l	figs-explicit	ἐξεπλήσσοντο δὲ πάντες ἐπὶ τῇ μεγαλειότητι τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	they all marveled at the majesty of God	Jesus performed the miracle, but the crowd recognized that **God** was the power behind the healing. Alternate translation: “Then they were all amazed that God would work so powerfully through Jesus in this way” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	9	43	d61c	writing-pronouns	πᾶσιν οἷς ἐποίει	1	everything that he was doing	The word **he** refers to Jesus, not to God the Father. Alternate translation: “everything Jesus was doing” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
LUK	9	44	gah9	figs-idiom	θέσθε ὑμεῖς εἰς τὰ ὦτα ὑμῶν τοὺς λόγους τούτους	1	You put these words in your ears	Jesus is using an idiom to tell his disciples to pay careful attention to what he is about to say.

If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this in the first person. Alternate translation: “Someone is going to betray me, the Son of Man” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
LUK	9	44	l520	figs-explicit	ὁ γὰρ Υἱὸς τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου μέλλει παραδίδοσθαι	1	the Son of Man is going to be handed over	See how you translated the title **Son of Man** in [5:24](../05/24.md). Alternate translation: “someone is going to betray me, the Messiah” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	9	44	l521	figs-metaphor	εἰς χεῖρας ἀνθρώπων	1	into the hands of men	The term **hands** figuratively represent power and control. Alternate translation: “to his enemies, who will have power over him” or (if you translated in the first person) “to my enemies, who will have power over me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	9	44	l522	figs-explicit	εἰς χεῖρας ἀνθρώπων	1	into the hands of men	It may be helpful to make explicit who these **men** are. Alternate translation: “to his enemies, who will have power over him” or (if you translated in the first person) “to my enemies, who will have power over me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

Alternate translation: “this saying … about this saying” or “this statement … about this statement” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	9	45	ub1r	figs-activepassive	ἦν παρακεκαλυμμένον ἀπ’ αὐτῶν	1	it was hidden from them	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form, and you can state who did the action. Alternate translation: “God hid its meaning from them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	9	46	dh3w	writing-pronouns	ἐν αὐτοῖς	1	among them	Be sure that it is clear in your translation that the pronoun **them** does not include Jesus. He was not arguing, along with the disciples, about who was the **greatest**. Alternate translation: “among the disciples” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
LUK	9	46	l524		τίς ἂν εἴη μείζων αὐτῶν	1	which of them might be the greatest	Alternate translation: “which one of them was the greatest”
LUK	9	47	cx62	figs-metaphor	εἰδὼς τὸν διαλογισμὸν τῆς καρδίας αὐτῶν	1	knowing the reasoning in their hearts	Here Luke uses **hearts** figuratively to represent the disciples’ thoughts and evaluations. Alternate translation: “knowing what they were thinking” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	9	48	l525	figs-hyperbole	τοῦτο τὸ παιδίον	1	this child	Jesus is using the **child** as an extreme example. He is illustrating that since he will be present in even the most humble of his followers, the disciples do not need to argue among themselves about which of them is the greatest. Everyone who is working on behalf of Jesus possesses his full honor and dignity. Alternate translation: “even someone as seemingly insignificant as this child” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
LUK	9	48	afx5	figs-metonymy	ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματί μου	1	in my name	Here, **name** is a figurative way of referring to a person by reference to something associated with him. Alternate translation: “as someone who is working on my behalf” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

LUK	9	48	awc6	figs-explicit	τὸν ἀποστείλαντά με	1	the one who sent me	Jesus assumes that his disciples will know that this means God. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “God, who sent me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	9	48	zw5t	figs-gendernotations	οὗτός ἐστιν μέγας	1	he is great	Here Jesus uses the pronoun **he** in a generic sense that includes both men and women. Alternate translation: “that is the person whom God considers to be great” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
LUK	9	49	uwr3	figs-hendiadys	ἀποκριθεὶς δὲ Ἰωάννης εἶπεν	1	Then answering John said	Together **answering** and **said** mean that John responded to what Jesus had just said. Alternate translation: “Then John responded” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
LUK	9	49	bj41	figs-exclusive	εἴδομέν…μεθ’ ἡμῶν	1	we saw … with us	When John says **we**, he is speaking of himself and some other disciples who spoke to this man, so **we** would be exclusive, if your language uses that form. However, when John says **us**, he seems to be referring to the disciples and Jesus traveling together, and since he is speaking to Jesus, **us** would be inclusive. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
LUK	9	49	py8i	figs-metonymy	ἐν τῷ ὀνόματί σου	1	in your name	The term **name** is a figurative way of referring to a person by reference to something associated with them. This expression means the person was acting with the power and authority of Jesus. Alternate translation: “on your behalf” or “as your representative” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	9	49	l526	figs-metaphor	οὐκ ἀκολουθεῖ μεθ’ ἡμῶν	1	he does not follow with us	In this case, to **follow** Jesus does not seem to mean to be one of his disciples, as in [5:27](../05/27.md), since this man was acting in Jesus’ **name**. Rather, in this context it seems to refer to traveling together in this group with Jesus. Alternate translation: “he does not travel with you in our group” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	9	50	hw85	figs-litotes	μὴ κωλύετε	1	Do not prevent him	Jesus is figuratively expressing a positive meaning by using a negative word together with a word that is the opposite of the intended meaning. You can state this positively. Alternate translation: “Allow him to continue” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
LUK	9	51	l527	writing-newevent	ἐγένετο δὲ	1	And it happened that	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])

Alternate translation: “when it was almost time for God to take him up” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	9	51	l528	figs-idiom	ἐν τῷ συνπληροῦσθαι τὰς ἡμέρας	1	when the days … were being fulfilled	Here Luke uses **days** figuratively to refer to a particular time. Alternate translation: “when it was almost time” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	9	51	l529	figs-explicit	τῆς ἀναλήμψεως αὐτοῦ	1	of his being taken up	The implication is that God would take Jesus back up to heaven, and the further implication is that this would be after Jesus died. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express one or both of those things explicitly. Alternate translation: “for God to take him up to heaven” or “for him to die and for God to take him back up to heaven” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	9	51	mq2d	figs-idiom	τὸ πρόσωπον ἐστήρισεν	1	he set his face	**Set his face** is an idiom. Alternate translation: “he firmly decided” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	9	52	b6ct	figs-idiom	ὡς ἑτοιμάσαι αὐτῷ	1	so as to prepare for him	This phrase means to make arrangements in anticipation of his arrival there, such as for food to eat, a place to stay, and possibly also a place to speak. Alternate translation: “to arrange his accommodations” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	9	53	v61k		οὐκ ἐδέξαντο αὐτόν	1	they did not welcome him	Alternate translation: “the Samaritans did not want him to stay with them”
LUK	9	53	l532	figs-synecdoche	τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ ἦν πορευόμενον εἰς Ἰερουσαλήμ	1	his face was going to Jerusalem	Luke is using one part of Jesus to represent all of him. Luke may use the **face** because Jesus was facing in the direction he was traveling. Or this may echo the expression “he set his face” in [9:52](../09/52.md). Alternate translation: “he was traveling toward Jerusalem” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
LUK	9	53	n62j	figs-explicit	ὅτι τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ ἦν πορευόμενον εἰς Ἰερουσαλήμ	1	because his face was going to Jerusalem	The Samaritans and the Jews hated each other. Therefore the Samaritans did not want to help Jesus travel to Jerusalem, which was the Jewish capital and the place where the Jews held their major religious observances. Alternate translation: “because they did not want to help any Jew make a journey to Jerusalem” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	9	54	a8sf	figs-metaphor	ἰδόντες	1	saw	The word **saw** figuratively represents notice and attention. Alternate translation: “recognized that the Samaritans were not going to accommodate Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	9	54	y4rq	figs-explicit	θέλεις εἴπωμεν πῦρ καταβῆναι ἀπὸ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ καὶ ἀναλῶσαι αὐτούς?	1	do you want us to tell fire to come down from heaven and consume them?	James and John suggested this method of judgment because they knew that this was how the prophets such as Elijah had called down judgment upon people who rejected God. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “do you want us to tell fire to come down from heaven to consume them, as Elijah did” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	9	54	l533	figs-exclusive	θέλεις εἴπωμεν	1	do you want us to tell	By **us**, James and John mean themselves, but not Jesus, so **us** is exclusive. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
LUK	9	55	pj6b	writing-pronouns	στραφεὶς…ἐπετίμησεν αὐτοῖς	1	he turned and rebuked them	The pronoun **them** refers to James and John. Jesus did not condemn the Samaritans, as the disciples expected. Alternate translation: “Jesus turned around and rebuked James and John” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
LUK	9	57	l534		τις	1	someone	This was not one of the disciples. Alternate translation: “a certain person”
LUK	9	58	yq5n	figs-merism	αἱ ἀλώπεκες φωλεοὺς ἔχουσιν, καὶ τὰ πετεινὰ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ κατασκηνώσεις	1	The foxes have dens, and the birds of the sky have nests	Jesus is using a figure of speech. By naming a creature that lives on land and a creature that flies in the air, Jesus is referring to all creatures. Alternate translation: “Every creature has a place to live” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
LUK	9	58	anv9	translate-unknown	αἱ ἀλώπεκες φωλεοὺς ἔχουσιν	1	The foxes have dens	The word **foxes** describes land animals that are similar to small dogs. The word **dens** refers to holes that these animals dig in the ground as shelters. If your readers would not be familiar with this animal and its habits, you could describe them in general terms. Alternate translation: “Little animals live in holes in the ground” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	9	58	c88m	figs-explicitinfo	τὰ πετεινὰ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ κατασκηνώσεις	1	the birds of the sky, nests	In your language, it might seem that this phrase expresses unnecessary extra information. If so, you could abbreviate it. However, you could also use an action clause to keep the sense of **sky**, to complement the idea of “ground” in the previous phrase. Alternate translation: “birds live in nests” or “birds that fly in the air live in nests” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo]])
LUK	9	58	ls02	figs-ellipsis	τὰ πετεινὰ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ κατασκηνώσεις	1	the birds of the sky, nests	Jesus is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. These words can be supplied from earlier in the sentence. Alternate translation: “birds live in nests” or “birds that fly in the air live in nests” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
LUK	9	58	r7vq	figs-123person	ὁ…Υἱὸς τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου	1	the Son of Man	**Jesus** is speaking about himself in the third person. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this in the first person. Alternate translation: “I, the Son of Man” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
LUK	9	58	l535	figs-explicit	ὁ…Υἱὸς τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου	1	the Son of Man	See how you translated the title **Son of Man** in [5:24](../05/24.md). Alternate translation: “I, the Messiah” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	9	58	l536	figs-explicit	οὐκ ἔχει ποῦ τὴν κεφαλὴν κλίνῃ	1	does not have anywhere to lay his head	Jesus implies that if this person were to follow him, he too might not have a home. Alternate translation: “does not have a home anywhere, so if you become his disciple, expect that you will not have a home either” or (if you translated in the first person) “do not have a home anywhere, so if you become my disciple, expect that you will not have a home either” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	9	58	l537	figs-metonymy	οὐκ ἔχει ποῦ τὴν κεφαλὴν κλίνῃ	1	does not have anywhere to lay his head	This expression figuratively means “does not have anywhere to sleep,” by association with something that a person does in order to sleep, **lay** down his **head**. And a place to sleep, by association, means a home, since that is where people sleep. Alternate translation: “does not have a home anywhere” or (if you translated in the first person) “do not have a home anywhere” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	9	58	ff62	figs-hyperbole	οὐκ ἔχει ποῦ τὴν κεφαλὴν κλίνῃ	1	does not have anywhere to lay his head	Jesus actually did find places to sleep wherever he went to teach and heal, but he says figuratively that he has no such place at all to emphasize that he has no permanent home. Alternate translation: “does not have a permanent home” or (if you translated in the first person) “do not have a permanent home” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
LUK	9	59	l538	figs-metaphor	ἀκολούθει μοι	1	Follow me	As in [5:27](../05/27.md), to **follow** Jesus means to become one of his disciples. Alternate translation: “I want you to be one of my disciples” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	9	59	l539		ἐπίτρεψόν μοι ἀπελθόντι, πρῶτον θάψαι τὸν πατέρα μου	1	permit me to go first to bury my father	It is unclear whether the man’s father had died and that he would bury him immediately, or whether the man wanted to wait for a longer amount of time until his father died so that he could bury him then. The main point is that the man wanted to do something else first before going with Jesus. Alternate translation: “before I do that, let me go and bury my father”
LUK	9	59	l540	figs-metonymy	ἐπίτρεψόν μοι ἀπελθόντι, πρῶτον θάψαι τὸν πατέρα μου	1	permit me to go first to bury my father	One possible meaning of this expression is that the man wanted to wait until he had received his inheritance from his father so that he could live on that money while traveling with Jesus. If so, then he would be referring to the inheritance by association with his father’s death, and he would be referring to his father’s death by association with his burial. Alternate translation: “let me wait until I receive my inheritance” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	9	60	l541	figs-metaphor	ἄφες τοὺς νεκροὺς θάψαι τοὺς ἑαυτῶν νεκρούς	1	Let the dead bury their own dead	Jesus does not mean literally that dead people will bury other dead people. Instead, the expression **the dead** likely refers figuratively to those who do not follow Jesus and so are spiritually dead. Alternate translation: “Let people who are not concerned about spiritual things take care of everyday matters” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	9	60	l542	figs-nominaladj	τοὺς νεκροὺς	1	the dead	Jesus is using the adjective **dead** as a noun in order to indicate a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “people who are dead” or “people who are not concerned about spiritual things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
LUK	9	60	l543	figs-abstractnouns	τὴν Βασιλείαν τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	the kingdom of God	See how you decided to translate this phrase in [4:43](../04/43.md). If your readers would misunderstand the abstract noun **kingdom**, you could express the idea behind it with a verb such as “rule.” Alternate translation: “how God will rule” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
LUK	9	61	l544	figs-metaphor	ἀκολουθήσω σοι	1	I will follow you	As in [5:27](../05/27.md), to **follow** Jesus means to become one of his disciples. Alternate translation: “I want to be one of your disciples” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	9	61	l545		πρῶτον δὲ ἐπίτρεψόν μοι	1	but first permit me	Alternate translation: “but before I do that, please let me”
LUK	9	61	l546	figs-metonymy	τοῖς εἰς τὸν οἶκόν μου	1	those in my home	This person is referring figuratively to his family by association with where they live. Alternate translation: “to my family” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	9	62	l547	figs-metaphor	οὐδεὶς ἐπιβαλὼν τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ ἐπ’ ἄροτρον καὶ βλέπων εἰς τὰ ὀπίσω, εὔθετός ἐστιν τῇ Βασιλείᾳ τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	No one, having put his hand on a plow, yet looking to the things behind, is fit for the kingdom of God	Jesus responds with an illustration that is designed to teach this person about what is required to be his disciple. He means that a person is not suitable for the kingdom to God if his past loyalties are more important to him. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain this illustration. Alternate translation, add: “No one can plow straight if he is looking backwards, and in the same way, no one will be useful in the kingdom of God if his past loyalties are more important to him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	9	62	l548	figs-synecdoche	οὐδεὶς ἐπιβαλὼν τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ ἐπ’ ἄροτρον	1	No one, having put his hand on a plow	Jesus refers figuratively to a person using a plow by describing one part of that activity, guiding the plow with the **hand**. Alternate translation: “No one who is using a plow” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
LUK	9	62	l553	translate-unknown	οὐδεὶς ἐπιβαλὼν τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ ἐπ’ ἄροτρον	1	No one, having put his hand on a plow	A **plow** is a tool that farmers use to break up soil to prepare a field for planting. Plows have sharp, pointed prongs that dig into the soil. They usually have handles that the farmer uses to guide the plow. If your readers would not be familiar with this kind of tool, you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “No one who needs to go straight forward” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	9	62	l549	figs-explicit	βλέπων εἰς τὰ ὀπίσω	1	looking to the things behind	The implication is that anyone who is looking backwards while plowing cannot guide the plow where it needs to go. That person must focus on looking forward in order to plow well. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “looking backwards, and so not going in the right direction” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	9	62	l550	figs-abstractnouns	εὔθετός ἐστιν τῇ Βασιλείᾳ τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	is fit for the kingdom of God	See how you decided to translate the phrase **the kingdom of God** in [4:43](../04/43.md). If your readers would misunderstand the abstract noun **kingdom**, you could express the idea behind it with a verb such as “rule.” Alternate translation: “can really let God rule his life” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
LUK	10	intro	z899			0		# Luke 10 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>1. Jesus sends seventy-two disciples to teach and heal (10:1-24)<br>2. Jesus tells the Parable of the Good Samaritan (10:25-37)<br>3. Jesus visits Mary and Martha (10:38-43)<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Harvest<br><br>Harvest refers to the time when people gather in the food they have planted so they can eat some of it right away and store the rest for future use. Jesus uses this as a metaphor to teach his followers that they need to go and tell other people about him so that those people can become part of God’s kingdom. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]])<br><br>### Neighbor<br><br>The Jews helped their Jewish neighbors who needed help, and they expected their Jewish neighbors to help them. Jesus wanted them to understand that people who were not Jews were also their neighbors, so he told them a story about this (10:29-37). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])<br><br>## Important textual issues in this chapter<br><br>### “72”<br><br>In 10:1 and 10:17, some ancient manuscripts of the Bible read “72,” but others read “70.” ULT reads “72,” but it mentions in a footnote that scholars are divided as to which number was originally in the book of Luke.<br><br>### “Jesus”<br><br>In 10:39, many of the best ancient manuscripts read “Jesus,” but some read “the Lord.” ULT reads “Jesus.”<br><br>In both of these cases, if a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it has. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to follow the example of ULT. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
LUK	10	1	u8l6	writing-newevent	μετὰ δὲ ταῦτα	1	And after these things	Luke uses this phrase to mark a new event in the story. If your language has a similar expression that it uses for this same purpose, you can use that here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
LUK	10	1	l551		ὁ Κύριος	1	the Lord	Here Luke refers to Jesus by the title **the Lord** to show his authority. Alternate translation: “the Lord Jesus”
LUK	10	1	m75c	translate-textvariants	ἑβδομήκοντα δύο	1	72	See the discussion of textual issues at the end of the General Notes to this chapter to decide whether to say **72** or “70” in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
LUK	10	1	g8ka	figs-idiom	ἀπέστειλεν αὐτοὺς ἀνὰ δύο	1	sent them out by twos	This phrase is an idiom. Alternate translation: “sent them out two by two” or “sent them out in groups of two” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	10	1	l554	figs-metaphor	πρὸ προσώπου αὐτοῦ	1	before his face	Here, **face** figuratively means the front of a person. Alternate translation: “ahead of him” or “to prepare the way for him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	10	2	fx9w	figs-events	ἔλεγεν δὲ πρὸς αὐτούς	1	And he said to them	Jesus said these things to the 72 disciples before they actually went out. Alternate translation: “He had said to them” or “Before they went out, he told them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-events]])
LUK	10	2	ju6z	figs-metaphor	ὁ μὲν θερισμὸς πολύς, οἱ δὲ ἐργάται ὀλίγοι	1	The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few	This statement means, “There is a big crop, but there are not enough workers to bring it in.” Jesus is speaking figuratively. Alternate translation: “There are many people who are ready to enter God’s kingdom, but there are not enough disciples to help them understand how to do that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	10	2	l555	figs-exmetaphor	τοῦ Κυρίου τοῦ θερισμοῦ	1	the Lord of the harvest	Jesus continues to speak figuratively and extends his metaphor by describing God as **the Lord of the harvest**. Alternate translation: “God, who leads people to believe” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])
LUK	10	2	l556	figs-exmetaphor	ὅπως ἐργάτας ἐκβάλῃ εἰς τὸν θερισμὸν αὐτοῦ	1	that he would send out laborers into his harvest	Jesus extends his metaphor even further by describing disciples who help others to trust in him as **laborers** in the **harvest**. Alternate translation: “to send more disciples to go and help people trust in me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])
LUK	10	3	x732	figs-explicit	ὑπάγετε	1	Go	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state explicitly where Jesus wants these disciples to go. Alternate translation: “Go to the cities and places where I am sending you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	10	3	l557	figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	Behold	Jesus uses the term **behold** to get his disciples to focus their attention on what he is about to say. Alternate translation: “Listen carefully now” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	10	3	u8h7	figs-simile	ἀποστέλλω ὑμᾶς ὡς ἄρνας ἐν μέσῳ λύκων	1	I send you out as lambs in the midst of wolves	Wolves attack and kill sheep. This simile is a warning to the disciples whom Jesus is sending out that there will be people who will want to harm them. You could explain the meaning of this figurative expression in your translation. (However, you could also reproduce the simile, as suggested in the next note.) Alternate translation: “when I send you out, there are going to be some people who will want to harm you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
LUK	10	3	l558	translate-unknown	ἀποστέλλω ὑμᾶς ὡς ἄρνας ἐν μέσῳ λύκων	1	I send you out as lambs in the midst of wolves	Jesus’ disciples would have known that **lambs** are gentle animals that have been domesticated for their wool, milk, meat, and leather, and that **wolves** are predatory land animals, similar to large dogs, that hunt and kill in packs. If you would like to reproduce the simile, but your readers would not be familiar with these animals, you could use general terms. Alternate translation: “I am sending you out like harmless animals that will encounter a group of predators” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	10	3	l559	figs-you	ὑμᾶς	1	you	Since Jesus is speaking to these 72 disciples as a group, **you** is plural here and through [10:12](../10/12.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
LUK	10	4	l560	figs-idiom	μὴ βαστάζετε βαλλάντιον, μὴ πήραν, μὴ ὑποδήματα	1	Do not carry a money bag, nor a sack, nor sandals	Here Jesus is using the word **carry** in an idiomatic sense to mean “bring along.” He is not envisioning that these disciples might carry their sandals in their hands. Alternate translation: “Do not bring any money or provisions or extra clothes with you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	10	4	fz6p	figs-metonymy	μὴ βαστάζετε βαλλάντιον, μὴ πήραν, μὴ ὑποδήματα	1	Do not carry a money bag, nor a sack, nor sandals	While Jesus probably means what he says literally about not bringing these specific items, he is also using them figuratively with larger meanings. The **money bag** represents the money it would contain. The **sack** represents the provisions someone would carry in it for a journey. The **sandals** represent, in this culture, more clothing and equipment than is strictly needed. Alternate translation: “Do not bring any money or provisions or extra clothes with you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	10	4	l561	figs-explicit	μὴ βαστάζετε βαλλάντιον, μὴ πήραν, μὴ ὑποδήματα	1	Do not carry a money bag, nor a sack, nor sandals	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state explicitly why Jesus does not want his disciples to bring these things with them. As he will explain in [10:7](../10/07.md), he wants the people who receive his message to provide for those who bring the message. Alternate translation: “Do not bring any money or provisions or extra clothes with you, because the people who receive my message will provide for you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	10	4	tj52	figs-hyperbole	μηδένα κατὰ τὴν ὁδὸν ἀσπάσησθε	1	greet no one on the road	Jesus is generalizing to indicate that these disciples should go quickly to the places where he is sending them to prepare the way for him. He is not telling them to be rude. Alternate translation: “make your journey as quickly as possible” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
LUK	10	5	l562	figs-quotesinquotes	λέγετε, εἰρήνη τῷ οἴκῳ τούτῳ	1	say, ‘Peace be to this house’	Luke is quoting Jesus, and Jesus is quoting what he wants his disciples to say. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “say that you want there to be peace in that house” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	10	5	zk69	figs-metonymy	εἰρήνη τῷ οἴκῳ τούτῳ	1	Peace be to this house	The term **house** refers figuratively to the people who live in the house. Alternate translation: “May the people in this household have peace” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	10	5	l563	figs-idiom	εἰρήνη τῷ οἴκῳ τούτῳ	1	Peace be to this house	This was an idiomatic expression, based on the Hebrew concept of “shalom,” that was both a greeting and a blessing. Alternate translation: “I greet all of you in this household and I wish for God to bless you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	10	6	x5e4	figs-idiom	υἱὸς εἰρήνης	1	a son of peace	The expression **son of** refers figuratively to a person who shares the qualities of something. Alternate translation: “a person who wants peace with God and with people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	10	6	pq5j	figs-metaphor	ἐπαναπαήσεται ἐπ’ αὐτὸν ἡ εἰρήνη ὑμῶν	1	your peace will rest upon him	Here, **upon** creates a spatial metaphor. It means that this person will experience the peace that God gives in a special and lasting way. Alternate translation: “he will deeply experience the peace that you wish him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	10	6	it4v	figs-ellipsis	εἰ…μή γε	1	if not	It may be helpful to restate the entire phrase. Alternate translation: “if there is no one there who wants peace with God and with people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
LUK	10	6	zpx9	figs-personification	ἐφ’ ὑμᾶς ἀνακάμψει	1	it will return to you	Jesus describes **peace** as a living thing that could choose to leave one person and go to another person. Alternate translation: “you will experience that peace yourselves instead” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
LUK	10	7	ki3k		ἐν αὐτῇ δὲ τῇ οἰκίᾳ μένετε	1	remain in that house	Jesus was not saying that they should stay in the house all the time and never leave it, but that they should make it their base of operations for as long as they were in that place. Alternate translation: “stay at that house”

LUK	10	7	u3vs	writing-proverbs	ἄξιος γὰρ ὁ ἐργάτης τοῦ μισθοῦ αὐτοῦ	1	for the laborer is worthy of his wages	Jesus is quoting or creating a proverb, a short saying about something that is generally true in life, to explain the reason for these arrangements. You could translate the proverb directly into your language, or you could explain its meaning. Alternate translation: “for since you will be teaching and healing the people, they should provide you with a place to stay and food to eat” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-proverbs]])
LUK	10	7	kd8i		μὴ μεταβαίνετε ἐξ οἰκίας εἰς οἰκίαν	1	Do not move around from house to house	This expression describes staying in different houses rather than making one house the base of operations the whole time. Jesus is repeating his earlier instruction, **remain in that house**, for emphasis. Jesus is not saying that these disciples cannot go to meet with people in other homes. Alternate translation: “As I said, stay at that house”
LUK	10	8	k8yb	writing-pronouns	καὶ δέχωνται ὑμᾶς	1	and they receive you	The pronoun **they** refers to the people living in this city. Alternate translation: “if the people there welcome you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
LUK	10	8	wd2x	figs-activepassive	ἐσθίετε τὰ παρατιθέμενα ὑμῖν	1	eat what is served to you	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who would do the action. Alternate translation: “eat whatever food the people of that city serve you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	10	9	ws6g	figs-nominaladj	τοὺς…ἀσθενεῖς	1	the sick	Jesus is using the adjective **sick** as a noun in order to indicate a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way.

LUK	10	9	l565	writing-pronouns	ἐν αὐτῇ	1	in it	Alternate translation: “who live in that city” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
LUK	10	9	l566	figs-quotesinquotes	λέγετε αὐτοῖς, ἤγγικεν ἐφ’ ὑμᾶς ἡ Βασιλεία τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	say to them, ‘The kingdom of God has come close to you’	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “tell them that the kingdom of God has come close to them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	10	9	e1he	figs-abstractnouns	ἤγγικεν ἐφ’ ὑμᾶς ἡ Βασιλεία τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	The kingdom of God has come close to you	The idea behind the abstract noun **kingdom** can be expressed with a verb such as “rule.” This could mean: (1) the kingdom of God is close in location, that is, its activities are happening nearby. Alternate translation: “God is ruling in this area” (2) the kingdom of God is close in time, that is, it will begin soon. Alternate translation: “God will soon begin to rule as king” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
LUK	10	10	nt9n	writing-pronouns	καὶ μὴ δέχωνται ὑμᾶς	1	and they do not receive you	This is a direct contrast to the similar expression in [10:8](../10/08.md). Once again the pronoun **they** refers to the people living in this city. Alternate translation: “if the people there do not welcome you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
LUK	10	11	l567	figs-quotesinquotes	καὶ τὸν κονιορτὸν τὸν κολληθέντα ἡμῖν, ἐκ τῆς πόλεως ὑμῶν εἰς τοὺς πόδας ἀπομασσόμεθα ὑμῖν; πλὴν τοῦτο γινώσκετε, ὅτι ἤγγικεν ἡ Βασιλεία τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Even the dust that clings to us from your city on our feet we wipe off against you! But know this, that the kingdom of God has come near	Luke is quoting Jesus, and Jesus is quoting what he wants his disciples to say. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation (continuing from the end of the previous verse): “that you are going to wipe even the dust from their city off your feet as a warning to them, but that you still want them to know that the kingdom of God came close to them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	10	11	bc9h	translate-symaction	καὶ τὸν κονιορτὸν τὸν κολληθέντα ἡμῖν, ἐκ τῆς πόλεως ὑμῶν εἰς τοὺς πόδας ἀπομασσόμεθα ὑμῖν	1	Even the dust that clings to us from your city on our feet we wipe off against you	This is a symbolic action by which these disciples are to show that they do not want to have the slightest connection with the people of any city who reject Jesus. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain its significance. Alternate translation: “Because you have rejected Jesus, we want to have nothing to do with you. We do not even want to have the dust from your town on our feet” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
LUK	10	11	l634	figs-youdual	ἀπομασσόμεθα	1	we wipe off	Since Jesus was sending these people out in groups of two, two people would be saying this. So languages that have a dual form of “we” should use that form. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
LUK	10	11	s7ks	figs-idiom	πλὴν τοῦτο γινώσκετε	1	But know this	The phrase introduces a warning. Alternate translation: “But we must warn you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	10	11	fdk3	figs-abstractnouns	ἤγγικεν ἡ Βασιλεία τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	the kingdom of God has come near	See how you translated the similar sentence in [10:9](../10/09.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
LUK	10	12	hhl1		λέγω ὑμῖν, ὅτι	1	I say to you that	Jesus says this to emphasize that what he is about to tell these disciples is very important. Alternate translation: “Take special note that”
LUK	10	12	l568	figs-idiom	ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ	1	on that day	Jesus is using the term **day** to refer figuratively to a specific time. Alternate translation: “when God judges everyone for what they have done” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	10	12	m7ch	figs-explicit	ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ	1	on that day	Jesus expected his disciples to understand that he was referring to the time when God will bring final judgment. Alternate translation: “when God judges everyone for what they have done” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	10	12	qg62	figs-metonymy	Σοδόμοις…ἀνεκτότερον ἔσται, ἢ τῇ πόλει ἐκείνῃ	1	it will be more tolerable for Sodom than for that city	Jesus uses the name of the city, **Sodom**, to refer figuratively to the people who lived there. Alternate translation: “God will judge the people of that town more severely than he will judge the people of Sodom” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	10	12	l569	figs-explicit	Σοδόμοις…ἀνεκτότερον ἔσται, ἢ τῇ πόλει ἐκείνῃ	1	it will be more tolerable for Sodom than for that city	Jesus assumes that these disciples will know that God destroyed the city of Sodom because the people in it were so wicked. The implication is that it must therefore be an extremely serious offense to reject the messengers of the kingdom of God. Alternate translation: “God will judge the people of that town more severely than he will judge the people of Sodom, even though he destroyed their city because they were so wicked” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	10	13	sf42	figs-apostrophe	οὐαί σοι, Χοραζείν! οὐαί σοι, Βηθσαϊδά!	1	Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida!	Jesus is speaking figuratively to two cities that he knows cannot hear him. He is doing this to show in a very strong way how he feels about those cities. He is actually speaking to the people who can hear him, the disciples whom he is sending out. If your readers might not understand this kind of figurative speech, you could translate Jesus’ words as if he were speaking directly to his disciples. Alternate translation: “Chorazin and Bethsaida are two of the cities whose people God will judge severely for rejecting my message” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe]])
LUK	10	13	l570	figs-idiom	οὐαί σοι, Χοραζείν! οὐαί σοι, Βηθσαϊδά!	1	Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida!	See how you translated this phrase in [6:24](../06/24.md). Alternate translation: “how terrible it will be for you, Chorazin and Bethsaida!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	10	13	l571	figs-metonymy	οὐαί σοι, Χοραζείν! οὐαί σοι, Βηθσαϊδά!	1	Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida!	Jesus is using the names of these cities to refer figuratively to the people who live there. Alternate translation: “How terrible it will be for you people of Chorazin and Bethsaida!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	10	13	l572	figs-you	οὐαί σοι, Χοραζείν! οὐαί σοι, Βηθσαϊδά!	1	Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida!	Jesus is addressing an individual city in each of these phrases, so **you** is singular in both cases. However, if you decide to translate this as “you people of Chorazin and Bethsaida,” then **you** would be plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
LUK	10	13	l573	translate-names	Χοραζείν…Βηθσαϊδά!	1	Chorazin … Bethsaida	These are the names of two cities. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

He is doing this to express disappointment and regret about what is happening in the present. Be sure to translate this in such a way that your readers will know that this event actually did not happen but they will understand why Jesus is imagining it. Alternate translation: “I can well imagine that if the people of Tyre and Sidon had witnessed the miracles that I performed for you, they would have repented a long time ago” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
LUK	10	13	l574	figs-explicit	ὅτι εἰ ἐν Τύρῳ καὶ Σιδῶνι ἐγενήθησαν αἱ δυνάμεις, αἱ γενόμεναι ἐν ὑμῖν, πάλαι ἂν…μετενόησαν	1	For if the mighty works that happened in you had happened in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago	Jesus assumes that these disciples will know that God destroyed the cities of Tyre and Sidon because the people in them were so wicked. So the implication is similar to the one about the people of Sodom. Alternate translation: “God destroyed the cities of Tyre and Sidon because they were so wicked. But even the people who lived in those cities would have repented if they had seen the miracles I did in Chorazin and Bethsaida. So the people of Chorazin and Bethsaida certainly should have repented as well” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	10	13	l575	figs-metonymy	Τύρῳ καὶ Σιδῶνι	1	Tyre and Sidon	Jesus uses the names of these cities to refer figuratively to the people who lived there. Alternate translation: “the people of Tyre and Sidon” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	10	13	l576	translate-names	Τύρῳ καὶ Σιδῶνι	1	Tyre and Sidon	**Tyre** and **Sidon** are the names of two cities. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	10	13	l577	figs-youdual	αἱ δυνάμεις, αἱ γενόμεναι ἐν ὑμῖν	1	the mighty works that happened in you	Since Jesus is addressing two cities, **you** would be dual here if your language uses that form. Otherwise, it would be plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
LUK	10	13	it4x	translate-symaction	ἂν ἐν σάκκῳ καὶ σποδῷ καθήμενοι μετενόησαν	1	they would have repented … sitting in sackcloth and ashes	Jesus is saying that the people of Tyre and Sidon would have performed these actions, which are signs of humility and sorrow, to show that they were very sorry for committing their sins. Alternate translation: “they would have shown how sorry they were for their sins … by sitting on the ground wearing rough clothes and putting ashes on their heads” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
LUK	10	14	l578	figs-metonymy	Τύρῳ καὶ Σιδῶνι, ἀνεκτότερον ἔσται…ἢ ὑμῖν	1	it will be more tolerable for Tyre and for Sidon … than for you	Jesus uses the names of these cities, **Tyre** and **Sidon**, to refer figuratively to the people who lived there. Alternate translation: “God will judge you people of Chorazin and Bethsaida more severely than he will judge the people who lived in Tyre and Sidon” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	10	14	ikt3	figs-explicit	Τύρῳ καὶ Σιδῶνι, ἀνεκτότερον ἔσται…ἢ ὑμῖν	1	it will be more tolerable for Tyre and for Sidon … than for you	Jesus assumes that these disciples will know that God destroyed the cities of Tyre and Sidon because the people in them were so wicked. The implication, as in the case of Sodom, is that it must therefore be an extremely grave offense to reject the messengers of the kingdom of God. Alternate translation: “God will judge you people of Chorazin and Bethsaida more severely than he will judge the people who lived in Tyre and Sidon, even though he destroyed their cities because they were so wicked” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	10	14	l579	figs-explicit	Τύρῳ καὶ Σιδῶνι, ἀνεκτότερον ἔσται…ἢ ὑμῖν	1	it will be more tolerable for Tyre and for Sidon … than for you	It may be helpful to state clearly the reason why God will judge Chorazin and Bethsaida. Alternate translation: “because you did not repent and believe in me even though you saw me do miracles, God will judge you people of Chorazin and Bethsaida more severely than he will judge the people who lived in Tyre and Sidon” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	10	14	txw5	figs-explicit	ἐν τῇ κρίσει	1	at the judgment	The disciples would have understood that Jesus was referring to the time when God will bring final judgment. Alternate translation: “at the time when God judges everyone for what they have done” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	10	14	l580	figs-youdual	ὑμῖν	1	you	Since Jesus is addressing two cities, **you** would be dual here if your language uses that form. Otherwise, it would be plural. Alternate translation: “you people of Chorazin and Bethsaida” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
LUK	10	15	h28u	figs-apostrophe	σύ, Καφαρναούμ, μὴ ἕως οὐρανοῦ ὑψωθήσῃ?	1	you, Capernaum, you will not be exalted to heaven, will you?	Jesus is speaking figuratively to another city that he knows cannot hear him. He is doing this once again to show in a very strong way how he feels about this city. He is actually speaking to the people who can hear him, the disciples whom he is sending out. If your readers might not understand this kind of figurative speech, you could translate Jesus’ words as if he were speaking directly to his disciples. Alternate translation: “The people of Capernaum are wrong to think that God is going to honor them greatly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe]])
LUK	10	15	l581	figs-doublenegatives	σύ, Καφαρναούμ, μὴ ἕως οὐρανοῦ ὑψωθήσῃ?	1	you, Capernaum, you will not be exalted to heaven, will you?	In Greek, the first word of the question that Jesus asks Capernaum is a negative word that can be used to turn a negative statement into a question that expects a negative answer. ULT shows this by adding, **will you?** Your language may have other ways of asking a question that expects a negative answer, for example, by changing the word order of a positive statement. Translate this in the way that would be clearest in your language. Alternate translation: “you people of Capernaum, do you really think that God is going to honor you greatly?” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
LUK	10	15	enp6	figs-rquestion	σύ, Καφαρναούμ, μὴ ἕως οὐρανοῦ ὑψωθήσῃ?	1	you, Capernaum, you will not be exalted to heaven, will you?	Jesus is using the question form to teach.

Alternate translation: “you people of Capernaum are wrong to think that God is going to honor you greatly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	10	15	gk9v	figs-metaphor	σύ, Καφαρναούμ, μὴ ἕως οὐρανοῦ ὑψωθήσῃ?	1	you, Capernaum, you will not be exalted to heaven, will you?	To be **exalted** or “lifted up” is a spatial metaphor that figuratively indicates receiving honor. To be lifted all the way up **to heaven** (or “to the sky,” another possible meaning) figuratively means to receive very great honor. Alternate translation: “you people of Capernaum are wrong to think that God is going to honor you greatly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	10	15	l582	figs-metonymy	σύ, Καφαρναούμ	1	you, Capernaum	Jesus uses the name of this city to refer figuratively to the people who live there. Alternate translation: “you people of Capernaum” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	10	15	l583	figs-you	σύ, Καφαρναούμ	1	you, Capernaum	Jesus is addressing an individual city, so **you** is singular here and in the rest of this verse. However, if you decide to translate this as “you people of Capernaum,” then **you** would be plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
LUK	10	15	l584	translate-names	Καφαρναούμ	1	Capernaum	**Capernaum** is the name of a city. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	10	15	l585	figs-activepassive	ἕως οὐρανοῦ ὑψωθήσῃ	1	you will … be exalted to heaven	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who would do the action.

LUK	10	15	l586	figs-explicit	ἕως οὐρανοῦ ὑψωθήσῃ	1	you will … be exalted to heaven	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state the reason why the people of Capernaum think that God would want to honor them. Alternate translation: “God is going to honor you greatly because you are such good people and your city is so prosperous” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	10	15	l587	figs-metaphor	τοῦ ᾍδου καταβήσῃ	1	You will be brought down as far as Hades	To be **brought down** is another spatial metaphor. It figuratively indicates experiencing punishment and dishonor. To be brought down all the way to Hades, the underworld (that is, the abode of the dead), figuratively means to receive very great punishment or dishonor. Alternate translation: “God is going to punish you severely” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	10	15	bjh5	figs-activepassive	τοῦ ᾍδου καταβήσῃ	1	You will be brought down as far as Hades	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who would do the action.

LUK	10	15	l588	figs-explicit	τοῦ ᾍδου καταβήσῃ	1	You will be brought down as far as Hades	It may be helpful to state clearly the reason why God will judge Capernaum. Alternate translation: “God is going to punish you severely because you did not repent and believe in me, even though you saw me do miracles” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	10	16	i786	figs-metaphor	ὁ ἀκούων ὑμῶν, ἐμοῦ ἀκούει	1	The one who listens to you listens to me	You could translate this metaphor as a simile. Alternate translation: “When someone listens to you, it is as if they were listening to me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	10	16	q56b	figs-metaphor	ὁ ἀθετῶν ὑμᾶς, ἐμὲ ἀθετεῖ	1	the one who rejects you rejects me	You could also translate this metaphor as a simile. Alternate translation: “when someone rejects you, it is as if they were rejecting me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	10	16	g3fx	figs-metaphor	ὁ…ἐμὲ ἀθετῶν, ἀθετεῖ τὸν ἀποστείλαντά με	1	the one who rejects me rejects the one who sent me	You could also translate this metaphor as a simile. Alternate translation: “when someone rejects me, it is as if they were rejecting the one who sent me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	10	16	eus8	figs-explicit	τὸν ἀποστείλαντά με	1	the one who sent me	This refers implictly to God, who appointed Jesus for this special task. Alternate translation: “God who sent me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	10	17	m7nh	figs-explicit	ὑπέστρεψαν δὲ οἱ ἑβδομήκοντα δύο	1	then the 72 returned	Some languages will need to say that the 72 actually went out first, as UST does. Alternate translation: “So the 72 disciples went out and did as Jesus had told them to do, and then they returned” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	10	17	prj8	translate-textvariants	ἑβδομήκοντα δύο	1	72	As in [10:1](../10/01.md), see the discussion of textual issues at the end of the General Notes to this chapter to decide whether to say **72** or “70” in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
LUK	10	17	l589	figs-activepassive	τὰ δαιμόνια ὑποτάσσεται ἡμῖν	1	the demons are subjected to us	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “the demons obey us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	10	17	cx7b	figs-metonymy	ἐν τῷ ὀνόματί σου	1	in your name	The term **name** refers figuratively to Jesus’ power and authority. Alternate translation: “when we command them using the authority that you gave us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	10	18	a37w	figs-simile	ἐθεώρουν τὸν Σατανᾶν ὡς ἀστραπὴν ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ πεσόντα	1	I was watching Satan fall from heaven like lightning	Jesus uses a simile to express that while his 72 disciples were out proclaiming the kingdom of God, he discerned that this was a quick and decisive defeat for Satan. If your readers would be familiar with lightning, you could use the same simile in your translation. Otherwise, you could use another comparison to something that happens rapidly and evidently. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
LUK	10	18	v8fl	figs-metaphor	ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ πεσόντα	1	fall from heaven	While Jesus actually did see this in his vision, if it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the meaning of this image, as UST does. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	10	18	l590	translate-names	Σατανᾶν	1	Satan	**Satan** is the name of the devil. It occurs a few more times in this book. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	10	19	l591	figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	Behold	Jesus uses **behold** to focus his disciples’ attention on what he is about to say. Alternate translation: “Listen carefully now” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	10	19	xl7q	figs-metaphor	τὴν ἐξουσίαν τοῦ πατεῖν ἐπάνω ὄφεων καὶ σκορπίων	1	authority to tread on snakes and scorpions	This could mean: (1) Jesus is referring to actual **snakes and scorpions** and saying that God will protect his disciples from these dangers everywhere they travel to proclaim the kingdom. Alternate translation: “protection from snakes and scorpions, even if you step on them” (2) the phrase **snakes and scorpions** is a figurative way of describing evil spirits. Alternate translation: “the power to defeat evil spirits” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	10	19	l592	translate-unknown	ὄφεων	1	snakes	In context, this clearly means poisonous **snakes**. If your readers would not be familiar with **snakes**, you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “poisonous biting animals” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	10	19	mla6	translate-unknown	σκορπίων	1	scorpions	The term **scorpions** describes small animals that are related to spiders. They have two claws and a poisonous stinger in their tail. If your readers would not be familiar with **scorpions**, you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “poisonous stinging animals” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	10	19	uvt4	figs-explicit	καὶ ἐπὶ πᾶσαν τὴν δύναμιν τοῦ ἐχθροῦ	1	and over all the power of the enemy	This phrase continues the meaning from earlier in the sentence. The **enemy** is Satan, as described in the previous verse. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “I have also given you authority to overcome the resistance of Satan” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	10	19	l593	figs-doublenegatives	οὐδὲν ὑμᾶς οὐ μὴ ἀδικήσῃ	1	nothing will harm you at all	Here Jesus uses a double negative for emphasis, “nothing in no way will hurt you.” The second negative does not cancel the first to create a positive meaning, “something in some way might hurt you.” If your language uses double negatives for emphasis that do not cancel one another, it would be appropriate to use that construction here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
LUK	10	20	cs52	figs-hyperbole	ἐν τούτῳ μὴ χαίρετε, ὅτι τὰ πνεύματα ὑμῖν ὑποτάσσεται, χαίρετε δὲ ὅτι τὰ ὀνόματα ὑμῶν ἐνγέγραπται ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς	1	do not rejoice in this, that the spirits are subjected to you, but rejoice that your names are written in the heavens	Jesus is not actually telling the disciples not to rejoice over the way God has allowed them to deliver people who were oppressed by demons. Rather, he is exaggerating to emphasize that the disciples should rejoice even more that their names are written in heaven. Alternate translation: “rejoice that your names are written in heaven even more than you rejoice that the spirits submit to you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
LUK	10	20	l594	figs-activepassive	τὰ πνεύματα ὑμῖν ὑποτάσσεται	1	the spirits are subjected to you	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “the demons must obey you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	10	20	s4cj	figs-activepassive	τὰ ὀνόματα ὑμῶν ἐνγέγραπται ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς	1	your names are written in the heavens	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who has done the action. Alternate translation: “God has written down your names in heaven” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	10	20	l595	figs-explicit	τὰ ὀνόματα ὑμῶν ἐνγέγραπται ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς	1	your names are written in the heavens	While it may be literally true that there is a written record of names in heaven, you may wish to express the meaning and significance of this in your translation. Alternate translation: “God in heaven knows that you belong to him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	10	21	l596	figs-idiom	ἐν αὐτῇ τῇ ὥρᾳ	1	At that hour	Here Luke uses the term **hour** figuratively to refer to a particular time. Alternate translation: “At that same time” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	10	21	l597	figs-youformal	ἐξομολογοῦμαί σοι, Πάτερ	1	I thank you, Father	Use your best judgment about whether the formal or informal form of **you** would be more natural in your language here. Jesus is speaking as an adult son would to a father with whom he had a close relationship. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youformal]])
LUK	10	21	mf9d	guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	Πάτερ	1	Father	**Father** is an important title for God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
LUK	10	21	rs3w	figs-merism	Κύριε τοῦ οὐρανοῦ καὶ τῆς γῆς	1	Lord of heaven and earth	Jesus is using a figure of speech to describe something by naming its two components. Together **heaven** and **earth** represent everything that exists. Alternate translation: “you who rule over everything that exists” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
LUK	10	21	n6xb	figs-extrainfo	ταῦτα	1	these things	Jesus is likely using this expression to refer to his identity as God’s Son and God’s identity as his Father. He describes these things in the next verse and says that only people to whom he reveals these identities can understand them, just as he says here that they are revealed only to certain people. Since the expression is explained in the next verse, you do not need to explain its meaning further here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])
LUK	10	21	l598	figs-nominaladj	σοφῶν καὶ συνετῶν	1	the wise and intelligent	Jesus is using the adjectives **wise** and **intelligent** as nouns in order to indicate people who have those qualities. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this with an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “people who are wise and intelligent” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
LUK	10	21	i2zf	figs-irony	σοφῶν καὶ συνετῶν	1	the wise and intelligent	Because God had concealed the truth from these people, they actually were not wise and intelligent, even though they thought they were. Alternate translation: “people who think they are wise and intelligent” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])
LUK	10	21	l599	figs-doublet	σοφῶν καὶ συνετῶν	1	the wise and intelligent	The terms **wise** and **intelligent** mean similar things. Jesus uses the two terms together for emphasis. Alternate translation: “people who think they understand everything” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

You could explain the meaning of this metaphor in your translation, or you could translate it as a simile, as UST does. Alternate translation: “people who trust my teachings implicitly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	10	21	nm6t	figs-metaphor	ἔμπροσθέν σου	1	before you	Jesus says **before you** to mean “where you could see” or “in your sight.” Sight, in turn, figuratively means attention and judgment. Alternate translation: “in your judgment” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	10	22	e47e	figs-activepassive	πάντα μοι παρεδόθη ὑπὸ τοῦ Πατρός μου	1	All things have been handed over to me from my Father	If your language does not use this passive form, you can state this in active form.

Alternate translation: “only the Father knows who the Son is” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-exceptions]])
LUK	10	22	six4		γινώσκει τίς ἐστιν ὁ Υἱὸς	1	knows who the Son is	Here, the Greek word translated **knows** means to know from personal experience. God the Father knows Jesus in this way. Alternate translation: “is acquainted with the Son” or “is acquainted with me”
LUK	10	22	xm3s	figs-123person	γινώσκει τίς ἐστιν ὁ Υἱὸς	1	knows who the Son is	Jesus is referring to himself in the third person. Alternate translation: “knows who I am” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
LUK	10	22	fp68	guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	ὁ Υἱὸς…ὁ Πατήρ	1	the Son … the Father	These are important titles that describe the relationship between God and Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])

LUK	10	23	yd5s	figs-explicit	καὶ στραφεὶς πρὸς τοὺς μαθητὰς κατ’ ἰδίαν, εἶπεν	1	And having turned around to the disciples, he said privately	The implication is that a crowd was present when the 72 disciples returned to report to Jesus what they had done, and that this crowd heard what Jesus told them and what he prayed to God. But now Jesus is speaking only to the disciples in a way that the crowd will not be able to hear him. Alternate translation: “Then Jesus said, in the direction of his disciples so that only they could hear him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	10	23	l601	figs-synecdoche	μακάριοι οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ οἱ βλέποντες ἃ βλέπετε	1	Blessed are the eyes that see what you see	Jesus is using the term **eyes** to describe these disciples by reference to one part of them, the part they are using to witness the great works that reveal who he is. Alternate translation: “How good it is for you to see what you see” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

LUK	10	24	mb4b	figs-explicit	καὶ οὐκ ἤκουσαν	1	and did not hear	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could give the reason why the prophets and kings did not hear these things. Alternate translation: “but could not hear them because they lived before this time” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	10	25	l602	figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	behold	Luke uses the term **behold** to calls the reader’s attention to what he is about to say. Your language may have a similar expression that you can use here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	10	25	klh4	writing-participants	νομικός τις	1	a certain lawyer	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new character into the story. If your language has its own way of doing that, you can use it here in your translation. Alternate translation: “there was a lawyer who” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
LUK	10	25	l603	translate-unknown	νομικός	1	lawyer	See how you translated this in [7:30](../07/30.md). Alternate translation: “an expert in the Jewish law” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	10	25	l604	translate-symaction	ἀνέστη	1	stood up	By standing up, this lawyer was indicating that he had a question to ask Jesus. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain that this was the reason for his action. Alternate translation: “stood up to show that he wanted to ask a question” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
LUK	10	25	c6ac		ἐκπειράζων αὐτὸν	1	to test him	Alternate translation: “to see how well he would answer”
LUK	10	25	l605		Διδάσκαλε	1	Teacher	**Teacher** was a respectful title. You can translate it with an equivalent term that your language and culture would use.
LUK	10	25	dh16	figs-metaphor	τί ποιήσας, ζωὴν αἰώνιον κληρονομήσω?	1	doing what, will I inherit everlasting life?	The lawyer is using the term **inherit** in a figurative sense to mean “come to possess” or “have.” Alternate translation: “what must I do in order to have everlasting life” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	10	25	l606	figs-verbs	τί ποιήσας, ζωὴν αἰώνιον κληρονομήσω?	1	Doing what, will I inherit eternal life?	This lawyer may be asking about a single deed that would be worthy of eternal life, because he uses a verb form that does not indicate continuing action. Alternate translation: “What one thing do I need to do so that God will give me eternal life?” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-verbs]])
LUK	10	25	ls03	figs-metaphor	τί ποιήσας, ζωὴν αἰώνιον κληρονομήσω	1	doing what, will I inherit everlasting life	The lawyer means implicitly that he would **inherit** or “come to possess” this **everlasting life** from God.

LUK	10	26	nj77	figs-rquestion	ἐν τῷ νόμῳ τί γέγραπται? πῶς ἀναγινώσκεις?	1	What is written in the law? How do you read it?	Jesus is using these questions to get this man to reflect on the Jewish law and apply it to his own question. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this as a statement that incorporates both of Jesus’ questions. Alternate translation: “Tell me what Moses wrote about that in the law and how you understand it.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	10	26	l607	figs-parallelism	ἐν τῷ νόμῳ τί γέγραπται? πῶς ἀναγινώσκεις?	1	What is written in the law? How do you read it?	These two phrases mean similar things. Jesus may be using repetition for emphasis and clarity. Both phrases have to do with what the law says. The first phrase views this objectively in terms of what is written there, and the second phrase views this subjectively from the perspective of a person reading it. You do not need to put both phrases in your translation if your readers might wonder why Jesus was saying basically the same thing twice. Alternate translation: “Tell me what answer a person would find to your question in the law of Moses.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
LUK	10	26	m2nl	figs-activepassive	ἐν τῷ νόμῳ τί γέγραπται?	1	What is written in the law?

LUK	10	26	a8nt	figs-idiom	πῶς ἀναγινώσκεις?	1	How do you read it?	This is an idiom. Alternate translation: “What do you understand it to be saying?” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	10	27	l608	figs-hendiadys	ὁ δὲ ἀποκριθεὶς εἶπεν	1	And answering he said	Together **answering** and **said** mean that the lawyer responded to the question that Jesus asked him. Alternate translation: “The lawyer responded” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
LUK	10	27	l609	figs-youcrowd	ἀγαπήσεις	1	you will love	Here it may not be clear whether to use the singular or plural form of **you** because this is a short quotation from the Scriptures and the context is not given. The word is actually singular because, even though Moses said this to the Israelites as a group, each individual person was supposed to obey this command. So in your translation, use the singular forms of **you** **your**, and **yourself** in this verse, if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd]])
LUK	10	27	hxk1	figs-declarative	ἀγαπήσεις	1	you will love	The Scriptures are using a statement to give a command. Alternate translation: “You must love” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative]])

LUK	10	27	l610	figs-metaphor	ἐξ ὅλης καρδίας σου, καὶ ἐν ὅλῃ τῇ ψυχῇ σου	1	with all your heart, and with all your soul	The words **heart** and **soul** figuratively represent a person’s inner being. If you do not translate all four of the terms here with a single phrase, you can represent these two together. Alternate translation: “with all of your inner self” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	10	27	k1el	figs-ellipsis	καὶ, τὸν πλησίον σου ὡς σεαυτόν	1	and your neighbor as yourself	The lawyer is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. These words can be supplied from earlier in the sentence. Alternate translation (filling in ellipsis): “and you must also love your neighbor as much as you love yourself” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
LUK	10	28	l611	grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical	τοῦτο ποίει, καὶ ζήσῃ	1	Do this, and you will live	Jesus is describing a conditional situation.

LUK	10	29	lr4m	figs-explicit	τίς ἐστίν μου πλησίον?	1	who is my neighbor?	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate the reason why the lawyer asked this specific question. Alternate translation: “whom should I consider to be my neighbor, that is, someone I need to love as I love myself?” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	10	30	l612	figs-hendiadys	ὑπολαβὼν δὲ Ἰησοῦς εἶπεν	1	Then answering Jesus said	Together **answering** and **said** mean that Jesus responded to the question that the lawyer asked him. Alternate translation: “Then Jesus responded” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
LUK	10	30	bh6g	figs-parables	ὑπολαβὼν δὲ Ἰησοῦς εἶπεν	1	Then answering Jesus said	Jesus answers the man’s question by telling a brief story that provides an illustration.

LUK	10	30	v2ms	figs-idiom	λῃσταῖς περιέπεσεν	1	fell among robbers	Be sure that it is clear in your translation that this does not mean that the man fell down accidentally. Rather, this is an idiom. Alternate translation: “some robbers attacked him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

LUK	10	30	l615	figs-idiom	καὶ πληγὰς ἐπιθέντες	1	and having laid on blows	This expression means that the robbers also beat this man. Alternate translation: “and beaten him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	10	30	r3gd	figs-idiom	ἡμιθανῆ	1	half dead	This is an idiom. Alternate translation: “almost dead.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

LUK	10	31	gh79	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	καὶ ἰδὼν αὐτὸν	1	and when he saw him	Since a priest is a religious leader, the audience would assume that he would help the injured man. Since he did not, this phrase could be introduced with a contrasting word to call attention to this unexpected result. Alternate translation: “but when the priest saw the injured man” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
LUK	10	31	xiu7	figs-explicit	ἀντιπαρῆλθεν	1	he passed by on the other side	The implication is that the priest did not help the man. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “he did not help him, but instead walked past him on the other side of the road” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	10	32	z3ct	writing-participants	καὶ Λευείτης	1	a Levite also	This expression introduces a new character in the parable. Alternate translation: “there was also a Levite” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])

Since he did not, this phrase could be introduced with a contrasting word to call attention to this unexpected result. Alternate translation: “likewise a Levite also came to the place, but when he saw him, he walked past him on the other side of the road” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
LUK	10	32	l619	figs-explicit	ἀντιπαρῆλθεν	1	passed by on the other side	The implication is that the Levite did not help the man.

LUK	10	37	ig9x	figs-explicit	πορεύου καὶ σὺ ποίει ὁμοίως	1	You go and do likewise	The implication is that the lawyer has given the correct answer.

LUK	10	39	l626	translate-textvariants	τοῦ Ἰησοῦ	1	Jesus	See the discussion of textual issues at the end of the General Notes to this chapter to decide whether to use this reading in your translation, or another reading, “the Lord.” The note below discusses a translation issue in that reading, for those who decide to include it. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
LUK	10	39	l627		τοῦ Ἰησοῦ	1	Jesus	If you use the variant reading “the Lord” at this place in your translation, you may wish to indicate that this is referring to Jesus by a respectful title. Alternate translation: “the Lord Jesus”
LUK	10	39	i74b	figs-metonymy	ἤκουεν τὸν λόγον αὐτοῦ	1	listening to his word	Luke uses the term **word** figuratively to describe what Jesus said while he was at Martha’s house. Alternate translation: “and listened to what he said” or “and listened to him teaching” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	10	40	adr5	figs-activepassive	ἡ δὲ Μάρθα περιεσπᾶτο περὶ πολλὴν διακονίαν	1	But Martha was distracted with much service	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “But all Martha could think about was the big meal she was preparing” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	10	40	jd9a	figs-rquestion	οὐ μέλει σοι, ὅτι ἡ ἀδελφή μου μόνην με κατέλιπεν διακονεῖν?	1	are you not concerned that my sister has left me alone to serve?	Martha is complaining that Jesus is allowing Mary to sit listening to him when there is so much work to do. Martha respects the Lord, so she uses a rhetorical question to make her complaint more polite. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate her words as a statement. Alternate translation: “it seems as if you do not care that my sister has left me alone to serve.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	10	41	l628	figs-hendiadys	ἀποκριθεὶς δὲ εἶπεν αὐτῇ ὁ Κύριος	1	But answering the Lord said to her	Together **answering** and **said** mean that Jesus responded to Martha’s request. Alternate translation: “But the Lord replied to her” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
LUK	10	41	l629		ὁ Κύριος	1	the Lord	Here Luke refers to Jesus by the respectful title **the Lord**. Alternate translation: “the Lord Jesus”
LUK	10	41	dsw3		Μάρθα, Μάρθα	1	Martha, Martha	Jesus repeats Martha’s name for emphasis. Alternate translation: “My dear Martha”
LUK	10	41	l630	figs-doublet	μεριμνᾷς καὶ θορυβάζῃ περὶ πολλά	1	you are anxious and troubled about many things	The terms **anxious** and **troubled** mean similar things. Jesus uses the two terms together for emphasis. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate them with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “you are worrying too much about things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
LUK	10	41	l631	figs-activepassive	θορυβάζῃ περὶ πολλά	1	you are … troubled about many things	If you do not combine the term for **troubled** with the word **anxious** into a single phrase, you could state **are … troubled** with an active form. Alternate translation: “you are … letting too many things bother you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	10	42	hqt4	figs-hyperbole	ἑνός δέ ἐστιν χρεία	1	but one thing is necessary	Jesus says **one thing** as an overstatement for emphasis. Other things actually are necessary for life, but this is the most important one. Alternate translation: “but one thing is more important than all the others” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
LUK	10	42	l632	figs-explicit	ἑνός δέ ἐστιν χρεία	1	but one thing is necessary	The implication is that this most important thing is what Jesus is teaching about God, and that Martha should have been concentrating on that. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “but one thing, what I am teaching about God, is more important than all the others, and you should have been concentrating on that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	10	42	l633		Μαριὰμ…τὴν ἀγαθὴν μερίδα ἐξελέξατο	1	Mary has chosen the good part	While Jesus spoke just earlier about “one thing” as opposed to “many things,” here he seems to contrast only two things, **the good part** with another part, perhaps not “the bad part,” but at least the part that is not to be preferred. This likely refers to the two activities that Mary and Martha have chosen to pursue while Jesus is present in their home. Alternate translation: “Mary has chosen the better activity”
LUK	10	42	nzn8	figs-activepassive	ἥτις οὐκ ἀφαιρεθήσεται ἀπ’ αὐτῆς	1	which will not be taken away from her	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who would do the action. This could mean: (1) “I will not take that opportunity away from her.” (2) “God will not let her lose what she has gained from listening to me.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	11	intro	j6le			0		# Luke 11 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>1. Jesus teaches about prayer (11:1-13)<br>2. Jesus teaches about driving out demons and other subjects (11:14-36)<br>3. Jesus criticizes the Pharisees and experts in the law (11:37-54)<br><br>ULT sets the lines in 11:2-4 farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because they are a special prayer.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### The Lord’s Prayer<br><br>When Jesus’ followers asked him to teach them how to pray, he taught them this prayer. He did not expect them to use the same words every time they prayed, but he did want them to know what God wanted them to pray about.<br><br>### Jonah<br><br>Jonah was an Old Testament prophet whom God sent to the Gentile city of Nineveh to tell the people there to repent. When he went and preached to them, they did repent. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/repent]])<br><br>### Light and darkness<br><br>The Bible often speaks of unrighteous people, that is, people who do not do what pleases God, as if they were walking around in darkness. The Bible speaks of light as if it were what enables those sinful people to become righteous, that is, to understand what they are doing wrong and begin to obey God. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]])<br><br>### Washing<br><br>The Pharisees would wash themselves and the things they ate with. They would even wash things that were not dirty. The law of Moses did not tell them to wash those things, but they would wash them anyway. They did that because they thought that if they obeyed both the rules that God had made and some rules that their ancestors had added, God would think that they were better people. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/clean]])<br><br>## Important textual issues in this chapter<br><br>### Bread and stone, fish and snake<br><br>In 11:11, some ancient manuscripts have a longer reading, which also is found in Matthew 7:9. It says, “Which father among you, if your son asks for a loaf of bread, will give him a stone? Or a fish, will give him a snake?” ULT uses the shorter reading, which mentions just the fish and snake. This shorter reading is well attested to in many other ancient manuscripts. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to follow its reading. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to follow the example of ULT. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
LUK	11	1	fl3j	writing-newevent	καὶ ἐγένετο	1	And it happened that	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
LUK	11	1	l635	figs-explicit	Ἰωάννης	1	John	This disciple is referring to John the Baptist. you could state that explicitly in your translation. Alternate translation: “John the Baptist” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	11	2	n3pz	guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	Πάτερ	1	Father	Jesus is commanding the disciples to honor the name of God the Father by addressing him as **Father** when praying to him. This is an important title for God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
LUK	11	2	l636	figs-explicit	ἁγιασθήτω τὸ ὄνομά σου	1	let your name be made holy	Jesus is not saying that God’s **name** is not already **holy** in itself. Rather, he is referring to how people consider God’s **name**. Alternate translation: “may people treat your name as holy” or “may people regard your name as holy” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	11	2	l637	figs-activepassive	ἁγιασθήτω τὸ ὄνομά σου	1	let your name be made holy	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who would do the action. Alternate translation: “may people treat your name as holy” or “may people regard your name as holy” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	11	2	b6sr	figs-metonymy	ἁγιασθήτω τὸ ὄνομά σου	1	let your name be made holy	The term **name** is a figurative way of referring to an entire person by reference to something associated with them. Alternate translation: “may all people honor you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	11	2	tm1a	figs-abstractnouns	ἐλθέτω ἡ βασιλεία σου	1	Let your kingdom come	See how you decided to translate the phrase **the kingdom of God** in [4:43](../04/43.md). If your readers would misunderstand the abstract noun **kingdom**, you could express the idea behind it with a verb such as “rule.” As the General Introduction to Luke explains, in one sense, the **kingdom** of God is already present on earth, while in another sense, it is still a future reality. Try to translate this in a way that acknowledges both aspects. Alternate translation: “Come and rule more and more throughout the earth” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
LUK	11	2	l638	figs-youformal	σου	1	your	Here, **your** is singular because Jesus is teaching his disciples how to pray to God. If your language has a formal form of “you” that it uses to address a superior respectfully, you may wish to use that form for **your** in its two instances here and for **you** in [11:4](../11/04.md). Alternatively, it might be more appropriate in your culture to address God using a familiar form, such as friends would use with one another. Use your best judgment about what form to use. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youformal]])
LUK	11	3	q89w	figs-imperative	δίδου ἡμῖν	1	Give us	This is an imperative, but it should be translated as a polite request rather than as a command. It may be helpful to add an expression such as “please” to make this clear. Alternate translation: “Please give us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
LUK	11	3	l639	figs-exclusive	δίδου ἡμῖν	1	Give us	Jesus teaches his disciples to speak to God in the plural because he wants them to pray together in community about the matters he describes. Since the word **us** would refer to the people praying, but not to God, it would be exclusive, if your language marks that form. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
LUK	11	3	s6qp	figs-synecdoche	τὸν ἄρτον ἡμῶν τὸν ἐπιούσιον	1	our daily bread	Jesus refers figuratively to **bread**, one common food, to mean food in general. Alternate translation: “the food we need that day” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
LUK	11	4	iid7	figs-imperative	ἄφες ἡμῖν…μὴ εἰσενέγκῃς ἡμᾶς	1	forgive us … may you not lead us	These are imperatives, but they should be translated as polite requests rather than as commands. It may be helpful to add an expression such as “please” in each case to make this clear. Alternate translation: “Please forgive us … please do not lead us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
LUK	11	4	wi99	figs-metaphor	παντὶ ὀφείλοντι ἡμῖν	1	everyone who owes us	Jesus uses the image of being in debt figuratively to describe having sinned against a person. Alternate translation: “everyone who has sinned against us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	11	4	db55		μὴ εἰσενέγκῃς ἡμᾶς εἰς πειρασμόν	1	may you not lead us into temptation	You could state this in a positive form. Alternate translation: “please lead us away from temptation”
LUK	11	5	l640	figs-hypo	τίς ἐξ ὑμῶν ἕξει φίλον, καὶ πορεύσεται πρὸς αὐτὸν μεσονυκτίου	1	Which of you will have a friend, and will go to him at midnight	Jesus is using a hypothetical situation to teach his disciples. Alternate translation: “Suppose one of you went to the house of a friend in the middle of the night” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
LUK	11	5	l641	figs-quotesinquotes	καὶ εἴπῃ αὐτῷ, φίλε, χρῆσόν μοι τρεῖς ἄρτους	1	and say to him, Friend, lend three loaves to me	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “and asked his friend to let him borrow three loaves of bread” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	11	5	y1s9		χρῆσόν μοι τρεῖς ἄρτους	1	lend three loaves to me	Alternate translation: “let me borrow three loaves of bread” or “give me three loaves of bread, and I will pay you back later”
LUK	11	6	l642	figs-quotesinquotes	ἐπειδὴ φίλος μου παρεγένετο ἐξ ὁδοῦ πρός με, καὶ οὐκ ἔχω ὃ παραθήσω αὐτῷ	1	since my friend has come to me from the road, and I do not have anything to serve to him	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation (continuing the sentence from the previous verse): “explaining that another friend has just arrived on a journey and that he does not have enough food to feed him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	11	6	l643	grammar-connect-logic-result	ἐπειδὴ	1	since	The speaker uses this word to introduce the reason why he is making this request at this time. If you translate this as a direct quotation, it may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “Let me tell you why I am asking” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
LUK	11	6	zl5w	figs-metonymy	παρεγένετο ἐξ ὁδοῦ πρός με	1	my friend has come to me from the road	The speaker uses the term **road** figuratively to describe being on a journey. Alternate translation: “another friend of mine is on a journey and has just arrived at my house” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	11	6	zp7j	figs-hyperbole	ὃ παραθήσω αὐτῷ	1	anything to serve to him	It is unlikely that the speaker has no food at all in his house that he could serve his friend. Rather, this is an exaggeration for emphasis. Alternate translation: “enough food to feed him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
LUK	11	6	l731	figs-explicit	ὃ παραθήσω αὐτῷ	1	anything to serve to him	This could mean: (1) as UST implies, while his family has the ingredients to make a meal, they do not want to make a weary traveler wait the time it would take for them to bake bread and prepare other food. Alternate translation: “any food prepared to feed him” (2) the speaker wants to extend hospitality by sharing a meal with his guest, and so he needs enough food for a family meal. Alternate translation: “enough food to share a meal with him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	11	7	l644	figs-hendiadys	ἀποκριθεὶς εἴπῃ	1	answering … he may say	The word **answering** indicates that what this friend **may say** would be a response. Alternate translation: “he may reply” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
LUK	11	7	l645	figs-quotesinquotes	εἴπῃ, μή μοι κόπους πάρεχε; ἤδη ἡ θύρα κέκλεισται, καὶ τὰ παιδία μου μετ’ ἐμοῦ εἰς τὴν κοίτην εἰσίν; οὐ δύναμαι ἀναστὰς δοῦναί σοι	1	he may say, ‘Do not cause me trouble. The door has already been shut, and my children are in the bed with me. I am not able to get up to give to you’	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “he may tell you not to bother him, because he has already locked the door for the night and his children are in bed with him, so he cannot get up and give you anything” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	11	7	l646	figs-activepassive	ἤδη ἡ θύρα κέκλεισται	1	The door has already been shut	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who has done the action. Alternate translation: “We have already closed and locked the door” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	11	7	vhf7	figs-hyperbole	οὐ δύναμαι ἀναστὰς	1	I am not able to get up	The friend inside is not literally incapable of getting up. Rather, this is an exaggeration for emphasis. Alternate translation: “It would be very difficult for me to get up” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
LUK	11	8	zl2k	figs-you	λέγω ὑμῖν	1	I say to you	Even though Jesus began this hypothetical situation by asking “which of you,” that is, “which one of you,” here he is addressing all of the disciples together, not the hypothetical single disciple who might go to a friend’s house at midnight. So here, the word **you** is plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
LUK	11	8	prx6	figs-abstractnouns	διά γε τὴν ἀναίδειαν αὐτοῦ	1	yet because of his persistence	If your readers would misunderstand the abstract noun **persistence**, you could express the idea behind it with a verb such as “continue.” Alternate translation: “because you continue to ask him urgently” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
LUK	11	8	l647		ἐγερθεὶς	1	he will rise up	Alternate translation: “getting out of bed”
LUK	11	9	j4ef	figs-you	ὑμῖν λέγω…ὑμῖν…εὑρήσετε…ὑμῖν	1	I say to you … to you … you will find … to you	In the first instance in this verse, **you** is plural because Jesus is speaking to the disciples. In the next three instances, even though Jesus is describing what could be an individual situation of a person praying to God, **you** is also plural because Jesus is still speaking to the disciples as a group. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
LUK	11	9	l648	figs-explicit	αἰτεῖτε…ζητεῖτε	1	ask … seek	It might be customary in your language to say what a person would be asking for and seeking, and from whom. Alternate translation: “keep asking God for what you need … keep seeking what you need from God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	11	9	i7j9	figs-activepassive	δοθήσεται ὑμῖν	1	it will be given to you	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who will do the action. Alternate translation: “God will give it to you” or “you will receive it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	11	9	l1f6	translate-unknown	κρούετε	1	knock	To **knock** at a door means to hit it a few times to let a person inside the house know you are standing outside. You could translate this expression with the way people in your culture show that they have arrived at a house, such as “call out” or “cough” or “clap.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	11	9	l649	figs-metaphor	κρούετε	1	knock	Jesus is using the expression **knock** figuratively to mean getting someone’s attention. Alternate translation: “seek God’s attention in prayer” or “let God know you are depending on him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	11	9	kp3h	figs-activepassive	ἀνοιγήσεται ὑμῖν	1	it will be opened to you	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who will do the action.

LUK	11	9	l650	figs-metaphor	ἀνοιγήσεται ὑμῖν	1	it will be opened to you	This phrase continues the metaphor of prayer as knocking on a door. Alternate translation: “God will give you what you need” or “God will enable you to do what you are praying about” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	11	10	l651	translate-unknown	τῷ κρούοντι	1	to the one who knocks	See how you translated the word “knock” in [11:9](../11/09.md). Alternate translation: “to the one who calls out” or “to the one who coughs” or “to the one who claps” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

Jesus is using the question form to teach his disciples. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate his words as a statement or exclamation.

LUK	11	11	l656	figs-hypo	τίνα δὲ ἐξ ὑμῶν τὸν πατέρα αἰτήσει ὁ υἱὸς ἰχθύν, καὶ ἀντὶ ἰχθύος, ὄφιν αὐτῷ ἐπιδώσει?	1	And which father among you, his son will ask for a fish, and instead of a fish he will give him a snake?	Jesus is also using a hypothetical situation to teach, and you could translate his words that way. Alternate translation: “Suppose one of you had a son who asked for a fish to eat. None of you fathers would give him a snake instead.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
LUK	11	11	ls04	figs-explicit	ὄφιν	1	a snake	In this culture, people did not eat snakes. So Jesus is saying that a father would not give a son something the son could not eat if the son asked for something that he could eat. If people do eat snakes in your culture, you could use the name of something that they do not eat, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “something he cannot eat” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	11	12	l657	figs-ellipsis	ἢ καὶ αἰτήσει ᾠόν, ἐπιδώσει αὐτῷ σκορπίον	1	Or also he will ask for an egg, he will give him a scorpion	Jesus is speaking in an abbreviated way.

LUK	11	12	l658	figs-hypo	ἢ καὶ αἰτήσει ᾠόν, ἐπιδώσει αὐτῷ σκορπίον?	1	Or also he will ask for an egg, he will give him a scorpion?	Jesus is also using a hypothetical situation to teach.

LUK	11	12	e8hr	translate-unknown	σκορπίον	1	scorpion	A **scorpion** is a small animal related to the spider. It has two claws and a poisonous stinger in its tail. If your readers would not be familiar with scorpions, you could use a more general term. Alternate translation: “a poisonous stinging animal” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	11	12	ls05	figs-explicit	σκορπίον	1	a scorpion	In this culture, people did not eat scorpions. So Jesus is saying that a father would not give a son something the son could not eat if the son asked for something that he could eat. If people do eat scorpions in your culture, you could use the name of something that they do not eat, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “something he cannot eat” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	11	13	g99r	grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἰ…ὑμεῖς πονηροὶ ὑπάρχοντες, οἴδατε	1	if you who are evil know	Jesus is speaking as if this were a hypothetical possibility, but he means that it is actually true. If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, and if your readers might misunderstand and think that what Jesus is saying is not certain, then you can translate his words as an affirmative statement.

LUK	11	34	l700	figs-youcrowd	σου	1	your	Even though Jesus is speaking to the crowd, he is addressing an individual situation, so **your** and **you** are singular in [11:34-36](../11/34.md).

LUK	11	34	l701		ἐπὰν δὲ πονηρὸς ᾖ	1	But when it is bad	In this context, Jesus is using the term **evil** to contrast with **healthy**, so it means “unhealthy.” Alternate translation: “But when your eye is unhealthy”

LUK	11	36	g336	figs-simile	ἔσται φωτεινὸν ὅλον, ὡς ὅταν ὁ λύχνος τῇ ἀστραπῇ φωτίζῃ σε	1	it will all be illuminated, as when the lamp with its brightness illuminates you	Jesus now uses a simile to connect the illustration of the lamp with the extended metaphor of the eye.

In the same way, if you are willing to obey God, you will be able to understand his message and live by it completely, just as a lamp shines a bright light that allows you to see yourself and everything around you clearly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

LUK	11	37	l702		ἐρωτᾷ αὐτὸν Φαρισαῖος	1	a Pharisee asks him	To call attention to a development in the story, Luke uses the present tense in past narration. See how you decided to approach this usage in [7:40](../07/40.md). If it would not be natural to use the present tense in your language, you can use the past tense in your translation. Alternate translation: “a Pharisee asked him”
LUK	11	37	l703	writing-participants	Φαρισαῖος	1	a Pharisee	This introduces a new character into the story. Alternate translation: “a Pharisee who was there” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])

Alternate translation: “but your true character is that you are greedy and wicked people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
LUK	11	40	zq4l	figs-nominaladj	ἄφρονες	1	You foolish ones	Jesus is using an adjective as a noun. ULT adds the term **ones** to show this. Your language may use adjectives in the same way.

Alternate translation: “The one who made the outside also made the inside!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	11	41	m3ww	figs-explicit	τὰ ἐνόντα δότε ἐλεημοσύνην	1	give as charity what is inside	Jesus assumes that the Pharisees will know that he is now referring literally to the cups and bowls because he wants to speak about what they contain. So in this saying, they no longer represent the Pharisees figuratively. Alternate translation: “give to the poor what is in your cups and bowls” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	11	41	l705	figs-metonymy	τὰ ἐνόντα δότε ἐλεημοσύνην	1	give as charity what is inside	Jesus is referring to food by association with the cups and bowls that the food is **inside**. Alternate translation: “share your food with the poor” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

LUK	11	41	phz9	figs-explicit	πάντα καθαρὰ ὑμῖν ἐστιν	1	all things are clean to you	The implication is that if the Pharisees devote themselves to what is most important, helping people in need, then they will recognize that ceremonial cleansing is less important and less worthy of their attention. Alternate translation: “you will not have to be so concerned about ritually washing cups and bowls” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	11	42	ans4	figs-explicit	ἀποδεκατοῦτε τὸ ἡδύοσμον, καὶ τὸ πήγανον, καὶ πᾶν λάχανον	1	you tithe the mint and the rue and every garden herb	The implication is that the Pharisees are counting the leaves on their garden herbs and giving a tenth of those to God, and that by doing that, they are going to almost absurd extremes in pursuing that devotional practice. Alternate translation: “you are so extreme that you give every tenth leaf from your mint and rue and other garden plants to God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	11	42	p71g	translate-unknown	τὸ ἡδύοσμον, καὶ τὸ πήγανον	1	the mint and the rue	These are the names of herbs. People put just a little bit of their leaves into their food to give it flavor.

LUK	11	42	l707		ταῦτα…κἀκεῖνα	1	these things, and … those things	By **these things**, Jesus means the justice and the love of God. By **those things**, he means devotional practices such as tithing. Your language may have its own way of expressing distinctions like this. Alternate translation: “the latter, and … the former”
LUK	11	42	myv2	figs-doublenegatives	κἀκεῖνα μὴ παρεῖναι	1	and not to neglect those things	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this double negative, which consists of a negative particle and a negative verb, as a positive statement. Alternate translation: “while making sure to express your devotion to God as well” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])

Alternate translation: “you are like burial places that people should not go near, but people do not realize that because the places are unmarked” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
LUK	11	44	l708	figs-explicit	ἐστὲ ὡς τὰ μνημεῖα τὰ ἄδηλα	1	you are like the unseen graves	The implication is that these **graves** are **unseen**, that is, people do not know that they are there, because they do not have markers such as the stones or plaques that are customarily used to identify graves and to memorialize the people who are buried in them. Alternate translation: “you are like unmarked graves” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	11	44	mrw1	translate-unknown	μνημεῖα	1	graves	The term **graves** refers to holes dug in the ground where dead bodies are buried.

LUK	11	44	h9x7	figs-explicit	οὐκ οἴδασιν	1	do not know it	The implication is that if the Jews walked over a grave, they would become ceremonially unclean because they had come close to a dead body. Unmarked graves would cause them to do that accidentally. Alternate translation: “do not realize that and so become ceremonially unclean” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	11	44	l710	figs-metaphor	οὐκ οἴδασιν	1	do not know it	Jesus is using the implied ceremonial uncleanness figuratively to represent not doing what pleases God. He has just said in [11:42](../11/42.md) that this is really a matter of showing love and justice to others. Alternate translation: “without realizing it and so, because they follow your teaching, they do not do the things that God wants them to do most” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	11	45	l711		ἀποκριθεὶς δέ τις τῶν νομικῶν λέγει αὐτῷ	1	Then answering one of the lawyers says to him	To call attention to a development in the story, Luke uses the present tense in past narration. See how you decided to approach this usage in [7:40](../07/40.md). If it would not be natural to use the present tense in your language, you can use the past tense in your translation. Alternate translation: “Then one of the experts in the Jewish law who was there said to him”
LUK	11	45	l712	figs-hendiadys	ἀποκριθεὶς…λέγει	1	answering … says	Together the two verbs **answering** and **says** mean that this lawyer was responding to what Jesus had said about the Pharisees. Alternate translation: “responded” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])

Alternate translation: “you are not doing anything at all to help people truly obey the law” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
LUK	11	47	l717	figs-gendernotations	πατέρες	1	fathers	Jesus is using the term **fathers** in a generic sense that includes both men and women. Alternate translation: “ancestors” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])

Rather, their ancestors began the job by actually killing them, and now they are finishing the job by burying them. Alternate translation: “you show that you approve of and agree with what your ancestors did when you bury the prophets to finish the job of killing them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	11	48	l718	figs-gendernotations	τῶν πατέρων ὑμῶν	1	your fathers	Jesus is using the term **fathers** in a generic sense that includes both men and women. Alternate translation: “your ancestors” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])

LUK	11	49	by5w		διὰ τοῦτο	1	For this reason	The expression **Because of this** refers to the way that the current generation was effectively continuing the actions of its ancestors, who had killed the prophets. Alternate translation: “Because you are just as hostile to the prophets as your ancestors were”
LUK	11	49	c97g	figs-personification	ἡ σοφία τοῦ Θεοῦ εἶπεν	1	the wisdom of God said	Jesus speaks figuratively of God’s **wisdom** as if it were able to speak by itself. Alternate translation: “God in his wisdom said” or “God wisely said” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
LUK	11	49	lda4	figs-explicit	ἀποστελῶ εἰς αὐτοὺς προφήτας καὶ ἀποστόλους, καὶ ἐξ αὐτῶν ἀποκτενοῦσιν καὶ διώξουσιν	1	I will send to them prophets and apostles, and some of them they will kill and persecute	Jesus is saying that God was not so foolish or naïve as to think that the Israelites would welcome the message of the prophets and apostles. God in his wisdom knew that they would oppose his messengers. But he sent them anyway, because their message was necessary and important. Alternate translation: “I am going to send prophets and apostles to them with my message, even though I know they will persecute and kill some of them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	11	49	w1fh	figs-hendiadys	ἀποκτενοῦσιν καὶ διώξουσιν	1	kill and persecute	Here, Jesus may be expressing a single idea by using two words connected with **and.** The word **persecute** may be telling why and how the people would **kill** the prophets. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express the meaning with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “persecute even to the point of killing” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
LUK	11	50	pi6u	figs-explicit	ἵνα ἐκζητηθῇ τὸ αἷμα πάντων τῶν προφητῶν, τὸ ἐκχυννόμενον ἀπὸ καταβολῆς κόσμου, ἀπὸ τῆς γενεᾶς ταύτης	1	that the blood of all the prophets that has been shed from the foundation of the world may be required from this generation	The implication seems to be that God will also send prophets to the people living at this time because the people’s violent persecution of the prophets will constitute a conscious, deliberate rejection of God’s message that will provide grounds for definitive judgment. That is because the people of this time should know better than to persecute the prophets, based on the prominent bad example of their own ancestors. Alternate translation: “so that the people living at this time, who should have known better, can be held accountable for the blood that people have shed of all the prophets since the beginning of the world” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	11	50	l720	figs-activepassive	ἵνα ἐκζητηθῇ…ἀπὸ τῆς γενεᾶς ταύτης	1	that … may be required from this generation	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who will do the action. Alternate translation: “so that God can hold the people living at this time accountable for” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	11	50	l721	figs-activepassive	τὸ αἷμα…τὸ ἐκχυννόμενον	1	the blood … that has been shed	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who has done the action.

LUK	11	50	d1rf	figs-metonymy	τὸ αἷμα…τὸ ἐκχυννόμενον	1	the blood … that has been shed	Jesus uses the term **the blood … that has been shed** to refer to the deaths of **the prophets** figuratively by association with their **blood.** Alternate translation: “the deaths” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	11	50	l722		ἀπὸ καταβολῆς κόσμου	1	from the foundation of the world	Alternate translation: “since the beginning of the world” or “since God made the world”
LUK	11	50	l723	figs-metonymy	τῆς γενεᾶς ταύτης	1	this generation	Jesus uses the term **generation** figuratively to mean the people who were born in the current generation. Alternate translation: “the people living at this time” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	11	51	l724	figs-metonymy	αἵματος Ἂβελ…αἵματος Ζαχαρίου	1	the blood of Abel … the blood of Zechariah	Jesus uses the terms **the blood of Abel … the blood of Zechariah** to refer to the deaths of these men figuratively by association with the shedding of their blood. Alternate translation: “the death of Abel … the death of Zechariah” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	11	51	l725	translate-names	Ἂβελ	1	Abel	**Abel** is the name of a man. He was the son of Adam, the first man, and God commended him for doing what was right. His brother Cain murdered him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	11	51	jes7	translate-names	Ζαχαρίου	1	Zechariah	**Zechariah** is the name of a man. It is not the same man as father of John the Baptist, whose story Luke tells at the beginning of this book. Rather, Jesus means the priest whom King Joash ordered the officials of Judah to stone to death in the temple courtyard after he rebuked the people of Judah for worshipping idols. See [2 Chronicles 24:21](../2ch/24/21.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	11	51	l726	figs-metaphor	τοῦ οἴκου	1	the house	Jesus figuratively calls the temple the **house**, meaning the “house of God,” since God’s presence was in the temple. Alternate translation: “the temple” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	11	51	l727	figs-activepassive	ἐκζητηθήσεται ἀπὸ τῆς γενεᾶς ταύτης	1	it will be required from this generation	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who will do the action.

LUK	11	52	vj5a	translate-unknown	τοῖς νομικοῖς	1	lawyers	See how you translated this in [11:45](../11/45.md). Alternate translation: “experts in the Jewish law” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	11	52	s4fc	figs-metaphor	ἤρατε τὴν κλεῖδα τῆς γνώσεως	1	you have taken away the key of knowledge	Jesus speaks figuratively about the **knowledge** of God’s truth as if it were in a building whose door was locked, and about proper teaching as if it were a **key** that could unlock that door. Alternate translation: “you prevent people from knowing God’s truth” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	11	52	xg48	translate-unknown	τὴν κλεῖδα	1	the key	A **key** is a small metal device that opens a lock that is used to keep things like a door, a box, or a drawer closed. If your readers would not know what a **key** is, you could use the name of a comparable device in your culture. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	11	52	fj7x	figs-metaphor	αὐτοὶ οὐκ εἰσήλθατε, καὶ τοὺς εἰσερχομένους ἐκωλύσατε	1	you have not entered yourselves, and you have hindered those who are entering	Jesus continues the metaphor by saying figuratively that these experts in the law have not gone into the building where they could learn God’s truth, and they have not given others the **key** that would allow them to unlock the door and go inside to learn. Alternate translation: “you do not know God’s truth yourselves, and you are preventing others from knowing it as well” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	11	53	mld3	writing-endofstory	κἀκεῖθεν ἐξελθόντος αὐτοῦ	1	After he went out from there	In this verse and the next verse, Luke comments on what happened as a result of the episode he has just related. Alternate translation: “After Jesus left the Pharisee’s house” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-endofstory]])
LUK	11	54	mr32	figs-metaphor	ἐνεδρεύοντες αὐτὸν θηρεῦσαί τι ἐκ τοῦ στόματος αὐτοῦ	1	lying in wait for him to trap something from his mouth	Luke speaks figuratively of the scribes and Pharisees trying to find grounds to accuse Jesus as if they were hunters hiding behind cover in order to catch an animal. Luke then speaks figuratively of what Jesus was saying as if it were the animal that these hunters were trying to catch. Alternate translation: “listening carefully to Jesus to see if they could use something he said to accuse him of teaching the wrong things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	11	54	l729	figs-metonymy	τι ἐκ τοῦ στόματος αὐτοῦ	1	something from his mouth	Luke figuratively describes what Jesus was saying by association with his **mouth**, by which he spoke these things. Alternate translation: “something he said” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	12	intro	jun3			0		# Luke 12 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>1. Jesus teaches about trusting and honoring God (12:1-12)<br>2. Jesus tells a parable about a man who trusted in money (12:13-21)<br>3. Jesus teaches not to trust in money (12:22-34)<br>4. Jesus teaches about being ready for his return (12:35-59)<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### “Blasphemy against the Holy Spirit”<br><br>Jesus says in 12:10 that anyone who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven. This is a descriptive statement, not a prescriptive one. Jesus is not saying that if people happen to speak certain words, then God will refuse to forgive them, no matter how sorry they are afterwards. Rather, it is the Holy Spirit who brings conviction of sin and of the need to repent. “Blasphemy against the Holy Spirit” means attributing the influence of the Holy Spirit to evil powers, as the Pharisees did when they said in 11:15 that Jesus drove out demons by the power of Beelzebul, the ruler of demons. By definition, then, if a person thinks that the influence of the Holy Spirit is an evil influence, they will not respond to it, and so they will not experience conviction of sin, repent, and be forgiven. That is why people who “blaspheme against the Holy Spirit” will not be forgiven. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/blasphemy]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/holyspirit]])<br><br>### Servants<br><br>God expects his people to remember that everything in the world belongs to God. God gives his people things so they can serve him. He wants them to please him by doing what he wants them to do with everything he has given them. One day Jesus will ask his servants what they have done with everything he gave them to use. He will give a reward to those who have done what he wanted them to do, and he will punish those who have not. Jesus teaches about this in 12:34-40.<br><br>### Division<br><br>Jesus knew that those who did not choose to follow him would hate those who did choose to follow him. He also knew that most people love their families more than they love anyone else. So he wanted his followers to understand that following and pleasing him had to be more important to them than having their family love them. Jesus teaches about this in 12:49-53.
LUK	12	1	en8g	writing-newevent	ἐν οἷς	1	In those times	Luke uses these words to mark the beginning of a new event. This phrase seems to refer back to [11:54](../11/54.md). Alternate translation: “While the scribes and Pharisees were still looking for a way to trap him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
LUK	12	1	c8yk	grammar-connect-time-background	ἐπισυναχθεισῶν τῶν μυριάδων τοῦ ὄχλου, ὥστε καταπατεῖν ἀλλήλους	1	when myriads of the crowd were gathered together	Luke provides this background information to give the setting for the events he is about to describe. Alternate translation: “while tens of thousands of the common people were gathering” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background]])
LUK	12	1	l730	translate-unknown	μυριάδων	1	myriads	The word **myriads** is the plural of the Greek word “myriad,” which means ten thousand (10,000). You can express this number in the way that would be most natural in your language. Alternate translation: “tens of thousands” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	12	1	l734		τοῦ ὄχλου	1	of the crowd	In this context, the word **crowd** refers to ordinary people. Alternate translation: “of the common people”

LUK	12	1	ybz9	figs-hyperbole	ὥστε καταπατεῖν ἀλλήλους	1	so that they trampled on each other	This could be an exaggeration to emphasize how tightly packed together the crowd as. Alternate translation: “so that they were all tightly packed together” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
LUK	12	1	x38n		ἤρξατο λέγειν πρὸς τοὺς μαθητὰς αὐτοῦ πρῶτον	1	he began to say to his disciples first	This could mean: (1) Jesus addressed his disciples before speaking to the crowd. Alternate translation: “Jesus first started speaking to his disciples, and said to them” (2) this was the first thing Jesus said to his disciples when he began to speak to them. Alternate translation: “Jesus started speaking to his disciples, and the first thing he said was”
LUK	12	1	f5b9	figs-metaphor	προσέχετε ἑαυτοῖς ἀπὸ τῆς ζύμης, τῶν Φαρισαίων, ἥτις ἐστὶν ὑπόκρισις	1	Guard yourselves from the yeast of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy	Jesus is describing the influence of **the Pharisees** figuratively by comparing its spread throughout the community to the way **yeast** spreads through a whole batch of dough or batter. You could represent this metaphor as a simile in your translation. Alternate translation: “Be careful that you do not become hypocrites like the Pharisees, whose behavior is influencing everyone around them, just as yeast spreads through a whole batch of dough” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	12	1	l736	translate-unknown	ζύμης	1	yeast	**Yeast** is a substance that causes fermentation and expansion within a batch of dough or batter. If your readers would not be familiar with yeast, you could use the name of a substance that they would be familiar with, or you could use a general term. Alternate translation: “leaven” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	12	2	m1ti	grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1	But	**But** connects the statement it introduces to the previous statement about the hypocrisy of the Pharisees. In your translation, you can use the term that would show this connection in the way that is most natural in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
LUK	12	2	e5w4	figs-parallelism	οὐδὲν…συνκεκαλυμμένον ἐστὶν, ὃ οὐκ ἀποκαλυφθήσεται, καὶ κρυπτὸν ὃ οὐ γνωσθήσεται	1	nothing is concealed that will not be revealed and hidden that will not be known	These two phrases mean similar things. Jesus uses them together to emphasize the truth of what he is saying. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could combine them, especially if including both phrases might be confusing for your readers. Alternate translation: “people will learn about everything that others try to hide” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
LUK	12	2	l737	figs-doublenegatives	οὐδὲν…συνκεκαλυμμένον ἐστὶν, ὃ οὐκ ἀποκαλυφθήσεται	1	nothing is concealed that will not be revealed	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this double negative as a positive statement. Alternate translation: “everything that is now concealed will be revealed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
LUK	12	2	g46e	figs-activepassive	οὐδὲν…συνκεκαλυμμένον ἐστὶν, ὃ οὐκ ἀποκαλυφθήσεται	1	nothing is concealed that will not be revealed	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could use active verbal forms in place of the two passive forms here, and you could state who will do the action. Alternate translation: “God will reveal everything that people are now concealing” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	12	2	l738	figs-ellipsis	καὶ κρυπτὸν ὃ οὐ γνωσθήσεται	1	and hidden that will not be known	Jesus is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. These words can be supplied from earlier in the sentence. Alternate translation: “and nothing is hidden that will not be known” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
LUK	12	2	l739	figs-doublenegatives	καὶ κρυπτὸν ὃ οὐ γνωσθήσεται	1	and hidden that will not be known	Supplying **nothing** from earlier in the sentence shows that this is a double negative. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate it as a positive statement. Alternate translation: “and everything that is now hidden will be known” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
LUK	12	2	l740	figs-activepassive	καὶ κρυπτὸν ὃ οὐ γνωσθήσεται	1	and hidden that will not be known	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could use active verbal forms in place of the two passive forms here, and you could state who will do the action. Alternate translation: “and God will let everyone know about everything that people are now hiding” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	12	3	iv8i	figs-metaphor	ὅσα ἐν τῇ σκοτίᾳ εἴπατε	1	whatever you have said in the darkness	Jesus uses the image of **darkness** to represent the idea of concealment. Alternate translation: “whatever you have said secretly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

LUK	12	3	jwe6	figs-metaphor	ἐν τοῖς ταμείοις	1	in the inner rooms	Jesus uses the image of this location to represent the idea of privacy. Alternate translation: “privately” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

LUK	12	3	rmx8	translate-unknown	ἐπὶ τῶν δωμάτων	1	upon the housetops	Houses in Israel had flat roofs that were reached by stairs or ladders, so people could easily go up and stand on top of them. If houses are different in your culture and you think your readers might wonder how people would get up onto **housetops** and stand there, you could translate this with a general expression. Alternate translation: “from a high place from which everyone will be able to hear” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	12	4	m6t7		λέγω δὲ ὑμῖν, τοῖς φίλοις μου	1	But I say to you, my friends	Jesus readdresses his disciples to mark a shift in his speech to a new topic, about not being afraid. Alternate translation: “Let me tell you, friends”

LUK	12	5	fsr4	figs-explicit	φοβήθητε τὸν…ἔχοντα ἐξουσίαν	1	Fear the one who … has authority	The expression **the one** refers to God. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “Fear God, who … has authority” or “Fear God, because he … has authority” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	12	5	us3x		μετὰ τὸ ἀποκτεῖναι	1	after having killed	Jesus is not suggesting that God actively kills each person. Alternate translation: “after a person dies”
LUK	12	5	l744	translate-names	Γέενναν	1	Gehenna	**Gehenna** is the Greek name for a place, the Valley of Hinnom just outside Jerusalem. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	12	5	ric8	figs-metaphor	Γέενναν	1	Gehenna	Jesus figuratively uses the name of this place, where refuse was thrown and fires burned continually, to mean hell. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	12	6	l745	figs-activepassive	οὐχὶ πέντε στρουθία πωλοῦνται ἀσσαρίων δύο	1	Are not five sparrows sold for two assaria	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who does the action. Alternate translation: “Do people not sell five sparrows for only two small copper coins” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	12	6	czr7	figs-rquestion	οὐχὶ πέντε στρουθία πωλοῦνται ἀσσαρίων δύο?	1	Are not five sparrows sold for two assaria?	Jesus is using this question to teach the disciples. He is not asking them to verify the market price for sparrows. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate his words as a statement. Alternate translation: “You know that five sparrows are sold for only two small copper coins.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	12	6	u697	translate-unknown	στρουθία	1	sparrows	**Sparrows** are small, seed-eating birds. If your readers would not know what **sparrows** are, you could use a general expression instead. Alternate translation: “small birds” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	12	6	l746	translate-bmoney	ἀσσαρίων δύο	1	two assaria	The word **assaria** is the plural of “assarion.” An assarion was a small copper coin equivalent to about half an hour’s wage. You could try to express this amount in terms of current monetary values, but that might cause your Bible translation to become outdated and inaccurate, since those values can change over time. So instead you might state something more general or give the equivalent in wages. Alternate translation: “two small copper coins” or “half an hour’s wages” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney]])
LUK	12	6	mru1	figs-activepassive	ἓν ἐξ αὐτῶν οὐκ ἔστιν ἐπιλελησμένον ἐνώπιον τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	not one of them is forgotten before God	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form.

LUK	12	6	l747	figs-doublenegatives	ἓν ἐξ αὐτῶν οὐκ ἔστιν ἐπιλελησμένον ἐνώπιον τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	not one of them is forgotten before God	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this double negative, which consists of a negative particle and a negative verb, as a positive statement. Alternate translation: “God is always aware of every one of them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
LUK	12	6	l748	figs-metaphor	ἓν ἐξ αὐτῶν οὐκ ἔστιν ἐπιλελησμένον ἐνώπιον τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	not one of them is forgotten before God	The expression **before God** means “in front of God,” that is, “where God can see.” Sight, in turn, figuratively represents attention. Alternate translation: “God is always aware of every one of them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	12	7	m833	figs-activepassive	καὶ αἱ τρίχες τῆς κεφαλῆς ὑμῶν πᾶσαι ἠρίθμηνται	1	even the hairs of your head have all been numbered	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who has done the action.

Alternate translation: “God is aware of everything about you, right down to the smallest detail” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
LUK	12	7	l750	figs-you	τῆς κεφαλῆς ὑμῶν	1	your head	Although **head** is singular because Jesus is describing an individual situation, **your** is plural because he is speaking to his disciples as a group. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
LUK	12	7	l751		ἠρίθμηνται	1	numbered	This word can also mean “counted.” Jesus is not necessarily saying that God has assigned a number to each individual hair on a person’s head. Alternate translation: “counted”
LUK	12	7	shk3	figs-explicit	μὴ φοβεῖσθε, πολλῶν στρουθίων διαφέρετε	1	Do not fear, you are more valuable than many sparrows	The implication is that if God is aware of and concerned for sparrows, which are of less value, then God is certainly aware of and concerned for people, who are of greater value. And so followers of Jesus do not need to be afraid, since God is watching over them. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “You are more valuable than many sparrows, so God is certainly even more aware of you and concerned for you, and so you do not need to be afraid” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	12	8	xzh3		λέγω δὲ ὑμῖν	1	But I say to you	Jesus readdresses his disciples to mark a shift in his speech to a new topic, confession. Alternate translation: “Let me tell you”
LUK	12	8	d1cs	figs-explicit	πᾶς ὃς ἂν ὁμολογήσῃ ἐν ἐμοὶ ἔμπροσθεν τῶν ἀνθρώπων	1	everyone who confesses me before men	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state explicitly what someone would **confess** or acknowledge. Alternate translation: “whoever tells other people that he believes in me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

Alternate translation: “But God told him that he was very foolish, because he was going to die that night, and the things he had stored up would belong to someone else” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])

LUK	12	20	l774	figs-idiom	ταύτῃ τῇ νυκτὶ, τὴν ψυχήν σου ἀπαιτοῦσιν ἀπὸ σοῦ	1	this night they are demanding your soul from you	The term **soul** means the life of a person. God is using the same term as the man did, but with a different meaning, to show that he was foolish to have such confidence in his possessions. Alternate translation: “you are going to lose your life this very night” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

LUK	12	20	vyn1	figs-rquestion	ἃ δὲ ἡτοίμασας, τίνι ἔσται?	1	what you have prepared, whose will it be?	God does not expect the man to tell him who will inherit his things. Rather, God is using the question as a teaching tool, to make the man realize that he could not count on possessing those things, and so he was wrong to put his confidence in them. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate these words as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “the things you have stored up will belong to someone else!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “he said to his disciples, as the crowd was listening” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

LUK	12	24	l776	figs-doublet	οὐκ…ταμεῖον οὐδὲ ἀποθήκη	1	neither storeroom nor barn	These two words mean similar things. Jesus may be using them together to express a general meaning. Alternate translation: “no place to store food” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

LUK	12	25	n286	figs-metaphor	ἐπὶ τὴν ἡλικίαν αὐτοῦ προσθεῖναι πῆχυν	1	add a cubit to his lifespan	Jesus is speaking figuratively of the **lifespan** as if it were measured in length rather than in time.

LUK	12	25	l777	translate-unknown	πῆχυν	1	a cubit	A **cubit** is a measure of length equal to about half a meter or about a foot and a half.

LUK	12	25	l778	figs-explicit	πῆχυν	1	a cubit	The implication may be that since a **cubit** is a relatively short distance, it figuratively represents only a short time. Alternate translation: “even a little bit” or “even a short time” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	12	26	hl4d	figs-rquestion	εἰ οὖν οὐδὲ ἐλάχιστον δύνασθε, τί περὶ τῶν λοιπῶν μεριμνᾶτε?	1	If then you are not able to do the least, why do you worry about the rest?	Jesus is using the question form to teach his disciples. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate his words as a statement or exclamation. Alternate translation: “Since you cannot do even this small thing, you should not worry about the other things!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	12	26	l779	figs-nominaladj	ἐλάχιστον	1	the least	Jesus is using the adjective **least** as a noun. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this with a noun phrase. Alternate translation: “such a very little thing” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
LUK	12	26	l780	figs-explicit	τῶν λοιπῶν	1	the rest	The implication in context is that Jesus is referring to having food to eat and clothes to wear. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “having food and clothing” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	12	27	h293		κατανοήσατε τὰ κρίνα πῶς αὐξάνει	1	Consider the lilies—how they grow	Alternate translation: “Think about how the lilies grow”
LUK	12	27	s8d3	translate-unknown	τὰ κρίνα	1	the lilies	The word **lilies** describes beautiful flowers that grow wild in the fields.

LUK	12	27	u3mf	translate-unknown	οὐδὲ νήθει	1	neither do they spin	In this context, to **spin** means to make thread or yarn for cloth.

If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, and if your readers might misunderstand and think that what Jesus is saying is uncertain, then you can translate his words as an affirmative statement. Alternate translation: “since God makes the wild plants so beautiful, even though they are alive today and are thrown into the oven tomorrow” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
LUK	12	28	l784	figs-explicit	ἐν ἀγρῷ τὸν χόρτον ὄντα σήμερον, καὶ αὔριον εἰς κλίβανον βαλλόμενον	1	the grass in the field, which exists today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven	While Jesus uses a term that typically means **grass**, in this context he must implicitly mean wild plants in general, since he is referring back to the wild lilies he has just mentioned. So you could express this with a general term in your translation. Alternate translation: “the wild plants, which are alive today and tomorrow are thrown into the oven” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

LUK	12	33	xb63	translate-unknown	βαλλάντια μὴ παλαιούμενα	1	purses that will not wear out	If you would like to reproduce the figure of speech that Jesus uses, but you think your readers might not know what **purses** are, you could explain that term, or you could use the name of a different container that people in your culture use to keep valuable things safe.

LUK	12	39	v73u	figs-idiom	ποίᾳ ὥρᾳ	1	at which hour	Jesus uses the term **hour** figuratively to refer to a particular time. Alternate translation: “when” or “at what time” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

LUK	12	41	l808	figs-exclusive	ἡμᾶς	1	us	By **us**, Peter means “me and the rest of your disciples” but not Jesus himself. So **us** would be exclusive, if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

Alternate translation: “But if that servant thinks to himself that his master is going to come back later than he said” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	12	45	l812	figs-hypo	ἐὰν δὲ εἴπῃ ὁ δοῦλος ἐκεῖνος ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ αὐτοῦ…καὶ ἄρξηται	1	But if that servant says in his heart … and begins	The illustration that Jesus is using involves a hypothetical situation.

LUK	12	46	j1m1	figs-parallelism	ἐν ἡμέρᾳ ᾗ οὐ προσδοκᾷ, καὶ ἐν ὥρᾳ ᾗ οὐ γινώσκει	1	in a day that he does not expect, and in an hour that he does not know	These two phrases mean the same thing. Jesus is likely using the repetition to emphasize that the return of the master will be completely unexpected by the servant. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could combine these phrases, especially if putting both of them in your translation might be confusing for your readers. Alternate translation: “at a time that is a complete surprise to the servant” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
LUK	12	46	l815	figs-idiom	ἐν ἡμέρᾳ ᾗ οὐ προσδοκᾷ	1	in a day that he does not expect	Here, Jesus uses the term **day** figuratively to refer to a specific time. Alternate translation: “at a time when he is not expecting him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

LUK	12	46	vg1d	figs-metaphor	διχοτομήσει αὐτὸν	1	will cut him in two	The expression **cut him in two** could mean one of two things, depending on how the word **unfaithful** is understood (see next note): (1) if **unfaithful** means “untrustworthy,” then the expression is probably figurative, since the master could not reassign this servant to less important responsibilities if he **cut him in two**. Alternate translation: “will punish him severely” (2) if **unfaithful** means “unbelieving,” then the expression is more literal, since it would describe something that will happen when God judges the world. Alternate translation: “destroy his body” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	12	46	l817		τὸ μέρος αὐτοῦ μετὰ τῶν ἀπίστων θήσει	1	will … appoint his place with the unfaithful	The term that ULT translates as **unfaithful** could mean: (1) “untrustworthy.” The meaning would be that the master will assign this servant to less important responsibilities, along with other servants who have shown that they cannot be trusted with important ones. Alternate translation: “will give him unimportant responsibilities, like other servants who have shown that they cannot be trusted” (2) “unbelieving.” The master in the parable represents God, and Jesus would be speaking of what God will do, when he judges the world, to people who show by their disobedience that they do not have genuine faith. Alternate translation: “will assign him a place with the unbelievers”
LUK	12	46	l818	figs-nominaladj	τῶν ἀπίστων	1	the unfaithful	Jesus is using the adjective **unfaithful** as a noun in order to indicate a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this expression with an equivalent phrase. The meaning will depend on how you decided to translate **unfaithful** (see previous note). Alternate translation: “servants who have shown that they cannot be trusted” or “people who have shown that they are not genuine believers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
LUK	12	47	p1l2	figs-hypo	ἐκεῖνος δὲ ὁ δοῦλος, ὁ γνοὺς τὸ θέλημα τοῦ κυρίου αὐτοῦ, καὶ μὴ ἑτοιμάσας ἢ ποιήσας πρὸς τὸ θέλημα αὐτοῦ, δαρήσεται πολλάς	1	Now that servant, the one who knew the will of his master, and did not get ready or do according to his will, will be beaten much	Jesus is describing a hypothetical situation. It may be helpful to use two sentences if you translate it that way. Alternate translation: “Suppose a servant knew what his master wanted him to do, and suppose he did not get ready or do what the master wanted. Then his master would punish him severely” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
LUK	12	47	aj41		τὸ θέλημα τοῦ κυρίου αὐτοῦ	1	the will of his master	Alternate translation: “what his master wanted him to do”
LUK	12	47	im3v	figs-activepassive	δαρήσεται πολλάς	1	will be beaten much	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who will do the action. Alternate translation: “his master will punish him severely” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	12	48	l819	figs-hypo	ὁ δὲ μὴ γνοὺς, ποιήσας δὲ ἄξια πληγῶν, δαρήσεται ὀλίγας	1	But the one who did not know, and did things worthy of blows will be beaten little	Jesus is describing a hypothetical situation. It may be helpful to use two sentences if you translate it that way. Alternate translation: “But suppose a servant did not know what his master wanted him to do, and suppose he did things that deserved punishment. Then his master would punish him lightly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
LUK	12	48	nn9c	figs-activepassive	δαρήσεται ὀλίγας	1	will be beaten little	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who will do the action. Alternate translation: “his master would punish him lightly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	12	48	qg96	figs-parallelism	παντὶ…ᾧ ἐδόθη πολύ, πολὺ ζητηθήσεται παρ’ αὐτοῦ; καὶ ᾧ παρέθεντο πολύ, περισσότερον αἰτήσουσιν αὐτόν	1	everyone to whom much has been given, much will be required from him, and to whom much has been provided, even more will be asked of him	These two clauses mean the same thing. Jesus is using repetition for emphasis. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could combine them, especially if putting both of them in your translation might be confusing for your readers. Alternate translation: “if someone entrusts many resources to a person, he will expect that person to produce much from those resources” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
LUK	12	48	ehu9	figs-activepassive	παντὶ…ᾧ ἐδόθη πολύ, πολὺ ζητηθήσεται παρ’ αὐτοῦ	1	everyone to whom much has been given, much will be required from him	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could use active verbal forms to express the meaning of the two passive verbal forms here. Alternate translation: “the master will require more of everyone to whom he has given much” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	12	48	ir7m	figs-activepassive	ᾧ παρέθεντο πολύ, περισσότερον αἰτήσουσιν αὐτόν	1	to whom much has been provided, even more will be asked of him	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could use active verbal forms to express the meaning of the two passive verbal forms here. Alternate translation: “the master will ask even more of the one to whom he has given much property to care for” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	12	49	qy62	figs-metaphor	πῦρ ἦλθον βαλεῖν ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν	1	I came to throw fire upon the earth	Jesus is speaking figuratively of the effects of his ministry and teaching. In context, since he says contrastingly in [12:51](../12/51.md) that he did not come to bring peace to the earth, **fire** likely represents the passionate responses to him, both favorable and unfavorable, that would lead to the divisions he describes in [12:52-53](../12/52.md). Alternate translation: “My coming will lead to conflict among people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	12	49	l820	figs-metonymy	τὴν γῆν	1	the earth	Jesus says **the earth** figuratively to mean the people living on the earth. Alternate translation: “people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	12	49	ygv3	figs-exclamations	τί θέλω εἰ ἤδη ἀνήφθη	1	how I wish that it were already kindled	This exclamation emphasizes how much Jesus wants this to happen. Alternate translation: “I wish very much that this fire were already lit” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations]])
LUK	12	49	ygx3	figs-metaphor	τί θέλω εἰ ἤδη ἀνήφθη	1	how I wish that it were already kindled	This exclamation continues the metaphor of **fire** as conflict. Alternate translation: “how I wish that people were already taking sides” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	12	49	l821	figs-activepassive	ἤδη ἀνήφθη	1	it were already kindled	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “the fire were already burning” or “people were already taking sides” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	12	50	k4e8	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	δὲ	1	But	Jesus uses this word to indicate that he cannot do what the previous sentence describes until after he does what this sentence describes. Alternate translation: “But first” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
LUK	12	50	hn1j	figs-metaphor	βάπτισμα…ἔχω βαπτισθῆναι	1	I have a baptism to be baptized with	Jesus speaks figuratively of **baptism** to describe how he must suffer. Just as water covers a person during baptism, suffering will overwhelm Jesus. Alternate translation: “I must be overwhelmed by suffering” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	12	50	l822	figs-activepassive	βάπτισμα…ἔχω βαπτισθῆναι	1	I have a baptism to be baptized with	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “suffering must overwhelm me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	12	50	r2yj	figs-exclamations	πῶς συνέχομαι ἕως ὅτου τελεσθῇ	1	how I am distressed until it is completed	This exclamation emphasizes how distressed Jesus is.

LUK	12	50	l823	figs-activepassive	πῶς συνέχομαι	1	how I am distressed	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form, and you can state what is doing the action. Alternate translation: “this suffering will continue to distress me terribly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	12	50	l824	figs-activepassive	ἕως ὅτου τελεσθῇ	1	until it is completed	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form, and you can state who will do the action. Alternate translation: “until I have endured all of it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	12	51	s32r	figs-rquestion	δοκεῖτε ὅτι εἰρήνην παρεγενόμην δοῦναι ἐν τῇ γῇ?	1	Do you think that I came to give peace on the earth?	Jesus is not asking the people in the crowd to tell him what they think. He is using the question form as a teaching tool. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate these words as a statement. Alternate translation: “Do not think that I came to bring peace on the earth.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	12	51	l825	figs-metonymy	δοκεῖτε ὅτι εἰρήνην παρεγενόμην δοῦναι ἐν τῇ γῇ	1	Do you think that I came to give peace on the earth	Jesus says **the earth** figuratively to mean the people living on the earth. Alternate translation: “Do you think that I came to make peace between people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	12	51	l826	figs-abstractnouns	εἰρήνην…δοῦναι ἐν τῇ γῇ	1	to give peace on the earth	If your readers would misunderstand the abstract noun **peace**, you could express the idea behind it with an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “to make people get along with one another” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
LUK	12	51	l827	figs-ellipsis	οὐχί…ἀλλ’ ἢ διαμερισμόν	1	No … but rather division	Jesus is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. These words can be supplied from earlier in the sentence. Alternate translation: “No … I came to bring division instead” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
LUK	12	51	np4v	figs-abstractnouns	οὐχί…ἀλλ’ ἢ διαμερισμόν	1	No … but rather division	If your readers would misunderstand the abstract noun **division**, you could express the idea behind it with an equivalent expression.

LUK	12	51	l828		λέγω ὑμῖν	1	I say to you	Jesus uses this expression to emphasize what he is about to tell his disciples and the crowd. Alternate translation: “I want you to understand”
LUK	12	52	vrt5	figs-metonymy	πέντε ἐν ἑνὶ οἴκῳ	1	five in one house	Jesus uses the term **house** to refer figuratively to people who live together in a house, that is, to a family. Alternate translation: “five members of the same family” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	12	52	l829	figs-activepassive	διαμεμερισμένοι	1	divided	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “who will take sides against one another” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	12	52	fln4	figs-ellipsis	τρεῖς ἐπὶ δυσὶν, καὶ δύο ἐπὶ τρισίν	1	three against two, and two against three	Jesus is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would ordinarily need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from what he says figuratively earlier in the sentence. Alternate translation: “three of the family members will be on one side, and the other two will be on the opposing side” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
LUK	12	52	l830	figs-parallelism	τρεῖς ἐπὶ δυσὶν, καὶ δύο ἐπὶ τρισίν	1	three against two, and two against three	These two phrases mean the same thing. Jesus is likely using repetition for emphasis. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could combine these phrases. Alternate translation: “three of the family members will be on one side, and the other two will be on the opposing side” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
LUK	12	53	qr7s	figs-activepassive	διαμερισθήσονται	1	They will be divided	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “Family members will oppose one another” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	12	53	l831	figs-parallelism	πατὴρ ἐπὶ υἱῷ, καὶ υἱὸς ἐπὶ πατρί	1	father against son, and son against father	These two phrases mean the same thing. Jesus is likely using repetition for emphasis.

LUK	12	53	l832	figs-parallelism	μήτηρ ἐπὶ τὴν θυγατέρα, καὶ θυγάτηρ ἐπὶ τὴν μητέρα	1	mother against her daughter, and daughter against her mother	These two phrases mean the same thing. Jesus is likely using repetition for emphasis. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could combine these phrases and make them a sentence of their own. Alternate translation: “mothers and daughters will oppose one another” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
LUK	12	53	l833	figs-parallelism	πενθερὰ ἐπὶ τὴν νύμφην αὐτῆς, καὶ νύμφη ἐπὶ τὴν πενθεράν	1	mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law, and daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law	These two phrases mean the same thing. Jesus is likely using repetition for emphasis. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could combine these phrases and make them a sentence of their own. Alternate translation: “mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law will oppose one another” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
LUK	12	54	i84z	figs-explicit	ὅταν ἴδητε νεφέλην ἀνατέλλουσαν	1	a cloud rising in the west	**A cloud rising** in this direction would indicate that rain was coming in Israel, because the sea was to the **west**. If rainstorms tend to come from a different direction in your region, you could use a general expression here. Alternate translation: “clouds forming in a certain direction” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	12	54	d3gk	figs-quotesinquotes	λέγετε, ὅτι ὄμβρος ἔρχεται	1	you say, ‘A shower is coming’	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “you say that it is going to rain” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	12	54	l834		καὶ γίνεται οὕτως	1	and it happens thus	Alternate translation: “and it does rain”
LUK	12	55	gq22	figs-explicit	νότον πνέοντα	1	a south wind is blowing	Wind coming from this direction would indicate that hot weather was coming in Israel, because the desert was to the **south**. If hot winds blow from a different direction in your region, you could use a general expression here. Alternate translation: “the wind is blowing from a certain direction” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	12	55	l835	figs-quotesinquotes	λέγετε, ὅτι καύσων ἔσται	1	you say, ‘There will be scorching heat’	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “you say that it is going to be very hot” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	12	55	l836		καὶ γίνεται	1	and it happens	Alternate translation: “and it does get hot”
LUK	12	56	l837	figs-explicit	ὑποκριταί!	1	Hypocrites!	The implication, which Jesus draws out in the rest of this verse, is that people who could understand the weather from signs such as wind and clouds also ought to be able to understand what God was doing through Jesus from the signs surrounding his ministry. So if they did not welcome him, it was not because they did not see or understand these signs. Rather, it was because they were pretending not to see or understand them. Alternate translation: “You are pretending not to understand!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	12	56	jdj7	figs-metaphor	τὸ πρόσωπον	1	the face	Jesus uses the term **face** figuratively to mean “appearance.” Alternate translation: “the appearance” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	12	56	y3yj	figs-rquestion	τὸν καιρὸν δὲ τοῦτον, πῶς οὐκ οἴδατε δοκιμάζειν?	1	but how do you not know how to interpret this time?	Jesus is using the question form to rebuke the crowd. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate his words as a statement. Alternate translation: “so you ought to be able to understand what is happening right now.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	12	57	w8rz	figs-rquestion	τί δὲ καὶ ἀφ’ ἑαυτῶν, οὐ κρίνετε τὸ δίκαιον?	1	And why do you not even judge for yourselves what is right?	Jesus is using the question form to rebuke the crowd. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate his words as a statement. Alternate translation: “You ought to discern on your own what is right.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	12	58	y75j	figs-hypo	ὡς γὰρ ὑπάγεις μετὰ τοῦ ἀντιδίκου σου ἐπ’ ἄρχοντα	1	For as you are going with your adversary to the magistrate	Jesus is using a hypothetical situation to teach the crowd. Alternate translation: “Suppose you owed someone money, and suppose they were taking you to court to collect it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
LUK	12	58	l838	figs-parables	ὡς γὰρ ὑπάγεις μετὰ τοῦ ἀντιδίκου σου ἐπ’ ἄρχοντα	1	For as you are going with your adversary to the magistrate	This hypothetical situation is also an illustration designed to help the people understand that they should be welcoming Jesus. Just as the debtor is going to be judged imminently, God is going to judge them imminently based on their responses to Jesus, and so they should make a positive response now, before it is too late. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “Then Jesus gave the crowd this illustration to help them understand. ‘Suppose you owed someone money, and suppose he was taking you to court to collect it’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])
LUK	12	58	f1ea	figs-youcrowd	ὑπάγεις…σου…σε	1	you are going … your … you	Even though Jesus is speaking to the crowd, he is addressing an individual situation, so **you** and **your** are singular throughout this verse. But if the singular form would not be natural in your language for someone who was speaking to a group of people, you could use the plural forms of **you** and **your** in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd]])
LUK	12	58	t4v8	translate-unknown	τοῦ ἀντιδίκου σου	1	your adversary	In the context of this story, the term **adversary** means specifically an opponent in a legal proceeding. You could translate it with the equivalent term in your language. Alternatively, since the next verse indicates that the **adversary** is trying to collect a debt, you could describe him in a way that indicates that. Alternate translation: “your opponent” or “your creditor” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	12	58	e7hz	translate-unknown	ἄρχοντα	1	the magistrate	**Magistrate** is a general term for a person in legal authority. You can translate it with the equivalent general term in your language. Alternate translation: “the official” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	12	58	b7sh	figs-activepassive	ἀπηλλάχθαι ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ	1	to be released from him	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “to settle the matter out of court” or “to have him forgive your debt” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	12	58	l839	translate-unknown	τὸν κριτήν	1	the judge	The term **the judge** refers to the same person as the **magistrate**, but the term here is more specific and threatening. In your translation you can use the specific term in your language that describes someone with the power to deliver a verdict and pass sentence on a defendant. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	12	58	l840	translate-unknown	τῷ πράκτορι	1	the officer	In the context of the story, the term **the officer** refers to a court official who was empowered to collect debts that a judge had ruled were owed and to put the debtor in prison if he did not pay. Your language may have a similar term that you can use. Alternate translation: “the bailiff” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	12	59	wi7m	figs-hypo	λέγω σοι	1	I say to you	Jesus uses this expression to emphasize what he is about to tell his disciples and the crowd. If you translated the previous verse as a hypothetical condition, you could translate this expression as an introduction to the result of that condition. Alternate translation: “If that happens, then” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
LUK	12	59	l841	figs-youcrowd	λέγω σοι	1	I say to you	Even though Jesus is speaking directly to the crowd, he is still addressing an individual situation, so **you** is singular here and in the rest of this verse. But if the singular form would not be natural in your language for someone who was speaking to a group of people, you could use the plural form of **you** in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd]])
LUK	12	59	i124	translate-bmoney	καὶ τὸ ἔσχατον λεπτὸν	1	the very last lepton	A **lepton** was the smallest and least valuable coin in circulation in this place and time. It was equivalent to about a tenth of an hour’s wage. You could try to express this amount in terms of current monetary values, but that might cause your Bible translation to become outdated and inaccurate, since those values can change over time. So instead you might use the name of the least valuable coin in your culture, or a general expression. Alternate translation: “the very last penny” or “every bit of money that your creditor demands” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney]])
LUK	13	intro	xaa2			0		# Luke 13 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>1. Jesus teaches with parables (13:1-30)<br>2. Jesus speaks about Herod and Jerusalem (13:31-35)<br><br>## Possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Unknown events<br><br>The people and Jesus speak about two events that they knew about, but about which no one today knows anything except what Luke has written. These events are Pilate executing some Galileans in the temple, 13:1-2, and 18 people being killed when a tower collapsed in Jerusalem, 13:4. In your translation, you should tell your readers no more than what Luke tells about what happened. Your translation should tell only what Luke tells.<br><br>### Paradox<br><br>A paradox is a statement that describes two things that seem as if they cannot both be true at the same time, but which actually are both true. Jesus speaks a paradox in this chapter: “Those who are least important will be first, and those who are most important will be last” (Luke 13:30)
LUK	13	1	t1fi	grammar-connect-time-background	δέ	1	And	Luke uses this word to introduce background information that will help readers understand what Jesus teaches next. Alternate translation: “Now” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background]])
LUK	13	1	l842	writing-participants	παρῆσαν…τινες ἐν αὐτῷ τῷ καιρῷ, ἀπαγγέλλοντες αὐτῷ	1	some were present at that time who were reporting to him	Luke uses this phrase to introduce new characters into the story.

LUK	13	1	wg2k	figs-explicit	ἐν αὐτῷ τῷ καιρῷ	1	at that time	This implicitly means while Jesus was still teaching the crowds, as Luke said he was doing in [11:54](../11/54.md). If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “while he was still teaching the crowds” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	13	1	l843	figs-metaphor	ὧν τὸ αἷμα Πειλᾶτος ἔμιξεν μετὰ τῶν θυσιῶν αὐτῶν	1	whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices	Luke is speaking figuratively about this event to indicate that the **blood** of the Galileans was shed at the same time as the blood of their animal **sacrifices**. Alternate translation: “whom Pilate had killed while they were offering sacrifices at the temple” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	13	1	fj2c	figs-metonymy	ὧν τὸ αἷμα Πειλᾶτος ἔμιξεν μετὰ τῶν θυσιῶν αὐτῶν	1	whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices	Luke uses the term **blood** figuratively to refer to the death of these Galileans. Alternate translation: “whom Pilate had killed while they were offering sacrifices at the temple” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	13	1	l844	figs-metonymy	ὧν τὸ αἷμα Πειλᾶτος ἔμιξεν μετὰ τῶν θυσιῶν αὐτῶν	1	whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices	Pilate likely did not kill these Galileans personally. Rather, he ordered his soldiers to kill them. Alternate translation: “whom Pilate’s soldiers had killed as they were offering sacrifices at the temple” or “whom Pilate had ordered his soldiers to kill as they were offering sacrifices at the temple” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	13	1	l845	translate-names	Πειλᾶτος	1	Pilate	**Pilate** is the name of a man; he was the Roman ruler of Judea in this time. See how you translated his name in [3:1](../03/01.md). His name occurs many times later in the book. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	13	2	l846	figs-hendiadys	ἀποκριθεὶς εἶπεν αὐτοῖς	1	answering he said to them	Together the two words **answering** and **said** mean that Jesus responded to what the people in the crowd told him. Alternate translation: “Jesus responded to them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
LUK	13	2	zfa8	figs-rquestion	δοκεῖτε ὅτι	1	Do you think that	Jesus is using the question form to teach these people and the whole crowd. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate his words as a statement. Alternate translation: “Do not think that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	13	2	l847		ἁμαρτωλοὶ παρὰ πάντας τοὺς Γαλιλαίους	1	more sinful than all the Galileans	Alternate translation: “more sinful than all the other Galileans” or “the most sinful of all Galileans”
LUK	13	2	l848		ταῦτα πεπόνθασιν	1	they suffered this	Alternate translation: “this happened to them”
LUK	13	3	xl6m		οὐχί, λέγω ὑμῖν	1	No, I say to you	Jesus uses this expression to emphasize what he is about to tell these people and the crowd. Alternate translation: “That is certainly not the case”
LUK	13	3	a3ez	figs-explicit	πάντες ὁμοίως ἀπολεῖσθε	1	you will all perish in the same way	This statement seems to be similar to the one that Jesus makes in [19:41-44](../19/41.md), in which he says that if the Jewish people reject him and instead follow violent false messiahs, this will bring them into conflict with the Romans and they will be destroyed. That seems to be the implicit meaning here as well, and you could express that in your translation. Alternate translation: “you too will be destroyed by the Romans” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	13	4	hj5w		ἢ ἐκεῖνοι	1	Or those	Jesus is giving a second example of people who suffered. Alternate translation: “Also consider those”

LUK	13	25	l879	figs-quotesinquotes	κρούειν τὴν θύραν λέγοντες, κύριε, ἄνοιξον ἡμῖν	1	knock on the door, saying, ‘Lord, open for us’	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation.

LUK	13	25	jqh7	translate-unknown	κρούειν τὴν θύραν	1	knock on the door	See how you translated the word “knock” in [11:9](../11/09.md). Alternate translation: “call out” or “cough” or “clap” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	13	25	l880	figs-exclusive	ἡμῖν	1	us	The people knocking on the door mean themselves but not the owner of the house, so if your language distinguishes between exclusive and inclusive **us,** use the exclusive form here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
LUK	13	25	l881	figs-hendiadys	ἀποκριθεὶς ἐρεῖ	1	will answer and say	Together the two words **answer** and **say** mean that the owner of the house will respond to the people who are knocking on the door. Alternate translation: “will respond” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
LUK	13	25	l882	figs-quotesinquotes	ἀποκριθεὶς ἐρεῖ ὑμῖν, οὐκ οἶδα ὑμᾶς, πόθεν ἐστέ	1	he will answer and say to you, ‘I do not know you, where you are from’	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “he will respond that he does not know you or where you are from” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	13	25	l883	figs-ellipsis	οὐκ οἶδα ὑμᾶς, πόθεν ἐστέ	1	I do not know you, where you are from	The owner is speaking in an abbreviated way. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could draw on the first phrase to supply the words that are missing from the second phrase, as UST does.

LUK	13	25	l884	figs-parallelism	οὐκ οἶδα ὑμᾶς, πόθεν ἐστέ	1	I do not know you, where you are from	The owner is also using repetition for emphasis.

LUK	13	26	l885	figs-quotesinquotes	ἄρξεσθε λέγειν, ἐφάγομεν ἐνώπιόν σου καὶ ἐπίομεν, καὶ ἐν ταῖς πλατείαις ἡμῶν ἐδίδαξας	1	you will begin to say, ‘We ate and drank in your sight, and you taught in our streets’	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation.

LUK	13	26	l886	figs-metaphor	ἐφάγομεν ἐνώπιόν σου καὶ ἐπίομεν	1	we ate and drank before you	Here, **before** figuratively means “in the presence” of another person.

LUK	13	26	l887	figs-merism	ἐφάγομεν…καὶ ἐπίομεν	1	ate and drank	The people are figuratively using the two components of a meal to mean an entire meal. Alternate translation: “We shared meals” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
LUK	13	26	l888	figs-you	σου	1	you	Since the people are addressing the owner alone, the pronoun **you** would be singular here, and also in any case where it is needed in your language as a pronoun for a verb, for example, **you taught**. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
LUK	13	26	l889	figs-exclusive	ἐν ταῖς πλατείαις ἡμῶν	1	in our streets	Within the extended metaphor, the people are addressing Jesus, who was not from their town, but who taught them as he traveled through. So the people would consider the streets to be theirs but not his, and **our** would be exclusive, if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

LUK	13	27	l891	figs-explicitinfo	ἐρεῖ λέγων ὑμῖν	1	he will speak, saying to you	In your language, it might seem that this phrase expresses unnecessary extra information. If so, you could abbreviate it. Alternate translation: “he will tell you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo]])
LUK	13	27	l892	figs-you	ὑμῖν…πάντες	1	you … all you	Since the owner of the house is speaking to the people outside, **you** would be plural in these instances. The implied “you” in the command to **get away** would also be plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
LUK	13	27	l893	figs-explicit	οὐκ οἶδα πόθεν ἐστέ	1	I do not know where you are from	This is a shorter version of what the house owner says at first.

LUK	13	31	l7fe	figs-metonymy	Ἡρῴδης θέλει σε ἀποκτεῖναι	1	Herod wants to kill you	Herod would not kill Jesus personally. Rather, he would order people to do it. Alternate translation: “Herod plans to send his soldiers to kill you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	13	32	l904	figs-quotesinquotes	πορευθέντες εἴπατε τῇ ἀλώπεκι ταύτῃ, ἰδοὺ, ἐκβάλλω δαιμόνια, καὶ ἰάσεις ἀποτελῶ	1	Go and tell that fox, ‘Behold, I am driving out demons and perform healings’	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation.

LUK	13	32	l905	translate-unknown	τῇ ἀλώπεκι ταύτῃ	1	that fox	A **fox** is a small wild dog. If your readers would not be familiar with what a **fox** is, you could use the name of a similar animal in your region, or a general expression.

LUK	13	32	af7k	figs-metaphor	τῇ ἀλώπεκι ταύτῃ	1	that fox	Jesus is referring to Herod figuratively as a **fox**. This could mean: (1) since foxes need to rely on cunning to catch their prey, Jesus may be saying that Herod is devious. Alternate translation: “that devious person” (2) since a fox is a small animal, Jesus may be saying that Herod was not much of a threat. Alternate translation: “that insignificant person” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

LUK	13	32	l909	figs-explicit	ἐκβάλλω δαιμόνια, καὶ ἰάσεις ἀποτελῶ σήμερον καὶ αὔριον	1	I am driving out demons and performing healings today and tomorrow	The implication is that Jesus is saying he knows he does not need to be afraid of Herod’s deadly intentions, even though he is in territory that Herod rules, because God will keep him safe while he carries out his ministry. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “I know that for now, with God’s protection, I can safely carry on my ministry even in Herod’s territory” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

Alternate translation: “I will complete my ministry” (2) this expression refers to someone reaching a goal or destination. Alternate translation: “I will finish traveling through Herod’s territory and reach Jerusalem” (3) Jesus is referring to a goal or destination figuratively, and mean that he will reach the end of his life. Alternate translation: “I will give my life as a sacrifice” (4) the expression describes someone reaching maturity or perfection of character, and if that is what it means here, it would describe the character that Jesus demonstrated when he gave his life as the Savior. Alternate translation: “I will demonstrate supreme love” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

The Jewish leaders claimed to serve God, and yet their ancestors killed many of God’s prophets in Jerusalem. Jesus knew that they would kill him there too. Alternate translation: “it is in Jerusalem that the Jewish leaders have killed so many of God’s messengers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])
LUK	13	34	cac7	figs-apostrophe	Ἰερουσαλὴμ, Ἰερουσαλήμ	1	Jerusalem, Jerusalem	Jesus is figuratively addressing something he knows cannot hear him, the city of Jerusalem, in order to show his listeners in a strong way how he feels about it.

Jesus is likely using repetition for emphasis. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could combine the phrases. Alternate translation: “who kills the prophets God sends her by stoning them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
LUK	13	34	l914	figs-personification	ἡ ἀποκτείνουσα τοὺς προφήτας, καὶ λιθοβολοῦσα τοὺς ἀπεσταλμένους πρὸς αὐτήν	1	who kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to her	Jesus speaks figuratively of the city as if it were female.

LUK	13	34	l915	figs-123person	ἡ ἀποκτείνουσα τοὺς προφήτας, καὶ λιθοβολοῦσα τοὺς ἀπεσταλμένους πρὸς αὐτήν	1	who kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to her	Jesus speaks of the city in the third person, even though he is addressing it directly.

LUK	13	34	rj48	figs-exclamations	ποσάκις ἠθέλησα	1	How often have I desired	This is an exclamation and not a question. Alternate translation: “I have desired so often” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations]])

LUK	13	34	l916	figs-you	σου	1	your	Even though Jesus is speaking of the people who live in Jerusalem, he is figuratively addressing the city, so **your** would be singular. The pronoun **you** would also be a singular pronoun in any case where it is needed in your language as a pronoun for a verb, for example, “you were not willing,” and in the phrase “sent to you,” if you decide to use the second person. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

LUK	13	34	l917	translate-unknown	τὴν ἑαυτῆς νοσσιὰν	1	her brood	The term **brood** refers collectively to all of the young offspring of a bird. Alternate translation: “her chicks” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

LUK	13	35	l921	figs-activepassive	ἀφίεται ὑμῖν ὁ οἶκος ὑμῶν	1	your house has been left to you	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who will do the action. Alternate translation: “God is going to leave your city to you alone” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	13	35	l922	figs-explicit	ἀφίεται ὑμῖν ὁ οἶκος ὑμῶν	1	your house has been left to you	The implications of this statement are that God will no longer consider that Jerusalem belongs to him, as a holy city where he dwells in his temple, and that God will therefore not protect the people of Jerusalem from their enemies. Alternate translation: “God will not protect you from your enemies” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	13	35	l923	figs-you	ὑμῖν…ὑμῶν…ὑμῖν	1	your … you … you	Jesus is now speaking directly to the people who live in Jerusalem, so **your** and **you** would be plural. The pronoun **you** would also be a plural pronoun in any case where it is needed in your language as a pronoun for a verb, for example, “you say.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
LUK	13	35	l924		λέγω δὲ ὑμῖν	1	I say to you	Jesus says this to emphasize what he is telling the people of Jerusalem. Alternate translation: “I can assure you”

LUK	13	35	l925	figs-idiom	ἕως ἥξει ὅτε εἴπητε	1	until it comes when you say	The expression **it comes** means “the time comes.” You could express that in your translation, or, if your language does not speak of time as “coming,” you could use an equivalent expression.

LUK	14	intro	xk3w			0		# Luke 14 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>1. Jesus attends a banquet and tells a parable about a banquet (14:1-24)<br>2. Jesus teaches more about being his disciple (14:25-35)<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Parable<br><br>Jesus told the parable in Luke 14:15-24 to teach that the kingdom of God will be something that everyone can enjoy, but many people will refuse to be part of it. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/kingdomofgod]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Paradox<br><br>A paradox is a statement that describes two things that seem as if they cannot both be true at the same time, but which actually are both true. Jesus speaks a paradox in this chapter: “For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted” (14:11).
LUK	14	1	dj2d	writing-newevent	καὶ ἐγένετο	1	And it happened that	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
LUK	14	1	a3ya	grammar-connect-time-background	καὶ	1	And	Luke uses this word to introduce background information that will help readers understand what happens next. Alternate translation: “Now” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background]])

LUK	14	1	lh8g	figs-synecdoche	φαγεῖν ἄρτον	1	to eat bread	Luke refers figuratively to **bread**, one kind of food, to mean food in general. Alternate translation: “to have a meal” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
LUK	14	1	jst8	figs-explicit	καὶ αὐτοὶ ἦσαν παρατηρούμενοι αὐτόν	1	and they were watching him closely	The implication is that other Pharisees were also present, as [14:3](../14/03.md) indicates explicitly, and that they all wanted to find a way to accuse Jesus of saying or doing something wrong. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. It might be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “Many other Pharisees were present, and they were all watching Jesus closely to try to catch him saying or doing something wrong” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	14	2	l927	figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	behold	Luke uses the term **behold** to calls the reader’s attention to what he is about to say. Your language may have a similar expression that you can use here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	14	2	f5gh	writing-participants	ἄνθρωπός τις	1	a certain man	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new character into the story. If your language has its own way of doing that, you can use it here in your translation. Alternate translation: “there was a man there” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
LUK	14	2	l4a1	translate-unknown	ἦν ὑδρωπικὸς	1	who was edematous	This means that the man had edema. That is a condition that causes swelling when water builds up in parts of the body. Your language may have a specific name for this condition. If not, you can use a general expression. Alternate translation: “who was suffering because parts of his body were swollen with water” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	14	2	l929	writing-background	ἦν ὑδρωπικὸς	1	who was edematous	Luke provides this background information about the man to help readers understand what happens in this episode. Jesus was facing the issue of whether to heal this man on the Sabbath, which the Pharisees thought was wrong. Alternate translation: “who was suffering because parts of his body were swollen with water” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
LUK	14	2	l930	figs-metaphor	ἔμπροσθεν αὐτοῦ	1	before him	Here, the word **before** means “in front of” or “in the presence of” another person. Alternate translation: “was in the presence of Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	14	3	l931	figs-explicit	ἀποκριθεὶς ὁ Ἰησοῦς εἶπεν	1	answering Jesus spoke	The term **answering** indicates that Jesus **spoke** in response to the situation that he observed. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “when he saw the man, Jesus spoke” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	14	3	l932	translate-unknown	τοὺς νομικοὺς	1	the lawyers	See how you translated this in [7:30](../07/30.md). In this context, the term **lawyers** refers to experts in the law of Moses and its application to various situations. Alternate translation: “the experts in the Jewish law” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	14	3	qak4	figs-rquestion	ἔξεστιν τῷ Σαββάτῳ θεραπεῦσαι ἢ οὔ?	1	Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath, or not?	Jesus is not asking this question for information or to get guidance about what he should do. Rather, he is using the question to challenge the Pharisees and lawyers to think about the meaning and purpose of the Sabbath. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this as an imperative. Alternate translation: “If you think the law does not permit healing on the Sabbath, explain why.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	14	4	pj9t		οἱ δὲ ἡσύχασαν	1	But they kept silent	Alternate translation: “But the religious leaders would not answer Jesus’ question”
LUK	14	4	l933	grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ	1	And	Luke uses this word to introduce the results of what the previous sentence described. Because the religious leaders made no objection to healing on the Sabbath, as a result, Jesus healed the man. Alternate translation: “So” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
LUK	14	4	x4lq	writing-pronouns	ἐπιλαβόμενος	1	taking hold of him	Alternate translation: “Jesus took hold of the man who was suffering from edema and” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
LUK	14	5	l934	grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ	1	And	Luke uses this word to introduce the results of what the previous sentence described. Alternate translation: “So” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
LUK	14	5	rr5z	figs-rquestion	τίνος ὑμῶν υἱὸς ἢ βοῦς εἰς φρέαρ πεσεῖται, καὶ οὐκ εὐθέως ἀνασπάσει αὐτὸν ἐν ἡμέρᾳ τοῦ Σαββάτου	1	Of which of you will a son or an ox fall into a well, and he will not immediately pull him out on the Sabbath day	Jesus does not expect these religious leaders to tell him whether they would do this. Rather, he is using the question form as a teaching tool. He wants these religious leaders to recognize that on the Sabbath day, they themselves would do something to address a situation of suffering and need. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate his words as a statement. It may be helpful to make this two sentences. Alternate translation: “If one of you had a son who fell into a well on the Sabbath, surely you would pull him out immediately. You would even do the same thing for your ox.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	14	6	cti5		καὶ οὐκ ἴσχυσαν ἀνταποκριθῆναι πρὸς ταῦτα	1	And they were not able to give an answer to these things	Alternate translation: “And there was nothing they could say in response”
LUK	14	7	l935	grammar-connect-logic-result	ἔλεγεν…παραβολήν…ἐπέχων πῶς τὰς πρωτοκλισίας ἐξελέγοντο	1	he was speaking a parable … noticing how they were choosing the first places	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could reverse the order of the phrases in this verse, since the second phrase gives the reason for the action that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “Jesus noticed that those whom the leader of the Pharisees had invited to the meal were trying to sit in the seats for honored guests, so he gave them an illustration” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
LUK	14	7	u86b	figs-parables	ἔλεγεν…παραβολήν	1	he was speaking a parable	In this instance, Luke is not using the term **parable** to mean a brief story that teaches something true in a way that is easy to understand and remember. Jesus used a hypothetical situation as an illustration to get the guests at this meal to consider how they should behave at feasts. Alternate translation: “he gave an illustration” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])
LUK	14	7	em4u	figs-activepassive	τοὺς κεκλημένους	1	those who were invited	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who had done the action.

LUK	14	7	yd4g	figs-metaphor	τὰς πρωτοκλισίας	1	the first places	The term **first** figuratively represents being important and honored. If your culture has a way of placing people at meals to show honor, you can use that in your translation. Otherwise, you can use a general expression. Alternate translation: “the seats closest to the host” or “the seats for honored guests” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	14	8	l936	figs-hypo	ὅταν κληθῇς ὑπό τινος εἰς γάμους, μὴ κατακλιθῇς	1	When you are invited by someone to a wedding feast, do not recline to eat	Jesus is using a hypothetical situation to teach the guests at this meal.

LUK	14	8	pd7w	figs-activepassive	ὅταν κληθῇς ὑπό τινος	1	When you are invited by someone	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “When someone invites you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	14	8	l937	translate-unknown	μὴ κατακλιθῇς	1	do not recline to eat	See how you translated this in [5:29](../05/29.md). Alternate translation: “do not take your place at the table” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	14	8	l938	figs-metaphor	τὴν πρωτοκλισίαν	1	the first place	See how you translated this in [14:7](../14/07.md). Alternate translation: “in a seat for an honored guest” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	14	8	t1r5	figs-activepassive	ἐντιμότερός σου ᾖ κεκλημένος ὑπ’ αὐτοῦ	1	a more honorable than you may have been invited by him	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form.

LUK	14	8	l939	figs-nominaladj	ἐντιμότερός	1	a more honorable	Jesus is using the comparative adjective **more honorable** as a noun. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate it with a noun phrase. Alternate translation: “a person who is more important” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
LUK	14	8	m5b9	figs-youcrowd	σου	1	you	Even though Jesus is speaking to the crowd, he is addressing an individual situation, so **you** and **your** are singular in [14:8-10](../14/08.md). But if the singular forms of these pronouns would not be natural in your language for someone who was speaking to a group of people, you could use the plural forms in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd]])
LUK	14	9	l940	translate-unknown	ἐλθὼν, ὁ σὲ καὶ αὐτὸν καλέσας	1	when the one who invited you and him arrives	In this culture, the host would come into the banquet hall after all the guests were seated. If the practice is different in your culture, you can use a general expression in your translation here. Alternate translation: “when the person who invited both of you sees the seating arrangements” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	14	9	ecp7	figs-idiom	ἄρξῃ μετὰ αἰσχύνης τὸν ἔσχατον τόπον κατέχειν	1	you will begin with shame to take the last place	Jesus uses the term **begin** idiomatically to suggest slowly unfolding, reluctant action.

LUK	14	9	gqa6	figs-metaphor	τὸν ἔσχατον τόπον	1	the last place	The term **last** figuratively represents being unimportant and not honored. If your culture has a way of placing people at meals to show honor, you can use that in your translation. Otherwise, you can use a general expression. Alternate translation: “a seat far from the host” or “a seat for the least important person” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	14	9	l941	figs-explicit	τὸν ἔσχατον τόπον	1	the last place	The implication is that this guest must go to the least important section of seats because all the other places have been taken in the meantime.

LUK	14	10	x5qh	figs-activepassive	ὅταν κληθῇς	1	when you are invited	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who does the action.

LUK	14	10	l942	translate-unknown	ἀνάπεσε	1	recline to eat	See how you translated this in [14:8](../14/08.md). Alternate translation: “take your place at the table” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

Alternate translation: “when the person who invited you sees where you are sitting” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	14	10	ck9k	figs-metaphor	προσανάβηθι ἀνώτερον	1	come up higher	The host speaks figuratively of the more important places at the feast being **higher** than the less important ones. Alternate translation: “move to a seat for a more important person” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	14	10	h5ee	figs-idiom	ἔσται σοι δόξα	1	there will be honor to you	This is an idiom. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state who would make this happen. Alternate translation: “your host will honor you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	14	10	l944	figs-metaphor	ἐνώπιον	1	before all those reclining to eat with you	Here, the word **before** means “in front of” or “in the presence of.” Alternate translation: “in the presence of all the other guests” or “as all the other guests are watching” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

LUK	14	12	v4uk	figs-you	ὅταν ποιῇς	1	when you make	Even though this is general advice for everyone listening, the word **you** is singular here, and **you** and **your** are singular in all of [14:12-14](../14/12.md), because Jesus is speaking directly to the Pharisee who invited him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
LUK	14	12	gmh6	figs-hyperbole	μὴ φώνει	1	do not invite	Jesus is probably not telling his host never to invite such people. Rather, this is likely a generalization that means he should invite others as well. Alternate translation: “do not invite only” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
LUK	14	12	l945	figs-metaphor	τοὺς ἀδελφούς σου…τοὺς συγγενεῖς σου	1	your brothers … your relatives	The term **brothers** probably refers figuratively to close family members, while the term **relatives** likely indicates more distant members of an extended family. Alternate translation: “your close family members … other relatives” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	14	12	l946	figs-gendernotations	τοὺς ἀδελφούς σου	1	your brothers	If **brothers** is a figurative term, then Jesus is using it in a generic sense that includes both men and women. Alternate translation: “your close family members” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
LUK	14	12	l947		μήποτε καὶ αὐτοὶ ἀντικαλέσωσίν σε	1	lest they also invite you in return	Alternate translation: “because they might feel an obligation to invite you to a banquet of their own”
LUK	14	12	l948		γένηται ἀνταπόδομά σοι	1	and repayment happen to you	Your language may require you to say who would make this happen. Alternate translation: “and they would repay you”
LUK	14	13	uc5f		κάλει	1	invite	It may be helpful to add “also” in your translation, since, as in [14:12](../14/12.md), Jesus probably does not mean to invite only these people. Alternate translation: “also invite”
LUK	14	13	abcf	figs-nominaladj	πτωχούς, ἀναπείρους, χωλούς, τυφλούς	1	the poor, the crippled, the lame, and the blind	Jesus is using these adjectives as nouns to refer to groups of people.

Rather, Jesus is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages in order to be complete. Alternate translation: “they do not have the means to repay you” or “they cannot invite you to a banquet in return” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
LUK	14	14	z4tv	figs-activepassive	ἀνταποδοθήσεται…σοι	1	it will be repaid to you	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who will do the action.

If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “In response, Jesus told this guest a story to help him understand. ‘There was a man who prepared a large banquet’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])

LUK	14	17	us3d	figs-idiom	τῇ ὥρᾳ τοῦ δείπνου	1	at the hour of the supper	Jesus is using the term **hour** figuratively to refer to a specific time. Alternate translation: “at the time for the dinner” or “when the dinner was about to begin” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

LUK	14	18	l952	figs-ellipsis	ἀπὸ μιᾶς πάντες	1	all from one	Jesus is leaving out a word that this sentence would need in many languages in order to be complete. This could mean a number of things, depending on what word is supplied, but the general sense is the same in every case: (1) “all from one mind” or “all from one voice,” that is, unanimously. Alternate translation: “all alike” (2) “all from one manner.” Alternate translation: “all in the same way” (3) “all from one time” Alternate translation: “all, as soon as the servant came to them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

LUK	14	18	l3r6	figs-explicit	ὁ πρῶτος εἶπεν αὐτῷ	1	The first said to him	While **him** refers to the servant, the implication is that this first guest was giving the servant a message for his master, since it would be the master, not the servant, who would excuse him from attending the banquet. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “The first guest whom the servant approached told him to give this message to his master” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	14	18	l953	figs-nominaladj	ὁ πρῶτος	1	The first	Jesus is using the adjective **first** as a noun in order to indicate a person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate the term with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “The first guest whom the servant approached” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
LUK	14	18	l954	figs-quotesinquotes	ἀγρὸν ἠγόρασα καὶ ἔχω ἀνάγκην ἐξελθὼν ἰδεῖν αὐτόν; ἐρωτῶ σε ἔχε με παρῃτημένον	1	‘I have bought a field, and I have need to go out to see it.

LUK	14	18	l955	figs-idiom	ἐρωτῶ σε ἔχε με παρῃτημένον	1	I ask you, have me excused	In this culture, this was a polite formula for declining a social invitation.

LUK	14	18	l956	figs-activepassive	ἔχε με παρῃτημένον	1	have me excused	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “excuse me from attending” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

LUK	14	19	l957	figs-quotesinquotes	ζεύγη βοῶν ἠγόρασα πέντε καὶ πορεύομαι δοκιμάσαι αὐτά; ἐρωτῶ σε ἔχε με παρῃτημένον	1	‘I have bought five pairs of oxen, and I am going to try them out. I ask you to have me excused’	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “that he had just bought five pairs of oxen and that he was going to try them out, so he wanted to be excused” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	14	19	cd9b	translate-unknown	ζεύγη βοῶν…πέντε	1	five pairs of oxen	**Oxen** are large cattle. In this culture, they were used in pairs to pull farming tools such as plows. Alternate translation: “five pairs of oxen to work in my fields” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

Alternate translation: “that he had just gotten married and so he could not come” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	14	20	gy6v	figs-explicitinfo	γυναῖκα ἔγημα	1	I have married a wife	In your language, it might seem that this phrase expresses unnecessary extra information. If so, you could abbreviate it. Use the expression that is most natural in your language. Alternate translation: “I have just gotten married” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo]])
LUK	14	20	l961		οὐ δύναμαι ἐλθεῖν	1	I cannot come	This is not the same polite formula that the previous two people used. This man feels he has solid grounds to decline the invitation, and he says so directly. Reflect this difference in the way your language naturally would. Alternate translation: “I will not be coming”
LUK	14	21	v7v7	figs-explicit	ὀργισθεὶς	1	becoming angry	The implication is that the host became angry with the people who had turned down his invitation, not with his servant. Alternate translation: “becoming angry with the people he had invited” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

LUK	14	21	l962	figs-nominaladj	τοὺς πτωχοὺς, καὶ ἀναπείρους, καὶ τυφλοὺς, καὶ χωλοὺς	1	the poor, and crippled, and blind, and lame	Jesus is using these adjectives as nouns to refer to groups of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate these with equivalent phrases. Alternate translation: “people who are poor, people with disabilities, people who are blind, and people who are handicapped” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
LUK	14	22	y4rb	figs-explicit	καὶ εἶπεν ὁ δοῦλος	1	And the servant said	The implication is that the servant did what the master commanded him and then came back with this report. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “After the servant went out and did that, he came back and reported” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	14	22	l963	figs-quotesinquotes	Κύριε, γέγονεν ὃ ἐπέταξας, καὶ ἔτι τόπος ἐστίν	1	‘Master, what you commanded has happened, and there is still room’	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation.

Alternate translation: “the master told the servant to go out into the roads and hedges and compel people to come in so that his house would be filled” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	14	23	n9x7	figs-metonymy	φραγμοὺς	1	hedges	The word **hedges** describes boundary fences that enclose and protect fields and buildings. They may be made of bushes and shrubs growing closely together, or they may be made of wood or stone or similar building materials. This could mean: (1) actual hedges. In that case, you could use the equivalent term in your language or a general expression. Alternate translation: “boundary fences” (2) since the term is paired with **roads**, it may figuratively mean the footpaths that run along hedges at the borders of fields. Alternate translation: “paths” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	14	23	w5w6	figs-activepassive	ἵνα γεμισθῇ μου ὁ οἶκος	1	so that my house may be filled	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who would do the action.

It is not clear why. Possibly it may be assumed that other servants have been helping and that the master is now addressing all of the servants at once. In that case, it would make sense to translate **you** using the plural form, if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
LUK	14	24	ooz4		λέγω…ὑμῖν	1	I say to you	The master says this to emphasize what he is telling his servants. Alternate translation: “I can assure you”

LUK	14	24	liz5	figs-gendernotations	τῶν ἀνδρῶν ἐκείνων	1	those men	Here, the word for **men** means “male adults,” not people in general. So it would be appropriate to use a specifically masculine term in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
LUK	14	24	n867	figs-activepassive	τῶν κεκλημένων	1	who were invited	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who did the action. Alternate translation: “whom I invited” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	14	24	hl7q	figs-metonymy	γεύσεταί μου τοῦ δείπνου	1	will taste of my supper	The master may be using the word **taste** figuratively to mean eating the meal. Alternate translation: “will enjoy the dinner that I have prepared” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	14	24	l984	figs-hyperbole	γεύσεταί μου τοῦ δείπνου	1	will taste of my supper	Alternatively, the master may be making an extreme statement for emphasis. Alternate translation: “will get even a taste of the dinner that I have prepared” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
LUK	14	24	l966		μου τοῦ δείπνου	1	my supper	By this expression, the master does not mean his own meal, but the dinner that he has prepared for others. Alternate translation: “the dinner that I have prepared”

LUK	14	25	gv94	writing-newevent	συνεπορεύοντο…αὐτῷ ὄχλοι πολλοί	1	large crowds were journeying with him	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new event in the story. Jesus is no longer at the dinner at the home of the Pharisee. He has resumed his journey to Jerusalem. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could introduce this new situation more fully. Alternate translation: “Jesus then continued on his way to Jerusalem, and large crowds were traveling with him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
LUK	14	26	l968	figs-idiom	εἴ τις ἔρχεται πρός με,	1	If anyone comes to me	This is an idiom. Alternate translation: “If anyone wants to be my disciple” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

LUK	14	26	rmt8	figs-hyperbole	οὐ μισεῖ	1	does not hate	Jesus is using the word **hate** figuratively as an exaggeration to say that his disciples are not to love other people and themselves more than they love Jesus. Alternate translation: “does not love me more than” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
LUK	14	27	pm44	figs-doublenegatives	ὅστις οὐ βαστάζει τὸν σταυρὸν αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔρχεται ὀπίσω μου, οὐ δύναται εἶναί μου μαθητής	1	Whoever does not carry his cross and come after me is not able to be my disciple	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this double negative as a positive statement. Alternate translation: “Whoever wants to be my disciple must carry his cross and follow me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
LUK	14	27	l970	figs-explicit	οὐ βαστάζει τὸν σταυρὸν αὐτοῦ	1	does not carry his cross	Jesus assumes that the crowds will know that the Romans executed some criminals by nailing them to a wooden beam with crossbar that was set upright so that the criminals would slowly suffocate. Jesus assumes that the crowds will also know that the Romans made these criminals carry these wooden crosses through the streets to the place where they were going to be executed. Alternate translation: “does not carry the wooden cross on which he will be executed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	14	27	jn5u	figs-metaphor	οὐ βαστάζει τὸν σταυρὸν αὐτοῦ	1	does not carry his cross	Jesus uses the phrase **carry his cross**, referring to this practice of execution figuratively, to say that his disciples must be people who have given up their lives to God and who are willing to suffer. Alternate translation: “does not surrender his life to God and be willing to suffer” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	14	27	l971	figs-idiom	ἔρχεται ὀπίσω μου	1	come after me	This is an idiom. Alternate translation: “follow my example” or “obey me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

Jesus is using this question as a teaching tool. Alternate translation: “If one of you wanted to build a tower, he would certainly sit down first and determine whether he had enough money to complete it.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	14	28	l972	figs-hypo	τίς γὰρ ἐξ ὑμῶν θέλων πύργον οἰκοδομῆσαι, οὐχὶ πρῶτον καθίσας, ψηφίζει τὴν δαπάνην, εἰ ἔχει εἰς ἀπαρτισμόν?	1	For which of you, desiring to build a tower, does not first sit down and calculate the cost—whether he has for completion?

LUK	14	30	l975	figs-gendernotations	οὗτος ὁ ἄνθρωπος	1	this man	Since Jesus addresses his question in [14:28](../14/28.md) to the whole crowd, his illustration envisions all of them, so the term **man** here may be generic.

LUK	14	34	tz7c	figs-parables	καλὸν οὖν τὸ ἅλας	1	Salt then is good	To help the people in the crowd understand what he has been teaching, Jesus provides an illustration.

LUK	15	intro	p1ba			0		# Luke 15 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>1. Jesus tells parables about a lost sheep, a lost coin, and a lost son (15:1-32)<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### The parable of the prodigal son<br><br>The story that Jesus tells in Luke 15:11-32 is known as The Parable of the Prodigal Son, although he does not give the story that title himself. Most interpreters understand the father in the story to represent God (the Father), the sinful younger son to represent those who repent and come to faith in Jesus, and the self-righteous older son to represent the Pharisees. In the story, the older son becomes angry at the father for forgiving the younger son’s sins. He will not even go in to the party that the father is giving to welcome the younger son home. Jesus knew that the Pharisees wanted God to think that only they were good and not forgive other people’s sins. Jesus was teaching them that they would never become part of God’s kingdom if they continued to think that way. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/forgive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])<br><br>### Sinners<br><br>When the people of Jesus’ time spoke of “sinners,” they were talking about people who did not obey the law of Moses and instead committed sins such as stealing or sexual sins. But Jesus told three parables (15:4-7, 15:8-10, and 15:11-32) to teach that the people who acknowledge that they are sinners and who repent are the people who truly please God. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/repent]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])

LUK	15	2	l987	writing-participants	διεγόγγυζον οἵ τε Φαρισαῖοι καὶ οἱ γραμματεῖς	1	both the Pharisees and the scribes were grumbling	Luke uses this phrase to reintroduce these characters into the story. While these may not be exactly the same individuals whom Jesus encountered in places such as [5:17-30](../05/17.md), the members of this group in general function as the same character throughout the story. Alternate translation: “some Pharisees and scribes were there, and they were grumbling” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
LUK	15	2	dd9b		οὗτος ἁμαρτωλοὺς προσδέχεται	1	This one receives sinners	Alternate translation: “This man lets sinners into his presence” or “This man associates with sinners”

LUK	15	4	pxm3	figs-rquestion	τίς ἄνθρωπος ἐξ ὑμῶν, ἔχων ἑκατὸν πρόβατα καὶ ἀπολέσας ἐξ αὐτῶν ἓν, οὐ καταλείπει τὰ ἐνενήκοντα ἐννέα ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ, καὶ πορεύεται ἐπὶ τὸ ἀπολωλὸς, ἕως εὕρῃ αὐτό?	1	Which man among you, having 100 sheep and having lost one of them, will not leave the 99 in the wilderness and go after the lost one until he finds it?	Jesus is using this question as a teaching tool. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate his words as a statement. Alternate translation: “If one of you had 100 sheep and lost one of them, he would certainly leave the other 99 sheep in the wilderness and go looking for the sheep that had wandered off until he found it.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

Alternate translation: “Which one of you, if you had 100 sheep … until you found it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
LUK	15	4	l990	figs-gendernotations	τίς ἄνθρωπος ἐξ ὑμῶν	1	Which man among you	This could mean: (1) while all of the Pharisees and scribes who are grumbling are probably men, Jesus is describing what any person, man or woman, would likely do in this situation, and he is telling the parable for the whole crowd to hear. So the term **man** here may be generic. Alternate translation: “Which person among you” (2) since Jesus speaks in his next parable of a woman doing something, he may be using a man and a woman in paired examples to offer a comprehensive teaching about the kingdom of God. In that case, the term **man** here would not be generic. Alternate translation: “Which of you men” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
LUK	15	5	l992	figs-123person	καὶ εὑρὼν, ἐπιτίθησιν ἐπὶ τοὺς ὤμους αὐτοῦ χαίρων	1	And having found it, he lays it on his shoulders, rejoicing	If you decided in the previous verse that your language would continue this parable in the second person, use the second person here as well.

Alternate translation: “and tells them to rejoice with him because he has found his sheep that was lost” or, if you decided to use the second person, “and you would tell them to rejoice with you because you had found your sheep that was lost” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])

LUK	15	7	abcg	figs-nominaladj	δικαίοις	1	righteous	Jesus is using the adjective **righteous** as a noun in order to indicate a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate the word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “people who are righteous” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
LUK	15	8	ly5c	figs-rquestion	τίς γυνὴ δραχμὰς ἔχουσα δέκα, ἐὰν ἀπολέσῃ δραχμὴν μίαν, οὐχὶ ἅπτει λύχνον, καὶ σαροῖ τὴν οἰκίαν, καὶ ζητεῖ ἐπιμελῶς, ἕως οὗ εὕρῃ?	1	what woman, having ten drachmas, if she would lose one drachma, would not light a lamp, and sweep the house, and seek diligently until she has found it?

LUK	15	8	l995	translate-bmoney	δραχμὰς	1	drachmas	A **drachma** was a silver coin equivalent to a day’s wage. You could try to express this amount in terms of current monetary values, but that might cause your Bible translation to become outdated and inaccurate, since those values can change over time. So instead you might state something more general or give the equivalent in wages. Alternate translation: “valuable silver coins” or “coins each worth a day’s wages” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney]])

LUK	15	12	y6uq	figs-imperative	δός μοι	1	give me	The son wanted his father to give him his inheritance immediately.

LUK	15	22	m018	figs-synecdoche	δότε δακτύλιον εἰς τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ	1	put a ring on his hand	The father figuratively says **hand** to mean one part of the hand, a finger. Alternate translation: “put a ring on his finger” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
LUK	15	22	xat6	translate-unknown	ὑποδήματα	1	sandals	In this culture, poorer people went barefoot, while more affluent people wore **sandals**. They are a type of open footwear, typically made of leather, consisting of a sole that is held onto the foot with straps. The modern equivalent in many cultures where the poor go barefoot and the more affluent have footwear would be shoes. Alternate translation: “shoes” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	15	23	m019	figs-quotesinquotes	καὶ φέρετε τὸν μόσχον τὸν σιτευτόν, θύσατε, καὶ φαγόντες εὐφρανθῶμεν	1	And bring the fattened calf, slaughter it, and let us eat and celebrate	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this so that it is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “He also told his servants to bring the calf they had been fattening and butcher it so that they could have a celebration feast” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	15	23	m020	figs-you	φέρετε…θύσατε	1	bring … slaughter	Since the father is speaking to a number of servants, the implied **you** in these imperatives would be plural. Your language may need to show that distinction explicitly. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
LUK	15	23	ll8j	translate-unknown	μόσχον τὸν σιτευτόν	1	the fattened calf	A **calf** is a young cow. People would give one of their calves special food so that it would grow well, and then, when they wanted to have a special feast, they would butcher and eat that calf. If your readers would not know what a **calf** or a cow is, or if a description of eating a cow would be offensive to them, you could use a general expression here. Alternate translation: “the young animal we have been making fat” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	15	23	t3cu	figs-explicit	θύσατε	1	kill	In this context, the term **kill** means to slaughter an animal and prepare its meat to be eaten. The implication is that the servants were also to cook the meat for the feast that the father wanted to have. Alternate translation: “butcher and cook” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	15	23	m021	figs-hendiadys	φαγόντες εὐφρανθῶμεν	1	let us eat and celebrate	The phrase **eat and celebrate** expresses a single idea by using two words connected with **and**. The word **eat** indicates how the father wants to **celebrate** his son’s homecoming. Alternate translation: “celebrate by having a feast” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
LUK	15	23	m022	figs-exclusive	φαγόντες εὐφρανθῶμεν	1	let us eat and celebrate	The word **us** includes the addressees, since the father means the whole household, including the servants to whom he is speaking. So use the inclusive form of **us** in your translation if your language marks that distinction. Other languages might say “all of us.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
LUK	15	24	m023	figs-quotesinquotes	ὅτι οὗτος ὁ υἱός μου νεκρὸς ἦν καὶ ἀνέζησεν, ἦν ἀπολωλὼς καὶ εὑρέθη	1	‘For this son of mine was dead, and has come back to life; he was lost, and has been found’	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this so that it is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “The father said that it was as if his son had died and come back to life, as if he had lost him and found him again” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	15	24	ubz3	figs-metaphor	ὁ υἱός μου νεκρὸς ἦν καὶ ἀνέζησεν	1	this son of mine was dead, and has come back to life	The father says figuratively that when his **son** was in the faraway country, it was as if he was **dead**. You could translate this as a simile or comparison if your readers might otherwise take the father’s statement to mean that the son actually had died. Alternate translation: “it was as if my son had died, but now I see he is very much alive” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	15	24	izx2	figs-metaphor	ἦν ἀπολωλὼς καὶ εὑρέθη	1	he was lost, and has been found	The father says figuratively that when his **son** was in faraway country, it was as if he was **lost** and no one knew where to find him. You could translate this as a simile or comparison if your readers might otherwise take the father’s statement to mean that the son actually had been missing. Alternate translation: “it was as if my son was missing, but now I have found him again” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	15	24	m024	figs-activepassive	εὑρέθη	1	he has been found	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who has done the action. Alternate translation: “I have found him again” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	15	24	m025	grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ ἤρξαντο εὐφραίνεσθαι	1	And they began to celebrate	**And** introduces the results of what the previous sentence described.

Alternate translation: “Then they began to celebrate” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
LUK	15	25	jd7l	grammar-connect-time-background	δὲ	1	Now	Jesus uses this word to introduce background information that will help readers understand what happens next. Alternate translation: “Now” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background]])
LUK	15	25	bk6d	figs-explicit	ἦν…ἐν ἀγρῷ	1	was in the field	The implication was that he was out in the field because he was working there.

LUK	15	25	m026	figs-explicit	ὡς ἐρχόμενος	1	as he came	Alternate translation: “as he came back home from the field” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	15	25	m027	figs-metonymy	ἤκουσεν συμφωνίας καὶ χορῶν	1	he heard music and dancing	The older son could not literally hear **dancing**, so Jesus is using the term **heard** figuratively in that case. Alternate translation: “he heard music and the sound of people dancing” or “he heard music and could tell that people were dancing” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	15	26	m028	grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ	1	And	Jesus uses this word to introduce the results of what the previous sentence described. When the older son heard these sounds, he wondered what was going on, so he called for a servant and asked him. Alternate translation: “So” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
LUK	15	26	m029	figs-explicit	ἕνα τῶν παίδων	1	one of the servants	Here the word that is translated as **servant** ordinarily means “boy.” So here it may indicate that the servant was young. Alternate translation: “a young servant” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	15	26	z51r		τί ἂν εἴη ταῦτα	1	what these things might be	Alternate translation: “what was happening”

LUK	15	27	m031	figs-metonymy	ἔθυσεν ὁ πατήρ σου τὸν μόσχον τὸν σιτευτόν	1	your father has killed the fattened calf	The father did not do this personally. Alternate translation: “your father ordered us to butcher and cook the fattened calf” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	15	27	m032	figs-metonymy	ἔθυσεν ὁ πατήρ σου τὸν μόσχον τὸν σιτευτόν	1	your father has killed the fattened calf	The implication, as the father says explicitly in [15:23](../15/23.md), was that this was in order to have a celebration. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “your father ordered us to butcher and cook the fattened calf so we could have a celebration” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	15	27	r8py	translate-unknown	τὸν μόσχον τὸν σιτευτόν	1	the fattened calf	See how you translated this in [15:23](../15/23.md). Alternate translation: “the young animal we had been making fat” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

LUK	15	28	m034	grammar-connect-logic-result	ὁ δὲ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ ἐξελθὼν, παρεκάλει αὐτόν	1	and his father came out and entreated him	Here Jesus uses the term **and** to introduce the results of what the previous sentence described. Alternate translation: “So his father came outside and pleaded with him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
LUK	15	29	m035	figs-quotesinquotes	ὁ δὲ ἀποκριθεὶς εἶπεν τῷ πατρὶ αὐτοῦ, ἰδοὺ, τοσαῦτα ἔτη δουλεύω σοι, καὶ οὐδέποτε ἐντολήν σου παρῆλθον, καὶ ἐμοὶ οὐδέποτε ἔδωκας ἔριφον, ἵνα μετὰ τῶν φίλων μου εὐφρανθῶ	1	But answering he said to his father, ‘Behold, for so many years I am slaving for you, and I have never disregarded your command, and you never gave a young goat to me so that I might celebrate with my friends’	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “But he responded to his father that even though he had been slaving for him for so many years and had never disobeyed one of his commands, his father had never given him a young goat so that he could celebrate with his friends” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	15	29	m036	figs-hendiadys	ἀποκριθεὶς εἶπεν	1	answering he said	Together the words **answering** and **said** mean that the older son said what follows in response to his father’s pleadings. Alternate translation: “he responded” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
LUK	15	29	m037	figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	Behold	The older son uses **behold** to get his father to focus his attention on what he is about to say. Alternate translation: “Now listen” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	15	29	f8w9	figs-metaphor	δουλεύω σοι	1	I am slaving for you	To emphasize how hard he believes he has worked for his father, the older son figuratively describes himself as a slave.

LUK	15	29	m038	figs-doublenegatives	οὐδέποτε ἐντολήν σου παρῆλθον	1	I have never disregarded your command	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this double negative as a positive statement.

LUK	15	29	ph4q	figs-explicit	ἔριφον	1	a young goat	A young goat was smaller and much less expensive than a fatted calf.

LUK	15	30	m039	figs-quotesinquotes	ὅτε δὲ ὁ υἱός σου οὗτος, ὁ καταφαγών σου τὸν βίον μετὰ πορνῶν ἦλθεν, ἔθυσας αὐτῷ τὸν σιτευτὸν μόσχον	1	but when this son of yours came, who has devoured your property with prostitutes, you killed for him the fattened calf	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation.

LUK	15	30	y27h		ὁ υἱός σου οὗτος	1	this son of yours	The older son refers to his brother as **this son of yours** because he does not want to be associated with him. He does not want to call him “my brother.” Alternate translation: “that other son of yours”

Alternate translation: “This first debtor told the manager that he owed 100 baths of olive oil” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	16	6	u8nh	translate-bvolume	ἑκατὸν βάτους	1	100 baths	The word **baths** is the plural of “bath,” an ancient measurement equal to about 30 liters or about 8 gallons.

LUK	16	7	pq2u	translate-bvolume	ἑκατὸν κόρους	1	100 cors	The word **cors** is the plural of “cor,” an ancient measurement equal to about one fifth of a metric ton or about ten bushels.

Alternate translation: “He said to him”

LUK	16	8	a1yq	figs-idiom	οἱ υἱοὶ τοῦ αἰῶνος τούτου	1	the sons of this age	The expression **sons of** is an idiom that means the people in view share the qualities of something. In this case, Jesus is describing people who share the values and outlook of the present world.

LUK	16	8	m063	figs-metonymy	τοῦ αἰῶνος τούτου	1	this age	The term **age** means specifically the long period of time defined by the duration of the created world and, by association, the world itself. Alternate translation: “this present world” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

It may be helpful to make this a separate sentence. Alternate translation: “And you should do something similar” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-endofstory]])
LUK	16	9	jkn7		ἑαυτοῖς ποιήσατε φίλους ἐκ τοῦ μαμωνᾶ τῆς ἀδικίας, ἵνα ὅταν ἐκλίπῃ, δέξωνται ὑμᾶς εἰς τὰς αἰωνίους σκηνάς	1	make friends for yourselves by means of unrighteous wealth, so that when it fails, they may welcome you into the eternal dwellings	The identity of these **friends** is unclear. Interpreters understand them in a variety of ways. It is also unclear whether it is these **friends** who would **welcome** someone into the **eternal dwellings** or whether the expression is indefinite, equivalent to “you will be welcomed into the eternal dwellings.” Because the meaning is unclear and it is interpreted in such a variety of ways, it might be best if your translation did not say any more about this than ULT does.
LUK	16	9	q2jb	figs-metonymy	τοῦ μαμωνᾶ τῆς ἀδικίας	1	unrighteous wealth	Here, the term **unrighteous** is an echo of the previous verse, in which Jesus described the manager by the same term.

LUK	16	10	we3j		ὁ πιστὸς ἐν ἐλαχίστῳ	1	The one who is faithful in very little	Be sure that this does not sound as if it is describing a person who is not very faithful. Alternate translation: “Someone who is trustworthy even in very small matters”
LUK	16	10	r8hz		ὁ ἐν ἐλαχίστῳ ἄδικος	1	the one who is unrighteous in very little	Be sure that this does not sound as if it is describing a person who is only infrequently unrighteous. Alternate translation: “someone who is not trustworthy even in very small matters”
LUK	16	11	tm3w	figs-metonymy	τῷ ἀδίκῳ μαμωνᾷ	1	in unrighteous wealth	See how you translated this in [16:9](../16/09.md). Alternate translation: “with the money that you have in this world” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

LUK	16	11	x2hr	figs-nominaladj	τὸ ἀληθινὸν	1	the true	Jesus is using the adjective **true** as a noun to mean wealth that is more genuine, real, or lasting than money.

Alternate translation: “genuine wealth” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])

LUK	16	13	w2sf		οὐδεὶς οἰκέτης δύναται δυσὶ κυρίοις δουλεύειν	1	No servant is able to serve two masters	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could make the subject positive and the verb negative in this expression. Alternate translation: “A servant cannot serve two masters”
LUK	16	13	msb6	figs-explicit	δυσὶ κυρίοις	1	two masters	The implication is that a servant could not meet the competing demands of two different masters at the same time with equal loyalty. Alternate translation: “two different masters equally well at the same time” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	16	13	u1lk	figs-parallelism	ἢ γὰρ τὸν ἕνα μισήσει, καὶ τὸν ἕτερον ἀγαπήσει; ἢ ἑνὸς ἀνθέξεται, καὶ τοῦ ἑτέρου καταφρονήσει	1	for either he will hate the one and he will love the other, or else he will be devoted to one and he will despise the other	Jesus is basically saying the same thing in two different ways.

LUK	16	13	pw7q	figs-you	οὐ δύνασθε…δουλεύειν	1	You are not able to serve	Even though Jesus has been describing the situation of an individual servant, as he draws this application, he is addressing his disciples as a group, so **you** is plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
LUK	16	14	taq3	grammar-connect-time-background	δὲ	1	And	Luke uses this word to introduce background information that will help readers understand what happens next. Alternate translation: “Now” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background]])
LUK	16	14	m067	writing-participants	οἱ Φαρισαῖοι	1	the Pharisees	Here Luke reintroduces **the Pharisees** as participants in the story, but they have been present all along.

LUK	16	15	m070	figs-gendernotations	ἀνθρώποις	1	men	Here, Jesus is using the term **men** in a generic sense that includes all people. Alternate translation: “people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
LUK	16	15	m071	translate-unknown	βδέλυγμα	1	is an abomination	The term **abomination** comes from the regulations for religious life in the Jewish law.

LUK	16	16	mrl3	figs-activepassive	ἡ Βασιλεία τοῦ Θεοῦ εὐαγγελίζεται	1	the kingdom of God is proclaimed as good news	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who has been doing the action.

LUK	16	16	m073	figs-abstractnouns	ἡ Βασιλεία τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	the kingdom of God	See how you decided to translate this phrase in [4:43](../04/43.md).

Anyone who divorces his wife” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

LUK	16	21	xby9	figs-explicit	οἱ κύνες	1	the dogs	The Jews considered dogs to be unclean animals. Lazarus was too sick and weak to stop them from licking his wounds, so in addition to being poor and sick, he was always ceremonially unclean.

Within the story, this feast likely represents the joys of heaven, and Jesus may be depicting Abraham, the ancestor of the Jews, as the host. In that case, Lazarus would be in a place of honor next to him. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express this explicitly. Alternate translation: “to a place of honor next to Abraham at the heavenly feast” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	16	22	hn6v	figs-activepassive	ἐτάφη	1	was buried	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “people buried him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

Alternate translation: “he shouted over to Abraham, addressing him respectfully as his ancestor, and asked him to have mercy on him and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool his tongue, because he was in a flame that was making him suffer greatly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	16	24	dpp9	figs-hendiadys	αὐτὸς φωνήσας εἶπεν	1	crying out he said	Together the terms **crying out** and **said** mean that the rich man spoke what follows as a loud cry. Alternate translation: “the rich man shouted out” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
LUK	16	24	m95a	figs-metaphor	Πάτερ Ἀβραάμ	1	Father Abraham	The rich man is using the term **Father**, which figuratively means “ancestor,” as a respectful title. Abraham was the ancestor of all the Jews. Alternate translation: “Abraham, my father” or “Abraham, my ancestor” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	16	24	b2rc	figs-imperative	ἐλέησόν με	1	have mercy on me	This is an imperative, but it should be translated as a polite request rather than as a command. It may be helpful to add an expression such as “please” to make this clear. Alternate translation: “please have pity on me” or “please help me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
LUK	16	24	ly9k		καὶ πέμψον Λάζαρον	1	and send Lazarus	Alternate translation: “by sending Lazarus” or “and tell Lazarus to come to me”

In your translation, you could indicate that this is not the most he would want Lazarus to do.

LUK	16	24	rc6x	figs-hyperbole	καὶ καταψύξῃ τὴν γλῶσσάν μου	1	and cool my tongue	The rich man is figuratively describing how thirsty he is by association with the way his **tongue** feels hot.

LUK	16	24	qix8	figs-activepassive	ὀδυνῶμαι ἐν τῇ φλογὶ ταύτῃ	1	I am tormented in this flame	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “this flame is making me suffer greatly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	16	25	m085	figs-quotesinquotes	εἶπεν δὲ Ἀβραάμ, τέκνον, μνήσθητι ὅτι ἀπέλαβες τὰ ἀγαθά σου ἐν τῇ ζωῇ σου, καὶ Λάζαρος ὁμοίως τὰ κακά. νῦν δὲ ὧδε παρακαλεῖται, σὺ δὲ ὀδυνᾶσαι	1	But Abraham said, ‘Child, remember that in your lifetime you received your good things, and Lazarus in like manner bad things. But now he is comforted here, and you are tormented	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “But Abraham, addressing the rich man as his descendant, told him to remember that he had received good things in his lifetime, while Lazarus had received bad things in his lifetime, but now Lazarus was receiving comforts with him, while the rich man was suffering greatly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	16	25	m086	figs-metaphor	τέκνον	1	Child	Abraham is using the term **child** figuratively to mean “descendant.” As a Jew, the rich man was a descendant of Abraham. Abraham is likely using the term in a compassionate way. Alternate translation: “My dear child” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	16	25	we9w	figs-nominaladj	τὰ ἀγαθά σου	1	the good of yours	Abraham is using the adjective **good** as a noun. It is plural.

LUK	16	25	rv17		ὁμοίως	1	likewise	Abraham is referring to the fact that both men received something while they lived on earth. He is not saying that what they received was the same. Alternate translation: “while he was living received”

LUK	16	26	m087	figs-quotesinquotes	καὶ ἐν πᾶσι τούτοις, μεταξὺ ἡμῶν καὶ ὑμῶν χάσμα μέγα ἐστήρικται, ὅπως οἱ θέλοντες διαβῆναι ἔνθεν πρὸς ὑμᾶς μὴ δύνωνται, μηδὲ ἐκεῖθεν πρὸς ἡμᾶς διαπερῶσιν	1	And with all these things, between us and you a great chasm has been put in place, so that those who want to cross over from here to you are not able, and none may cross over from there to us	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “Abraham also told him that God had placed a huge pit between them, so that no one who wanted to cross over to where the rich man was, and no one who wanted to come over from there to where Abraham was, would be able to do that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	16	26	af4h	figs-idiom	καὶ ἐν πᾶσι τούτοις	1	And with all these things	This is an idiom. Alternate translation: “In addition to this reason” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	16	26	m088	figs-exclusive	ἡμῶν…ἡμᾶς	1	us … us	Abraham means himself and the people who are with him, but not the rich man, so **us** is exclusive in both instances in this verse, if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
LUK	16	26	m089	figs-you	ὑμῶν…ὑμᾶς	1	you … you	Even though Abraham is speaking to the rich man individually, he is referring to all of the people who are in Hades with him, so **you** is plural in both instances in this verse.

LUK	16	26	tu5w	figs-activepassive	χάσμα μέγα ἐστήρικται	1	a great chasm has been set in place	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who has done the action.

LUK	16	26	sg6d	figs-ellipsis	μηδὲ ἐκεῖθεν πρὸς ἡμᾶς διαπερῶσιν	1	and that they may not go across from there to us	Abraham is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could supply these words from earlier in the sentence. Alternate translation: “and so that those who want to come across from where you are to where we are will not be able to do that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
LUK	16	27	abcj	figs-quotesinquotes	εἶπεν δέ, ἐρωτῶ οὖν σε Πάτερ, ἵνα πέμψῃς αὐτὸν εἰς τὸν οἶκον τοῦ πατρός μου	1	Then he said, ‘I beg you then, Father, that you would send him to the house of my father	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “So the rich man then begged Abraham, addressing him respectfully as his ancestor, to send Lazarus to his family” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	16	27	m090	figs-metaphor	Πάτερ	1	Father	The rich man is using the term **Father**, which figuratively means “ancestor,” as a respectful title. Alternate translation: “Abraham, my father” or “Abraham, my ancestor” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	16	27	m091	figs-metonymy	εἰς τὸν οἶκον τοῦ πατρός μου	1	to the house of my father	The rich man is using the word **house** figuratively to mean the people who live together in a household. Alternate translation: “to my family” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

It may be helpful to make this a separate sentence. Alternate translation: “The rich man explained that he had five brothers and that he wanted Lazarus to warn them so that they would not also come to where he was, in a place where they would suffer greatly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	16	28	x8xk	figs-explicit	ὅπως διαμαρτύρηται αὐτοῖς	1	in order that he might warn them	The implication is that the rich man wanted Lazarus to warn his brothers not to act as he had. He had been selfish, self-indulgent, and unconcerned about the needs of people around him who were poor and suffering. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “so that he can warn them not to be self-indulgent and callous, as I was” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	16	29	m092		λέγει δὲ Ἀβραάμ	1	But Abraham says	To call attention to a significant development in the story, Jesus uses the present tense in past narration here. See how you decided to approach this usage in [7:40](../07/40.md). If it would not be natural to use the present tense in your language, you can use the past tense in your translation. Alternate translation: “But Abraham said”
LUK	16	29	m093	figs-quotesinquotes	λέγει δὲ Ἀβραάμ, ἔχουσι Μωϋσέα καὶ τοὺς προφήτας; ἀκουσάτωσαν αὐτῶν	1	But Abraham says, ‘They have Moses and the prophets; let them listen to them’	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation.

Alternate translation: “No, I will not do that, because your brothers have what Moses and the prophets have written” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	16	29	x8pt	figs-metonymy	Μωϋσέα καὶ τοὺς προφήτας	1	Moses and the prophets	Abraham is using the names of the authors of the biblical books to refer figuratively to their writings. Alternate translation: “what Moses and the prophets have written” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

LUK	16	29	m095	figs-explicit	ἀκουσάτωσαν αὐτῶν	1	let them listen to them	The implication is that the rich man’s brothers do not need Lazarus to come and warn them, because in the Scriptures they already have all the warning they need. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “your brothers should obey their teaching, because it provides all the warning they need” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	16	30	m096	figs-quotesinquotes	ὁ δὲ εἶπεν, οὐχί, Πάτερ Ἀβραάμ, ἀλλ’ ἐάν τις ἀπὸ νεκρῶν πορευθῇ πρὸς αὐτοὺς, μετανοήσουσιν	1	But he replied, ‘No, Father Abraham, but if someone would go to them from the dead, they will repent.’	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “But the rich man told Abraham, addressing him respectfully as his ancestor, that his brothers would not repent based on the teaching of the Scriptures, but that if someone came to them from the dead, then they would repent” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	16	30	m097	figs-explicit	οὐχί	1	No	The rich man uses this word to indicate that what Abraham has just said is not true.

Alternate translation: “suppose someone who had died went and warned them. Then they would repent” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
LUK	16	30	m098	figs-nominaladj	ἀπὸ νεκρῶν	1	from the dead	The rich man is using the adjective **dead** as a noun in order to indicate a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this with an equivalent expression.

LUK	16	31	abcl	figs-quotesinquotes	εἶπεν δὲ αὐτῷ, εἰ Μωϋσέως καὶ τῶν προφητῶν οὐκ ἀκούουσιν, οὐδ’ ἐάν τις ἐκ νεκρῶν ἀναστῇ, πεισθήσονται	1	But he said to him, ‘If they do not hear Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded if someone would rise from the dead’	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “But Abraham told the rich man that if his brothers would not obey the teaching of Moses and the prophets, then they would not change their ways even if someone who had died came back to life and warned them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])

If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, and if your readers might misunderstand and think that what Abraham is saying is not actually the case, then you can translate his words as an affirmative statement. Alternate translation: “Since they will not obey the teaching of Moses and the prophets, a dead person who came back to life would not be able to convince them either” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
LUK	16	31	m099	figs-idiom	εἰ Μωϋσέως καὶ τῶν προφητῶν οὐκ ἀκούουσιν	1	If they do not listen to Moses and the prophets	The term **listen to** is an idiom that means “obey.” See how you translated this idiom in [16:29](../16/29.md).

LUK	17	intro	c4am			0		# Luke 17 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>1. Jesus teaches about forgiveness, faith, and service (17:1-10)<br>2. Jesus heals ten lepers (17:11-19)<br>3. Jesus teaches about the kingdom of God coming (17:20-37)<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Old Testament Examples<br><br>Jesus uses Noah and Lot’s wife as examples to teach his followers. Noah was ready for the flood when it came, and followers of Jesus need to be ready for him to return, because he will not warn them when he is about to come. Lot’s wife loved the evil city she had been living in so much that God also punished her when he destroyed it. Followers of Jesus need to love him more than anything else. You may need to provide some background information that Jesus assumed his listeners would know so that people who read your translation today can understand what Jesus is teaching here.<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Rhetorical Questions<br><br>Jesus asks his disciples three questions in (17:7-9) to teach them that even those who serve him well are righteous only because of his grace. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/grace]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Paradox<br><br>A paradox is a statement that describes two things that seem as if they cannot both be true at the same time, but which actually are both true. Jesus speaks a paradox in this chapter: “Whoever seeks to gain his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life will save it” (17:33).<br><br>## Important textual issues in this chapter<br><br>### “In his day”<br><br>At the end of 17:24, some ancient manuscripts of the Bible have the phrase “in his day,” but the manuscripts considered to be the most accurate do not. ULT does not have the phrase in its text, but it does have it in a footnote.<br><br>### “There will be two in the field”<br><br>Some ancient manuscripts of the Bible include the verse 17:36, but the manuscripts considered to be the most accurate do not. ULT does not have this verse in its text, but it does have it in a footnote.<br><br>In both of these cases, if a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to include the verse if it does, but leave it out if it does not include it. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to follow the example of ULT. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
LUK	17	1	ej1e	figs-doublenegatives	ἀνένδεκτόν ἐστιν τοῦ τὰ σκάνδαλα μὴ ἐλθεῖν	1	It is impossible for traps not to come	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this double negative as a positive statement. Alternate translation: “Traps will certainly come” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
LUK	17	1	m102	translate-unknown	τὰ σκάνδαλα	1	traps	The term **traps** refers to a device that a person or animal would unknowingly activate and that would then confine them in a net, cage, or pit.

LUK	17	1	m103	figs-metaphor	τὰ σκάνδαλα	1	traps	Jesus is using the word **traps** figuratively. Alternate translation: “temptations” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	17	1	zck5	figs-ellipsis	οὐαὶ δι’ οὗ ἔρχεται!	1	woe through whom they come!	Jesus is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. Alternate translation: “how terrible it will be for anyone who causes these temptations to come” or “how terrible it will be for any person who tempts others to sin” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
LUK	17	2	dvz5	figs-explicit	λυσιτελεῖ αὐτῷ εἰ	1	It would be better for him if	Jesus is drawing a comparison to the punishment for causing people to sin. He means that this person’s punishment for causing people to sin will be worse than if he had drowned in the sea. No one would actually put a stone around his neck and throw him into the sea as an alternative to that punishment, and Jesus is not saying that anyone will do so. Alternate translation: “The punishment he will receive will be worse than if” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	17	2	uk6e	figs-explicit	λίθος μυλικὸς περίκειται περὶ τὸν τράχηλον αὐτοῦ	1	a millstone were lying around his neck	The implication is that someone would tie the stone around the person’s neck. Alternate translation: “if someone were to attach a millstone around his neck” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	17	2	gr89	translate-unknown	λίθος μυλικὸς	1	a millstone	A **millstone** is a very large, heavy, circular stone that is used for grinding grain into flour.

LUK	17	2	xm7x	figs-metaphor	τῶν μικρῶν τούτων	1	these little ones	This could be: (1) a reference to children who love Jesus and who are physically **little** compared to adults.

Alternate translation: “these new believers” or (3) a figurative reference to people who are not important from a human perspective. Alternate translation: “these common people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	17	3	m104	figs-explicit	προσέχετε ἑαυτοῖς	1	Pay attention to yourselves	Since Jesus is teaching about how important it is not to sin and not to encourage others to sin, the implication is that this statement means that he wants his disciples to help one another not to sin. Alternate translation: “Help one another not to sin” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	17	3	m105	figs-you	προσέχετε	1	Pay attention	The implied “you” in this imperative is plural, since Jesus is speaking to his disciples. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
LUK	17	3	m106	figs-youcrowd	σου…ἐπιτίμησον…ἄφες	1	your … rebuke … forgive	The word **your** and the implied “you” in the imperatives **rebuke** and **forgive** are singular, since Jesus is addressing an individual situation, even though he is speaking to a group. If these singular forms would not be natural in your language for someone who was speaking to a group of people, you could use plural forms in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd]])
LUK	17	3	hyn8	grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical	ἐὰν ἁμάρτῃ ὁ ἀδελφός σου, ἐπιτίμησον αὐτῷ	1	If your brother sins, rebuke him	Jesus is describing a hypothetical situation in order to tell his disciples what they should do if it takes place. Alternate translation: “Suppose a fellow believer were to sin. Then you should rebuke him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical]])
LUK	17	3	kkp3	figs-metaphor	ὁ ἀδελφός σου	1	your brother	Jesus is using the term **brother** figuratively to mean someone who shares the same faith. Alternate translation: “a fellow believer” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	17	3	m107	figs-gendernotations	ὁ ἀδελφός σου	1	your brother	Although the term **brother** is masculine, Jesus is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women. Alternate translation: “a fellow believer” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
LUK	17	3	p35i		ἐπιτίμησον αὐτῷ	1	rebuke him	Alternate translation: “correct him” or “tell him strongly that what he did was wrong”
LUK	17	3	m108	grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical	καὶ ἐὰν μετανοήσῃ, ἄφες αὐτῷ	1	and if he repents, forgive him	Jesus is describing another hypothetical situation in order to tell his disciples what they should do if it takes place.

LUK	17	4	m110	figs-youcrowd	σὲ…σὲ…ἀφήσεις	1	you … you … you will forgive	The word **you** is singular in this verse, since Jesus is addressing an individual situation, even though he is speaking to a group. If these singular forms would not be natural in your language for someone who was speaking to a group of people, you could use plural forms in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd]])
LUK	17	4	m111	figs-quotesinquotes	ἐπιστρέψῃ πρὸς σὲ, λέγων μετανοῶ, ἀφήσεις αὐτῷ	1	returns to you, saying, ‘I repent,’ you will forgive him	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation.

LUK	17	4	m112	figs-declarative	ἀφήσεις αὐτῷ	1	you will forgive him	Jesus is using a future statement to give an instruction and command. Alternate translation: “you must forgive him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative]])

LUK	17	6	m117	figs-you	ἔχετε…ἐλέγετε…ὑμῖν	1	you had … you would say … you	Even though Jesus is describing something that an individual might do, **you** is plural in this verse because he is speaking to his 12 apostles in response to their request. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
LUK	17	6	ep7z	figs-simile	εἰ ἔχετε πίστιν ὡς κόκκον σινάπεως	1	If you had faith like a mustard seed	A **mustard seed** is a very small seed.

LUK	17	6	m118	translate-unknown	κόκκον σινάπεως	1	a mustard seed	If your readers would not be familiar with a **mustard seed**, you could use the name of another small seed with which they would be familiar, or you could use a general expression.

LUK	17	6	i31l	translate-unknown	συκαμίνῳ	1	mulberry tree	Jesus likely uses a **mulberry tree** as an example because it has an extensive root system that makes it very difficult to uproot. If your readers would not be familiar with this tree, you could use the name of another type of tree with extensive roots that they would be familiar with, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “firmly rooted tree” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

Jesus is using the question form to teach his disciples. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation.

LUK	17	7	va34	figs-explicit	δοῦλον…ἀροτριῶντα ἢ ποιμαίνοντα	1	a servant plowing or tending sheep	It may be helpful to say explicitly that the land and sheep hypothetically belong to the person who is being asked to consider what he would do in this situation.

Jesus uses a second question as a further teaching tool, to emphasize how a person actually would treat a servant. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate his words as a statement. Alternate translation: “he would certainly say to him, ‘Prepare something for me to eat, and then wrap your robe around your hips so you can serve me while I eat and drink, and after that you yourself can eat and drink’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation.

The first word of this sentence in Greek is a negative word that can be used to turn a statement into a question that expects a negative answer. ULT shows this by adding, **does he?** Your language may have other ways of asking a question that expects a negative answer, for example, by changing the word order of a positive statement. Alternate translation: “Would he thank the servant for doing what he had been commanded to do?” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
LUK	17	9	m125	figs-explicit	μὴ ἔχει χάριν τῷ δούλῳ, ὅτι ἐποίησεν τὰ διαταχθέντα?	1	He does not have gratitude to the servant because he did the things commanded, does he?

LUK	17	9	jn5s	figs-rquestion	μὴ ἔχει χάριν τῷ δούλῳ, ὅτι ἐποίησεν τὰ διαταχθέντα?	1	He does not have gratitude to the servant because he did the things commanded, does he?	Jesus is using the question form to teach. He wants his disciples to reflect on the nature of the master-servant relationship in order to understand better how they should relate to God.

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
LUK	17	10	dga7	figs-hyperbole	δοῦλοι ἀχρεῖοί ἐσμεν	1	We are worthless servants	This is an exaggeration that means the servants have not done anything worthy of praise or thanks or a special reward.

Alternate translation: “Jesus was traveling along the border between Samaria and Galilee” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
LUK	17	12	d9mg	writing-participants	ἀπήντησαν δέκα λεπροὶ ἄνδρες	1	ten men who were lepers met him	Luke uses this phrase to introduce these new characters into the story. Alternate translation: “ten men who were lepers came out to meet him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
LUK	17	12	i1sc	figs-explicit	οἳ ἔστησαν πόρρωθεν	1	who stood at a distance	The **lepers** were not reluctant to engage Jesus. Rather, this was a respectful gesture, since they were not allowed to approach other people. According to the law of Moses, they were ceremonially unclean for as long as they had a skin disease. Luke assumes that his readers will know that, but if it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate it explicitly. It may be helpful to make this a separate sentence. Alternate translation: “They stood at a distance, as they were required to do because they were ceremonially unclean” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	17	13	l1j4	figs-idiom	αὐτοὶ ἦραν φωνὴν	1	they lifted up their voice	This idiom means that they spoke loudly. Alternate translation: “they called out in loud voices” or “they shouted out” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	17	13	m134		αὐτοὶ ἦραν φωνὴν	1	they lifted up their voice	If it would be unusual in your language for someone to speak as if a group of people had only one **voice**, you can use the plural form here. Alternate translation: “they called out in loud voices”
LUK	17	13	fsn5	figs-imperative	ἐλέησον ἡμᾶς	1	have mercy on us	This is an imperative, but it should be translated as a polite request, rather than as a command.

LUK	17	13	m135	figs-explicit	ἐλέησον ἡμᾶς	1	have mercy on us	The ten lepers assume that Jesus will know that they are specifically asking to be healed. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “please have mercy on us and heal us” or “please be merciful to us by healing us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	17	14	mrx8	figs-explicit	πορευθέντες ἐπιδείξατε ἑαυτοὺς τοῖς ἱερεῦσιν	1	Go show yourselves to the priests	People who had been lepers but who had been healed were required under the law of Moses to have the priests verify that fact. So the implication of this command is that Jesus is healing the men. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “You are healed. Now go and show yourselves to the priests so they can verify that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	17	14	m137	writing-newevent	καὶ ἐγένετο	1	And it happened that	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a significant development in the episode. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for this purpose. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
LUK	17	14	jpk2	figs-activepassive	ἐκαθαρίσθησαν	1	they were cleansed	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form, and you can state who did the action. Alternate translation: “God healed them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	17	14	m138	figs-explicit	ἐκαθαρίσθησαν	1	they were cleansed	Luke uses the term **cleansed** for the healing of these lepers because when they were healed, they were no longer ceremonially unclean. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “God healed them and so they were no longer ceremonially unclean” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	17	15	tdt1	figs-activepassive	ἰδὼν ὅτι ἰάθη	1	seeing that he had been healed	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form, and you can state who did the action.

LUK	17	17	m140	figs-hendiadys	ἀποκριθεὶς δὲ ὁ Ἰησοῦς εἶπεν	1	Then Jesus answering said	Together the two words **answering** and **said** mean that Jesus spoke in response to the Samaritan man coming back to thank him. Alternate translation: “Jesus responded” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
LUK	17	17	hfa2	figs-explicit	ἀποκριθεὶς δὲ ὁ Ἰησοῦς εἶπεν	1	Then Jesus answering said	Jesus responded to what the man did, but he did so by speaking about the man to the group of people around him, rather than to the man directly.

LUK	17	17	m141	figs-activepassive	οὐχὶ οἱ δέκα ἐκαθαρίσθησαν?	1	Were not the ten cleansed?

LUK	17	17	cvb2	figs-rquestion	οὐχὶ οἱ δέκα ἐκαθαρίσθησαν?	1	Were not the ten cleansed?	Jesus is using the question form for emphasis, to show the people around him how surprised and disappointed he is that only one of the ten men whom he healed came back to thank and praise God.

Alternate translation: “I know that I healed ten men of their leprosy.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	17	17	w8y3	figs-rquestion	οἱ δὲ ἐννέα ποῦ?	1	But where are the nine?	Jesus is not asking the crowd to tell him where the other nine men are. He is using the question form for emphasis. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate his words as a statement or exclamation. Alternate translation: “The other nine men should have come back too!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	17	18	m142	grammar-connect-exceptions	οὐχ εὑρέθησαν ὑποστρέψαντες δοῦναι δόξαν τῷ Θεῷ, εἰ μὴ ὁ ἀλλογενὴς οὗτος	1	Were they not found returning to give glory to God except this foreigner	If, in your language, it would appear that Jesus was making a statement here and then contradicting it, you could reword this to avoid using an exception clause. Alternate translation: “Was this foreigner the only one who returned to give glory to God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-exceptions]])
LUK	17	18	rxh9	figs-rquestion	οὐχ εὑρέθησαν ὑποστρέψαντες δοῦναι δόξαν τῷ Θεῷ, εἰ μὴ ὁ ἀλλογενὴς οὗτος?	1	Were they not found returning to give glory to God except this foreigner?	Jesus is using the question form for emphasis. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate his words as a statement or exclamation.

LUK	17	18	m143	writing-pronouns	οὐχ εὑρέθησαν ὑποστρέψαντες	1	Were they not found returning	The pronoun **they** refers to the lepers who were healed. Alternate translation: “Did none of the lepers I healed return” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])

LUK	17	18	x64q	figs-explicit	ὁ ἀλλογενὴς οὗτος	1	this foreigner	Samaritans had non-Jewish ancestors, and they did not worship God in the same way that the Jews did. The implication is that some of the lepers in the group were Jews, and Jesus would have expected them to return to give thanks to God.

Alternate translation: “this foreigner, when the Jewish men should certainly have returned to thank God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	17	19	n2ce	figs-abstractnouns	ἡ πίστις σου σέσωκέν σε	1	Your faith has saved you	If your readers would misunderstand the abstract noun **faith**, you could express the idea behind it with a verb such as “believe.” Alternate translation: “Because you believed, that has saved you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
LUK	17	19	m196	figs-explicit	ἡ πίστις σου σέσωκέν σε	1	Your faith has saved you	While the word **saved** can mean “healed,” as in [7:3](../07/03.md) and [8:48](../08/48.md), that does not seem to be the meaning here. Since all ten of the lepers were healed, but only this man demonstrated that he believed, Jesus seems to be saying that beyond being healed, he received salvation through faith. Alternate translation: “Because you believed, you have received salvation” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	17	19	m146	figs-personification	ἡ πίστις σου σέσωκέν σε	1	Your faith has saved you	Jesus speaks figuratively of the leper’s **faith** as if it had actively saved him.

LUK	17	28	m170	figs-ellipsis	καθὼς ἐγένετο ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις Λώτ	1	just as it happened in the days of Lot	Jesus is drawing another analogy like the one in [17:27](../17/27.md), but in this case he does not specify the object of the comparison right away. He does not do so explicitly until [17:30](../17/30.md). If it would be helpful to your readers, you could supply that information here.

Housetops were used for a variety of purposes, such as storing and ripening grain and fruit, sleeping in hot weather, and gathering in a large open space. If housetops or roofs are different in your culture and your readers would not understand that Jesus is speaking of someone doing an ordinary activity, you could use a general expression in your translation.

LUK	17	34	j3b6	figs-hypo	ταύτῃ τῇ νυκτὶ ἔσονται δύο ἐπὶ κλίνης μιᾶς	1	in that night there will be two in one bed	Jesus is speaking of a hypothetical situation that might occur at this time. It may be helpful to make this a separate sentence. Alternate translation: “Suppose this were to happen at night, and suppose there were two people sleeping in the same bed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
LUK	17	34	at99	translate-unknown	ἐπὶ κλίνης μιᾶς	1	in one bed	If your readers would not be familiar with what a **bed** is, you could use the name of the sleeping furniture that people in your own culture use, or you could use a general expression.

LUK	17	34	e9hj	figs-activepassive	ὁ εἷς παραλημφθήσεται, καὶ ὁ ἕτερος ἀφεθήσεται	1	The one will be taken and the other will be left	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could use active forms for both of these verbs, and you can state who would do the actions. This could mean: (1) the person who is **taken** may be one whom God takes out of a situation in which they would be destroyed, as God brought Lot out of Sodom, and the person who is **left** may be one who remains in a situation where they will be destroyed, like the people who remained in Sodom. That is the interpretation of UST. Alternate translation: “God will spare one of them but destroy the other” (2) in the parallel to this passage in the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus says that the people living in Noah’s time “knew nothing until the flood came and took them all away” (Matthew 24:39 ULT). So the person who is **taken** may actually be one whom God destroys, and the one who is **left** may be one whom God spares and allows to remain alive. Alternate translation: “God will destroy one of them but spare the other” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	17	34	m183	figs-hypo	ὁ εἷς παραλημφθήσεται	1	The one will be taken	If you translated the first sentence in this verse as the condition of a hypothetical situation, translate this sentence as the result of that condition. Alternate translation: “Then one of them will be taken” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
LUK	17	35	il9v	figs-hypo	ἔσονται δύο ἀλήθουσαι ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτό	1	There will be two grinding together	Jesus is speaking of a hypothetical situation that might occur at this time. It may be helpful to make this a separate sentence. Alternate translation: “Suppose that when this happens, two women are grinding grain together” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
LUK	17	35	m184		δύο	1	two	The verb is feminine, so this means “two women.” (In [17:34](../17/34.md) and [17:36](../17/36.md), grammatically masculine forms are used, but conventionally in Greek that means that the people are not known to be all women; they could be men or women, so a general term such as “people” would be appropriate in those verses.) Alternate translation: “two women”
LUK	17	35	t4zn	translate-unknown	ἀλήθουσαι	1	grinding	The term **grinding** refers to the process of breaking up grain into very small pieces so that it can be used for cooking. If your readers would not be familiar with grain, you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “grinding grain” or “preparing food” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	17	35	m185	figs-activepassive	ἡ μία παραλημφθήσεται, ἡ δὲ ἑτέρα ἀφεθήσεται	1	The one will be taken, but the other will be left	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could use active forms for both of these verbs, and you can state who would do the actions. See how you decided to translate this in [17:34](../17/34.md). Alternate translation: “God will spare one of them but destroy the other” or “God will destroy one of them but spare the other” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	17	35	m186	figs-hypo	ἡ μία παραλημφθήσεται	1	The one will be taken	If you translated the first sentence in this verse as the condition of a hypothetical situation, translate this sentence as the result of that condition. Alternate translation: “Then one of them will be taken” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
LUK	17	36	m187	translate-textvariants	δύο ἐν ἀγρῷ εἰς παραληφθήσεται καὶ ὁ ἕτερος ἀφεθήσεται	1	There will be two in the field; one will be taken and the other will be left	See the discussion of textual issues at the end of the General Notes to this chapter to decide whether to include this verse in your translation. The notes below discuss translation issues in the verse, for those who decide to include it. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
LUK	17	36	m188	figs-hypo	δύο ἐν ἀγρῷ	1	There will be two in the field	Jesus is speaking of a hypothetical situation that might occur at this time. It may be helpful to make this a separate sentence. Alternate translation: “Suppose that when this happens, two people are out working in a field” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
LUK	17	36	m189	figs-activepassive	εἰς παραληφθήσεται καὶ ὁ ἕτερος ἀφεθήσεται	1	one will be taken and the other will be left	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could use active forms for both of these verbs, and you can state who would do the actions. See how you decided to translate this in [17:34](../17/34.md). Alternate translation: “God will spare one of them but destroy the other” or “God will destroy one of them but spare the other” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	17	36	m190	figs-hypo	εἰς παραληφθήσεται	1	one will be taken	If you translated the beginning of this verse as the condition of a hypothetical situation, translate this as the result of that condition, as a separate sentence. Alternate translation: “Then one of them will be taken” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
LUK	17	37	m191		ἀποκριθέντες λέγουσιν αὐτῷ	1	answering they say to him	To convey the vividness and immediacy of the disciples’ question, Luke uses the present tense in past narration here. See how you decided to approach this usage in [7:40](../07/40.md). If it would not be natural to use the present tense in your language, you can use the past tense in your translation. Alternate translation: “the disciples responded to him”
LUK	17	37	m192	figs-hendiadys	ἀποκριθέντες λέγουσιν αὐτῷ	1	answering they say to him	Together the two words **answering** and **say** mean that the disciples responded to what Jesus had been telling them by asking him a question about it. Alternate translation: “the disciples responded to him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
LUK	17	37	wmg6	figs-explicit	ποῦ, Κύριε	1	Where, Lord	The implication is that the disciples are asking where the things that Jesus has been describing will happen. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “Lord, where will these things happen” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	17	37	fen1	writing-proverbs	ὅπου τὸ σῶμα, ἐκεῖ καὶ οἱ ἀετοὶ ἐπισυναχθήσονται	1	Where the body is, there also the vultures will be gathered together	Jesus may be quoting a popular proverb of the time. Alternate translation: “The location will be obvious from the things that you see happening there” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-proverbs]])
LUK	17	37	m193	figs-metaphor	ὅπου τὸ σῶμα, ἐκεῖ καὶ οἱ ἀετοὶ ἐπισυναχθήσονται	1	Where the body is, there also the vultures will be gathered together	In this proverb, **the body** and **the vultures** are figurative. If you would like to present the same image to your readers but your language does not use metaphors, you could express this as a simile. Alternate translation: “Just as vultures gather where there is a dead body, so the things I have described will indicate where this is about to happen” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	17	37	m6ca	translate-unknown	οἱ ἀετοὶ	1	the vultures	The word **vultures** describes large birds that travel in flocks and eat the flesh of dead animals that they find. If your readers would not be familiar with **vultures**, you could use the name of similar birds in your area, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “the scavenger birds” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	17	37	m194	figs-activepassive	ἐπισυναχθήσονται	1	will be gathered together	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “will flock together” or “will assemble” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	18	intro	v92v			0		# Luke 18 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>1. Jesus tells a parable about a widow and a judge (18:1-8)<br>2. Jesus tells a parable about a Pharisee and a tax collector (18:9-14)<br>3. Jesus blesses little children (18:15-17)<br>4. Jesus teaches about wealth and the kingdom of God (18:18-30)<br>5. Jesus warns about his impending death (18:31-34)<br>6. Jesus heals a blind man in Jericho (18:35-43)<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Judges<br><br>People expected judges always to do what God said was right and to make sure that other people did what was right. But some judges did not care about doing right or making sure others did right. Jesus called this kind of judge “unjust.” (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/justice]])<br><br>### Pharisees and tax collectors<br><br>The Pharisees thought that they themselves were the best examples of good, righteous people, and they thought that tax collectors were the most unrighteous of sinners. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])<br><br>## Important textual issues in this chapter<br><br>### “that he had become sad”<br><br>At the beginning of 18:24, in the story of the ruler who asked Jesus how he could have eternal life, some ancient manuscripts of the Bible say that Jesus saw “that he had become sad.” However, the ancient manuscripts considered to be the most accurate do not have that phrase. They say simply that Jesus looked at him. ULT does not have the phrase in its text, but it does have it in a footnote.<br><br>### “we have left everything”<br><br>In 18:28, in some ancient manuscripts of the Bible, Peter says that the disciples have left “everything” to follow Jesus. In other manuscripts, the expression is “our own possessions.” ULT says “everything” in its text, but it acknowledges the variant “our own possessions” in a footnote.<br><br>In each of these cases, if a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to follow its reading. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to follow the example of ULT. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
LUK	18	1	r26t	figs-parables	ἔλεγεν δὲ παραβολὴν αὐτοῖς, πρὸς τὸ	1	Then he spoke a parable to them to show that	Alternate translation: “Then Jesus told his disciples this story to help them understand that it was necessary” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])
LUK	18	2	l2qr		λέγων	1	saying	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “He said”
LUK	18	2	ph5w	writing-participants	κριτής τις ἦν ἔν τινι πόλει	1	In a certain city there was a certain judge	Jesus uses this phrase to introduce one of the main characters in this parable. Alternate translation: “There once was a judge who lived in a certain city” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
LUK	18	2	d77j	writing-background	τὸν Θεὸν μὴ φοβούμενος καὶ ἄνθρωπον μὴ ἐντρεπόμενος	1	not fearing God and not respecting men	Jesus provides this background information about the **judge** to help his disciples understand what happens in the story. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “He did not make his decisions based on what God wanted or on what other people thought” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
LUK	18	2	m195	figs-gendernotations	ἄνθρωπον	1	men	Here, Jesus is using the term **men** in a generic sense that includes all people. Alternate translation: “other people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
LUK	18	3	ie2v	writing-participants	χήρα δὲ ἦν ἐν τῇ πόλει ἐκείνῃ	1	And there was a widow in that city	Jesus uses this phrase to introduce the other main character into the story. Alternate translation: “There was also a woman who lived in that city whose husband had died” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
LUK	18	3	jhk6	figs-explicit	χήρα	1	a widow	A widow is a woman whose husband has died and who has not remarried. Jesus assumes that his disciples will know that in this culture, she would have had no one to protect her from anyone who was trying to take advantage of her. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “a woman whose husband had died, and so she had no one to protect her” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	18	3	xfg3		ἤρχετο πρὸς αὐτὸν	1	she was coming to him	Here the Greek verb indicates repeated or continual action. Alternate translation: “she kept coming to the judge”
LUK	18	3	m131	figs-quotesinquotes	λέγουσα, ἐκδίκησόν με ἀπὸ τοῦ ἀντιδίκου μου	1	saying, ‘Vindicate me against my opponent’	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “and asking him to make a fair ruling in her case against her opponent” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	18	3	kj2l	figs-imperative	ἐκδίκησόν με ἀπὸ τοῦ ἀντιδίκου μου	1	Vindicate me against my opponent	This is an imperative, but since the woman is not in a position to make a demand, it should be translated as a polite request rather than as a command. It may be helpful to add an expression such as “please” to make this clear. Alternate translation: “Please give me a fair ruling in my case against my opponent” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
LUK	18	3	xc7k	translate-unknown	τοῦ ἀντιδίκου μου	1	my opponent	The term **opponent** refers specifically to the opposing party in a lawsuit. It is not clear whether the widow is suing the man to protect her interests, or the man is suing the widow to try to take things from her unfairly. If your language has a specific term for a legal adversary, you can use it here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	18	4	m197		μετὰ ταῦτα	1	after these things	Alternate translation: “later on” or “eventually”
LUK	18	4	m198	figs-quotesinquotes	εἶπεν ἐν ἑαυτῷ, εἰ καὶ τὸν Θεὸν οὐ φοβοῦμαι οὐδὲ ἄνθρωπον ἐντρέπομαι	1	he said to himself, ‘Even if I do not fear God or respect man’	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “he decided that even though he did not make his decisions based on what God wanted or on what other people thought” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	18	4	m199	grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἰ καὶ τὸν Θεὸν οὐ φοβοῦμαι οὐδὲ ἄνθρωπον ἐντρέπομαι	1	Even if I do not fear God or respect man	The judge speaks as if this were a hypothetical possibility, but he means that it is actually true. If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, and if your readers might misunderstand and think that what the judge is saying is not actually the case, then you can translate his words as an affirmative statement. Alternate translation: “Even though I do not make my decisions based on what God wants or on what other people think” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
LUK	18	4	bh3q	figs-gendernotations	ἄνθρωπον	1	men	The judge is using the term **men** in a generic sense that includes all people. Alternate translation: “other people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
LUK	18	5	m200	figs-quotesinquotes	διά γε τὸ παρέχειν μοι κόπον τὴν χήραν ταύτην, ἐκδικήσω αὐτήν, ἵνα μὴ εἰς τέλος ἐρχομένη ὑπωπιάζῃ με	1	yet because this widow causes me trouble, I will vindicate her, so that she will not beat me up by coming to the end	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation (continuing the sentence from the previous verse): “because this widow bothered him, he would give a fair ruling in her case, so that she would not wear him out by coming incessantly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	18	5	v9uu		παρέχειν μοι κόπον	1	causes me trouble	Alternate translation: “bothers me”
LUK	18	5	cf4e	figs-metaphor	μὴ…ὑπωπιάζῃ με	1	she will not beat me up	The judge speaks figuratively of the wearying effect of the widow’s constant pleas as if they were physically pummeling him. Alternate translation: “she will not wear me out” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	18	5	ub29	figs-idiom	εἰς τέλος ἐρχομένη	1	by coming to the end	The expression **to the end** is an idiom that means “perpetually” or “forever.” Alternate translation: “by coming to me incessantly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	18	6	m201		ὁ Κύριος	1	the Lord	Here Luke refers to Jesus by the respectful title **the Lord**. Alternate translation: “the Lord Jesus”
LUK	18	6	t9mg	figs-idiom	ἀκούσατε τί ὁ κριτὴς τῆς ἀδικίας λέγει	1	Listen to what the unrighteous judge says	**Listen to** is an idiom that means “think about.” Jesus says this to get his disciples to reflect on what the judge said at the end of the parable. He is not introducing a further statement from the judge. Translate this in such a way that your readers will understand that Jesus has already related what the judge said. Alternate translation: “Think about what the unjust judge said” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	18	7	t1sk	figs-rquestion	ὁ δὲ Θεὸς οὐ μὴ ποιήσῃ τὴν ἐκδίκησιν τῶν ἐκλεκτῶν αὐτοῦ	1	And will not God do the vindication of his elect	Jesus is using the question form for emphasis as he teaches his disciples. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate his words as a statement. Alternate translation: “Now God will certainly answer the prayers of the people he has chosen” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	18	7	e2lv	figs-explicit	ὁ δὲ Θεὸς οὐ μὴ ποιήσῃ τὴν ἐκδίκησιν τῶν ἐκλεκτῶν αὐτοῦ	1	And will not God do the vindication of his elect	Jesus is drawing an implicit comparison between the unrighteous human judge and **God**, who is the perfectly righteous divine judge. The implication is that if even the human judge would ensure justice for someone who persevered in pleading for it, God would certainly do so. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “If an unrighteous human judge would ensure justice for someone who persevered in pleading for it, God will certainly answer the prayers of the people he has chosen” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	18	7	lrs0	figs-nominaladj	τῶν ἐκλεκτῶν αὐτοῦ	1	his elect	Jesus is using the adjective **elect** as a noun in order to describe a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this with a noun phrase. Alternate translation: “for the people whom he chose” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
LUK	18	7	m202	figs-merism	τῶν βοώντων αὐτῷ ἡμέρας καὶ νυκτός	1	the ones crying out to him day and night	Jesus is using the phrase **day and night** figuratively to describe all of time, by referring to its two components. Alternate translation: “who pray to him all the time” or “who ask him for help continually” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
LUK	18	7	ljb4	figs-idiom	καὶ μακροθυμεῖ ἐπ’ αὐτοῖς	1	and he delays long over them	Here Jesus may be using the word **and** in an idiomatic sense to mean “even if.” (UST offers another possible interpretation of this phrase.) Alternate translation: “even if he takes a long time to answer their prayers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	18	8	m203		λέγω ὑμῖν	1	I say to you	Jesus says this to emphasize what he is about to tell his disciples. Alternate translation: “I can assure you”
LUK	18	8	m204	figs-explicit	ποιήσει τὴν ἐκδίκησιν αὐτῶν ἐν τάχει	1	he will do the vindication of them quickly	The point of the parable and of this teaching is that people should continue to pray even if God does not answer right away. So this statement might seem contradictory, since it suggests that God will answer right away. The implication may be that God is concerned for his people and will begin to act immediately to help them, even if his actions do not become apparent for some time. If you think your readers would be puzzled or troubled by the apparent contradiction, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “he will start to answer their prayers right away” or “he will begin to send them help right away” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	18	8	zi1f	figs-rquestion	πλὴν ὁ Υἱὸς τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου ἐλθὼν, ἆρα εὑρήσει τὴν πίστιν ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς?	1	Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will he indeed find faith on the earth?	Jesus is using the question form as a teaching tool. This particular question uses a word that anticipates a negative answer. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this as a statement. Alternate translation: “Nevertheless, it is doubtful that the Son of Man will find faith on the earth when he returns.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	18	8	m205	figs-explicit	πλὴν	1	Nevertheless	The reference of this word is implied in the context. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could make it explicit. Alternate translation: “Even though God readily answers prayer” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	18	8	inw3	figs-123person	ὁ Υἱὸς τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου ἐλθὼν	1	when the Son of Man comes	Jesus is speaking about himself in the third person. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this in the first person. Alternate translation: “when I, the Son of Man, come” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
LUK	18	8	m206	figs-explicit	ὁ Υἱὸς τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου ἐλθὼν	1	the Son of Man	See how you translated the title **Son of Man** in [5:24](../05/24.md). Alternate translation: “when I, the Messiah, come” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	18	8	m207	figs-explicit	τὴν πίστιν	1	faith	When Jesus asks whether he will find **faith** on the earth, he may be referring implicitly to the kind of persevering trust in God that would lead a person to continue praying even when the answer was delayed. (UST offers another possible interpretation of this word.) Alternate translation: “this kind of persevering faith” or “this kind of persevering trust in God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	18	9	n2b5	figs-parables	εἶπεν δὲ καὶ πρός τινας…τὴν παραβολὴν ταύτην	1	Then he also spoke this parable to some	Jesus now tells a brief story to correct some wrong attitudes that he realized certain people had. The story is designed teach something that is true in a way that is easy to understand and remember. Alternate translation: “Then Jesus told this story to correct certain people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])
LUK	18	9	pmp1	writing-participants	πρός τινας	1	to some	Luke uses this phrase to introduce some new characters, but he does not say specifically who these people were. (The story that Jesus tells suggests that they may have been Pharisees.) Alternate translation: “to some people who were there” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
LUK	18	9	b6zy		τοὺς πεποιθότας ἐφ’ ἑαυτοῖς, ὅτι εἰσὶν δίκαιοι	1	who were persuaded in themselves that they were righteous	Alternate translation: “who had convinced themselves that they were righteous” or “who considered themselves to be righteous”
LUK	18	9	rs6q		καὶ ἐξουθενοῦντας τοὺς λοιποὺς	1	who disdained others	Alternate translation: “and who thought they were superior to other people”
LUK	18	10	m208	writing-participants	ἄνθρωποι δύο	1	Two men	Jesus uses this phrase to introduce the characters in this parable. Alternate translation: “Once there were two men who” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
LUK	18	10	m209	figs-idiom	ἀνέβησαν εἰς τὸ ἱερὸν προσεύξασθαι	1	went up to the temple to pray	When Jesus says that these men **went up**, he likely means that they traveled to Jerusalem. That was the customary way of speaking about going there, since the city was up on a mountain. Alternate translation: “went to pray in the temple courtyard” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	18	10	qp39	figs-synecdoche	εἰς τὸ ἱερὸν	1	to the temple	Since only priests could enter the **temple** building, this means the **temple** courtyard. Jesus is using the word for the entire building to refer to one part of it. Alternate translation: “into the temple courtyard” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
LUK	18	10	m210	writing-background	ὁ εἷς Φαρισαῖος καὶ ὁ ἕτερος τελώνης	1	the one a Pharisee, and the other a tax collector	Jesus provides this background information to help his listeners understand what happens in the story. It may be helpful to make this a separate sentence. Alternate translation: “Now one of these men was a Pharisee, and the other man was a tax collector” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
LUK	18	11	mi9g	figs-quotesinquotes	ταῦτα πρὸς ἑαυτὸν προσηύχετο, ὁ Θεός, εὐχαριστῶ σοι ὅτι οὐκ εἰμὶ ὥσπερ οἱ λοιποὶ τῶν ἀνθρώπων, ἅρπαγες, ἄδικοι, μοιχοί, ἢ καὶ ὡς οὗτος ὁ τελώνης	1	was praying these things about himself, ‘God, I thank you that I am not like the rest of men—robbers, unrighteous, adulterers—or even like this tax collector	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “prayed about himself and thanked God that he was not like other people, who were robbers, unrighteous, and adulterers, or even like the tax collector who was there” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	18	11	m211	figs-youformal	εὐχαριστῶ σοι	1	I thank you	Here, the pronoun **you** is singular because the Pharisee is addressing God. If your language has a formal form of **you** that it uses to address a superior respectfully, you may wish to use that form here. Alternatively, it might be effective to show this man addressing God using a familiar form, as if he could presume on God’s friendship and approval. Use your best judgment about what form to use. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youformal]])
LUK	18	11	m212	figs-gendernotations	οἱ λοιποὶ τῶν ἀνθρώπων	1	the rest of men	The Pharisee is using the term **men** in a generic sense that includes all people. Alternate translation: “other people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
LUK	18	11	lud3	translate-unknown	ἅρπαγες	1	robbers	The word **robbers** describes people who steal from other people by forcing them to give things to them. Your language may have a specific term for this kind of person. Alternate translation: “bandits” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	18	11	m213	figs-nominaladj	ἄδικοι	1	unrighteous	The Pharisee is using the adjective **unrighteous** as a noun in order to indicate a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this with an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “evildoers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
LUK	18	11	z78w	figs-explicit	ἢ καὶ ὡς οὗτος ὁ τελώνης	1	or even like this tax collector	The Pharisees believed that any **tax collector** would be dishonest and cheat others, and so as a group they were as sinful as robbers, unrighteous people, and adulterers. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly, as UST does. Alternate translation: “and I am certainly not like this sinful tax collector who cheats people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	18	12	m214	figs-quotesinquotes	νηστεύω δὶς τοῦ σαββάτου; ἀποδεκατεύω πάντα, ὅσα κτῶμαι	1	I fast twice a week. I tithe all that I acquire	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “He boasted that he fasted twice a week and that he gave ten percent of all his income to God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	18	12	ru63	figs-idiom	ἀποδεκατεύω πάντα, ὅσα κτῶμαι	1	I tithe all that I acquire	To **tithe** means to give ten percent of one’s income to God, as required in the law of Moses. Alternate translation: “I give you ten percent of all my income” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	18	13	c37t	translate-symaction	ὁ δὲ τελώνης μακρόθεν ἑστὼς	1	But the tax collector, standing at a distance	This was a sign of humility. The **tax collector** did not feel worthy to be near the Pharisee and the other people in the temple courtyard. It may be helpful to make each of the phrases in this verse a separate sentence. Alternate translation: “But the tax collector humbly stood by himself, away from the other people who were there” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
LUK	18	13	qtt7	figs-idiom	οὐκ ἤθελεν οὐδὲ τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς ἐπᾶραι εἰς τὸν οὐρανόν	1	not even willing to lift his eyes toward heaven	The phrase **lift up his eyes** means to look at something.

LUK	18	13	m215	figs-explicit	εἰς τὸν οὐρανόν	1	toward heaven	See how you translated the similar expression in [9:16](../09/16.md). Alternate translation: “beyond the sky towards God in heaven” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	18	13	c7x7	translate-symaction	ἀλλ’ ἔτυπτε τὸ στῆθος αὐτοῦ	1	but was beating his breast	This was a physical expression of great sorrow, and it showed this man’s repentance and humility. Alternate translation: “Instead, he hit his chest to demonstrate his shame and sorrow over his sins” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
LUK	18	13	m216	figs-quotesinquotes	λέγων, ὁ Θεός, ἱλάσθητί μοι, τῷ ἁμαρτωλῷ	1	saying, ‘God, have mercy on me, the sinner’	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “He admitted that he was a sinner and asked God to have mercy on him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	18	13	mx5p	figs-imperative	ὁ Θεός, ἱλάσθητί μοι, τῷ ἁμαρτωλῷ	1	God, have mercy on me, the sinner	This is an imperative, but it should be translated as a polite request rather than as a command. It may be helpful to add an expression such as “please” to make this clear. Alternate translation: “God, please be merciful to me, I confess that I am a sinner” or “God, please forgive me for the many sins I have committed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])

LUK	18	14	s1yr	figs-explicit	κατέβη οὗτος δεδικαιωμένος εἰς τὸν οἶκον αὐτοῦ, παρ’ ἐκεῖνον	1	this one went down to his house justified rather than that one	The implication is that the tax collector was right with God because God forgave his sin when he prayed humbly and repentantly. Alternate translation: “the tax collector was right with God when he went home, rather than the Pharisee, because God forgave his sin” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	18	14	m218		οὗτος…παρ’ ἐκεῖνον	1	this one … rather than that one	Alternate translation: “the latter … rather than the former” or “the tax collector … rather than the Pharisee”
LUK	18	14	m219	figs-activepassive	δεδικαιωμένος	1	justified	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express the meaning of the passive verbal form **justified** with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “right with God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	18	14	m220	figs-idiom	κατέβη…εἰς τὸν οἶκον αὐτοῦ	1	went down to his house	When Jesus says that this man **went down** to his house, he likely means that he returned home from Jerusalem, since the city was up on a mountain. Alternate translation: “returned to his home” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	18	14	qrg3	figs-explicit	παρ’ ἐκεῖνον	1	rather than that one	The implication is that the Pharisee was not right with God. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly.

LUK	18	14	uuc5	figs-activepassive	ὑψωθήσεται	1	will be exalted	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who will do the action. Alternate translation: “God will honor” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	18	14	m221	figs-metaphor	ὑψωθήσεται	1	will be exalted	Jesus is using a spatial metaphor to describe someone who is honored as if he were high up. Alternate translation: “God will honor” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	18	15	m260	grammar-connect-time-background	δὲ	1	And	Luke uses this word to begin relating a new event by introducing background information that will help readers understand what happens. Alternate translation: “Now” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background]])
LUK	18	15	abcm	writing-pronouns	προσέφερον…αὐτῷ καὶ τὰ βρέφη	1	they were bringing even the infants to him	Here, **they** refers to people in general. Alternate translation: “people were bringing their children to Jesus, even their newborns” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
LUK	18	15	m222	translate-symaction	ἵνα αὐτῶν ἅπτηται	1	so that he might touch them	If Jesus would **touch** the babies, this would express God’s love for them and convey God’s blessing to them.

LUK	18	16	j8x3	figs-verbs	ἄφετε τὰ παιδία ἔρχεσθαι πρός με, καὶ μὴ κωλύετε αὐτά	1	Permit the little children to come to me, and do not forbid them	The verb in the first phrase indicates a one-time action, while the verb in the second phrase indicates an ongoing action. Alternate translation: “Allow these children to come to me, and do not ever forbid children to come” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-verbs]])
LUK	18	16	u7sq	figs-simile	τῶν…τοιούτων ἐστὶν ἡ Βασιλεία τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	of such is the kingdom of God	It becomes clear in [18:17](../18/17.md) that this is simile. You could express it as one here. Alternate translation: “the kingdom of God consists of people who are like these little children” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
LUK	18	16	m223	figs-abstractnouns	τῶν…τοιούτων ἐστὶν ἡ Βασιλεία τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	of such is the kingdom of God	See how you decided to translate the phrase **the kingdom of God** in [4:43](../04/43.md). If your readers would misunderstand the abstract noun **kingdom**, you could express the idea behind it with a verb such as “rule.” Alternate translation: “people who are like children will let God rule their lives” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
LUK	18	17	p5lq		ἀμὴν, λέγω ὑμῖν, ὃς ἂν	1	Truly I say to you, whoever	Jesus says this to emphasize what he is about to say. Alternate translation: “I can assure you that whoever”
LUK	18	17	m224	figs-abstractnouns	δέξηται τὴν Βασιλείαν τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	receive the kingdom of God	See how you decided to translate the phrase **the kingdom of God** in [4:43](../04/43.md). If your readers would misunderstand the abstract noun **kingdom**, you could express the idea behind it with a verb such as “rule.” Alternate translation: “let God rule over him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
LUK	18	17	ar8e	figs-simile	ὡς παιδίον	1	like a child	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the basis of this comparison. Alternate translation: “with trust and humility like a child” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
LUK	18	17	m225		οὐ μὴ εἰσέλθῃ εἰς αὐτήν	1	will certainly not enter into it	Alternate translation: “will not let God rule over him at all”
LUK	18	18	a5qz	writing-participants	καὶ ἐπηρώτησέν τις αὐτὸν ἄρχων	1	And a certain ruler asked him	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new character into the story. Alternate translation: “Then a Jewish leader came up to Jesus and asked him a question” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
LUK	18	18	d6kf		τί ποιήσας…κληρονομήσω	1	doing what will I inherit	Alternate translation: “what do I need to do to inherit”
LUK	18	18	xrs8	figs-metaphor	κληρονομήσω	1	will I inherit	The ruler is using the term **inherit** figuratively to mean coming into possession of something. Alternate translation: “will I receive” or “will I obtain” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	18	19	fxi2	figs-rquestion	τί με λέγεις ἀγαθόν? οὐδεὶς ἀγαθὸς, εἰ μὴ εἷς ὁ Θεός	1	Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone	Jesus is using the question form as a teaching tool. He is not asking the ruler to explain why he used this term. Jesus is also not denying that he is God. Rather, he is challenging the ruler to reflect on whether, in light of God’s holiness, he should consider any human being to be **good**. The ruler apparently considers Jesus to be a **good** human being, and he wants to know how he can be **good** enough himself to earn God’s approval. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate Jesus’ words as a statement, and it may be helpful to combine that statement with the next sentence in the verse. Alternate translation: “You should not consider any human being to be good, since no one is good except God alone” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	18	20	m226	figs-explicit	τὰς ἐντολὰς οἶδας	1	You know the commandments	The implication is that Jesus is saying this in response to the ruler’s question.

Alternate translation: “As for what God expects from us, you know what he has commanded” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	18	20	m227	figs-quotesinquotes	μὴ μοιχεύσῃς, μὴ φονεύσῃς, μὴ κλέψῃς, μὴ ψευδομαρτυρήσῃς, τίμα τὸν πατέρα σου καὶ τὴν μητέρα	1	do not commit adultery, do not murder, do not steal, do not testify falsely, honor your father and mother	You may wish to represent these commandments as a second-level direct quotation within Jesus’ reply to the ruler, using the capitalization and punctuation conventions of your language. That is what UST does. However, that would be a quotation within a quotation, and you may wish to avoid that by leaving the commandments as an indirect quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	18	20	m261	figs-youcrowd	σου	1	your	Jesus is reciting these commandments from the Scriptures, and the word **your** is singular because that is the way Moses spoke the commandments, since even though he gave them to the Israelites as a group, each individual person was supposed to obey them. So in your translation, it would be appropriate to use the singular form of **your**. The implied **you** in the imperative verbs would also be singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd]])
LUK	18	21	m5qf	figs-abstractnouns	ταῦτα πάντα ἐφύλαξα ἐκ νεότητος μου	1	All these things I have kept from my youth	If your readers would misunderstand the abstract noun **youth**, you could express the idea behind it with an adjective such as “young.” Alternate translation: “I have obeyed all of these commandments ever since I was young” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
LUK	18	22	e8il		ἀκούσας δὲ, ὁ Ἰησοῦς εἶπεν αὐτῷ	1	But Jesus, hearing, said to him	Alternate translation: “When Jesus heard the ruler say that, he responded”
LUK	18	22	t2cw		ἔτι ἕν σοι λείπει	1	One thing is still lacking to you	Alternate translation: “You still need to do one more thing” or “There is one thing that you have not yet done”
LUK	18	22	d3ar		πάντα ὅσα ἔχεις, πώλησον	1	Sell all that you have	Alternate translation: “Sell all your possessions” or “Sell everything that you own”
LUK	18	22	c4s5	figs-nominaladj	πτωχοῖς	1	distribute to the poor	Jesus is using the adjective **poor** as a noun in order to indicate a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “people who are poor” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
LUK	18	22	hy6a	figs-metaphor	δεῦρο, ἀκολούθει μοι	1	come, follow me	As in [5:27](../05/27.md), to **follow** Jesus means to be one of his disciples. Alternate translation: “come with me as my disciple” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	18	23	m228	writing-pronouns	ὁ δὲ ἀκούσας ταῦτα…ἐγενήθη	1	But he, hearing these things, became	Alternate translation: “But when the ruler heard what Jesus said, he said” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
LUK	18	24	m229	translate-textvariants	ἰδὼν δὲ αὐτὸν ὁ Ἰησοῦς	1	Then Jesus, looking at him	Many manuscripts have two additional Greek words here, so that this says, “Then Jesus, seeing him having become sad.” See the discussion of textual issues at the end of the General Notes to this chapter to decide whether to represent those words in your translation. Alternate translation (if you choose to represent them): “Then Jesus, noticing how sad the ruler had become” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
LUK	18	24	qcm7	figs-exclamations	πῶς δυσκόλως οἱ τὰ χρήματα ἔχοντες, εἰς τὴν Βασιλείαν τοῦ Θεοῦ εἰσπορεύονται	1	How difficultly those who have riches are entering into the kingdom of God	This is an exclamation, not a question. Alternate translation: “It is so very difficult for those who are rich to enter the kingdom of God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations]])
LUK	18	24	m230	figs-abstractnouns	πῶς δυσκόλως οἱ τὰ χρήματα ἔχοντες, εἰς τὴν Βασιλείαν τοῦ Θεοῦ εἰσπορεύονται	1	How difficultly those who have riches are entering into the kingdom of God	See how you decided to translate the phrase **the kingdom of God** in [4:43](../04/43.md). If your readers would misunderstand the abstract noun **kingdom**, you could express the idea behind it with a verb such as “rule.” Alternate translation: “It is so very difficult for those who are rich to allow God to rule their lives” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
LUK	18	25	hdz1	figs-hyperbole	εὐκοπώτερον γάρ ἐστιν κάμηλον διὰ τρήματος βελόνης εἰσελθεῖν, ἢ	1	it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for	It is impossible for **a camel** to fit through **the eye of a needle** Jesus is using an exaggeration to express how difficult it is for a rich person to enter God’s kingdom. Alternate translation: “It is extremely difficult” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
LUK	18	25	m231	translate-unknown	κάμηλον	1	camel	A **camel** is a large animal that was used in this culture to transport people and goods. If your readers would not know what a **camel** is, you could use the name of a similar animal that they would recognize, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “a huge beast of burden” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	18	25	j7x3	translate-unknown	τρήματος βελόνης	1	the eye of a needle	The **eye of a needle** is the hole in a sewing needle through which the thread is passed. If your language has an expression of its own that describes this hole, you can use it in your translation. Otherwise, you can use a general expression. Alternate translation: “the tiny hole for thread in a needle” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	18	25	m232	figs-abstractnouns	εἰς τὴν Βασιλείαν τοῦ Θεοῦ εἰσελθεῖν	1	to enter into the kingdom of God	See how you translated this phrase in [18:24](../18/24.md). Alternate translation: “to allow God to rule his life” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
LUK	18	26	ycm3		οἱ ἀκούσαντες	1	the ones who heard	Alternate translation: “the people who were listening to Jesus”
LUK	18	26	vu3z	figs-rquestion	καὶ τίς δύναται σωθῆναι?	1	And who is able to be saved?	It is possible that these people were asking for an answer. But it is more likely that they were using the question form to emphasize their surprise at what Jesus said. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this as a statement or exclamation. Alternate translation: “Then no one can be saved!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	18	26	m233	figs-activepassive	καὶ τίς δύναται σωθῆναι?	1	And who is able to be saved?	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form, and you could specify the agent. Alternate translation: “Then God is not going to save anyone!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	18	27	ms9b	figs-nominaladj	τὰ ἀδύνατα παρὰ ἀνθρώποις, δυνατὰ παρὰ τῷ Θεῷ ἐστιν	1	The impossible with men is possible with God	Jesus is using the adjectives **impossible** and **possible** as nouns to describe types of things. The terms are plural. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate these terms with equivalent expressions. Alternate translation: “The things that are impossible for people to do are possible for God to do” or “God is able to do the things that people are not able to do” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
LUK	18	28	m235	figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	Behold	Peter uses the term **Behold** to get Jesus to focus his attention on what he is about to say. Alternate translation: “Listen” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	18	28	znu6	figs-exclusive	ἡμεῖς ἀφήκαμεν…ἠκολουθήσαμέν	1	we have left … we have followed	Peter is referring to himself and his fellow disciples, but not to Jesus, so if your language distinguishes between exclusive and inclusive **we**, use the exclusive form in both of these cases. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
LUK	18	28	yk9b		πάντα	1	everything	This is not hyperbole. Peter and the others did leave behind **everything** they had in order to become Jesus’ disciples. Alternate translation: “all our possessions”
LUK	18	28	m236	translate-textvariants	πάντα	1	everything	Some manuscripts say “our own possessions” here instead of “everything.” See the discussion of textual issues at the end of the General Notes to this chapter to decide which reading to use in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
LUK	18	28	m262	figs-metaphor	καὶ ἠκολουθήσαμέν σοι	1	and we have followed you	As in [18:22](../18/22.md), to follow Jesus means to be one of his disciples. Alternate translation: “in order to become your disciples” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

LUK	18	29	sk6z	figs-doublenegatives	οὐδείς ἐστιν ὃς ἀφῆκεν	1	there is no one who has left	A double negative statement begins in this verse and concludes in the next verse.

Alternate translation, beginning here: “anyone who has left” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
LUK	18	29	m237	figs-abstractnouns	εἵνεκεν τῆς Βασιλείας τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	for the sake of the kingdom of God	See how you decided to translate the phrase **the kingdom of God** in [4:43](../04/43.md).

LUK	18	30	s6rp	figs-doublenegatives	ὃς οὐχὶ μὴ ἀπολάβῃ	1	who will by no means not receive	This is the conclusion of the double negative statement that began in the previous verse with “there is no one who has left.” If you started to translate it there as a positive statement, you can finish that translation here. Alternate translation: “will certainly receive” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
LUK	18	30	m238	figs-metonymy	ἐν τῷ καιρῷ τούτῳ…ἐν τῷ αἰῶνι τῷ ἐρχομένῳ	1	in this time … in the age that is coming	Jesus is using the word **time** in the same figurative sense as the word **age** in [16:8](../16/08.md), to mean the long period of time defined by the duration of the created world; by association, it means the world itself. Here, Jesus is using the word **age** similarly to mean the new world that God will introduce after the end of this present world. Alternate translation: “in this present world … in the world to come” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	18	30	d3xa	figs-ellipsis	καὶ ἐν τῷ αἰῶνι τῷ ἐρχομένῳ, ζωὴν αἰώνιον	1	and in the age that is coming, eternal life	Jesus is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from what he says earlier in the sentence. Alternate translation: “and they will also receive eternal life in the world to come” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
LUK	18	31	pwk9		παραλαβὼν…τοὺς δώδεκα	1	he took the Twelve aside	Alternate translation: “Jesus took the Twelve to a place away from other people where they would be alone”

LUK	18	31	m240	translate-names	τοὺς δώδεκα	1	the Twelve	You may have decided instead in [8:1](../08/01.md) to translate this as a title, even if your language does not ordinarily use adjectives as nouns. If so, you can do the same thing here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

Alternate translation: “we are traveling to Jerusalem” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	18	31	pg4k	figs-activepassive	πάντα τὰ γεγραμμένα διὰ τῶν προφητῶν	1	all the things that have been written by the prophets	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form.

LUK	18	31	ss78	figs-explicit	τὰ γεγραμμένα διὰ τῶν προφητῶν	1	the things that have been written by the prophets	Jesus assumes that his disciples will know that he is referring to the Old Testament prophets.

Alternate translation: “the things that the prophets have written in the Scriptures” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	18	31	zj2x	figs-123person	τῷ Υἱῷ τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου	1	the Son of Man	Jesus is speaking about himself in the third person.

LUK	18	32	es98	figs-123person	παραδοθήσεται	1	he will be delivered	If you decided in [18:31](../18/31.md) to use the second person for what Jesus is telling his disciples, also use it here.

LUK	18	32	m244	figs-123person	ἐμπαιχθήσεται, καὶ ὑβρισθήσεται, καὶ ἐμπτυσθήσεται	1	he be mocked, and will be mistreated, and will be spit upon	If you decided in [18:31](../18/31.md) to use the second person for what Jesus is telling his disciples, also use it here. Alternate translation: “they will mock me, mistreat me, and spit on me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

LUK	18	33	fie4	figs-explicit	καὶ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ τρίτῃ, ἀναστήσεται	1	And on the third day he will rise up	See how you translated this in [9:22](../09/22.md). In the idiom of this culture, today was the “first day,” tomorrow was the “second day,” and the day after tomorrow was the **third day**. To make sure that this is clear to your readers, you may wish to use a different expression than “the third day,” especially if, in your culture, this would mean one day longer than Jesus intends. Otherwise, your readers may be confused when they read later in the book that Jesus died on a Friday and came back to life on a Sunday, if that would be “the second day” according to the way your culture reckons time. Alternate translation: “and he will spend the next full day in the grave, but on the day after that, he will come back to life” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	18	33	m245	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	καὶ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ τρίτῃ	1	And on the third day	Jesus uses the word **and** to introduce a contrast between the belief of the authorities that they could kill him and the fact that he would come back to life.

LUK	18	33	m246	translate-ordinal	τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ τρίτῃ	1	on the third day	If your language does not use ordinal numbers, you can use a cardinal number here.

LUK	18	33	m247	figs-metonymy	ἀναστήσεται	1	he will rise up	Jesus speaks figuratively of his coming back to life as if he will **rise up**, since he will come **up** out of the grave. Alternate translation: “he will come back to life” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	18	34	bm7h		αὐτοὶ οὐδὲν τούτων συνῆκαν	1	they understood none of these things	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could make the verb negative and the object positive here. Alternate translation: “they did not understand any of these things”

LUK	18	35	w3sw	writing-newevent	ἐγένετο δὲ	1	And it happened that	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
LUK	18	35	m249	translate-names	ἐν τῷ ἐγγίζειν αὐτὸν εἰς Ἰερειχὼ	1	as he came near to Jericho	**Jericho** is the name of a city. Alternate translation: “as Jesus approached the city of Jericho” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

LUK	18	37	ku9j	translate-names	Ἰησοῦς ὁ Ναζωραῖος	1	Jesus the Nazarene	The people call **Jesus** **the Nazarene** because he was from the town of Nazareth in Galilee. Alternate translation: “Jesus from the town of Nazareth” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	18	38	u9ct	grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ	1	And	Luke uses **and** to introduce the results of what the previous sentence described.

Alternate translation: “So” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
LUK	18	38	yaj2		ἐβόησεν	1	cried out	Alternate translation: “he called out” or “he shouted”

LUK	18	38	ehf6	figs-explicit	Υἱὲ Δαυείδ	1	Son of David	**David** was Israel’s most important king, and God had promised him that one of his descendants would be the Messiah. So the title **Son of David** implicitly meant “Messiah.” Alternate translation: “Messiah” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	18	38	m251	translate-names	Δαυείδ	1	David	**David** is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	18	38	u69g	figs-imperative	ἐλέησόν με	1	have mercy on me	This is an imperative, but it should be translated as a polite request rather than as a command. It may be helpful to add an expression such as “please” to make this clear. Alternate translation: “please be merciful to me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
LUK	18	38	m252	figs-explicit	ἐλέησόν με	1	have mercy on me	The blind man assumes that Jesus will know that he is asking specifically to be healed. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “please have mercy on me and heal me” or “please be merciful to me by healing me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	18	39	m253		οἱ προάγοντες	1	the ones who were walking ahead	Alternate translation: “the people who were walking ahead of Jesus”
LUK	18	39	z7r6		ἐπετίμων αὐτῷ, ἵνα σιγήσῃ	1	were rebuking him, so that he would be silent	Alternate translation: “kept telling him not to shout”
LUK	18	39	zug7		πολλῷ μᾶλλον ἔκραζεν	1	he kept crying out much more	This could mean: (1) “he shouted even louder.” (2) “he called out even more persistently.”

LUK	18	41	al8g		ἵνα ἀναβλέψω	1	that I might see again	Alternate translation: “I want to be able to see again” or “I want you to restore my sight”
LUK	18	42	n67h	figs-imperative	ἀνάβλεψον	1	See again	This was not a command that the man was capable of obeying. Instead, this was a command that directly caused the man to be healed. Alternate translation: “I have restored your sight” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
LUK	18	42	m256	figs-abstractnouns	ἡ πίστις σου σέσωκέν σε	1	Your faith has saved you	If your readers would misunderstand the abstract noun **faith**, you could express the idea behind it with a verb such as “believe.” Alternate translation: “Because you believed, you have been healed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

LUK	19	intro	zn2b			0		# Luke 19 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>1. Jesus helps a man named Zacchaeus repent of his sins (19:1-10)<br>2. Jesus tells a parable about a man who entrusted money to his servants (19:11-27)<br>3. Jesus rides into Jerusalem on a colt (19:28-48)<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### “Sinner”<br><br>The Pharisees refer to a group of people as “sinners.” The Jewish leaders thought these people were sinful, but in reality the leaders were also sinful. This can be taken as irony. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])<br><br>### Servants<br><br>God expects his people to remember that everything in the world belongs to God. God gives his people things so they can serve him. He wants them to please him by doing what he wants them to do with everything he has given them. One day Jesus will ask his servants what they have done with everything he gave them to use. He will give a reward to those who have done what he wanted them to do, and he will punish those who have not.<br><br>### The donkey and the colt<br><br>Jesus rode into Jerusalem on an animal. In this way he was like a king who came into a city after he had won an important battle. Also, the kings of Israel in the Old Testament rode on donkeys. Other kings rode on horses. So Jesus was showing that he was the king of Israel and that he was not like other kings.<br><br>Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John all wrote about this event. Matthew and Mark wrote that the disciples brought Jesus a donkey. John wrote that Jesus found a donkey. Luke wrote that they brought him a colt. Only Matthew wrote that the disciples brought Jesus both a donkey and a colt. No one knows for sure whether Jesus rode the donkey or the colt. It is best to translate each of these accounts as it appears in ULT without trying to make them all say exactly the same thing. (See: Matthew 21:1-7 and Mark 11:1-7 and Luke 19:29-36 and John 12:14-15)<br><br>### Spreading garments and branches<br><br>When kings would enter the cities they ruled, people would cut branches from trees and take off the outer garments that they wore to stay warm in cold weather and spread them all on the road so the king would ride over them. They did this to honor the king and show that they loved him. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/honor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])<br><br>### The merchants in the temple<br><br>Jesus forced the people who were selling animals in the temple to leave. He did this to show everyone that he had authority over the temple and that only those who were righteous, who did what God said was good, could be in it. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]])

LUK	19	2	m263	figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	behold	Luke uses the term **behold** to calls the reader’s attention to what he is about to say. Your language may have a similar expression that you can use here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	19	2	y5i5	writing-participants	ἀνὴρ	1	a man	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new character into the story. If your language has its own way of doing that, you can use it here in your translation. Alternate translation: “there was a man who lived there” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
LUK	19	2	m264	figs-idiom	ὀνόματι καλούμενος Ζακχαῖος	1	called Zacchaeus by name	This is an idiom. Alternate translation: “whose name was Zacchaeus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

Alternate translation: “because he was short, he could not see over the crowd” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
LUK	19	3	m266	figs-explicit	οὐκ ἠδύνατο ἀπὸ τοῦ ὄχλου, ὅτι τῇ ἡλικίᾳ μικρὸς ἦν	1	he was not able from the crowd, because he was small in stature	The implication may be that the people resented Zacchaeus for taking their money, and so they would not let him come forward and stand in front of them, even though they would have been able to see over him. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “he could not see over the crowd because he was short, and the people would not let him stand in the front, because they resented him for taking their money” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	19	4	k984	grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ	1	And	Luke uses this word to introduce the results of what the previous sentence described. Alternate translation: “So” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
LUK	19	4	pzr6	translate-unknown	συκομορέαν	1	a sycamore tree	This is a type of fig tree. It would have been tall enough and strong enough to hold Zacchaeus at a height from which he could see the street. If you readers would not be familiar with this particular tree, you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “a fig tree” or “a tree” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	19	5	mr51		ὡς ἦλθεν ἐπὶ τὸν τόπον	1	when he came to the place	Alternate translation: “when Jesus got to that tree” or “when Jesus reached the place where Zacchaeus was”

LUK	19	7	k2cl		παρὰ ἁμαρτωλῷ ἀνδρὶ εἰσῆλθεν καταλῦσαι	1	He has gone in to lodge with a sinful man	Alternate translation: “Jesus is going to stay in the house of an obvious sinner”
LUK	19	7	yl4h		ἁμαρτωλῷ ἀνδρὶ	1	a sinful man	By using two terms together, rather than simply saying “sinner,” the crowd is emphasizing that Zacchaeus has openly done many wrong things. Alternate translation: “an obvious sinner”
LUK	19	8	m267	translate-symaction	σταθεὶς	1	stood	At a relaxed meal such as this one, it was the custom in this culture for host and guests to eat while lying down comfortably around the table. So by standing up, Zacchaeus was signifying that he had something important to say. Alternate translation: “stood up from the meal to speak” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
LUK	19	8	s46z		τὸν Κύριον	1	the Lord	Here Luke refers to Jesus by the respectful title **the Lord**. Alternate translation: “the Lord Jesus”
LUK	19	8	m268	figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	Behold	Zacchaeus uses **behold** to get Jesus to focus his attention on what he is about to say. Alternate translation: “Please listen” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	19	8	m269		Κύριε	1	Lord	Zacchaeus is addressing Jesus directly by a respectful title. It would be appropriate to represent the title with the corresponding term in your language and culture, rather than using the name “Jesus.”
LUK	19	8	m270	grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἴ τινός τι ἐσυκοφάντησα, ἀποδίδωμι τετραπλοῦν	1	if I have defrauded anything from anyone, I will restore four-fold	Zacchaeus speaks as if this were a hypothetical possibility, but he means that it is actually true. He is inviting anyone he has cheated to come to him for restitution. If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, and if your readers might misunderstand and think that what Zacchaeus is saying is not certain, then you can translate his words as an affirmative statement. Alternate translation: “I know that I have cheated many people out of their money, and I promise to pay each one back four times as much” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
LUK	19	8	u2bt		ἀποδίδωμι τετραπλοῦν	1	I will restore four-fold	Alternate translation: “I will return to them four times as much as I took from them”

In this culture, people were allowed to stand around the walls of the banquet room in a private home and listen to what an invited guest was saying. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “Then Jesus said to Zacchaeus and to the people from the crowd who were standing around the room” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	19	9	m272	figs-123person	σωτηρία τῷ οἴκῳ τούτῳ ἐγένετο, καθότι καὶ αὐτὸς υἱὸς Ἀβραάμ ἐστιν	1	salvation has come to this house, because he too is a son of Abraham	Jesus is speaking to Zacchaeus, but he addresses him in the third person because he is also speaking to the people from the crowd. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could use the second person here. Alternate translation: “salvation has come to your household, because you too are a son of Abraham” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
LUK	19	9	m273	figs-personification	σωτηρία τῷ οἴκῳ τούτῳ ἐγένετο	1	salvation has come to this house	Jesus speaks figuratively of **salvation** as if it were a living thing that could come to the house of Zacchaeus.

LUK	19	9	i8yg	figs-metonymy	τῷ οἴκῳ τούτῳ	1	this house	Jesus is using the word **house** figuratively to refer to the people living in the house. Alternate translation: “to this household” or “to this family” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

LUK	19	9	v3hq	figs-idiom	υἱὸς Ἀβραάμ	1	a son of Abraham	Alternatively, Jesus could be using the expression **son of** as an idiom to mean someone who shares the qualities of someone else. Alternate translation: “a person who has faith as Abraham did” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	19	10	myp2	figs-123person	ὁ Υἱὸς τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου	1	the Son of Man	Jesus is speaking about himself in the third person. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this in the first person. Alternate translation: “I, the Son of Man” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
LUK	19	10	m275	figs-explicit	ὁ Υἱὸς τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου	1	the Son of Man	See how you translated the title **Son of Man** in [5:24](../05/24.md). Alternate translation: “I, the Messiah” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

LUK	19	11	m279	grammar-connect-logic-result	προσθεὶς, εἶπεν παραβολὴν	1	he proceeded to speak a parable	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could put this clause last in the verse, since the two statements that follow give the reason for the result that it describes.

LUK	19	12	m9j6	writing-participants	ἄνθρωπός τις εὐγενὴς	1	A certain well-born man	Jesus uses this phrase to introduce the main character into the story. Alternate translation: “There once was a nobleman who” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
LUK	19	12	mtz9	figs-explicit	λαβεῖν ἑαυτῷ βασιλείαν	1	to receive for himself a kingdom	Jesus assumes that his listeners will know that he is speaking of a lesser king going to a greater king or emperor. The emperor would give the lesser king the right and authority to rule over his own country. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “to receive authorization from the emperor to rule over his own kingdom” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

LUK	19	13	t82q	translate-bweight	ἔδωκεν αὐτοῖς δέκα μνᾶς	1	he gave them ten minas	A mina was a unit of weight equal to about half a kilogram. The term refers to silver coins of that weight. Each one was equal to what people would be paid for about four months’ work. You could try to express this amount in terms of current monetary values, but that might cause your Bible translation to become outdated and inaccurate, since those values can change over time. So instead you might state something more general or give the equivalent in wages. Alternate translation: “he gave each of them a valuable silver coin” or “he gave each of them four months’ wages” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bweight]])

LUK	19	17	m288	figs-imperative	ἴσθι ἐξουσίαν ἔχων ἐπάνω δέκα πόλεων	1	be having authority over ten cities	The new king speaks this as a command, but it is not one that the servant is capable of obeying on his own.

LUK	19	19	jxa9	figs-imperative	σὺ ἐπάνω γίνου πέντε πόλεων	1	you be over five cities	The new king speaks this as a command, but it is not one that the servant is capable of obeying on his own.

LUK	19	22	m294		λέγει αὐτῷ	1	He says to him	To call attention to a development in the story, this parable uses the present tense here in past narration.

The king is not asking the servant to verify what he has just said. Rather, he is using the question form to challenge the servant. He is repeating what the servant said about him, but not to grant that it is true. Rather, he is about to tell the servant what he should have done if it actually had been true.

LUK	19	48	pnf9	figs-metaphor	ἐξεκρέμετο αὐτοῦ ἀκούων	1	were hanging on him listening	Luke speaks figuratively of the people **hanging** on Jesus to emphasize how closely they were listening to what he said. Alternate translation: “were paying close attention to him to hear what he was saying” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	20	intro	h6in			0		# Luke 20 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>1. Jesus answers a question about his authority (20:1-8)<br>2. Jesus tells a parable about a man who rented a vineyard to farmers (20:9-19)<br>3. Jesus answers a question about paying taxes to Caesar (20:20-26)<br>4. Jesus answers a question about marriage and the resurrection (20:27-40)<br>5. Jesus asks a challenging question about the Messiah (20:41-44)<br>6. Jesus warns about the scribes (20:45-47)<br><br>Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. ULT does this with the poetry in [20:17](../20/17.md) and [20:42-43](../20/42.md), which is quoted from the Old Testament.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Questions that seem to have no good answer<br><br>In [20:4](../20/04.md), Jesus asks the Pharisees a question that seems to have no good answer. His goal is to show them that they should have recognized John the Baptist as someone who came with God’s authority. So he asks them who gave John the authority to baptize. They could not answer, because any answer they gave would show that they should have respected John [20:5-6](../20/05.md).<br><br>In [20:22](../20/22.md), the Pharisees ask Jesus a question that seems to have no good answer. They thought that they would get Jesus in trouble either with the Roman government or the Jewish people when they asked him if people should pay taxes to Caesar. If he said “yes,” then the Jewish people would be angry with him for telling them to pay taxes to a foreign government. If he said “no,” then the religious leaders could tell the Romans that Jesus was teaching the people to break the Roman laws. But Jesus gave them an answer they had not anticipated, and instead everyone respected the wisdom of Jesus even more.<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Paradox<br><br>A paradox is a statement that describes two things that seem as if they cannot both be true at the same time, but which actually are both true. In this chapter, Jesus quotes a psalm that records David calling his son “lord,” that is, “master.” However, to the Jews, ancestors were greater than their descendants, so a father would not call his son “master.” In this passage, [Luke 20:41-44](../20/41.md), Jesus is trying to lead his hearers to the true understanding that the Messiah will be divine, and that he himself is the Messiah. So David is speaking to his son, that is, his descendant, as the Messiah, and it is appropriate for him to address him as his “Lord.”
LUK	20	1	h8gv	writing-newevent	καὶ ἐγένετο	1	And it happened that	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
LUK	20	1	vtg4	figs-synecdoche	ἐν τῷ ἱερῷ	1	in the temple	Only priests were allowed to enter the **temple** building, so Luke means that Jesus was teaching in the temple courtyard. Luke is using the word for the entire building to refer to one part of it. Alternate translation: “in the temple courtyard” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
LUK	20	1	m350	writing-participants	ἐπέστησαν οἱ ἀρχιερεῖς καὶ οἱ γραμματεῖς σὺν τοῖς πρεσβυτέροις	1	the chief priests and the scribes approached with the elders	Luke uses this statement to reintroduce these characters into the story. He mentioned their activity in opposition to Jesus as background information in [19:47-48](../19/47.md), but here he brings them back into the main action of the story. If your language has its own way of doing that, you can use it here in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
LUK	20	2	m351	figs-imperative	εἰπὸν ἡμῖν ἐν ποίᾳ ἐξουσίᾳ ταῦτα ποιεῖς, ἢ τίς ἐστιν ὁ δούς σοι τὴν ἐξουσίαν ταύτην	1	Tell us by what authority you are doing these things, or who the one is who gave you this authority	The Jewish leaders are using an imperative to ask a question, so you could translate this as a question. It may be helpful to make it two sentences. Alternate translation: “Tell us, by what authority are you doing these things? Or who is the one who gave you this authority?” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
LUK	20	3	qn89	figs-hendiadys	ἀποκριθεὶς…εἶπεν	1	answering he said	Together the words **answering** and **said** mean that Jesus said what follows in response to the question from the Jewish leaders. Alternate translation: “he responded” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
LUK	20	3	ku6a		ἐρωτήσω ὑμᾶς κἀγὼ λόγον καὶ εἴπατέ μοι	1	I also will ask you a word, and you say to me	Jesus begins his response with a statement, but then he gives a command, **you say to me**. It might be helpful to make the statement one sentence and the command another sentence, leading into the next verse. Alternate translation: “I will also ask you a question. Now you tell me”
LUK	20	3	m352		λόγον	1	a word	Here Jesus is using the term **word** in a specific sense. Alternate translation: “a question”
LUK	20	4	uph3		τὸ βάπτισμα Ἰωάννου, ἐξ οὐρανοῦ ἦν ἢ ἐξ ἀνθρώπων?	1	The baptism of John, was it from heaven or from men?	Jesus knows that John’s authority came from God, so he is not asking the Jewish leaders for information. However, this is not a rhetorical question that could be translated as a statement, for example, “Surely you must admit that God, not people, gave John the authority to baptize.” This is an actual question that Jesus wants the Jewish leaders to try to answer, because he knows that either way they answer, they will have a problem. So his words should be translated as a question. Alternate translation: “Was it God who told John to baptize people, or did people tell him to do it?”
LUK	20	4	z7cg	figs-euphemism	ἐξ οὐρανοῦ	1	from heaven	In order to honor the commandment not to misuse God’s name, Jewish people often avoided saying the word “God” and used the word **heaven** instead. That seems to be what Jesus is doing here. Alternate translation: “from God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
LUK	20	4	m353	figs-gendernotations	ἀνθρώπων	1	men	Here Jesus is using the term **men** in a generic sense that includes all people. Alternate translation: “people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
LUK	20	5	mn6x		οἱ…συνελογίσαντο πρὸς ἑαυτοὺς	1	they reasoned among themselves	Alternate translation: “they discussed with each other what they should say”
LUK	20	5	m354	figs-hypo	ἐὰν εἴπωμεν, ἐξ οὐρανοῦ, ἐρεῖ, διὰ τί οὐκ ἐπιστεύσατε αὐτῷ	1	If we should say, ‘From heaven,’ he will say, ‘For what reason did you not believe him?’	The Jewish leaders are describing a hypothetical situation. Alternate translation: “Suppose we say, ‘From heaven.’ Then he will ask, ‘Then why did you not believe him’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
LUK	20	5	z599	figs-quotesinquotes	ἐὰν εἴπωμεν, ἐξ οὐρανοῦ, ἐρεῖ, διὰ τί οὐκ ἐπιστεύσατε αὐτῷ	1	If we should say, ‘From heaven,’ he will say, ‘For what reason did you not believe him?’	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “If we say that John’s authority came from God, Jesus will ask us why we did not believe him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	20	5	m4l7	figs-euphemism	ἐξ οὐρανοῦ	1	from heaven	See how you translated this expression in [20:4](../20/04.md). Alternate translation: “From God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
LUK	20	6	m355	figs-hypo	ἐὰν δὲ εἴπωμεν, ἐξ ἀνθρώπων, ὁ λαὸς ἅπας καταλιθάσει ἡμᾶς	1	But if we should say, ‘From men,’ the whole people will stone us	The Jewish leaders are describing another hypothetical situation. Alternate translation: “But suppose we say, ‘From men.’ Then all the people will stone us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
LUK	20	6	e9ps	figs-quotesinquotes	ἐὰν δὲ εἴπωμεν, ἐξ ἀνθρώπων, ὁ λαὸς ἅπας καταλιθάσει ἡμᾶς	1	But if we should say, ‘From men,’ the whole people will stone us	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “But if we say that John’s authority came from people, then all the people will stone us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	20	6	m356	figs-gendernotations	ἀνθρώπων	1	men	See how you translated this in [20:4](../20/04.md). Alternate translation: “people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
LUK	20	6	m357	figs-hyperbole	ὁ λαὸς ἅπας	1	the whole people	For emphasis, the Jewish leaders speak figuratively as if every single person in the Jewish nation believed that John was God’s prophet and would stone them if they said otherwise. Alternate translation: “many of the Jewish people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
LUK	20	6	m358	figs-idiom	ὁ λαὸς	1	the … people	This was a customary way of speaking of the Jewish nation. Alternate translation: “the … Jewish people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	20	6	nns5	figs-explicit	καταλιθάσει ἡμᾶς	1	stone us	The implication is that the people would do this as a punishment for blasphemy, for saying that one of God’s prophets had only human authority. Alternate translation: “kill us by throwing stones at us, as punishment for blasphemy” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	20	6	m359	figs-activepassive	πεπεισμένος…ἐστιν	1	it is persuaded	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form. If you translated **the … people** as “the Jewish people,” this would be plural. Alternate translation: “they firmly believe” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	20	7	ia28	grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ	1	And	Luke uses this word to introduce the results of what the previous sentences described. Alternate translation: “So” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
LUK	20	7	w2bc	figs-quotations	ἀπεκρίθησαν, μὴ εἰδέναι πόθεν	1	they answered that they did not know from where	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this as a direct quotation. Alternate translation: “they replied, ‘We do not know where it came from’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
LUK	20	7	eeg7	figs-ellipsis	πόθεν	1	from where	Luke leaves out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages in order to be complete. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could supply these words from [20:4](../20/04.md). Alternate translation: “where John’s authority to baptize came from” or “who gave John the authority to baptize people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
LUK	20	8	d3bg	grammar-connect-logic-result	οὐδὲ ἐγὼ λέγω ὑμῖν	1	Nor will I tell you	Jesus is indicating that this is the result of what the Jewish leaders told him. Alternate translation: “Then I will not tell you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
LUK	20	9	mf5e	figs-parables	ἤρξατο δὲ πρὸς τὸν λαὸν λέγειν τὴν παραβολὴν ταύτην	1	Then he began to speak this parable to the people	To help the people understand what the Jewish leaders were doing by rejecting him and John the Baptist, Jesus tells a brief story that provides an illustration. Alternate translation: “Jesus told the people this story to help them understand better” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])
LUK	20	9	m360	writing-participants	ἄνθρωπος ἐφύτευσεν ἀμπελῶνα	1	A man planted a vineyard	Jesus uses this phrase to introduce the main character into the story. Alternate translation: “There once was a man who planted a vineyard” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
LUK	20	9	s8tt	translate-unknown	ἐξέδετο αὐτὸν γεωργοῖς	1	rented it to farmers	As the rest of the story shows, the man **rented** the vineyard not for regular cash payments, but under an arrangement that entitled him to a share of the crop in exchange for the use of the land. If an arrangement like that would not be familiar to your readers, you could translate this in a way that explains it. Alternate translation: “allowed some grape farmers to use it in exchange for a share of the crop” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	20	9	y37s		γεωργοῖς	1	farmers	While **farmers** is a general term for anyone who farms the ground, in this context it refers to people who tend grape vines and grow grapes. Alternate translation: “vine growers” or “grape farmers”
LUK	20	10	wm51	figs-explicit	καιρῷ	1	at the time	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state more explicitly what time this was. Alternate translation: “at the time at which they had agreed to give him a share of the crop” or “at harvest time” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	20	10	m361		γεωργοὺς…γεωργοὶ	1	farmers … farmers	See how you translated **farmers** in [20:9](../20/09.md). Alternate translation: “vine growers” or “grape farmers”
LUK	20	10	kr7j	figs-metaphor	ἀπὸ τοῦ καρποῦ τοῦ ἀμπελῶνος	1	of the fruit of the vineyard	The word **fruit** could be: (1) intended literally. Alternate translation: “some of the grapes they had grown” (2) figurative. Alternate translation: “some of what they had produced from the grapes they had grown” or “some of the money they had earned by selling their produce” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	20	10	m362	figs-explicit	οἱ…γεωργοὶ ἐξαπέστειλαν αὐτὸν, δείραντες κενόν	1	the farmers sent him away, having beaten him, empty	It may be helpful to state explicitly that the farmers did this after the servant arrived, as UST does. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	20	10	isk1	figs-metaphor	ἐξαπέστειλαν αὐτὸν…κενόν	1	sent him away empty	Jesus speaks figuratively of this servant as if he were a container with nothing in it. Alternate translation: “sent him away without giving him anything” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	20	11	r72a		ἀτιμάσαντες	1	treated him shamefully	Alternate translation: “humiliated him”
LUK	20	11	vxh2	figs-metaphor	ἐξαπέστειλαν κενόν	1	sent him away empty	See how you translated this in [20:10](../20/10.md). Alternate translation: “sent him away without giving him anything” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	20	12	m363	figs-nominaladj	τρίτον	1	a third	Jesus is using the adjective **third** as a noun in order to indicate a particular person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can specify the person. Alternate translation: “a third servant” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
LUK	20	12	lr3h	translate-ordinal	τρίτον	1	a third	If your language does not use ordinal numbers, you can use a cardinal number here. Alternate translation: “servant number three” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
LUK	20	12	ub4g		οἱ…καὶ τοῦτον τραυματίσαντες	1	they also wounded that one	Alternate translation: “they injured that servant as well”
LUK	20	12	h32a	figs-metaphor	ἐξέβαλον	1	threw him out	Jesus is likely speaking figuratively when he says that the farmers **threw** this servant out of the vineyard. It is unlikely that they actually picked him up and heaved him through the air. Alternate translation: “chased him off the property” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	20	13	m364		ὁ κύριος τοῦ ἀμπελῶνος	1	the lord of the vineyard	Alternate translation: “the owner of the vineyard” or “the man who had planted the vineyard”
LUK	20	13	kt8i	figs-quotesinquotes	εἶπεν…τί ποιήσω? πέμψω τὸν υἱόν μου τὸν ἀγαπητόν; ἴσως τοῦτον ἐντραπήσονται	1	said, ‘What should I do? I will send my beloved son. Perhaps they will respect him.’	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “asked himself what he should do. He decided to send his beloved son, hoping that the farmers would respect him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	20	13	m365		ἴσως τοῦτον ἐντραπήσονται	1	Perhaps they will respect him	In this context, the term that ULT translates as **perhaps** indicates something that is not certain but should be expected. If your language has a word or phrase that indicates the same thing, you can use it here in your translation. Alternate translation: “They ought to respect him”
LUK	20	14	ib2b	figs-explicit	ἰδόντες δὲ αὐτὸν, οἱ γεωργοὶ	1	But when the farmers saw him	It may be helpful to state explicitly that this happened after the owner sent his son and he arrived. Alternate translation: “So the owner sent his son. But when he arrived and the farmers saw him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	20	14	m366		οἱ γεωργοὶ	1	the farmers	See how you translated **farmers** in [20:9](../20/09.md). Alternate translation: “the vine growers” or “the grape farmers”
LUK	20	14	rvi4	figs-quotesinquotes	λέγοντες, οὗτός ἐστιν ὁ κληρονόμος; ἀποκτείνωμεν αὐτόν, ἵνα ἡμῶν γένηται ἡ κληρονομία	1	saying, ‘This is the heir. Let us kill him so that the inheritance may become ours’	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “saying that the son was the owner’s heir, and that they should kill him in order to get for themselves the vineyard he would have inherited” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	20	14	m367	figs-metonymy	ἡ κληρονομία	1	the inheritance	By **inheritance**, the farmers mean the vineyard, which the son would inherit. Alternate translation: “this vineyard, which he is going to inherit” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	20	15	u7us	grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ	1	And	Jesus uses this word to introduce the results of what the previous sentence described. The farmers carried out the plan they had decided on. Alternate translation: “So” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
LUK	20	15	m6en	figs-metaphor	ἐκβαλόντες αὐτὸν ἔξω τοῦ ἀμπελῶνος	1	they threw him out of the vineyard	As in [20:12](../20/12.md), Jesus is likely speaking figuratively when he says that the farmers **threw** the son out of the vineyard, as if they heaved him through the air. Alternate translation: “the vine growers forced the son out of the vineyard” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	20	15	dlu4	figs-rquestion	τί οὖν ποιήσει αὐτοῖς ὁ κύριος τοῦ ἀμπελῶνος?	1	What then will the lord of the vineyard do to them?	Jesus does not want the people to tell him what the owner of the vineyard will do. Rather, he is using the question form to get his listeners to pay attention to what he says the owner will do. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this as a statement. Alternate translation: “So now, listen to what the lord of the vineyard will do to them.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	20	15	m368		ὁ κύριος τοῦ ἀμπελῶνος	1	the lord of the vineyard	Alternate translation: “the owner of the vineyard” or “the man who had planted the vineyard”
LUK	20	16	m369		τοὺς γεωργοὺς τούτους	1	these farmers	See how you translated the term **farmers** in [20:9](../20/09.md). Your language might say “those” instead of **these** in a context like this. Alternate translation: “those vine growers” or “those grape farmers”
LUK	20	16	m370	translate-unknown	δώσει τὸν ἀμπελῶνα ἄλλοις	1	give the vineyard to others	See how you translated the similar expression in [20:9](../20/09.md). Alternate translation: “allow different grape farmers to use it in exchange for a share of the crop” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	20	16	k18g	figs-exclamations	μὴ γένοιτο	1	May it not be	This is an exclamation. Alternate translation: “May nothing like that ever happen” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations]])
LUK	20	17	qtb7	translate-symaction	ὁ δὲ ἐμβλέψας αὐτοῖς εἶπεν	1	But looking at them he said	Jesus was **looking at** the people to hold them accountable for understanding what he was saying. Alternate translation: “But Jesus looked straight at them and said” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
LUK	20	17	m371	figs-quotesinquotes	τί οὖν ἐστιν τὸ γεγραμμένον τοῦτο, λίθον ὃν ἀπεδοκίμασαν οἱ οἰκοδομοῦντες, οὗτος ἐγενήθη εἰς κεφαλὴν γωνίας	1	What then is this that is written: ‘The stone that the builders rejected, this has become the head of the corner’	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “What then does Scripture mean when it says that the stone that the builders rejected became the cornerstone” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	20	17	rf5f	figs-rquestion	τί οὖν ἐστιν τὸ γεγραμμένον τοῦτο	1	What then is this that is written	Jesus does not expect the people to explain the meaning of the scripture he is quoting. Rather, he is using the question form to get them to consider its implications carefully. Alternate translation: “Think carefully about what this scripture is saying” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	20	17	l6l3	figs-activepassive	τὸ γεγραμμένον τοῦτο	1	this that is written	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this passive verbal form with a noun. Alternate translation: “this scripture” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	20	17	a5kc	figs-metaphor	λίθον ὃν ἀπεδοκίμασαν οἱ οἰκοδομοῦντες, οὗτος ἐγενήθη εἰς κεφαλὴν γωνίας	1	The stone that the builders rejected, this has become the head of the corner	This is a quotation from Psalm 118, and it is a metaphor. It refers to the Messiah as if he were a stone that builders chose not to use. This means that people will reject him. When the psalm says that this stone became the cornerstone, this means figuratively that God will nevertheless make the Messiah the ruler of these people. However, since this is a quotation from Scripture, translate the words directly rather than providing a non-figurative explanation of them, even if your language does not customarily use such figures of speech. If you want to explain the meaning of the metaphor, we recommend that you do that in a footnote rather than in the Bible text. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	20	17	bd2f	figs-explicit	λίθον ὃν ἀπεδοκίμασαν οἱ οἰκοδομοῦντες	1	The stone that the builders rejected	The psalm refers implicitly to the way people in this culture used stones to build the walls of houses and other buildings. Alternate translation: “The stone that the builders thought was not good enough to use for building” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	20	17	bh2r	figs-idiom	κεφαλὴν γωνίας	1	the head of the corner	The phrase **the head of the corner** is an idiom that refers to a large stone with straight edges that builders would place down first and use as a reference to make sure that the walls of a stone building were straight and that the building was oriented in the right direction. Your language may have its own term for such a stone. You could also use a general expression. Alternate translation: “the cornerstone” or “the reference stone for the whole building” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	20	18	d7n2	figs-metaphor	πᾶς ὁ πεσὼν ἐπ’ ἐκεῖνον τὸν λίθον, συνθλασθήσεται	1	Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces	Jesus is applying the metaphor from the psalm to himself. He is speaking figuratively of people who reject him as Messiah as if they would fall over a stone and be injured. Jesus’ words are a direct allusion to the figurative language of Scripture, and he does not explain the metaphor to the people who are listening. So it would not be appropriate to change them into a non-figurative explanation of the metaphor, even if your language does not customarily use such figures of speech. If you want to explain the meaning of the metaphor, we recommend that you do that in a footnote rather than in the Bible text. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	20	18	n3n5	figs-activepassive	συνθλασθήσεται	1	will be broken to pieces	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “will break up into pieces” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	20	18	fdu6	figs-metaphor	ἐφ’ ὃν δ’ ἂν πέσῃ, λικμήσει αὐτόν	1	and on whomever it may fall, it will crush him	Jesus is making a further application of the metaphor from the psalm to himself. He is speaking figuratively of the Messiah judging those who reject him as if he were a large stone that would crush them. Once again it would not be appropriate to change Jesus’ words, which allude directly to the figurative language of Scripture, into a non-figurative explanation of the metaphor. However, you could explain the meaning of the metaphor in a footnote. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	20	19	vbf7	figs-metonymy	ἐζήτησαν…ἐπιβαλεῖν ἐπ’ αὐτὸν τὰς χεῖρας	1	sought to lay hands on him	The expression **to lay hands on** means figuratively to arrest a person by association with the way that arresting officers might physically take hold of the person with their **hands**. Alternate translation: “looked for a way to arrest Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	20	19	u4tz	figs-idiom	ἐν αὐτῇ τῇ ὥρᾳ	1	in that hour	Here Luke uses the term **hour** figuratively to refer to a specific time. Alternate translation: “right at that time” or “immediately” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	20	19	m372	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	καὶ ἐφοβήθησαν τὸν λαόν	1	and they feared the people	Luke uses the word **and** to introduce a contrast between what the Jewish leaders wanted to do and this reason why they were not able to do. Alternate translation: “but they were afraid of what the people might do” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
LUK	20	19	u4ta	figs-explicit	ἐφοβήθησαν τὸν λαόν	1	they feared the people	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state explicitly that the religious leaders did not arrest Jesus, even though they wanted to, and why they did not. Alternate translation: “but they knew that the people respected Jesus and they were afraid of what the people might do if they did arrest him, so they did not arrest him right then” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	20	19	m373	grammar-connect-logic-result	ἔγνωσαν γὰρ ὅτι πρὸς αὐτοὺς εἶπεν τὴν παραβολὴν ταύτην	1	for they knew that he had spoken this parable against them	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could make this the first clause in the verse, since it gives the reason why the religious leaders wanted to arrest Jesus. That is what UST does, making the clause a separate sentence. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
LUK	20	20	m374	grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ	1	And	Luke uses this word to introduce the results of what the previous sentence described. The religious leaders could not arrest Jesus openly, so this is what they did instead. Alternate translation: “So” or “Instead” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
LUK	20	20	f1en	writing-participants	ἀπέστειλαν ἐνκαθέτους	1	they sent spies	Luke uses this statement to introduce these **spies** as new characters into the story.

Alternate translation: “they found some people who agreed to act as spies, and they sent them to Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
LUK	20	20	m375		ὑποκρινομένους ἑαυτοὺς δικαίους εἶναι	1	who pretended themselves to be righteous	Alternate translation: “who pretended that they were sincere”
LUK	20	20	ml5w	figs-metaphor	ἵνα ἐπιλάβωνται αὐτοῦ λόγου	1	that they might take hold of his word	Luke says figuratively that these religious leaders wanted to **take hold** of something Jesus said, as if they could physically grasp his words. Alternate translation: “because they wanted to use something he might say against him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	20	20	m376	figs-metonymy	αὐτοῦ λόγου	1	his word	Luke uses the term **word** figuratively to mean something Jesus might say by using words. Alternate translation: “of something he might say” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	20	20	r84a	figs-doublet	ὥστε παραδοῦναι αὐτὸν τῇ ἀρχῇ καὶ τῇ ἐξουσίᾳ τοῦ ἡγεμόνος	1	in order to deliver him to the rule and to the authority of the governor	The terms **rule** and **authority** mean basically the same thing. Luke is likely using repetition for emphasis. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could combine these terms into a single, equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “so that the governor would take Jesus into custody” or “so that the governor would arrest Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
LUK	20	21	xn1w	figs-explicit	ἐπηρώτησαν αὐτὸν	1	they asked him	It may be helpful to state explicitly that this happened after the spies whom the leaders sent arrived where Jesus was. Alternate translation: “the spies came and asked Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	20	21	i3fr	figs-synecdoche	ἐπηρώτησαν αὐτὸν	1	they asked him	Luke could mean that one spy spoke on behalf of the whole group. So instead of **they**, you could state “one of them,” as UST does. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
LUK	20	21	m377		Διδάσκαλε	1	Teacher	**Teacher** is a respectful title. You could translate it with an equivalent term that your language and culture would use.
LUK	20	21	v93z	figs-exclusive	οἴδαμεν	1	we know	The spies are speaking only of themselves, so **we** would be exclusive, if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
LUK	20	21	fi1t	figs-metonymy	οὐ λαμβάνεις πρόσωπον	1	you do not receive a face	The spies are using the term **face** figuratively to mean “person.” Alternate translation: “it does not matter to you who a person is” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	20	21	ubu9	figs-metaphor	τὴν ὁδὸν τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	the way of God	The spies speak figuratively of how God wants people to live as if it were a **way** or path that people should follow. Alternate translation: “how God wants people to live” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	20	22	j6wb	figs-explicit	ἔξεστιν	1	Is it lawful	The spies are asking about God’s law, not the law of the Roman government. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “Does God’s law permit” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	20	22	m378		φόρον δοῦναι	1	to give tribute	Alternate translation: “to pay taxes”
LUK	20	22	h4cc	figs-metonymy	Καίσαρι	1	to Caesar	The spies are referring figuratively to the Roman government by Caesar’s name, since he was its ruler. Alternate translation: “to the Roman government” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	20	23	z9dm		κατανοήσας δὲ αὐτῶν τὴν πανουργίαν, εἶπεν	1	but perceiving their craftiness, he said	Alternate translation: “But Jesus realized that these spies were trying to trick him, and so he said”
LUK	20	24	j21y	translate-bmoney	δηνάριον	1	a denarius	See how you translated this in [7:41](../07/41.md). Alternate translation: “a Roman coin” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney]])
LUK	20	24	cvs9	figs-rquestion	τίνος ἔχει εἰκόνα καὶ ἐπιγραφήν?	1	Whose image and inscription does it have?	This is not a rhetorical question, since Jesus does want the spies to answer, even though he already knows the answer to the question himself and he is using it as a teaching tool. So it would not be appropriate to translate this as if it were a statement or an exclamation, for example, “Surely you can see whose picture and name are on this coin” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	20	24	wt51	figs-metonymy	ἐπιγραφήν	1	inscription	Jesus is referring figuratively to the name on the coin by association with the fact that it is an **inscription**, that is, something written on the coin. Alternate translation: “name” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	20	25	rey9	figs-metonymy	ἀπόδοτε τὰ Καίσαρος Καίσαρι, καὶ τὰ τοῦ Θεοῦ τῷ Θεῷ	1	give back the things of Caesar to Caesar, and the things of God to God	Jesus is referring figuratively to the Roman government by the name of **Caesar**, its ruler. Alternate translation: “pay the Roman government what it deserves, and pay God what he deserves” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	20	25	gj71	figs-ellipsis	καὶ τὰ τοῦ Θεοῦ τῷ Θεῷ	1	and the things of God to God	Jesus is speaking compactly and he does not repeat the verb **give back**, but it may be supplied from the previous phrase. AT: “and pay God what he deserves” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
LUK	20	26	wa3s	figs-metaphor	οὐκ ἴσχυσαν ἐπιλαβέσθαι τοῦ ῥήματος	1	they were not able to take hold of his word	Luke says figuratively that the spies had wanted to **take hold** of something Jesus said, as if they could physically grasp his words. Alternate translation: “the spies were not able to use what he said against him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	20	26	m379	figs-metaphor	ἐναντίον τοῦ λαοῦ	1	in front of the people	Luke speaks of this spatially to refer figuratively to the people’s attention. Alternate translation: “while the people were watching” or “while the people were listening” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	20	27	m380	writing-participants	προσελθόντες δέ τινες τῶν Σαδδουκαίων	1	Then some of the Sadducces came	Luke uses this statement to introduce these new characters into the story. It may be helpful to introduce them more fully in your translation. Alternate translation: “Some members of the group of Jews called the Sadducees then came to Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
LUK	20	27	m381	figs-explicit	προσελθόντες δέ τινες τῶν Σαδδουκαίων	1	Then some of the Sadducces came	The implication is that these people also wanted to discredit Jesus. Alternate translation: “Because they too wanted to discredit Jesus, some members of the group of Jews called the Sadducees then came to him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	20	27	m382	translate-names	τῶν Σαδδουκαίων	1	the Sadducees	**Sadducees** is the name of a group of Jews. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	20	27	f9e3	figs-distinguish	οἱ, λέγοντες ἀνάστασιν μὴ εἶναι	1	the ones who say there is no resurrection	This phrase is identifying the Sadducees as a group of Jews that said no one would rise from the dead. It is not identifying the Sadducees who came to question Jesus as members of that group who held that belief, as if other members did not. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could begin a new sentence here to clarify this. Alternate translation: “The Sadducees believe that no one will rise from the dead” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish]])
LUK	20	28	m383	figs-synecdoche	λέγοντες	1	saying	Luke could mean that one Sadducee spoke on behalf of the whole group, and you could indicate that as UST does. If you decide to do that, it may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “One of them said to Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
LUK	20	28	m384		Διδάσκαλε	1	Teacher	**Teacher** is a respectful title. You can translate it with an equivalent term that your language and culture would use.
LUK	20	28	m385	figs-metonymy	Μωϋσῆς ἔγραψεν ἡμῖν	1	Moses wrote for us	These Sadducees are figuratively describing Moses giving this instruction in the law by association with the way that he **wrote** it down. Alternate translation: “Moses instructed us in the law” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	20	28	m386	figs-exclusive	ἡμῖν	1	us	Here, the word **us** would be inclusive, if your language marks that distinction. The Sadducces mean “us Jews,” and they are speaking to Jesus, who is also a Jew. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
LUK	20	28	d6yl	figs-hypo	ἐάν τινος ἀδελφὸς ἀποθάνῃ ἔχων γυναῖκα, καὶ οὗτος ἄτεκνος ᾖ, ἵνα	1	if the brother of anyone should die, having a wife, and he is childless, that	Alternate translation: “if a man’s brother dies who is married but who does not have children” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
LUK	20	28	sjt5		λάβῃ ὁ ἀδελφὸς αὐτοῦ τὴν γυναῖκα	1	his brother should take his wife	Alternate translation: “that man should marry his dead brother’s widow”
LUK	20	28	pn1c	figs-metaphor	ἐξαναστήσῃ σπέρμα τῷ ἀδελφῷ αὐτοῦ	1	and raise up seed for his brother	The Sadducees assume that Jesus will know that this law specified that if the widow had children by her late husband’s brother, those children would be considered the children of her late husband. Alternate translation: “and have children who will be considered his brother’s descendants” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	20	28	m388	figs-metaphor	σπέρμα	1	seed	See how you translated this figurative sense of the word **seed** in [1:55](../01/55.md). Alternate translation: “descendants” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	20	29	c2jr	grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical	οὖν	1	Therefore	The Sadducees are not saying this to draw a logical inference, but to lead into a question about a hypothetical possibility. Alternate translation (as a separate sentence): “We would like to ask you how this law would be applied in a possible situation” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical]])
LUK	20	29	ax5n	figs-hypo	ἑπτὰ οὖν ἀδελφοὶ ἦσαν; καὶ ὁ πρῶτος, λαβὼν γυναῖκα, ἀπέθανεν ἄτεκνος	1	there were seven brothers, and the first, having taken a wife, died childless	While the Sadducees describe this as if it happened, they are actually asking about a hypothetical possibility in order to test Jesus. Alternate translation: “Suppose there were seven brothers, and the oldest brother got married, but he died before he had any children” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
LUK	20	29	si57	figs-nominaladj	ὁ πρῶτος	1	the first	Jesus is using the adjective **first** as a noun in order to indicate a particular person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can specify the person. Alternate translation: “the first brother” or “the oldest brother” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
LUK	20	29	m389	translate-ordinal	ὁ πρῶτος	1	the first	If your language does not use ordinal numbers, you can use a cardinal number here. Alternate translation: “brother number one” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
LUK	20	30	m390	figs-hypo	καὶ	1	and	The Sadducees are continuing to describe a hypothetical situation. It may be helpful to make this a separate sentence. Alternate translation: “And suppose that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
LUK	20	30	p5mw	figs-ellipsis	καὶ ὁ δεύτερος	1	and the second	The division at the end of this verse separates this subject from its verb, effectively creating an ellipsis that is not in the original Greek. The verb, “took her,” must now be supplied from the next verse. Alternate translation: “the second brother then married her” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
LUK	20	30	m391	figs-explicit	καὶ ὁ δεύτερος	1	and the second	The implication, as the next verse says specifically, is that after this second brother married the first brother’s widow, he too died before they had any children. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “and the second brother then married her, but he also died before they had any children” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	20	30	m392	figs-nominaladj	ὁ δεύτερος	1	the second	Jesus is using the adjective **second** as a noun in order to indicate a particular person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way.

LUK	20	31	m393	figs-hypo	καὶ	1	and	The Sadducees are continuing to describe a hypothetical situation. It may be helpful to make this a separate sentence. Alternate translation: “And suppose that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
LUK	20	31	d5tq	figs-explicit	ὁ τρίτος ἔλαβεν αὐτήν	1	the third took her	The implication, as the end of the verse says specifically, is that after this third brother married the widow, he too died before they had any children. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. It may be helpful to make this a separate sentence. Alternate translation: “The third brother then married her, but he also died before they had any children” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	20	31	m394	figs-nominaladj	ὁ τρίτος	1	the third	Jesus is using the adjective **third** as a noun in order to indicate a particular person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can specify the person. Alternate translation: “the third brother” or “the next oldest brother” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
LUK	20	31	ky9p	translate-ordinal	ὁ τρίτος	1	the third	If your language does not use ordinal numbers, you can use a cardinal number here. Alternate translation: “brother number three” or “the next oldest brother” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
LUK	20	31	f1fj	figs-explicit	ὡσαύτως δὲ καὶ οἱ ἑπτὰ, οὐ κατέλιπον τέκνα, καὶ ἀπέθανον	1	and likewise the seven also left no children, and died	The Sadducees are speaking in a compact way in order to keep the story short. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could supply the information they leave out from the context. It may be helpful to make this a separate sentence. Alternate translation: “In the same way, the rest of the seven brothers married this widow, but they all died before they had any children” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	20	33	avu1		ἐν τῇ…ἀναστάσει	1	in the resurrection	The Sadducees did not actually believe that there would be a resurrection. Your language may have a way of showing this. Alternate translation: “in the supposed resurrection” or “when people supposedly rise from the dead”
LUK	20	33	m395	figs-hypo	οὖν	1	Therefore	This introduces the question that the Sadducees had planned all along to ask Jesus about the hypothetical situation they were describing. If you said “Suppose” in the previous three verses, you could begin this sentence with “Then.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
LUK	20	33	m396		οἱ…ἑπτὰ ἔσχον αὐτὴν γυναῖκα	1	the seven had her as wife	Alternate translation: “each of the seven were married to her”

If your culture does not use different expressions like that, you can use a single term here. Alternate translation: “The people of this present world get married” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	20	34	m397	figs-activepassive	οἱ υἱοὶ τοῦ αἰῶνος τούτου γαμοῦσιν καὶ γαμίσκονται	1	The sons of this age marry and are given in marriage	If your language does not use passive verbal forms, but your culture does use different expressions for men and women when they marry, you can use two different active verbal forms here, and you can state who does the action in the second case. Alternate translation: “In this present world, men marry wives and parents give their daughters in marriage to husbands” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	20	34	n91c	figs-idiom	οἱ υἱοὶ τοῦ αἰῶνος τούτου	1	the sons of this age	The term **sons of** is an idiom that means the people in view share the qualities of something. In this case, Jesus is describing people who share the quality of living in the present world. Alternate translation: “The people of this present world” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	20	34	m398	figs-gendernotations	οἱ υἱοὶ	1	the sons	Jesus is using the word **sons** in a generic sense that includes both men and women. Alternate translation: “The people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
LUK	20	34	m399	figs-metonymy	τοῦ αἰῶνος τούτου	1	this age	As in [16:8](../16/08.md), here the term **age** means specifically the long period of time defined by the duration of the world; by association, it means the world itself. Alternate translation: “this present world” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	20	35	m8m9	figs-activepassive	οἱ…καταξιωθέντες…οὔτε γαμοῦσιν οὔτε γαμίζονται	1	those who are considered worthy … neither marry nor are given in marriage	As in [20:34](../20/34.md), if your language does not use passive verbal forms, but your culture does use different expressions for men and women when they marry, you can use two different active verbal forms here, and you can specify the agent in the second case. Alternate translation: “among the people whom God considers worthy … the men will not marry wives and parents will not give their daughters in marriage to husbands” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	20	35	m400	figs-activepassive	οἱ…καταξιωθέντες	1	those who are considered worthy	If your readers would misunderstand this, you can express this with an active form, and you can state who does the action. Alternate translation: “the people whom God considers worthy” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	20	35	m401	figs-metonymy	τοῦ αἰῶνος ἐκείνου, τυχεῖν καὶ τῆς ἀναστάσεως τῆς ἐκ νεκρῶν	1	to obtain that age and resurrection that is from the dead	Jesus is using the word **age** in the same figurative sense as in [18:30](../18/30.md), to mean the new world that God will introduce after the end of this present world. See how you translated the expression there. Alternate translation: “to live in his new world when he brings back to life the people who have died” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	20	35	ct9h	figs-abstractnouns	τυχεῖν…τῆς ἀναστάσεως τῆς ἐκ νεκρῶν	1	to obtain … the resurrection that is from the dead	If your readers would misunderstand the abstract noun **resurrection**, you could express the idea behind it with an equivalent expression.

LUK	20	35	rh62	figs-idiom	οὔτε γαμοῦσιν οὔτε γαμίζονται	1	neither marry nor are given in marriage	If your culture does not use different expressions for men and women when they marry, you may have you translated this with a single term in [20:34](../20/34.md). If so, you can do the same thing here. Alternate translation: “will not get married” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	20	36	lk28	figs-explicit	οὐδὲ…ἀποθανεῖν ἔτι δύνανται	1	neither are they able to die anymore	The implication is that these people will not need to get married and have children anymore in order to carry on the human race, because they will not die. Alternate translation: “they will not need to have children anymore, since they will not die” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	20	36	m402	figs-explicit	ἰσάγγελοι γάρ εἰσιν	1	for they are like the angels	Jesus assumes that his listeners will know that angels do not die.

Alternate translation: “because they will be like the angels, who do not die” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	20	36	m403	figs-gendernotations	υἱοί εἰσιν Θεοῦ	1	they are sons of God	Here Jesus is using the term **sons** in a generic sense that includes both men and women. Alternate translation: “they are God’s own children” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
LUK	20	36	btb3	figs-idiom	τῆς ἀναστάσεως υἱοὶ ὄντες	1	being sons of the resurrection	Jesus is using the term **sons** in this second case idiomatically to mean people who share the qualities of something. In this case, Jesus is describing people who share the quality of God bringing them back to life after they have died. Alternate translation: “since God has brought them back to life” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	20	37	j8z5	figs-activepassive	ἐγείρονται οἱ νεκροὶ	1	the dead are raised	If your readers would misunderstand this, you can express this with an active form, and you can state who does the action. Alternate translation: “God brings back to life people who have died” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	20	37	m404	figs-nominaladj	οἱ νεκροὶ	1	the dead	Jesus is using the adjective **dead** as a noun in order to indicate a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this with an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “people who have died” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
LUK	20	37	g3xg		καὶ Μωϋσῆς	1	even Moses	Jesus is using the word **even** for emphasis. He is stressing the authority of Moses as someone to whom God gave an extensive revelation of his character and actions. Alternate translation: “Moses himself”
LUK	20	37	m405	translate-names	Μωϋσῆς	1	Moses	**Moses** is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “at the burning bush” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	20	37	m406	figs-metonymy	ἐπὶ τῆς βάτου	1	at the bush	Jesus is not referring to the actual encounter that Moses had with God at the burning bush, since during that encounter Moses did not say the words that Jesus attributes to him here. Rather, God said those words about himself, and Moses recorded them in the Scriptures. So Jesus is referring by association to the passage in which Moses describes his encounter with God at the burning bush. Alternate translation: “in the passage where he wrote about the burning bush” or “in the scripture about the burning bush” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	20	37	nx7f	figs-verbs	λέγει	1	he calls	In many languages, it is conventional to use the present tense to describe what a writer does within a composition.

LUK	20	37	pqm8	figs-explicit	τὸν Θεὸν Ἀβραὰμ, καὶ Θεὸν Ἰσαὰκ, καὶ Θεὸν Ἰακώβ	1	the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob	The implication is that God would not have identified himself as the God of these men if they were not alive. This must mean that God brought them back to life after they died. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly, as UST does. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	20	37	m407	translate-names	Ἀβραὰμ…Ἰσαὰκ…Ἰακώβ	1	Abraham … Isaac … Jacob	translate-names
LUK	20	38	tdq7	grammar-connect-time-background	δὲ	1	And	Jesus uses this word to introduce a teaching about God that will help the Sadducees understand how God’s description of himself at the burning bush proves that God raises people from the dead. Alternate translation: “Now” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background]])
LUK	20	38	u1y5	figs-parallelism	οὐκ…νεκρῶν, ἀλλὰ ζώντων	1	not … of the dead, but of the living	These two phrases mean the same thing. Jesus is using repetition for emphasis. If your language does not use repetition in this way, you can express this idea with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “of living people only” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
LUK	20	38	m408	figs-nominaladj	νεκρῶν	1	the dead	Jesus is using the adjective **dead** as a noun in order to indicate a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this with an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “people who have died” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
LUK	20	38	dxi9	figs-nominaladj	ζώντων	1	the living	Jesus is using the adjective **living** as a noun in order to indicate a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this with an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “people who are alive” or “people whom he has brought back to life” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
LUK	20	38	i6am	figs-explicit	πάντες γὰρ αὐτῷ ζῶσιν	1	for all are alive to him	Interpreters understand this statement in various ways. One likely possibility is that Jesus is saying implicitly that after people die, while they are **dead** as far as other people are concerned, they are **alive** as far as God is concerned. That is because their spirits live on after death, and God is still able to relate to their spirits. Alternate translation: “because even after people die, God is still able to relate to them as living spirits” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	20	39	n5nq	writing-participants	ἀποκριθέντες δέ τινες τῶν γραμματέων εἶπαν	1	Then answering some of the scribes said	Luke uses this statement to reintroduce these characters into the story. Alternate translation: “There were some scribes listening to what Jesus was saying, and they responded” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
LUK	20	39	m409	figs-hendiadys	ἀποκριθέντες…εἶπαν	1	answering … said	Together the two words **answering** and **said** mean that these scribes responded to the teaching that Jesus gave in answer to the question that the Sadducees asked. Alternate translation: “responded” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
LUK	20	39	m410		Διδάσκαλε	1	Teacher	**Teacher** is a respectful title. You could translate it with an equivalent term that your language and culture would use.
LUK	20	40	m411	figs-doublenegatives	οὐκέτι…ἐτόλμων ἐπερωτᾶν αὐτὸν οὐδέν	1	they no longer dared to ask him anything	Here Luke uses a double negative in Greek for emphasis, saying **no longer** and “nothing.” The second negative does not cancel the first to create a positive meaning, “they still dared to ask him something.” If for emphasis your language uses double negatives that do not cancel one another, it would be appropriate to use that construction here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
LUK	20	40	vjx9	figs-explicit	οὐκέτι…ἐτόλμων ἐπερωτᾶν αὐτὸν οὐδέν	1	they no longer dared to ask him anything	The implication in context is that Jesus’ enemies were afraid that if they continued to ask him difficult questions, his wise answers would continue to show how much more he understood than they did. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “they were afraid to ask him any more difficult questions, because they realized he would give more wise answers that would show how much more he understood than they did” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	20	40	i6sv	writing-pronouns	οὐκέτι…ἐτόλμων	1	they no longer dared	It is unclear whether **they** refers to the scribes, the Sadducees, or everyone who had been trying to trap Jesus with difficult questions. It may be best to translate this with a general statement. Alternate translation: “Jesus’ enemies no longer dared” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
LUK	20	41	t981	writing-pronouns	εἶπεν…πρὸς αὐτούς	1	he said to them	As in [20:40](../20/40.md), it is unclear to whom the pronoun **them** refers. It may be best to translate it with a general statement here as well. Alternate translation: “Jesus said to those who were listening” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
LUK	20	41	mda6	figs-rquestion	πῶς λέγουσιν τὸν Χριστὸν εἶναι Δαυεὶδ Υἱόν?	1	How do they say that the Christ is the son of David?	This does not seem to be a rhetorical question that Jesus is using as a teaching tool. Rather, it seems to be a question that Jesus wanted his listeners to try to answer. They had asked him some difficult questions, and they had admitted that he answered them well. Now, in return, he is asking them a difficult question. None of them will be able to answer it, and this will demonstrate his wisdom even further. His question actually will teach something to those who are able to recognize its implications. But it would be appropriate to leave it in question form and not translate it as a statement. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	20	41	sq2g	writing-pronouns	λέγουσιν	1	they say	Here Jesus is using the pronoun **they** in an indefinite sense. He does not have specific individuals in mind. Alternate translation: “do people say that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
LUK	20	41	b7rb	figs-metaphor	Δαυεὶδ Υἱόν	1	the son of David	Here Jesus is using the term **son** figuratively to mean “descendant.” Alternate translation: “a descendant of King David” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	20	41	m412	translate-names	Δαυεὶδ	1	David	**David** is the name of a man, Israel’s most important king. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	20	42	y972	figs-rpronouns	αὐτὸς γὰρ Δαυεὶδ	1	For David himself	Jesus uses the word **himself** here to emphasize to that it was **David**, the very person whom the scribes call the father of the Christ, who spoke the words in the quotation that follows. Use a way that is natural in your language to indicate this emphasis. Alternate translation: “None other than David” or “David, the very person whom you call the father of the Christ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns]])
LUK	20	42	z0vc	grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	For	Jesus uses the word **For** to introduce the reason why he has asked this question. Alternate translation: "I ask this question because" See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
LUK	20	42	m413		λέγει	1	says	In many languages, it is conventional to use the present tense to describe what a writer does within a composition. However, if that would not be natural in your language, you could use the past tense here. Alternate translation: “said”
LUK	20	42	h2al	figs-quotesinquotes	λέγει ἐν βίβλῳ Ψαλμῶν, εἶπεν ὁ Κύριος τῷ Κυρίῳ μου, κάθου ἐκ δεξιῶν μου	1	says in the book of Psalms, ‘The Lord said to my Lord, “Sit at my right	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation, and then another quotation within that one. Alternate translation: “says in the book of Psalms that the Lord told his Lord to sit at his right side” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	20	42	e1i2	figs-euphemism	εἶπεν ὁ Κύριος τῷ Κυρίῳ μου	1	The Lord said to my Lord	Here, the term **Lord** does not refer to the same person in both instances. The first instance is representing the name Yahweh, which David actually uses in this psalm. In order to honor the commandment not to misuse God’s name, Jewish people often avoided saying that name and said **Lord** instead. The second instance is the regular term for “lord” or “master.” ULT and UST capitalize the word because it refers to the Messiah. Alternate translation: “The Lord God said to my Lord” or “God said to my Lord” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
LUK	20	42	m415	figs-nominaladj	κάθου ἐκ δεξιῶν μου	1	Sit at my right	In this quotation, Yahweh is using the adjective **right** as a noun in order to indicate his right side. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could state that specifically. Alternate translation: “Sit at my right side” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
LUK	20	42	pse3	translate-symaction	κάθου ἐκ δεξιῶν μου	1	Sit at my right	The seat at the right side of a ruler was a position of great honor and authority. By telling the Messiah to sit there, God was symbolically conferring honor and authority on him. Alternate translation: “Sit in the place of honor beside me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
LUK	20	43	m416	figs-quotesinquotes	ἕως ἂν θῶ τοὺς ἐχθρούς σου ὑποπόδιον τῶν ποδῶν σου	1	until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet	This is the continuation of a quotation within a quotation within a quotation. If you decided in [20:42](../20/42.md) to have only one level of quotation, you can make the same adjustment here. Alternate translation: “until he made his enemies a footstool for his feet” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	20	43	fl1h	figs-metaphor	ἕως ἂν θῶ τοὺς ἐχθρούς σου ὑποπόδιον τῶν ποδῶν σου	1	until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet	The psalm speaks figuratively of the Messiah using his enemies as a **footstool** to mean that Yahweh would make those enemies stop resisting the Messiah and submit to him. Alternate translation: “until I conquer your enemies for you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	20	43	m418	figs-metaphor	ὑποπόδιον τῶν ποδῶν σου	1	a footstool for your feet	If your readers would not know what a **footstool** is, you can use a general expression. Alternate translation: “something on which you can rest your feet” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	20	44	m419	figs-quotesinquotes	Δαυεὶδ οὖν, Κύριον, αὐτὸν καλεῖ	1	David therefore calls him ‘Lord’	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “David therefore calls the Messiah his Lord” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	20	44	zk2h	figs-explicit	Δαυεὶδ οὖν, Κύριον, αὐτὸν καλεῖ	1	David therefore calls him ‘Lord’	In this culture, an ancestor was more respected than a descendant. But to call someone **Lord** was to address that person as the more respected one. As the General Notes to this chapter describe, this is a paradox, that is, is a statement that describes two things that seem as if they cannot both be true at the same time, but which actually are both true. Jesus is calling attention to this paradox to get his listeners to think more deeply about who the Messiah is. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate explicitly what makes this a paradox. Alternate translation: “David therefore addresses the Messiah respectfully as his Lord. But if the Messiah is his descendant, David should be the more respected person” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	20	44	k1tp	figs-rquestion	καὶ πῶς υἱός αὐτοῦ ἐστιν	1	And how is he his son	Like the question in [20:41](../20/41.md), this seems to be a question that Jesus wanted his listeners to try to answer, even though he is also using it to teach. It is a difficult question, like the ones they asked him, which he answered well. They will not be able to answer his question, and this should give them a further appreciation for his wisdom, in addition to what they might learn from reflecting on the question later. So it would be appropriate to leave it in question form and not translate it as a statement. Alternate translation: “So why do people say that the Messiah is David’s descendant” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	20	44	m427	grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ	1	And	Jesus is using this word to show that a conclusion should be drawn as a result of what he has just said, and that this conclusion would be different from what his listeners had previously believed. Alternate translation: “So” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
LUK	20	44	m426	figs-metaphor	υἱός	1	son	Here Jesus is using the term **son** figuratively to mean “descendant.” Alternate translation: “descendant” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	20	45	k3pf	grammar-connect-time-sequential	δὲ	1	And	Luke uses this word to indicate that after asking his own difficult question to the people who had been trying to trap him, Jesus turned to speak to his disciples. Alternate translation: “Then” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
LUK	20	45	m420	figs-hyperbole	παντὸς τοῦ λαοῦ	1	all the people	Luke is generalizing to refer to everyone who was present as Jesus was teaching. Alternate translation: “all the people who were there” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
LUK	20	46	m421	figs-metonymy	προσέχετε ἀπὸ τῶν γραμματέων	1	Beware of the scribes	Jesus says **beware** to warn about the influence of these people. He is not saying that the scribes themselves are physically dangerous, but that it would be dangerous spiritually to follow their example. Alternate translation: “Be careful not to follow the example of the scribes” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	20	46	ang2	translate-symaction	θελόντων περιπατεῖν ἐν στολαῖς	1	who desire to walk in long robes	In this culture, **long robes** were a symbol of wealth and status. To walk around in public in a long robe was to assert wealth and status. Alternate translation: “who like to walk around looking important in their long robes” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
LUK	20	46	m422	figs-explicit	φιλούντων ἀσπασμοὺς	1	love greetings	The implication is that these would be respectful greetings, in which the scribes would be addressed by important titles. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “love to be greeted respectfully” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	20	46	m423	figs-metaphor	πρωτοκαθεδρίας…πρωτοκλισίας	1	the first seats … the first places	As in [14:7](../14/07.md), **first** here figuratively means “best.” Alternate translation: “the best seats … the best places” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	20	47	m424	figs-metonymy	οἳ κατεσθίουσιν τὰς οἰκίας τῶν χηρῶν	1	They devour the houses of widows	Jesus speaks figuratively of the **houses** of widows to mean their wealth and possessions, which they would have in their houses. Alternate translation: “They defraud widows of everything they own” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	20	47	c7yv	figs-metaphor	οἳ κατεσθίουσιν τὰς οἰκίας τῶν χηρῶν	1	They devour the houses of widows	Jesus says figuratively that the scribes **devour** or eat up the possessions of widows to mean that they continually ask the widows for money until the widows have none left. Alternate translation: “They defraud widows of everything they own” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	20	47	g67x		προφάσει μακρὰ προσεύχονται	1	for a pretext they pray at length	Here, **pretext** refers to something that someone would do in order to appear a certain way. Alternate translation: “in order to seem godly, they offer long prayers”
LUK	20	47	zpp5	figs-metonymy	οὗτοι λήμψονται περισσότερον κρίμα	1	These will receive greater condemnation	Jesus is using the word **condemnation** figuratively to mean the punishment that a person would receive after being condemned (found guilty) for doing something wrong. Alternate translation: “These scribes will receive greater punishment” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	20	47	zpx5	figs-explicit	οὗτοι λήμψονται περισσότερον κρίμα	1	These will receive greater condemnation	The implication seems to be that these proud and greedy scribes will receive **greater** punishment than they would have if they had not pretended to be so godly. It is also implicit that God will be the one who punishes them. Alternate translation: “God will punish these scribes more severely because they do all these wrong things while pretending to be godly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	21	intro	ny7d			0		# Luke 21 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>1. Jesus teaches about a widow who gave her little money to God (21:1-4)<br>2. Jesus tells his disciples what will happen before he returns (21:5-38)<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### “the times of the nations”<br><br>The Jews spoke of the time between when the Babylonians forced their ancestors to go to Babylon and the time when the Messiah would come as “the times of the nations.” In this expression, the term “nations” means people groups who are not Jews, that is, the Gentiles. So this expression meant the time when the Gentiles ruled over the Jews.<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Paradox<br><br>A paradox is a statement that describes two things that seem as if they cannot both be true at the same time, but which actually are both true. There is a paradox in this chapter. Jesus tells his disciples in [21:16](../21/16.md), “they will put to death some of you,” but then, in [21:18](../21/18.md), he tells them, “not even a hair of your head will perish.” As a note to [21:18](../21/18.md) explains, Jesus means this second statement in a spiritual sense.
LUK	21	1	k2zb	writing-background	δὲ	1	And	Luke uses this word to introduce background information that will help readers understand what happens next in the story. Alternate translation: “Now” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
LUK	21	1	m425	writing-newevent	εἶδεν τοὺς βάλλοντας εἰς τὸ γαζοφυλάκιον τὰ δῶρα αὐτῶν πλουσίους	1	he saw the rich who were putting their gifts into the treasury	This background information that Luke provides introduces a new event in the story. Alternate translation: “he noticed that there were some rich people who were placing gifts of money in the offering boxes” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
LUK	21	1	m428	figs-nominaladj	τοὺς…πλουσίους	1	the rich	Jesus is using the adjective **rich** as a noun in order to indicate a type of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this with an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “rich people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
LUK	21	1	nf4c	figs-explicit	τὰ δῶρα	1	gifts	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state explicitly what the **gifts** were. Alternate translation: “gifts of money” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	21	1	unv2	figs-metonymy	τὸ γαζοφυλάκιον	1	the treasury	Luke is figuratively describing the boxes in the temple courtyard where people put money that they were giving to God by association with the name of the place where this money would be kept until it was needed, the **treasury**. Alternate translation: “the offering boxes” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	21	2	xrk2	writing-participants	εἶδεν δέ τινα χήραν πενιχρὰν	1	And he saw a certain poor widow	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new character into the story. If your language has its own way of doing that, you can use it here in your translation. Alternate translation: “There was also a poor widow there, and Jesus saw her” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
LUK	21	2	vzu8	translate-bmoney	λεπτὰ δύο	1	two lepta	The word **lepta** is the plural of “lepton.” A lepton was a small bronze or copper coin equivalent to a few minutes’ wages. It was the least valuable coin that people used in this culture. You could try to express this amount in terms of current monetary values, but that might cause your Bible translation to become outdated and inaccurate, since those values can change over time. So instead you might use the name of the least valuable coin in your culture, or a general expression. Alternate translation: “two pennies” or “two small coins of little value” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney]])
LUK	21	3	i8gf	figs-explicit	εἶπεν	1	he said	Jesus is still speaking to his disciples, as in [20:45](../20/45.md). If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “he said to his disciples” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	21	3	t97j		ἀληθῶς λέγω ὑμῖν	1	Truly I say to you	Jesus says this to emphasize the importance of what he is about to say. Alternate translation: “I can assure you”
LUK	21	3	rwt3	figs-metaphor	ἡ χήρα αὕτη ἡ πτωχὴ, πλεῖον πάντων ἔβαλεν	1	this poor widow put in more than all	Even though it is not literally true that the widow has put more money into the offering box than all the rich people, this is still not figurative language. As Jesus explains in the next verse, he means that she has put in proportionately more than all the others, relative to her means, and that is literally true. But Jesus makes the seemingly untrue statement first, to get his disciples to reflect on how it can be true. So it would be appropriate to translate Jesus’ words directly and not interpret them as if they were figurative. For example, it would be a figurative interpretation to say, “God considers what this poor widow has given to be more valuable than the gifts of all the others” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	21	3	m429	figs-explicit	πάντων	1	all	In context, **all** means specifically all of the rich people who were putting large monetary gifts in the collection boxes. Alternate translation: “all of those rich people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	21	4	x3qb		ἐκ τοῦ περισσεύοντος αὐτοῖς ἔβαλον εἰς τὰ δῶρα	1	put in the gifts out of their abundance	Alternate translation: “had a lot of money but only gave a small portion of it”
LUK	21	4	gaj8		αὕτη δὲ ἐκ τοῦ ὑστερήματος αὐτῆς, πάντα τὸν βίον ὃν εἶχεν ἔβαλεν	1	But she, out of her poverty, put in all the livelihood that she had	Alternate translation: “But she only had a very little money but gave everything she had to live on”
LUK	21	5	vgp3	figs-explicit	τινων	1	some	The implication is that these were some of Jesus’ disciples. Alternate translation: “some of Jesus’ disciples” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	21	5	m430	figs-activepassive	κεκόσμηται	1	it was decorated	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “people had decorated it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	21	5	vk7z	figs-metonymy	ἀναθέμασιν	1	offerings	In this context, **offerings** refers specifically to golden ornaments that people had given to beautify the temple and its courtyards. The ornaments were known by this name since people had given them as offerings. Alternate translation: “ornaments that people had donated” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	21	6	lcz6		ταῦτα ἃ θεωρεῖτε	1	These things that you are looking at	Alternate translation: “As for this beautiful temple and its decorations”
LUK	21	6	wcd9	figs-idiom	ἐλεύσονται ἡμέραι ἐν αἷς	1	the days will come in which	Here Jesus is using the term **days** figuratively to refer to a specific time. Alternate translation: “there will be a time when” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	21	6	jfl1	figs-activepassive	οὐκ ἀφεθήσεται λίθος ἐπὶ λίθῳ	1	stone upon stone will not be left	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form, and you can state who will do the action. Alternate translation: “your enemies will not leave one stone upon another” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	21	6	ajx2		οὐκ ἀφεθήσεται λίθος ἐπὶ λίθῳ	1	stone upon stone will not be left	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could make this statement in positive form. Alternate translation: “your enemies will topple every stone off the stone it is resting on”
LUK	21	6	dps1	figs-hyperbole	οὐκ ἀφεθήσεται λίθος ἐπὶ λίθῳ	1	stone upon stone will not be left	See how you translated the similar expression “they will not leave stone upon stone” in [19:44](../19/44.md). Here as well this is a figurative overstatement to emphasize how completely the enemies of the Jews will destroy the temple. Alternate translation: “your enemies will completely destroy this building of stone” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
LUK	21	6	m431		ὃς οὐ καταλυθήσεται	1	which will not be torn down	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could make this statement in positive form and make it a separate sentence. Alternate translation: “Every stone will be torn down”
LUK	21	6	m432	figs-activepassive	ὃς οὐ καταλυθήσεται	1	which will not be torn down	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this as a separate sentence with an active form, and you can state who will do the action. (In the alternate translation that is suggested here, “they” would mean “your enemies,” and “it” would mean “this building of stone,” as in the alternate translation in the last note to the previous phrase in this verse.) Alternate translation: “They will tear it all down” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	21	7	rix4	writing-pronouns	ἐπηρώτησαν…αὐτὸν	1	they asked him	The pronoun **they** refers to Jesus’ disciples, and the word **him** refers to Jesus. Alternate translation: “the disciples asked Jesus” or “Jesus’ disciples asked him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
LUK	21	7	m433		Διδάσκαλε	1	Teacher	**Teacher** is a respectful title. You could translate it with an equivalent term that your language and culture would use.
LUK	21	7	a11j	figs-explicit	πότε οὖν ταῦτα ἔσται, καὶ τί τὸ σημεῖον ὅταν μέλλῃ ταῦτα γίνεσθαι	1	when therefore will these things be, and what will be the sign when these things are about to happen	The phrase **these things** refers implicitly to what Jesus has just said about enemies destroying the temple. Alternate translation: “then when will the temple be destroyed, and how will we know that our enemies are about to destroy it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	21	8	bbri	figs-quotesinquotes	βλέπετε μὴ πλανηθῆτε; πολλοὶ γὰρ ἐλεύσονται ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματί μου λέγοντες, ἐγώ εἰμι, καί, ὁ καιρὸς ἤγγικεν	1	Be careful that you are not deceived. For many will come in my name, saying, ‘I am {he},’ and, ‘The time has come near.’	If the direct quotation inside a direct quotation would be confusing in your language, you could translate the second direct quotation as an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: “Be careful that you are not deceived. For many will come in my name, saying that they are the Messiah.

LUK	21	14	q1s1	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	οὖν	1	But	**But** is usually translated “therefore” because it typically introduces a result or conclusion from something that has just been said.

LUK	21	36	h83d	figs-metaphor	καὶ σταθῆναι ἔμπροσθεν τοῦ Υἱοῦ τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου	1	and to stand before the Son of Man	Here, **stand** is an idiom that means to be declared innocent when judged, as in [Psalm 130:3](../psa/130/03.md), “If you, Yahweh, would mark iniquities, Lord, who could stand?” (That is, “If you, Yahweh, kept a record of sins, no one would be declared innocent.”) Jesus is referring to the time when he will judge everyone.

LUK	22	intro	y8nr			0		# Luke 22 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>1. Judas Iscariot agrees to betray Jesus to his enemies (22:1-6)<br>2. Jesus shares the Passover meal with his disciples (22:7-38)<br>3. Jesus prays on the Mount of Olives and is arrested there (22:39-53)<br>4. Peter denies Jesus (22:54-62)<br>5. Soldiers mock Jesus and the Jewish leaders question him (22:63-71)<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### The meaning of the “body” and “blood” of Jesus<br><br>[22:14-20](../22/14.md) describes Jesus’ last meal with his followers. During this meal, Jesus said of the bread, “This is my body,” and of the wine, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood.” As Jesus instructed, Christian churches around the world re-enact this meal regularly, calling it “the Lord’s Supper,” the “Eucharist”, or “Holy Communion.” But they have different understandings of what Jesus meant by these sayings. Some churches believe that Jesus was speaking figuratively and that he meant that the bread and wine represented his body and blood. Other churches believe that he was speaking literally and that the actual body and blood of Jesus are really present in the bread and wine of this ceremony. Translators should be careful not to let how they understand this issue affect how they translate this passage.<br><br>### The new covenant<br><br>Some people think that Jesus established the new covenant during the supper. Others think he established it after he went up to heaven. Others think it will not be established until Jesus comes again. Your translation should say no more about this than ULT does. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/covenant]])<br><br>## Important textual issues in this chapter<br><br>### “And an angel from heaven appeared to him … his sweat became like drops of blood falling on the ground”<br><br>Verses 43 and 44 of Luke 22 are not in the earliest and most accurate manuscripts of the Bible, and so they are likely not an original part of the Gospel of Luke. However, many scholars consider them to provide accurate accounts of real events in Jesus’ life that were preserved in oral or written traditions about him and copied into the book of Luke at an early stage. ULT and UST include these verses, but some other versions do not. If you decide to translate these verses, you should put them inside square brackets to indicate that they are probably not original to Luke’s Gospel. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])

LUK	22	3	m501	figs-nominaladj	ὄντα ἐκ τοῦ ἀριθμοῦ τῶν δώδεκα	1	who was from the number of the Twelve	See how you translated this in [8:1](../08/01.md).

LUK	22	3	m502	translate-names	τῶν δώδεκα	1	the Twelve	You may have decided instead in [8:1](../08/01.md) to translate this as a title, even if your language does not ordinarily use adjectives as nouns. If so, you can do the same thing here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	22	4	qpi4	figs-explicit	στρατηγοῖς	1	captains	The temple had its own guards, and these were their commanding officers. Alternate translation: “captains of the temple guard” or “temple military officers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	22	4	s7qx	writing-pronouns	πῶς αὐτοῖς παραδῷ αὐτόν	1	how he might deliver him to them	The pronoun **him** refers to Jesus. Alternate translation: “how he could help them arrest Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])

LUK	22	5	usn7	figs-metonymy	αὐτῷ ἀργύριον δοῦναι	1	to give him silver	Luke is speaking figuratively of money by reference to the precious metal, **silver**, that gives it its value. Alternate translation: “to pay Judas money for doing this” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

You could translate this as either a description or as a name, depending on what you did there.

LUK	22	7	rqi1	figs-metonymy	ἔδει θύεσθαι τὸ Πάσχα	1	it was necessary to sacrifice the Passover	Luke is using the name of this part of the festival, **Passover**, to refer figuratively to the lamb that the law of Moses told Jews to kill and eat for their celebration meal.

LUK	22	8	abcs	writing-pronouns	ἀπέστειλεν	1	he sent	The pronoun **he** refers to Jesus. Alternate translation: “Jesus sent” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
LUK	22	8	m503	translate-names	Πέτρον…Ἰωάννην	1	Peter … John	These are the names of two men. See how you translated them in [6:14](../06/14.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	22	8	m504	figs-youdual	πορευθέντες, ἑτοιμάσατε	1	Going, prepare	Since Jesus is speaking to two men, **you** as implied in the participle and imperative verb would be in the dual, if your language uses that form. Otherwise, it would be plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
LUK	22	8	nkz4	figs-explicit	πορευθέντες	1	Going	The implication is that Jesus is sending Peter and John into the city of Jerusalem to do this. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Your language might translate this as an imperative. Alternate translation: “Go into the city of Jerusalem and” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	22	8	e4ev	figs-exclusive	ἡμῖν…ἵνα φάγωμεν	1	us … that we may eat	Peter and John would be part of the group that would eat the meal, so the terms **us** and **we** would be inclusive, if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

LUK	22	9	j52e	figs-exclusive	θέλεις ἑτοιμάσωμεν	1	do you wish that we should prepare it	Jesus was not part of the group that would prepare the meal, so the word **we** does not include Jesus and it would be exclusive, if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
LUK	22	9	s8yw	figs-verbs	ἑτοιμάσωμεν	1	that we should prepare it	Peter and John are speaking as a group of two, so this verb would be in the dual form if your language uses that form. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-verbs]])
LUK	22	10	um6z	figs-youdual	αὐτοῖς…ὑμῶν…ὑμῖν…ἀκολουθήσατε	1	them … you … you … follow	Since Jesus is speaking to two men, the pronouns **them** and **you** and the implied **you** in the imperative verb would all be in the dual form, if your language uses that form.

LUK	22	10	c13w	figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	Behold	Jesus uses this word to tell Peter and John to pay close attention to what he is saying and to do exactly what he tells them.

LUK	22	10	a677	translate-unknown	κεράμιον ὕδατος	1	a pitcher of water	This means not a small serving **pitcher**, but a large earthen jug, which the man would likely be carrying on his shoulder. If your language has its own term for a large container that people use to transport water, you can use it here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	22	11	khy9	figs-quotesinquotes	ἐρεῖτε τῷ οἰκοδεσπότῃ τῆς οἰκίας, λέγει σοι ὁ διδάσκαλος, ποῦ ἐστιν τὸ κατάλυμα, ὅπου τὸ Πάσχα μετὰ τῶν μαθητῶν μου φάγω?	1	say to the master of the house, ‘The Teacher says to you, “Where is the guest room where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?”’	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation and then another quotation within that one. Alternate translation: “tell the owner of the house that the Teacher wants to know where the guest room is where he can eat the Passover meal with his disciples” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	22	11	iv6f		ὁ διδάσκαλος	1	the Teacher	**Teacher** is a respectful title for Jesus. You could translate it with an equivalent term that your language and culture would use.

LUK	22	12	lg2z	translate-unknown	ἀνάγαιον	1	upper room	In this culture, in some houses, rooms were built above other rooms.

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	22	12	m506	figs-activepassive	ἐστρωμένον	1	furnished	This is a passive verbal form. If your language does not use such forms, you can translate this with an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “that has carpets, dining couches, and a dining table” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	22	13	m507	grammar-connect-logic-result	δὲ	1	And	Luke uses this word to introduce the results of what the previous sentences described. Because Jesus told Peter and John to do this, they did it. Alternate translation: “So” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
LUK	22	13	g9ty	figs-explicit	ἀπελθόντες	1	they went	The implication is that these two disciples went into the city of Jerusalem, as Jesus had told them to do. Alternate translation: “Peter and John went into the city of Jerusalem” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	22	13	m508	figs-metonymy	τὸ Πάσχα	1	the Passover	Luke is using the name of this part of the festival, **Passover**, to refer figuratively to the meal that people shared on that occasion. Alternate translation: “the Passover meal” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

LUK	22	14	lnc6	translate-unknown	ἀνέπεσεν	1	he reclined to eat	See how you translated this in [5:29](../05/29.md). It was the custom in this culture for dinner guests to eat while lying comfortably around the table on banqueting couches. Alternate translation: “Jesus took his place at the table” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	22	15	hue3	figs-explicitinfo	ἐπιθυμίᾳ ἐπεθύμησα	1	With desire I have desired	Jesus is using a characteristic Hebrew construction, a cognate noun with a verb, to express intensity. If your language has this same construction, you can use it here. But if this construction would seem to express unnecessary extra information in your language, you could show the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “I have wanted very much” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo]])
LUK	22	15	m509	figs-metonymy	τοῦτο τὸ Πάσχα	1	this Passover	Jesus is using the name of this part of the festival, **Passover**, to refer figuratively to the meal that people shared on that occasion. Alternate translation: “this Passover meal” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

Alternate translation: “before I experience a painful death” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	22	16	m510	translate-versebridge	γὰρ	1	For	Jesus is giving the reason why he has been so eager to share this Passover meal with his disciples, as he said in the previous verse. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could put this reason before the result by creating a verse bridge. You could combine [22:15](../22/15.md) and [22:16](../22/16.md), putting all of [22:16](../22/16.md) first, followed by all of [22:15](../22/15.md). This would require saying “this Passover meal” in [22:16](../22/16.md) and **it** in [22:15](../22/15.md). You could have no introductory word for [22:16](../22/16.md) and begin [22:15](../22/15.md) with “And so.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge]])
LUK	22	16	gbj7		λέγω…ὑμῖν	1	I say to you	Jesus says this to emphasize the importance of what he is about to say. Alternate translation: “I can assure you”
LUK	22	16	m511	figs-explicit	οὐ μὴ φάγω αὐτὸ	1	I will certainly not eat it	Since Jesus is just about to eat a Passover meal, he means implicitly that he will not eat such a meal again until the later time he describes.

LUK	22	16	k28r	figs-activepassive	ἕως ὅτου πληρωθῇ ἐν τῇ Βασιλείᾳ τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	until when it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who will do the action. See the discussion in the General Notes to this chapter. This could mean: (1) “until people celebrate this feast in the kingdom of God.” (2) “until God gives this feast its full meaning when he establishes his kingdom.” (3) “until I die as the true Passover sacrifice and establish the kingdom of God.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	22	17	l5e6	figs-metonymy	δεξάμενος ποτήριον	1	he took a cup	Luke is using the term **cup** figuratively to mean what it contained, which was wine. Alternate translation: “Jesus picked up a cup of wine” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	22	17	d7pc		εὐχαριστήσας	1	having given thanks	Your language may require you to state the object of the verb. Alternate translation: “when he had given thanks to God”
LUK	22	17	xvm7	figs-metonymy	διαμερίσατε εἰς ἑαυτούς	1	divide it among yourselves	Jesus meant that the apostles were to divide up the contents of the cup, not the cup itself. Alternate translation: “share the wine that is in this cup among yourselves” or “each of you drink some wine from this cup” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	22	18	m512	translate-versebridge	γὰρ	1	For	Jesus is giving the reason why he wants his disciples to share the wine, as he told them to do in the previous verse. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could put this reason before the result by combining this verse and the previous one into a verse bridge. See the suggestions in the note about the similar situation in [22:16](../22/16.md) for how you might do this. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge]])
LUK	22	18	m78n		λέγω…ὑμῖν	1	I say to you	Jesus is using this phrase to emphasize the importance of what he is about to say. Alternate translation: “I can assure you”
LUK	22	18	h5tl	figs-metonymy	ἀπὸ τοῦ γενήματος τῆς ἀμπέλου	1	of the fruit of the vine	Jesus is referring figuratively to the juice that people squeeze from grapes that grow on grapevines as if it were the **fruit** or grapes themselves.

LUK	22	18	m513	figs-abstractnouns	ἕως οὗ ἡ Βασιλεία τοῦ Θεοῦ ἔλθῃ	1	until the kingdom of God comes	See how you decided to translate the phrase **the kingdom of God** in [4:43](../04/43.md). If your readers would misunderstand the abstract noun **kingdom**, you could express the idea behind it with a verb such as “rule.” Alternate translation: “until God begins to rule as king” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
LUK	22	19	m514	translate-unknown	ἄρτον	1	bread	The term **bread** refers to a loaf of bread, which is a lump of flour dough that a person has shaped and baked. See how you translated this term in [9:13](../09/13.md). Alternate translation: “a loaf of bread” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	22	19	nd2m	figs-explicit	ἄρτον	1	bread	Since Jews did not eat bread made with yeast during this festival, this bread would not have had any yeast in it and it would have been flat. Alternate translation: “a loaf of unleavened bread” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	22	19	m515		εὐχαριστήσας	1	when he had given thanks	Your language may require you to state the object of the verb. Alternate translation: “when he had given thanks to God”
LUK	22	19	d3yc		ἔκλασεν	1	he broke it	Jesus may have divided the loaf of **bread** into many pieces, as UST says, or he may have divided it into two pieces and given those to the apostles to divide among themselves. If possible, use an expression in your language that would apply to either situation.
LUK	22	19	m516	figs-explicit	καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτοῖς	1	and gave to them	The implication is that Jesus gave the bread to the disciples to eat. Alternate translation: “and gave it to them to eat” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	22	19	d8r1	figs-metaphor	τοῦτό ἐστιν τὸ σῶμά μου	1	This is my body	See the discussion in the General Notes to this chapter about how to translate this phrase.

Alternate translation: “My body is really present in this bread”
LUK	22	19	lc9m	figs-activepassive	τὸ ὑπὲρ ὑμῶν διδόμενον	1	which is given for you	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who is doing the action. Alternate translation: “which I am giving for you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	22	19	cxy5	figs-explicit	τοῦτο ποιεῖτε εἰς τὴν ἐμὴν ἀνάμνησιν	1	Do this in my remembrance	Jesus seems to be telling his disciples implicitly that he wants them to re-enact this part of the meal regularly in the future in order to remember him. Alternate translation: “When you meet together, break and share bread like this in order to remember me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	22	20	m517	figs-ellipsis	καὶ τὸ ποτήριον	1	And the cup	Luke is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could supply these words from the previous verse. Alternate translation: “And he took the cup” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
LUK	22	20	z3cx	figs-metonymy	τὸ ποτήριον…τοῦτο τὸ ποτήριον	1	the cup … This cup	In each case, the term **cup** figuratively means what the **cup** contained, which was wine. Alternate translation: “the cup of wine … The wine in this cup” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	22	20	gc8h	figs-explicit	ἡ καινὴ διαθήκη ἐν τῷ αἵματί μου	1	the new covenant in my blood	In the Hebrew culture, covenants were customarily ratified through animal sacrifices that involved shedding the blood of the animals. Here, Jesus is likely alluding to that practice in light of his impending sacrificial death. Alternate translation: “the new covenant that will be ratified when I shed my blood” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	22	20	v4d3	figs-activepassive	τὸ ὑπὲρ ὑμῶν ἐκχυννόμενον	1	which is poured out for you	Jesus is referring to the way his blood is going to be **poured out** when he dies.

LUK	22	21	swj1	figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	behold	Jesus is using the term **behold** to get his disciples to focus their attention on what he is about to say. Alternate translation: “indeed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

There is significance to the part that Jesus chooses. With the same hand with which Judas has just received the bread and wine, he will receive the money for betraying Jesus. Alternate translation: “the man who is going to betray me is sharing this meal with me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
LUK	22	21	m518	figs-metonymy	μετ’ ἐμοῦ ἐπὶ τῆς τραπέζης	1	is with me on the table	Jesus is using the shared location of the **table** figuratively to mean sharing the meal that is being served on the **table**. Alternate translation: “sharing this meal with me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	22	22	wtj2	translate-versebridge	ὅτι	1	For	Jesus is giving the reason why one of his disciples is going to betray him, as he said in the previous verse. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could put this reason before the result by combining this verse and the previous one into a verse bridge. See the suggestions in the note about the similar situation in [22:16](../22/16.md) for how you might do this. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge]])
LUK	22	22	mk3q	figs-123person	ὁ Υἱὸς μὲν τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου…πορεύεται	1	the Son of Man indeed goes	Jesus is speaking about himself in the third person.

LUK	22	24	yyw9	grammar-connect-logic-result	δὲ	1	Then	Luke may use this word simply to indicate that the quarrel about which disciple was the greatest took place after the discussion about which disciple would betray Jesus. However, he could also be using the word to indicate that the quarrel arose directly from the discussion. Alternate translation: “As a result” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
LUK	22	24	y9ce		δοκεῖ εἶναι μείζων	1	seems to be greater	Here Luke uses the present tense in past narration. See how you decided to approach this usage in [7:40](../07/40.md). If it would not be natural to use the present tense in your language, you can use the past tense in your translation. Alternate translation: “appeared to be the greatest one” or “people should consider to be the greatest one”
LUK	22	24	m521		μείζων	1	greater	Your language might naturally use the comparative form of the adjective here, **greater**, to express the issue in terms of which one disciple was greater than all the others. Or your language might naturally use the superlative form, “greatest,” to express the issue in terms of which disciple was the greatest of them all. Alternate translation: “the greatest one”
LUK	22	25	m522	figs-explicit	οἱ βασιλεῖς τῶν ἐθνῶν	1	the kings of the nations	Here Jesus assumes that his disciples will know that by **the nations** he means the people groups who are not Jews. Alternate translation: “the kings of the Gentiles” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

LUK	22	25	tw4y	figs-irony	εὐεργέται, καλοῦνται	1	are called Benefactors	The subjects of these rulers did not call them this spontaneously and gratefully. Rather, the rulers gave themselves this title, even though they were not really ruling in a way that was good for their subjects, as Jesus says in the first part of this sentence. Jesus is mentioning the title to emphasize how undeserved it is. Alternate translation: “nevertheless give themselves the title of Benefactor” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])
LUK	22	25	m523	figs-activepassive	καλοῦνται	1	are called	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who is doing the action. Alternate translation: “call themselves” or “give themselves the title” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	22	25	m524	translate-names	εὐεργέται	1	Benefactors	This is a title that several rulers of this time had given themselves. Your language may have an equivalent title. If not, you can express the meaning with an equivalent expression, as UST does. Alternate translation: “the Good” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	22	26	ne9r		ὑμεῖς δὲ οὐχ οὕτως	1	But you be not thus	Alternate translation: “But you should not act like that”
LUK	22	26	m525		ὁ μείζων ἐν ὑμῖν, γενέσθω ὡς ὁ νεώτερος	1	let the greater among you become like the younger	As the last note to [22:24](../22/24.md) discusses, your language might naturally use the superlative form of these adjectives rather than the comparative form. Alternate translation: “let the greatest one among you become like the youngest one”
LUK	22	26	m526	figs-nominaladj	ὁ μείζων…ὁ νεώτερος	1	the greater … the younger	Jesus is using the adjectives **greater** and **younger** as nouns to describe types of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate these with equivalent expressions. Alternate translation: “the greatest one … the youngest one” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
LUK	22	26	cdq7	figs-metonymy	ὁ νεώτερος	1	the younger	This culture respected older people and followed them as leaders. Jesus is referring figuratively to a person who was less important and influential by association with the fact that this would be the case if they were younger. Alternate translation: “the least important one” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	22	26	y4n1		ὁ διακονῶν	1	the one who serves	Alternate translation: “a servant”
LUK	22	27	mw2l	grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	For	Jesus uses this word to introduce a reason why his disciples should do what he told them in the previous verse. The reason is that he is already setting a personal example of this himself. Alternate translation: “After all” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
LUK	22	27	jt7r	figs-rquestion	τίς…μείζων, ὁ ἀνακείμενος ἢ ὁ διακονῶν?	1	who is greater, the one who reclines to eat, or the one who serves?	Jesus is using the question form to teach his disciples. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate his words as a statement. Alternate translation: “I want you to think about who is greater, the person who is dining, or the who is serving the food.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	22	27	n3dl	translate-unknown	ὁ ἀνακείμενος	1	the one who reclines to eat	See how you translated this in [5:29](../05/29.md). It was the custom in this culture for dinner guests to eat while lying comfortably around the table on banqueting couches. Alternate translation: “the person who is dining” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	22	27	lu3a	figs-rquestion	οὐχὶ ὁ ἀνακείμενος?	1	Is it not the one who reclines to eat?	Jesus is using a further question to teach his disciples. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate his words as a statement. Alternate translation: “You must agree that it is the person who is dining.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	22	27	qbn6	figs-explicit	ἐγὼ δὲ ἐν μέσῳ ὑμῶν εἰμι ὡς ὁ διακονῶν	1	But I am in the midst of you as one who serves	Jesus is likely referring to the example that he has set at this meal. This would include serving the bread to the disciples, which Luke describes in [22:19](../22/19.md). [John 13:4-5](../jhn/13/04.md) also records that before this meal, Jesus washed the disciples feet, which a household servant would ordinarily have done. Alternate translation: “But I have been acting like a servant here at this meal with you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	22	28	i9xb		οἱ διαμεμενηκότες μετ’ ἐμοῦ, ἐν τοῖς πειρασμοῖς μου	1	the ones who have continued with me in my trials	Alternate translation: “the ones who have stayed with me through my struggles”

Alternate translation: “And so, just as my Father has given a kingdom to me, I am giving one to you”
LUK	22	29	nly5	figs-abstractnouns	κἀγὼ διατίθεμαι ὑμῖν, καθὼς διέθετό μοι ὁ Πατήρ μου βασιλείαν	1	And I grant to you, just as my Father has granted to me, a kingdom	If your readers would misunderstand the abstract noun **kingdom**, you could express the idea behind it with a verb such as “rule.” Alternate translation: “And so I am giving you the authority to rule, just as my Father has done for me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
LUK	22	29	m527	grammar-connect-logic-result	κἀγὼ	1	And I	Jesus uses this expression to indicate that what he is about to say is the result of what he has just said. Alternate translation: “And so I” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
LUK	22	29	ii65	guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	Πατήρ	1	Father	**Father** is an important title for God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
LUK	22	30	m528	figs-metonymy	ἵνα ἔσθητε καὶ πίνητε ἐπὶ τῆς τραπέζης μου	1	so that you may eat and drink at my table	Jesus may simply be referring to the way he and his disciples will renew their table fellowship in the kingdom of God, as he described in [22:16](../22/16.md). But he may also be referring figuratively to his disciples becoming important officials in his kingdom, since such officials would have their meals at the king’s **table**. Alternate translation: “so that you may be important officials” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	22	30	m529	figs-abstractnouns	ἐν τῇ βασιλείᾳ μου	1	in my kingdom	If your readers would misunderstand the abstract noun **kingdom**, you could express the idea behind it with a verb such as “rule” and a concrete noun such as “king.” Alternate translation: “when I rule as king” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
LUK	22	30	us1j	translate-symaction	καθῆσθε ἐπὶ θρόνων	1	sit on thrones	Rulers have **thrones** that symbolize their authority. These special seats are signs of status and power. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that in some way in your translation. Alternate translation: “sit on royal thrones” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
LUK	22	30	m530	figs-metonymy	τὰς δώδεκα φυλὰς…τοῦ Ἰσραήλ	1	the 12 tribes of Israel	Here Jesus uses the term **tribes** figuratively to refer to the people who belong to those **tribes**. Alternate translation: “the people of the 12 tribes of Israel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	22	31	t8qd		Σίμων, Σίμων	1	Simon, Simon	Jesus says the name of this disciple twice to show him that what he is about to say to him is very important. Your language may have a way of addressing someone to show this same thing. Alternate translation: “Now Simon”
LUK	22	31	m531	translate-names	Σίμων	1	Simon	**Simon** is the name of a man. See how you translated it in [4:38](../04/38.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	22	31	m532	figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	behold	Jesus uses the term **behold** to get Simon to focus his attention on what he is about to say. Alternate translation: “listen” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	22	31	m533	translate-names	ὁ Σατανᾶς	1	Satan	**Satan** is the name of the devil. See how you translated it in [10:18](../10/18.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	22	31	m534		ἐξῃτήσατο	1	has asked	Your language may require you to state the object of the verb. Alternate translation: “has asked God for permission”
LUK	22	31	m535	translate-unknown	ὑμᾶς τοῦ σινιάσαι ὡς τὸν σῖτον	1	to sift you as wheat	To **sift wheat** means to put it in a sieve, which is a container with a mesh bottom, and shake it back and forth so that the grain stays in the sieve and the husk or chaff falls out. If your readers would not be familiar with **wheat**, you could use the name of a grain that they would recognize, or use a general expression. Alternate translation: “to shake you as if he were separating grain from its husks in a sieve” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	22	31	qyy7	figs-simile	ἐξῃτήσατο ὑμᾶς τοῦ σινιάσαι ὡς τὸν σῖτον	1	has asked to sift you as wheat	Jesus is using this comparison to say figuratively that Satan wants to put the disciples through difficult experiences in order to show that many of them are not unconditionally loyal to Jesus. You could use this same comparison in your translation, or you could explain its meaning. Alternate translation: “to shake you as if he were separating grain from its husks in a sieve” or “to test you to show that many of you will not stay loyal to me when threatened” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
LUK	22	31	m536	figs-explicit	ἐξῃτήσατο ὑμᾶς τοῦ σινιάσαι ὡς τὸν σῖτον	1	has asked to sift you as wheat	The implication is that God has given Satan permission to do this, and that is why Jesus is giving this warning. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “to test you to show that many of you are not unconditionally loyal to me, and God has given him permission to do that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	22	31	dmw8	figs-you	ὑμᾶς	1	you	Here, **you** is plural. Jesus is referring to all of the apostles. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
LUK	22	32	m537		ἐγὼ…ἐδεήθην	1	I have asked	Your language may require you to state the object of the verb. In this context the verb has a strong sense. Alternate translation: “I have prayed to God” or “I have pleaded with God”
LUK	22	32	pd1t	figs-you	ἐγὼ δὲ ἐδεήθην περὶ σοῦ	1	you … your … you … you … your	Jesus is addressing Simon specifically, and so the terms **you** and **your** are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
LUK	22	32	zp8w	figs-doublenegatives	ἵνα μὴ ἐκλίπῃ ἡ πίστις σου	1	that your faith may not fail	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express the meaning of the negative word **not** combined with the negative verb **fail** as a positive statement. Alternate translation: “that you will continue to have faith” or “that you will continue to trust me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
LUK	22	32	qxk7	figs-metaphor	ποτε ἐπιστρέψας	1	when you have turned back	This expression refers figuratively to resuming a previous course of action. Alternate translation: “when you are once more openly loyal to me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	22	32	f9v8	figs-explicit	στήρισον τοὺς ἀδελφούς σου	1	strengthen your brothers	The implication is that Jesus wants Simon to **strengthen** the other disciples in their faith. Alternate translation: “encourage the other disciples to be strong in their faith as well” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	22	32	r7ux	figs-metaphor	τοὺς ἀδελφούς σου	1	your brothers	Jesus is using the term **brothers** figuratively to mean someone who shares the same belief. Alternate translation: “your fellow believers” or “the other disciples” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	22	32	m538	figs-gendernotations	τοὺς ἀδελφούς σου	1	your brothers	Here Jesus has the other apostles, who are all men, initially in view. But he may also want Simon to strengthen the faith of any of his other disciples, male or female, who need encouragement. In that case, he would be using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women. Alternate translation: “your fellow believers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
LUK	22	33	m539	writing-pronouns	ὁ δὲ εἶπεν αὐτῷ	1	But he said to him	**He** refers to Simon, who was also known as Peter, and the word **him** refers to Jesus. Jesus calls him Peter in the next verse. So that your readers will know that Jesus is talking to the same man there, you could use both of his names here. Alternate translation: “But Simon Peter said to Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
LUK	22	34	m540	writing-pronouns	ὁ δὲ εἶπεν	1	But he said	The pronoun **he** refers to Jesus. Alternate translation: “But Jesus answered” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
LUK	22	34	m541		λέγω σοι	1	I say to you	Jesus says this to emphasize what he is about to tell Peter. Alternate translation: “Indeed”
LUK	22	34	tu15		οὐ φωνήσει σήμερον ἀλέκτωρ, ἕως τρίς με ἀπαρνήσῃ εἰδέναι	1	the rooster will not crow today before you will deny three times that you know me	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this as a positive statement. Alternate translation: “before the rooster crows today, you will deny three times that you know me”
LUK	22	34	pwj1	figs-metonymy	οὐ φωνήσει σήμερον ἀλέκτωρ, ἕως	1	the rooster will not crow today before	Jesus is referring figuratively to a certain time of day. Roosters crow just before the sun appears in the morning. In other words, Jesus is referring to dawn. Alternate translation: “before another morning begins” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	22	34	eq7h	translate-unknown	οὐ φωνήσει σήμερον ἀλέκτωρ, ἕως	1	the rooster will not crow today before	A **rooster** is a bird that calls out loudly around the time the sun comes up. If your readers would not be familiar with this bird, you could use the name of a bird in your area that calls out or sings just before dawn, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “before the birds begin to sing in the morning” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	22	34	m542	figs-genericnoun	ἀλέκτωρ	1	the rooster	Jesus is not speaking of one particular **rooster** but of roosters in general. Alternate translation: “the roosters” or “the birds” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])
LUK	22	34	m543	figs-explicit	σήμερον	1	today	The Jewish day began at sunset. Jesus was speaking after the sun had set. The rooster would crow just before morning. That morning was considered part of the same day. Alternate translation: “in the morning” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	22	35	m544	figs-metonymy	ἄτερ βαλλαντίου, καὶ πήρας, καὶ ὑποδημάτων	1	without a money bag and sack and sandals	As in [10:4](../10/04.md), Jesus is speaking of these items figuratively to mean what they represent. See how you translated these terms there. Alternate translation: “without any money or provisions or extra clothes” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	22	35	m545	figs-doublenegatives	μή τινος ὑστερήσατε?	1	you did not lack anything, did you?	The first word of this question in Greek is a negative word that can be used to turn a statement into a question that expects a negative answer. ULT shows this by adding, **did you?** Your language may have other ways of asking a question that expects a negative answer, for example, by changing the word order of a positive statement. Alternate translation: “did you lack anything?” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
LUK	22	35	cv68	figs-rquestion	μή τινος ὑστερήσατε?	1	you did not lack anything, did you?	Even though Jesus already knows the answer to this question and he is using it as a teaching tool, in this case he does want the disciples to reply. If you translated his words as a statement, for example, “I know that you did not lack anything,” then the disciples might seem to be interrupting him by speaking uninvited. Since Jesus did want them to speak, it would probably be most appropriate to present his words in the form of a question. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	22	35	tb51	figs-ellipsis	οὐθενός	1	Nothing	Luke may be summarizing the disciples’ response briefly, or the disciples themselves may have responded this briefly. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could expand on what this means. Alternate translation: “We did not lack anything” or “We had everything we needed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
LUK	22	36	h7j7	figs-genericnoun	ὁ ἔχων βαλλάντιον…ὁ μὴ ἔχων…μάχαιραν	1	the one who has a money bag … the one who does not have a sword	Jesus was not referring to a specific one of the disciples who had a money bag or did not have a sword. Alternate translation: “anyone who has a money bag … anyone who does not have a sword” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])
LUK	22	36	m546	figs-explicit	ὁ ἔχων βαλλάντιον…ὁ μὴ ἔχων…μάχαιραν	1	the one who has a money bag … the one who does not have a sword	Jesus is giving these instructions specifically to his disciples. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that in your translation. Alternate translation: “any one of you who has a money bag … any one of you who does not have a sword” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	22	36	q717	translate-unknown	τὸ ἱμάτιον	1	cloak	See how you translated **cloak** in [19:35](../19/35.md). Alternate translation: “coat” or “outer garment” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	22	37	n73l	translate-versebridge	γὰρ	1	For	Jesus is giving the reason why the disciples should now be concerned about providing for and protecting themselves, as he said in the previous verse. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could put this reason before the result by combining this verse and the previous one into a verse bridge. See the suggestions in the note about the similar situation in [22:16](../22/16.md) for how you might do this. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge]])
LUK	22	37	m547		λέγω…ὑμῖν	1	I say to you	Jesus says this to emphasize what he is about to tell the disciples. Alternate translation: “indeed”
LUK	22	37	g4l7	figs-activepassive	τοῦτο τὸ γεγραμμένον	1	this that is written	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who did the action. Alternate translation: “what a prophet wrote in the Scriptures” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	22	37	m548	figs-explicit	τοῦτο τὸ γεγραμμένον	1	this that is written	Jesus may be assuming that his disciples know the source and subject of this passage. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could identify it more specifically. Alternate translation: “what Isaiah wrote about the Messiah in the Scriptures” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	22	37	u9jx	figs-activepassive	δεῖ τελεσθῆναι	1	must be accomplished in me	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form. The meaning of **accomplished** is the same as for the word “fulfilled” in [1:1](../01/01.md), [1:20](../01/20.md), and many other places in the book, even though the Greek verb is different. Alternate translation: “must happen to me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	22	37	m549	figs-quotesinquotes	τό καὶ μετὰ ἀνόμων ἐλογίσθη	1	And he was reckoned with the lawless	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. It may be more natural in your language to use a singular form here. Alternate translation: “that people would consider me to be a criminal” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	22	37	jz9d	figs-nominaladj	μετὰ ἀνόμων ἐλογίσθη	1	he was reckoned with the lawless	Jesus is using the adjective **lawless** as a noun in order to indicate a type of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this with an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “he was considered a criminal” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
LUK	22	37	jf1f	figs-activepassive	μετὰ ἀνόμων ἐλογίσθη	1	he was reckoned with the lawless	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form, and you can state who did the action. Alternate translation: “people considered him to be a criminal” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	22	37	se1d	figs-explicit	καὶ γὰρ τὸ περὶ ἐμοῦ τέλος ἔχει	1	For indeed the thing concerning me has an accomplishment	Here Jesus is speaking implicitly about what the Scriptures say about him. Alternate translation: “Yes, what the Scriptures say about me must certainly happen” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	22	38	kbt8	figs-explicit	ἱκανόν ἐστιν	1	It is enough	This could mean: (1) Jesus is indicating that when he told his disciples to buy swords, he meant for their own defense, not to attack their enemies, and that they have enough swords for that purpose. Alternate translation: “That will be enough for us to defend ourselves” (2) Jesus wants them to stop talking about having swords. The implication would be that when he said they should buy swords, he was mainly warning them that they were going to face dangers, and he did not really want them to buy swords and fight. Alternate translation: “That is enough talk about swords, I do not really want you to buy them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	22	39	zaw6	writing-background	ἐξελθὼν, ἐπορεύθη κατὰ τὸ ἔθος εἰς τὸ Ὄρος τῶν Ἐλαιῶν	1	going out, he went according to his custom to the Mount of Olives	Luke provides this background information about where Jesus went to help readers understand what happens next in the story. Luke has already indicated in [21:37](../21/37.md) that during this time in Jerusalem, Jesus did not spend the nights in the city, but rather in this location. Alternate translation: “leaving the city of Jerusalem, Jesus went to spend the night on the Mount of Olives, as he had been doing” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
LUK	22	39	m550	translate-names	τὸ Ὄρος τῶν Ἐλαιῶν	1	the Mount of Olives	This is the name of a hill or mountain. See how you translated it in [19:29](../19/29.md). Alternate translation: “Olive Tree Mountain” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	22	40	m551	figs-synecdoche	γενόμενος δὲ ἐπὶ τοῦ τόπου	1	when he came to the place	Luke says **he**, meaning Jesus, to refer figuratively to Jesus and his disciples. Alternate translation: “when Jesus and his disciples arrived at the Mount of Olives” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
LUK	22	40	b6pz	figs-abstractnouns	προσεύχεσθε μὴ εἰσελθεῖν εἰς πειρασμόν	1	Pray not to enter into temptation	If your readers would misunderstand the abstract noun **temptation**, you could express the idea behind it with a verb such as “tempt.” Alternate translation: “Pray that nothing will tempt you to sin” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
LUK	22	40	m552	figs-explicit	προσεύχεσθε μὴ εἰσελθεῖν εἰς πειρασμόν	1	Pray not to enter into temptation	The implications are that the disciples will soon face the **temptation** to abandon Jesus in order to save themselves. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “Pray that when the Jewish leaders come to arrest me and you are tempted to try to save yourselves by running away or denying that you know me, you will not sin by doing that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	22	41	sp1s	figs-idiom	ὡσεὶ λίθου βολήν	1	about the throw of a stone	This is an idiom that means “about as far as someone can throw a stone.” If your readers would misunderstand this, you could represent this with a general expression or with an estimated measurement. Alternate translation: “a short distance” or “about 30 meters” or “about 100 feet” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	22	41	m553	translate-symaction	θεὶς τὰ γόνατα	1	having put down his knees	As Jesus indicates in his parable in [18:11](../18/11.md), the customary posture of prayer in this culture was standing. By kneeling down, Jesus indicated that he was praying urgently about a serious matter. Alternate translation: “after kneeling down to show the urgency of his request” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
LUK	22	42	y51l	guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	Πάτερ	1	Father	**Father** is an important title for God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
LUK	22	42	m554	figs-youformal	εἰ βούλει…τὸ σὸν	1	if you are willing … yours	Use your best judgment about whether the formal or informal forms of **you** and **yours** would be more natural in your language here. Jesus is speaking as an adult son would to a father with whom he had a close relationship. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youformal]])
LUK	22	42	ic7y	figs-metaphor	παρένεγκε τοῦτο τὸ ποτήριον ἀπ’ ἐμοῦ	1	remove this cup from me	Jesus is referring to the sufferings he will soon experience as if they were a cup of bitter-tasting liquid that he would have to drink. Alternate translation: “please spare me from these sufferings” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	22	42	m555	figs-imperative	παρένεγκε τοῦτο τὸ ποτήριον ἀπ’ ἐμοῦ	1	remove this cup from me	This is an imperative, but it should be translated as a request rather than as a command. It may be helpful to add an expression such as “please” to make this clear. Alternate translation: “please spare me from these sufferings” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
LUK	22	42	zw2y	figs-imperative	πλὴν μὴ τὸ θέλημά μου, ἀλλὰ τὸ σὸν γινέσθω	1	But let not my will, but yours, happen	This is another imperative that should be translated as a request rather than as a command. Alternate translation: “However, please do what is according to your will, rather than what is according to my will” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
LUK	22	43	m556	translate-textvariants	Ὤφθη δὲ αὐτῷ ἄγγελος ἀπ’ οὐρανοῦ ἐνισχύων αὐτόν	1	And an angel from heaven appeared to him, strengthening him	See the discussion of textual issues at the end of the General Notes to this chapter to decide whether to include this verse in your translation. The note below discusses a translation issue in this verse, for those who decide to include it. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
LUK	22	43	m557	figs-idiom	Ὤφθη…αὐτῷ	1	appeared to him	**Appeared** does not mean that the angel simply seemed to be there, or that Jesus saw the angel in a vision. Rather, this expression indicates that the angel was actually present with Jesus. Alternate translation: “came there to be with him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	22	44	m558	translate-textvariants	Καὶ γενόμενος ἐν ἀγωνίᾳ ἐκτενέστερον προσηύχετο. καὶ Ἐγένετο ὁ ἱδρὼς αὐτοῦ ὡσεὶ θρόμβοι αἵματος καταβαίνοντες ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν	1	And being in agony, he was praying more earnestly, and his sweat became like drops of blood falling on the ground	See the discussion of textual issues at the end of the General Notes to this chapter to decide whether to include this verse in your translation. The two notes below discusses translation issues in this verse, for those who decide to include it. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
LUK	22	44	m559		ἐκτενέστερον προσηύχετο	1	he was praying more earnestly	This could mean: (1) Luke is using the comparative form of the adjective **earnest**, which has an adverbial sense here, with a superlative meaning. Alternate translation: “he was praying most earnestly” or “he was praying very fervently” (2) the word has an actual comparative sense. Alternate translation: “he began to pray even more earnestly than he had been praying before”
LUK	22	44	m560	figs-simile	Ἐγένετο ὁ ἱδρὼς αὐτοῦ ὡσεὶ θρόμβοι αἵματος καταβαίνοντες ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν	1	his sweat became like drops of blood falling on the ground	This could mean one of two things. The first is more likely. (1) It could describe the appearance of the drops. This would mean that Jesus had been under such stress that the small blood vessels that fed his sweat glands ruptured, and his sweat became mixed with blood. (This is a rare but well-document medical condition known as hematohidrosis.) Alternate translation: “his sweat became mixed with blood and it fell to the ground in drops” (2) It could describe the way in which the drops of sweat fell to the ground. Alternate translation: “he began to sweat so intensely that the sweat formed drops and fell to the ground as blood drops do” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
LUK	22	45	m561	grammar-connect-time-sequential	καὶ	1	And	Luke uses the word **and** to indicate that what he describes next came after what he described just previously. Alternate translation: “Then” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
LUK	22	45	m562		ἀναστὰς ἀπὸ τῆς προσευχῆς, ἐλθὼν πρὸς τοὺς μαθητὰς	1	having risen up from the prayer, he came to the disciples	Alternate translation: “when Jesus had finished praying, he got up and went back to his disciples”
LUK	22	45	gb3z	figs-abstractnouns	εὗρεν κοιμωμένους αὐτοὺς ἀπὸ τῆς λύπης	1	found them sleeping from the sorrow	If your readers would misunderstand the abstract noun **sorrow**, you could express the idea behind it with an adjective such as “sad.” Alternate translation: “saw that they were sleeping because they were tired from being sad” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
LUK	22	46	in7g	figs-rquestion	τί καθεύδετε?	1	Why are you sleeping?	Jesus is not looking for information. He is using the question form to rebuke his disciples. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “You should not be sleeping now!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	22	46	nl7w	figs-abstractnouns	ἵνα μὴ εἰσέλθητε εἰς πειρασμόν	1	so that you may not enter into temptation	If your readers would misunderstand the abstract noun **temptation**, you could express the idea behind it with a verb such as “tempt.” See how you translated the similar phrase in [22:40](../22/40.md). Alternate translation: “so that nothing tempts you to sin” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
LUK	22	46	m563	figs-explicit	ἵνα μὴ εἰσέλθητε εἰς πειρασμόν	1	so that you may not enter into temptation	As in [22:40](../22/40.md), the implications are that the disciples will soon face the **temptation** to abandon Jesus in order to save themselves. If you indicated that explicitly in your translation there, you could state something similar here. Alternate translation: “so that when the Jewish leaders arrest me and you are tempted to abandon me to save yourselves, you will not sin by doing that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	22	47	m564	figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	behold	Luke uses the term **behold** to calls the reader’s attention to what he is about to say. Your language may have a similar expression that you can use here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	22	47	kt25	writing-participants	ὄχλος	1	a crowd	Luke is introducing new characters into the story. If your language has its own way of doing that, you can use it here in your translation. Alternate translation: “there was a crowd that arrived” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
LUK	22	47	m565	figs-activepassive	ὁ λεγόμενος Ἰούδας	1	the one called Judas	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “the man whose name was Judas” or “the man that people called Judas” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	22	47	m56x	translate-names	Ἰούδας	1	Judas	**Judas** is the name of a man. See how you translated it in [22:3](../22/03.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	22	47	m567	figs-nominaladj	εἷς τῶν δώδεκα	1	one of the Twelve	See how you translated this in [8:1](../08/01.md). You may have decided to translate the nominal adjective **Twelve** with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “who was one of the 12 men Jesus had appointed to be apostles” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
LUK	22	47	m568	translate-names	τῶν δώδεκα	1	the Twelve	You may have decided instead in [8:1](../08/01.md) to translate **Twelve** as a title, even if your language does not ordinarily use adjectives as nouns. If so, you can do the same thing here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	22	47	mva7	figs-explicit	προήρχετο αὐτούς	1	was leading them	Judas was showing the people where Jesus was. He was not the person in charge of the whole group. Alternate translation: “leading them to where Jesus was” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	22	47	c2l7	translate-symaction	φιλῆσαι αὐτόν	1	to kiss him	In this culture, when men greeted other men who were family or friends, they would kiss them on one cheek or on both cheeks. If your readers would find it embarrassing if you said that one man would kiss another man, you could explain the purpose of the gesture, or you could translate the expression in a more general way. Alternate translation: “to greet him by kissing him on the cheek” or “to give him a friendly greeting” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
LUK	22	48	e2n9	figs-rquestion	φιλήματι τὸν Υἱὸν τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου παραδίδως?	1	are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?	Jesus is using the question form to rebuke Judas. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “You should not be using a kiss to betray the Son of Man!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	22	48	zvk8	figs-123person	τὸν Υἱὸν τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου	1	the Son of Man	Jesus is speaking about himself in the third person. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this in the first person. Alternate translation: “me, the Son of Man” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
LUK	22	48	m569	figs-explicit	τὸν Υἱὸν τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου	1	the Son of Man	See how you translated the title **Son of Man** in [5:24](../05/24.md). Alternate translation: “me, the Messiah” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	22	49	njs1		οἱ περὶ αὐτὸν	1	those who were around him	The expression **those who were around him** refers to Jesus' disciples. Alternate translation: “Jesus’ disciples, who were around him,”
LUK	22	49	y5za	figs-explicit	τὸ ἐσόμενον	1	what was going to happen	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state more explicitly what this means. Alternate translation: “that the Jewish leaders and soldiers who had come were going to arrest Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	22	49	m570	figs-idiom	εἰ πατάξομεν ἐν μαχαίρῃ	1	if we will strike with the sword	This was an idiomatic way to ask a question. Alternate translation: “should we strike with the sword” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	22	49	m571	figs-synecdoche	εἰ πατάξομεν ἐν μαχαίρῃ	1	if we will strike with the sword	The disciples may be asking specifically not about what weapon to use, but generally whether they should fight back to prevent Jesus from being arrested. In that case they would be using one kind of weapon, a **sword**, to mean fighting in general. The disciples said in [22:38](../22/38.md) that they had two swords, but they could also have resisted by further means. Alternate translation: “should we fight to defend you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
LUK	22	49	gv81	figs-explicit	εἰ πατάξομεν ἐν μαχαίρῃ	1	if we will strike with the sword	Alternatively, the disciples may implicitly be asking whether this was the kind of occasion for which Jesus told them in [22:38](../22/38.md) that they should have swords. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “you told us we should have swords; should we use them now” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	22	50	b4ij	writing-participants	εἷς τις ἐξ αὐτῶν	1	a certain one of them	Luke uses this phrase to bring one of the characters into the story into the center of the action, but he does not identify the person by name. John indicates in his Gospel that it was Peter, but since Luke does not name him here, it would not be appropriate to use his name in your translation. Alternate translation: “one of the disciples who was there” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
LUK	22	50	f2fm	figs-explicit	ἐπάταξεν…τὸν δοῦλον τοῦ ἀρχιερέως	1	struck the servant of the high priest	The implication is that this disciple did this with a sword. Alternate translation: “struck the servant of the high priest with a sword” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	22	51	m572	figs-hendiadys	ἀποκριθεὶς…ὁ Ἰησοῦς εἶπεν	1	answering Jesus said	Together the two words **answering** and **said** mean that Jesus responded to what the disciple had just done. Alternate translation: “Jesus responded” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
LUK	22	51	rcp5	figs-idiom	ἐᾶτε ἕως τούτου	1	Allow up to this	This is an idiom. It is in the form of a positive statement, but it actually has a strong negative meaning. Alternate translation: “No more of this” or “Do not do anything more like that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	22	51	c6pz	figs-explicit	ἁψάμενος τοῦ ὠτίου, ἰάσατο αὐτόν	1	touching his ear, he healed him	It may be necessary to explain what it means that Jesus touched the servant’s **ear**, since it had been cut off. Alternate translation: “Jesus put the servant’s ear back in place and healed it” or “Jesus touched the servant at the place where his ear had been cut off and restored it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	22	52	m573	figs-explicit	στρατηγοὺς τοῦ ἱεροῦ	1	captains of the temple	See how you translated this in [22:4](../22/04.md). Alternate translation: “captains of the temple guard” or “temple military officers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	22	52	fa7z	figs-rquestion	ὡς ἐπὶ λῃστὴν ἐξήλθατε μετὰ μαχαιρῶν καὶ ξύλων?	1	Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs?	Jesus is using the question form to rebuke the Jewish leaders. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “You did not need to bring soldiers with weapons to arrest me, as if I were a bandit!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	22	52	m574	figs-explicit	ὡς ἐπὶ λῃστὴν ἐξήλθατε μετὰ μαχαιρῶν καὶ ξύλων?	1	Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs?	The implication, as Jesus will say specifically in the next verse, is that he has demonstrated that he is a peaceful person. He has taught openly and undefened in the temple. He has not gathered an armed band around him and operated from a hidden location. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “You have seen that I am a peaceful person, yet you come to arrest me bringing soldiers with weapons, as if I were a bandit!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	22	52	m575	figs-simile	ὡς ἐπὶ λῃστὴν	1	as against a robber	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the meaning of this simile. Here, the term **robber** likely indicates a violent person who steals from others by forcing them to hand over their valuables, threatening to harm them if they refuse. Alternate translation: “as if I were a bandit who needed to be subdued with force” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
LUK	22	52	m576	figs-metonymy	μαχαιρῶν καὶ ξύλων	1	swords and clubs	Jesus is speaking of these weapons figuratively, to mean the soldiers who are carrying them. Alternate translation: “soldiers armed with weapons” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	22	53	a6qu	figs-synecdoche	ἐν τῷ ἱερῷ	1	in the temple	Only priests were allowed to enter the **temple** building, so Jesus means the temple courtyard. He is using the word for the entire building to refer to one part of it. Alternate translation: “in the temple courtyard” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
LUK	22	53	c4is	figs-metonymy	οὐκ ἐξετείνατε τὰς χεῖρας ἐπ’ ἐμέ	1	you did not lay your hands on me	As in [20:19](../20/19.md), here this expression means figuratively to arrest a person by association with the way that arresting officers might physically take hold of the person with their **hands**. Alternate translation: “you did not arrest me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	22	53	gw9n	figs-idiom	αὕτη ἐστὶν ὑμῶν ἡ ὥρα	1	this is your hour	Jesus is using the term **hour** figuratively to refer to a specific time. Alternate translation: “this is a time when you can do whatever you want” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	22	53	mzb4	figs-ellipsis	καὶ ἡ ἐξουσία τοῦ σκότους	1	and the authority of the darkness	Jesus is using this phrase to characterize the **hour** further. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could show that by repeating the reference to “time” from earlier in the sentence. Alternate translation: “because it is a time when darkness is in authority” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
LUK	22	53	m577	figs-metaphor	καὶ ἡ ἐξουσία τοῦ σκότους	1	and the authority of the darkness	Jesus is referring figuratively to Satan as **darkness**. Alternate translation: “because it is a time when God is allowing Satan to do what he wants” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	22	54	mtp8	figs-explicit	ἤγαγον	1	they led him away	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state more explicitly what this means. Alternate translation: “they led Jesus away from the place where they had arrested him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	22	54	m578	writing-background	ὁ δὲ Πέτρος ἠκολούθει μακρόθεν	1	And Peter was following from a distance	Luke provides this background information to help readers understand what happens next in the story. Alternate translation: “Now Peter followed the group there, staying some distance away” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
LUK	22	54	m579	figs-explicit	ὁ δὲ Πέτρος ἠκολούθει μακρόθεν	1	And Peter was following from a distance	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state explicitly why Peter followed **from a distance**. Alternate translation: “Now Peter followed the group there, staying some distance away so that he would not be recognized and arrested himself” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	22	55	b3x7	writing-pronouns	περιαψάντων…πῦρ	1	they having kindled a fire	Here the pronoun **they** does not mean the same thing as in the previous verse. Luke is not saying that the leaders and soldiers who had arrested Jesus built this fire. Rather, Luke is using the word **they** in an indefinite sense. Alternate translation: “some people had started a fire” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
LUK	22	55	m580	writing-participants	περιαψάντων…πῦρ	1	they having kindled a fire	Luke is using this phrase to introduce some new characters into the story. Alternate translation: “some of the people who were there at the high priest’s house had started a fire” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
LUK	22	55	m581	figs-explicit	πῦρ	1	a fire	Implicitly, the purpose of the **fire** was to keep the people warm during the cool night. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “a fire to keep warm” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	22	55	qx64	figs-explicit	ἐν μέσῳ τῆς αὐλῆς	1	in the middle of the courtyard	Luke assumes that his readers will know that in this culture, the courtyard of a house had walls around it, but no roof. You may wish to clarify this for your readers. This was an outdoor fire. Alternate translation: “in the middle of the open courtyard” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	22	55	m8ew		μέσος αὐτῶν	1	in the midst of them	Alternate translation: “there together with them”
LUK	22	56	m582	writing-participants	ἰδοῦσα δὲ αὐτὸν, παιδίσκη τις	1	Then a certain female servant, seeing him	Luke says this to introduce this new character into the story. Alternate translation: “Now there was a female servant there who saw him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
LUK	22	56	fm4t		καθήμενον πρὸς τὸ φῶς	1	sitting towards the light	Alternate translation: “sitting facing the light of the fire” or “sitting with his face lit up by the fire”
LUK	22	56	fxz3	figs-explicit	καὶ ἀτενίσασα αὐτῷ εἶπεν	1	and looking steadily at him, said	Though this woman was looking at Peter, she was not speaking to him but to the others around them. It might be helpful to begin a new sentence here in your translation. Alternate translation: “She looked straight at Peter and said to the other people in the courtyard” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	22	56	zu63	figs-explicit	καὶ οὗτος σὺν αὐτῷ ἦν	1	This one also was with him	This could mean: (1) Peter was with Jesus when the group came to arrest him, as UST suggests. (2) since it is perhaps unlikely that this female servant accompanied that group, she may mean instead that she saw Peter with Jesus somewhere in Jerusalem earlier in the week and she could tell that he was associated with Jesus. Alternate translation: “I know that this man is one of Jesus’ disciples” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	22	57	dzq9		ὁ δὲ ἠρνήσατο	1	But he denied it	Alternate translation: “But Peter said that was not true”
LUK	22	57	vdm1		γύναι	1	Woman	Peter addresses the female servant as **Woman** because he does not know her name. He is not insulting her by calling her that. If your readers might think he was insulting her, you could use a way that is acceptable in your culture for a man to address a woman he does not know. Alternate translation: “Miss” or “Ma’am”
LUK	22	58	m583	writing-participants	ἕτερος	1	another	Luke uses this word to introduce another new character into the story. Alternate translation: “another of the people who was there by the fire” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
LUK	22	58	i65s		καὶ σὺ ἐξ αὐτῶν εἶ	1	You are also of them	Alternate translation: “You are also one of the people who were with Jesus”
LUK	22	58	cyv7		ἄνθρωπε	1	Man	Peter addresses this person as **Man** because he does not know his name. He is not insulting him by calling him that. If your readers might think he was insulting him, you could use a way that is acceptable in your culture for a man to address another man he does not know. Alternate translation: “Sir”
LUK	22	59	m584		διαστάσης ὡσεὶ ὥρας μιᾶς	1	about one hour having passed	You can express this in the way your language describes time. Alternate translation: “about an hour later”
LUK	22	59	m585	writing-participants	ἄλλος τις	1	a certain other one	Luke uses this expression to introduce a further character into the story. Alternate translation: “yet another of the people who was there by the fire” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
LUK	22	59	h5tb		διϊσχυρίζετο	1	was insisting	Alternate translation: “kept saying loudly”
LUK	22	59	fc42		οὗτος	1	this one	The phrase **this one** refers to Peter. The speaker probably did not know Peter’s name. Alternate translation: “this man”
LUK	22	59	qwf7	figs-explicit	καὶ γὰρ Γαλιλαῖός ἐστιν	1	for he is also a Galilean	The man could probably tell Peter was from Galilee from the way he talked. If it wold be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “for he speaks with a Galilean accent” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	22	59	m586	grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ γὰρ Γαλιλαῖός ἐστιν	1	for he is also a Galilean	If your readers would misunderstand this, you put this phrase before the previous phrase, as UST does, since this phrase gives the reason for the conclusion that the previous phrase states. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
LUK	22	60	ck93		ἄνθρωπε	1	Man	See how you translated this in [22:58](../22/58.md). Peter did not know the man’s name. He was not insulting him by calling him **Man**. Alternate translation: “Sir”
LUK	22	60	al3s	figs-idiom	οὐκ οἶδα ὃ λέγεις	1	I do not know what you are saying	This is an idiom that means that Peter completely disagrees with the man. Alternate translation: “what you are saying is not true at all” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	22	60	p6c5	writing-pronouns	ἔτι λαλοῦντος αὐτοῦ	1	while he was still speaking	The pronoun **he** refers to Peter, not to the other man. Alternate translation: “while Peter was speaking” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
LUK	22	60	lt62	translate-unknown	ἐφώνησεν ἀλέκτωρ	1	a rooster crowed	See how you translated the similar phrase in [22:34](../22/34.md). You may have decided to use a general expression there. Alternate translation: “the birds began to sing” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	22	61	gdp5		ὁ Κύριος…τοῦ Κυρίου	1	the Lord … the Lord	Luke is referring to Jesus by a respectful title. Alternate translation in each case: “the Lord Jesus”
LUK	22	61	dpk1	figs-metonymy	τοῦ ῥήματος τοῦ Κυρίου	1	the word of the Lord	Luke is using the term **word** figuratively to describe what Jesus had said using words. Alternate translation: “the statement Jesus had made” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	22	61	kkq8	translate-unknown	ἀλέκτορα φωνῆσαι	1	a rooster crows	See how you translated this in [22:60](../22/60.md) and the similar phrase in [22:34](../22/34.md). You may have decided to use a general expression. Alternate translation: “the birds begin to sing” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	22	61	ui26	figs-explicit	σήμερον	1	today	See how you translated this in [22:34](../22/34.md). The Jewish day started at sundown and continued to the next evening. Jesus had spoken the previous evening about what would happen shortly before dawn or at dawn, so this was still the same day. Alternate translation: “in the morning” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	22	61	zjc6		ἀπαρνήσῃ με τρίς	1	you will deny me three times	Alternate translation: “you will say three times that you do not know me”
LUK	22	62	m5gu	figs-explicit	ἐξελθὼν ἔξω, ἔκλαυσεν πικρῶς	1	going outside, he wept bitterly	As the note to [22:55](../22/55.md) explains, this was an open-air courtyard, so the people in it were already outside in that sense. This expression means that Peter left the courtyard and went completely outside the house of the high priest. Alternate translation: “Peter went out of the courtyard and away from the house, and he wept bitterly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	22	63	abcu	writing-pronouns	οἱ συνέχοντες αὐτὸν, ἐνέπαιζον αὐτῷ δέροντες	1	the men who were holding him mocked and beat him	The pronoun **him** refers to Jesus in both cases. Alternate translation: “the soldiers who were guarding Jesus mocked and beat Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
LUK	22	64	zn1p	translate-unknown	καὶ περικαλύψαντες αὐτὸν	1	And having blindfolded him	A **blindfold** is a thick cloth that people tie around the middle of a person’s head to cover the eyes and prevent that person from seeing. If your readers would not be familiar with this, you could explain it with a general expression. Alternate translation: “They covered his eyes so that he could not see, and” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	22	64	cl2v	figs-irony	προφήτευσον, τίς ἐστιν ὁ παίσας σε?	1	Prophesy! Who is the one who hit you?	The guards did not believe that Jesus was a prophet. Rather, they believed that a real prophet would know who hit him even if he could not see. When they called Jesus a prophet, they were saying the opposite of what they believed to be true. They were only calling him a prophet to mock him. Alternate translation: “Prove that you really are a prophet. Tell us who hit you!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])
LUK	22	64	m587	figs-rquestion	τίς ἐστιν ὁ παίσας σε?	1	Who is the one who hit you?	The guards do not expect Jesus to be able to answer their question. They are really using the question form to give a command, to tell Jesus what he should do if he wants to convince them that he is a prophet. So if your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this as a command. Alternate translation: “Tell us who hit you!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	22	64	q4g1	figs-explicit	προφήτευσον	1	Prophesy	The implication is that God would have to tell Jesus who struck him, since Jesus was blindfolded and could not see. Alternate translation: “Speak words from God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	22	65	m588		βλασφημοῦντες	1	blaspheming him	**Blaspheming** can have a technical sense, as it often does in this book. It can refer to a human being claiming to be God, as the Jewish leaders felt Jesus was doing in [5:21](../05/21.md). It can also refer to a human being wrongly denying that something is divine or of divine origin, as the Jewish leaders were afraid the people would consider them to be doing in [20:6](../20/06.md). By ironically suggesting that Jesus was not a true prophet, the soldiers actually were guilty of blasphemy in this technical sense. But the word can also have a general sense of “insult,” and that may be the sense in which Luke is using it here. Alternate translation: “insulting him”
LUK	22	66	v9m2		καὶ ὡς ἐγένετο ἡμέρα	1	And when it became day	Alternate translation: “As soon as it was light”
LUK	22	66	vp8u	writing-pronouns	ἀπήγαγον αὐτὸν εἰς τὸ Συνέδριον αὐτῶν	1	they led him into their Sanhedrin	The pronoun **they** does not necessarily refer to **the elders**. Rather, since Jesus was in the custody of the guards, the elders would have had the guards bring Jesus in. Alternate translation: “the elders had Jesus brought into the Sanhedrin” or “the guards led Jesus into the Sanhedrin” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
LUK	22	66	m589	figs-explicit	τὸ Συνέδριον αὐτῶν	1	their Sanhedrin	The **Sanhedrin** is the name of the ruling council of the Jews. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “the Sanhedrin, their ruling council” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	22	66	cboi	figs-metonymy	τὸ Συνέδριον αὐτῶν	1	their Sanhedrin	Luke is figuratively using the name of the Jewish ruling council to mean by association the meeting place of that council. Alternate translation: “the place where the Sanhedrin, their ruling council, met” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	22	66	m590	translate-names	Συνέδριον	1	Sanhedrin	**Sanhedrin** is the name of a governing body. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	22	67	br8y		λέγοντες	1	saying	It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “The elders said to Jesus”
LUK	22	67	h12k		εἰ σὺ εἶ ὁ Χριστός, εἰπὸν ἡμῖν	1	If you are the Christ, tell us	This sounds like a conditional statement, but it is actually an imperative. Alternate translation: “Tell us whether you are the Messiah”
LUK	22	67	g8iy	figs-hypo	ἐὰν ὑμῖν εἴπω, οὐ μὴ πιστεύσητε	1	If I told you, you would certainly not believe	Jesus is using a hypothetical situation to avoid answering the question directly, since that might give the elders a reason to say that he was guilty of blasphemy for claiming to be the Messiah. Alternate translation: “Suppose I said that I was the Messiah. Then you would certainly not believe me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
LUK	22	68	l7nz	figs-hypo	ἐὰν δὲ ἐρωτήσω, οὐ μὴ ἀποκριθῆτε	1	and if I questioned you, you would certainly not answer	Jesus is using a further hypothetical situation to avoid answering the question directly, in order not to give the elders a reason to say that he was guilty of blasphemy. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “And suppose I asked you whether you thought I was the Messiah. Then you would certainly not tell me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
LUK	22	68	m591	figs-explicit	ἐὰν…ἐρωτήσω	1	if I questioned you	The implicit meaning is that Jesus would **question** them about whether they thought he was the Messiah. Alternate translation: “suppose I asked you whether you thought I was the Messiah” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	22	69	z3ea		ἀπὸ τοῦ νῦν	1	from now on	Alternate translation: “after this”
LUK	22	69	p8kt	figs-123person	ὁ Υἱὸς τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου	1	the Son of Man	Here Jesus is referring to himself in the third person. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this in the first person. Alternate translation: “I, the Son of Man” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
LUK	22	69	m592	figs-explicit	ὁ Υἱὸς τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου	1	the Son of Man	See how you translated the title **Son of Man** in [5:24](../05/24.md). Alternate translation: “I, the Messiah” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	22	69	m593	figs-activepassive	ἔσται…καθήμενος	1	will be seated	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “will sit” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	22	69	nka9	translate-symaction	ἐκ δεξιῶν τῆς δυνάμεως τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	at the right hand of the power of God	To sit at the **right hand … of God** means to receive great honor and authority from God. Alternate translation: “in a place of honor next to the all-powerful God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
LUK	22	69	h4n3	figs-hendiadys	τῆς δυνάμεως τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	the power of God	This expression is like a hendiadys, in which two nouns are used together and one of them describes the other. Alternate translation: “the powerful God” or “the all-powerful God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
LUK	22	70	udh2	figs-explicit	σὺ οὖν εἶ ὁ Υἱὸς τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Therefore are you the Son of God	The council asked this question because they wanted Jesus to confirm explicitly their understanding that he was saying he was the Son of God. Alternate translation: “So when you said that, did you mean that you are the Son of God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	22	70	l4j7	guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	ὁ Υἱὸς τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	the Son of God	This is an important title that Jesus deserves, even though the elders did not think he deserved it. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
LUK	22	70	jtr9	figs-idiom	ὑμεῖς λέγετε ὅτι ἐγώ εἰμι	1	You are saying that I am	This is an idiom. Jesus is using it to acknowledge that what the elders are asking about is true. Alternate translation: “Yes, it is just as you say” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	22	71	u3m3	figs-rquestion	τί ἔτι ἔχομεν μαρτυρίας χρείαν?	1	What further need do we have of a witness?	The elders are using the question form for emphasis. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate their words as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “We have no further need for testimony!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	22	71	m594	figs-explicit	τί ἔτι ἔχομεν μαρτυρίας χρείαν?	1	What further need do we have of a witness?	The implications are that no further testimony is needed to prove a charge of blasphemy. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “We have no further need for testimony to prove a charge of blasphemy!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	22	71	m595	figs-exclusive	ἔχομεν…αὐτοὶ…ἠκούσαμεν	1	do we have … we ourselves have heard	The elders are speaking to one another about themselves, so **we** and **ourselves** would be exclusive, if your language marks that form. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
LUK	22	71	m596	grammar-connect-logic-result	αὐτοὶ γὰρ ἠκούσαμεν ἀπὸ τοῦ στόματος αὐτοῦ	1	For we ourselves have heard from his own mouth	If your readers would misunderstand this, you put this phrase before the previous phrase, as UST does, since this phrase gives the reason for the conclusion that the previous phrase states. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
LUK	22	71	lpm4	figs-metonymy	ἠκούσαμεν ἀπὸ τοῦ στόματος αὐτοῦ	1	we … have heard from his own mouth	The elders are using the expression **his own mouth** figuratively to refer to what Jesus has just said using his mouth. Alternate translation: “we … have heard what he just said” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	22	71	m597	figs-explicit	ἠκούσαμεν ἀπὸ τοῦ στόματος αὐτοῦ	1	we … have heard from his own mouth	The implications are that what Jesus has just said proves a charge of blasphemy by itself, because Jesus has claimed to be equal with God. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “we have heard him say that he is equal with God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	23	intro	p6wq			0		# Luke 23 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>1. Jesus stands trial before Pilate and Herod (23:1-25)<br>2. The Roman soldiers crucify Jesus (23:26-49)<br>3. Joseph of Arimathea buries Jesus and women prepare spices (23:50-56)<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### “The curtain of the temple was split in two”<br><br>The curtain in the temple was an important symbol that showed that people needed to have someone speak to God for them. They could not speak to God directly because all people are sinful and God hates sin. God split the curtain to show that Jesus’ people can now speak to God directly because Jesus has paid for their sins.<br><br>### The tomb<br><br>The tomb in which Jesus was buried (Luke 23:53) was the kind of tomb in which wealthy Jewish families buried their dead. It was an actual room cut into a rock. It had a flat place on one side where they could place the body after they had put oil and spices on it and wrapped it in cloth. Then they would roll a large rock in front of the tomb so no one could see inside or enter.<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### “Truly I say to you, today you will be with me in paradise”<br><br>There are two translation issues related to the statement, “Truly I say to you, today you will be with me in paradise” in [23:42](../23/42.md).<br><br>(1) When Jesus said this to the criminal who was crucified with him, it is possible that he was using the term **paradise** figuratively to mean “heaven,” describing it by association with the way that it is a place of comfort and consolation. Some groups of believers would understand it that way. However, other groups of believers would say that people who express their faith in Jesus, as this criminal did, still need to wait until the final resurrection before they go to heaven, and so **paradise** refers to a place where such people go when they die and await the final resurrection. Be sensitive to this difference in your translation. You may decide it is best simply to use the term **paradise** and leave the meaning open to either understanding. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])<br><br>(2) Some groups that may be active in your area, such as the Jehovah’s Witnesses, do not honor Jesus as the Son of God, and so they do not believe that he would have been able to promise the criminal entrance into paradise with himself that day, when they both would die. And so they translate or punctuate this so that the word **today** describes when Jesus is making the statement, rather than when the criminal will be in paradise. However, if that were actually the case, the Greek wording and word order would be different. The expression that introduces the statement would be, “Truly, today, I say to you,” or, “Truly I say to you today that.” The actual expression, “Truly I say to you,” occurs ten times in the book of Luke, and it always stands by itself as an introduction to a statement that follows. So **today** belongs with the statement, not with the introduction to the statement. Your language may have a way of making this clear, for example, by saying, “Truly I say to you, you will be with me in paradise today.”<br><br>## Important textual issues in this chapter<br><br>### “And he was obligated to release one to them at every feast” [23:17](../23/17.md)<br><br>This verse is not in the earliest and most accurate manuscripts of the Bible. Most scholars consider it to be a later addition for explanation. Many current versions of the Bible do not include it. Some versions put it into square brackets. We recommend that you do not translate this verse. However, if there are older versions of the Bible in your region that include this verse, you may include it.<br><br>### “Jesus said, ‘Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.’” [23:34](../23/34.md)<br><br>This sentence is not in the earliest and most accurate manuscripts of the Bible, and so it is likely not an original part of the Gospel of Luke. However, many scholars consider it an authentic saying of Jesus that was copied into the book at an early stage. ULT and UST include this sentence in this verse, but some other versions do not.<br><br>If you decide to include either [23:17](../23/17.md) or the additional sentence [23:34](../23/34.md) in your translation, you should enclose the material in square brackets to indicate that it is probably not original to Luke’s Gospel. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
LUK	23	1	pi3d	grammar-connect-time-sequential	καὶ	1	And	Luke uses this word to indicate that this event came after the events he has just described. Alternate translation (as in UST): “Then” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
LUK	23	1	sgf1	figs-hyperbole	ἅπαν τὸ πλῆθος αὐτῶν	1	the whole multitude of them	The word **whole** is a generalization. Luke says in [23:51](../23/51.md) that at least one member of the Sanhedrin did not agree that Jesus was guilty of blasphemy and should be punished. Alternate translation: “the many members of the ruling council who wanted to condemn Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
LUK	23	1	mvn9	figs-metonymy	ἀναστὰν	1	rose up	This means literally that they “stood up” or “stood to their feet,” but figuratively by extension it means that they adjourned the meeting and left the meeting place. Alternate translation: “ended the meeting” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	23	1	k4aa	figs-explicit	ἐπὶ τὸν Πειλᾶτον	1	to Pilate	The implication is that the Jewish leaders brought Jesus to Pilate because they wanted Pilate to judge him. Alternate translation: “to Pilate so that Pilate would judge him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	23	1	m598	translate-names	Πειλᾶτον	1	Pilate	**Pilate** is the name of the man who was the Roman ruler of Judea in this time. See how you translated his name in [3:1](../03/01.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	23	2	m599	figs-explicit	κατηγορεῖν αὐτοῦ	1	to accuse him	The chief priests and scribes accused Jesus of doing wrong things because they wanted Pilate to kill Jesus. But they were accusing him falsely, because Jesus had never done what they accused him of doing. For example, in [20:25](../20/25.md), Jesus had specifically said that the Jews could pay taxes to the Roman government. To make sure that your readers are not confused, you could state explicitly that these accusations were false. Alternate translation: “to accuse him falsely” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	23	2	mtc8	figs-exclusive	εὕρομεν…τὸ ἔθνος ἡμῶν	1	we found … our nation	The terms **we** and **our** refer only the members of the Jewish ruling council who are speaking, not to Pilate or any of the other people nearby. So in your translation, use the exclusive forms of these words, if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
LUK	23	2	im4v	figs-metaphor	διαστρέφοντα τὸ ἔθνος ἡμῶν	1	misleading our nation	The Jewish leaders speak figuratively of Jesus as if he were a guide who was leading someone in the wrong direction. Alternate translation: “encouraging our people to do things that are wrong” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	23	2	xsa4		κωλύοντα φόρους…διδόναι	1	forbidding to give tribute	Alternate translation: “telling them not to pay taxes”
LUK	23	2	l68k	figs-metonymy	Καίσαρι	1	to Caesar	See how you translated this in [20:22](../20/22.md). The Jewish leaders are referring figuratively to the Roman government by Caesar’s name, since he was its ruler. Alternate translation: “to the Roman government” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	23	3	m600	figs-hendiadys	ὁ…ἀποκριθεὶς αὐτῷ ἔφη	1	answering him he said	Together the two words **answering** and **said** mean that Jesus responded to what Pilate asked him. Alternate translation: “Jesus responded” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
LUK	23	3	ve4s	figs-idiom	σὺ λέγεις	1	You say so	Like the similar expression in [22:70](../22/70.md), this is an idiom. Jesus is using it to acknowledge that what Pilate has said is true. Alternate translation: “Yes, it is as you say” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	23	4	fx7d	writing-participants	καὶ τοὺς ὄχλους	1	and the crowds	Luke uses this phrase subtly within the narrative to introduce these new characters into the story. Alternate translation: “and to the crowds that had gathered there” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
LUK	23	4	s8fi	figs-explicit	οὐδὲν εὑρίσκω αἴτιον ἐν τῷ ἀνθρώπῳ τούτῳ	1	I find no cause in this man	Pilate means implicitly **no cause** to convict Jesus of a crime and punish him. Alternate translation: “I do not find this man to be guilty of anything” or “I find no grounds for conviction in this man’s case” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	23	5	m601	writing-pronouns	οἱ…ἐπίσχυον	1	they were insisting	The pronoun **they** refers to the Jewish leaders who had brought Jesus to Pilate for trial. Alternate translation: “the Jewish leaders kept insisting” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
LUK	23	5	yy6w	figs-metaphor	ἀνασείει τὸν λαὸν	1	He stirs up the people	The Jewish leaders speak figuratively as if Jesus were stirring a pot and putting in motion things that had been lying quietly on the bottom. They mean that he is encouraging rebellion. Alternate translation: “He encourages the people to rebel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	23	5	cr78		καὶ ἀρξάμενος ἀπὸ τῆς Γαλιλαίας ἕως ὧδε	1	beginning from Galilee as far as here	It might be helpful to make this a new sentence. Alternate translation: “He began causing trouble in Galilee, and he has done so all the way to here”
LUK	23	6	vvp6	figs-explicit	Πειλᾶτος…ἀκούσας	1	when Pilate heard this	As the rest of the verse shows, this refers implicitly to Pilate hearing that Jesus had begun teaching in Galilee. Alternate translation: “when Pilate heard that Jesus had begun to teach in Galilee” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	23	6	px94	figs-quotations	ἐπηρώτησεν εἰ ὁ ἄνθρωπος Γαλιλαῖός ἐστιν	1	he asked whether the man was a Galilean	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could represent this as a direct quotation, as UST does. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
LUK	23	6	dr1s	figs-explicit	ὁ ἄνθρωπος	1	the man	The term **the man** refers to Jesus. Alternate translation: “Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	23	7	cbn1	figs-explicit	ἐπιγνοὺς ὅτι	1	when he learned that	The implication is that the Jewish leaders answered Pilate’s question and confirmed that Jesus came from Galilee. Alternate translation: “when the Jewish leaders confirmed to Pilate that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	23	7	mn6i	figs-explicit	ἐκ τῆς ἐξουσίας Ἡρῴδου ἐστὶν	1	he was under the authority of Herod	The implication is that Jesus was under Herod’s authority because Herod was the ruler of Galilee. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “Jesus was under the authority of Herod, since Herod ruled over Galilee” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	23	7	ay2i	figs-explicit	ἀνέπεμψεν αὐτὸν πρὸς Ἡρῴδην	1	he sent him to Herod	The implication seems to be that Pilate used these grounds to get someone else to decide Jesus’ case. He did not want to decide it himself, because he would either have to release someone the Jewish leaders wanted condemned or else condemn someone he knew was innocent. Alternate translation: “he referred Jesus’ case to Herod so that he would not have to decide it himself” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	23	7	ys2n	figs-idiom	ἐν ταύταις ταῖς ἡμέραις	1	in those days	Luke is using the term **days** figuratively to refer to a specific time. Alternate translation: “at that time” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	23	8	z3zz	writing-pronouns	θέλων ἰδεῖν αὐτὸν…διὰ τὸ ἀκούειν περὶ αὐτοῦ	1	he had been desiring to see him … because he had heard about him	In these phrases, **he** refers to Herod and **him** refers to Jesus. Alternate translation: “wanting to see Jesus … because he had heard about Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
LUK	23	8	b424	figs-activepassive	ἤλπιζέν τι σημεῖον ἰδεῖν ὑπ’ αὐτοῦ γινόμενον	1	he was hoping to see some sign happen by him	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “Herod wanted to see Jesus perform a miracle” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	23	9	hbp3	figs-metonymy	ἐπηρώτα…αὐτὸν ἐν λόγοις ἱκανοῖς	1	he questioned him in many words	Luke is using the term **words** figuratively to refer to what Herod said as he questioned Jesus. Alternate translation: “Herod asked Jesus many questions” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	23	9	c8li		οὐδὲν ἀπεκρίνατο αὐτῷ	1	he answered him nothing	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could make the verb negative and the object positive here. Alternate translation: “Jesus did not say anything in reply”
LUK	23	10	lpu6		ἵστήκεισαν	1	stood by	Alternate translation: “were standing there”
LUK	23	10	hn8g		εὐτόνως κατηγοροῦντες αὐτοῦ	1	vehemently accusing him	Alternate translation: “insisting strongly that Jesus was guilty of doing wrong”
LUK	23	11	m602		ἐξουθενήσας…αὐτὸν	1	despised him	This does not mean that Herod hated Jesus, but that he treated him as if he were worthless. Alternate translation: “humiliated him”
LUK	23	11	qt1c	figs-explicit	περιβαλὼν ἐσθῆτα λαμπρὰν	1	Putting elegant clothing around him	Herod and his soldiers did this to mock Jesus and to make fun of him, so be sure that your readers do not get the impression that they did this to honor or care for Jesus. Alternate translation: “Dressing him mockingly in beautiful clothes” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	23	12	b6f1	figs-explicit	ἐγένοντο…φίλοι ὅ τε Ἡρῴδης καὶ ὁ Πειλᾶτος ἐν αὐτῇ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ μετ’ ἀλλήλων	1	both Herod and Pilate became friends with each other on that day	Luke does not say specifically why these two men **became friends**. This could mean: (1) Pilate had shown Herod courtesy by respecting his jurisdiction over Jesus. Alternate translation: “Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day because Pilate had respectfully sent Jesus to Herod to judge him” (2) they realized that they agreed in their opinion about Jesus. They both felt that he was not guilty of doing wrong, but they also felt they could mistreat him as a way of asserting their power and authority over someone the people considered a leader. Alternate translation: “Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day because they had both responded to Jesus in the same way” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	23	12	x7r8	grammar-connect-logic-result	προϋπῆρχον γὰρ ἐν ἔχθρᾳ ὄντες πρὸς αὑτούς	1	for they were previously being in hostility between themselves	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could put this clause first in the verse, as UST does, since it gives the reason for the results that the rest of the verse describes. These two men had to become **friends** because they had not been **friends** previously. Alternate translation, as the beginning of the verse, replacing “Then”: “Before this Herod and Pilate had been enemies, but now” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
LUK	23	13	d7gn	writing-participants	τὸν λαὸν	1	the people	This is a further reference reintroducing these participants, whom Luke first introduced subtly in 23:4. It is not likely that Pilate asked a crowd to gather. Instead, the crowd was probably still there waiting to see what would happen to Jesus. Alternate translation: “the crowd of people that was still there” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
LUK	23	14	dh77	figs-explicit	εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτούς, προσηνέγκατέ μοι τὸν ἄνθρωπον τοῦτον	1	said to them, “You brought this man to me”	By **this man**, Pilate means Jesus. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “said to them about Jesus, ‘You brought this man to me’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	23	14	wsw6	figs-metaphor	ὡς ἀποστρέφοντα τὸν λαόν	1	as turning the people away	Here Pilate uses a figurative term that is similar to the one that the council members use in [23:2](../23/02.md) when they accuse Jesus of “misleading” the Jewish nation, meaning that he was encouraging them to do wrong things. The slightly different term that Pilate uses to summarize their charges means that they accused Jesus of **turning the people away** from their duties to the Roman Empire. It does not mean that Jesus refused to welcome people who came to him for help. Alternate translation: “saying that he encourages the people to be disloyal to the Roman Empire” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	23	14	m603	figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	behold	Pilate uses the term **behold** to get the Jewish leaders and the crowd to focus their attention on what he is about to say. Alternate translation: “indeed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	23	14	m604	writing-pronouns	ἐγὼ ἐνώπιον ὑμῶν ἀνακρίνας	1	I, having examined him before you	For emphasis, since he is declaring Jesus innocent, Pilate uses the personal pronoun **I** here when it would not ordinarily be required in Greek. If your language uses pronouns in this same way, it would be appropriate to do that here in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
LUK	23	14	m605	figs-metaphor	ἐγὼ ἐνώπιον ὑμῶν ἀνακρίνας, οὐθὲν εὗρον	1	I, having examined him before you, found nothing	The term **before** figuratively means “in the presence” of another person. Alternate translation: “I have questioned him in your presence, and I have found nothing” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	23	14	ee53	figs-explicit	ἐγὼ ἐνώπιον ὑμῶν ἀνακρίνας, οὐθὲν εὗρον	1	I, having examined him before you, found nothing	The implication is that the Jewish leaders were witnesses to the proceedings. Alternate translation: “I have questioned him with you present as witnesses, and I have found nothing” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	23	14	e517		οὐθὲν εὗρον ἐν τῷ ἀνθρώπῳ τούτῳ αἴτιον ὧν κατηγορεῖτε κατ’ αὐτοῦ	1	found nothing in this man as cause for what you are accusing against him	See how you translated the similar expression in [23:4](../23/04.md). Alternate translation: “found no grounds to convict this man on the charges you are making against him”
LUK	23	15	h623	figs-ellipsis	ἀλλ’ οὐδὲ Ἡρῴδης	1	But neither did Herod	Here Pilate is speaking in an abbreviated way. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could clarify his meaning by adding information from the previous sentence. Alternate translation: “But Herod did not find any grounds to convict him either” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
LUK	23	15	bn7l	grammar-connect-logic-result	ἀνέπεμψεν γὰρ αὐτὸν πρὸς ἡμᾶς	1	for he sent him back to us	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could put this clause first in the verse, as UST does, since it gives the reason why it is clear that Herod did not consider Jesus guilty. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
LUK	23	15	i2ba	figs-exclusive	πρὸς ἡμᾶς	1	to us	Pilate means that Herod sent Jesus back not just to him and his soldiers, but also to the Jewish leaders who were the accusers in this trial. Since Pilate is speaking specifically to those leaders (he says in the previous verse, “You brought this man to me”), the word **us** includes the addressees. So it would be inclusive, if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
LUK	23	15	gs4m	figs-activepassive	οὐδὲν ἄξιον θανάτου ἐστὶν πεπραγμένον αὐτῷ	1	nothing worthy of death has been done by him	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “he has not done anything to deserve being put to death” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	23	16	p5wa	figs-explicit	παιδεύσας οὖν αὐτὸν, ἀπολύσω	1	Therefore, having punished him, I will release him	Your readers may find this hard to understand. Since Pilate had found Jesus not guilty, he should have released him without punishing him. The implications are that Pilate punished Jesus anyway, even though he knew he was innocent, to try to satisfy the Jewish leaders. However, since Luke does not provide this explanation in his book, you probably should not add it to your translation. But you could make explicit that Pilate is saying he is not going to execute Jesus. Alternate translation: “So I will not execute him, but whip him, and then let him go” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	23	16	m606	figs-synecdoche	παιδεύσας…αὐτὸν	1	having punished him	Pilate will not administer this punishment personally. Rather, he will have his soldiers do it. Alternate translation: “after having my soldiers whip him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
LUK	23	17	m607	translate-textvariants	Ἀνάγκην δὲ εἶχεν ἀπολύειν αὐτοῖς κατὰ ἑορτὴν ἕνα	1	And he had obligation to release one to them at every feast	See the discussion of textual issues at the end of the General Notes to this chapter to decide whether to include this verse in your translation. The notes below discuss translation issues in the verse, for those who decide to include it. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
LUK	23	17	m608	grammar-connect-time-background	δὲ	1	And	This verse uses this word to introduce background information that will help readers understand what is happening. In the previous verse, Pilate was saying that Jesus would be the prisoner he was obligated to release. But in the next verse, the crowd shouts for him to release a different man instead. Alternate translation: “Now” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background]])
LUK	23	17	m609	writing-pronouns	Ἀνάγκην…εἶχεν	1	he had obligation	The pronoun **he** refers to Pilate. Alternate translation: “Pilate was obligated” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
LUK	23	17	m610	figs-nominaladj	ἕνα	1	one	This verse is using the adjective **one** as a noun. In context, the term clearly means **one** prisoner. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can supply the noun for clarity, as ULT does. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
LUK	23	17	m611	figs-synecdoche	κατὰ ἑορτὴν	1	at every feast	This verse uses the general term **feast** to mean one feast in particular, Passover. Alternate translation: “during each Passover celebration” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
LUK	23	18	v7pf	writing-pronouns	ἀνέκραγον…πανπληθεὶ	1	they cried out all together	The pronoun **they** refers to the people in the crowd. Alternate translation: “the people in the crowd shouted together” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
LUK	23	18	ib9q	figs-imperative	αἶρε τοῦτον	1	Take away this one	This is an imperative, but since the crowd cannot command Pilate to do this, you can translate it as an expression of what they want. Alternate translation: “We want you to execute this man” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
LUK	23	18	m612	figs-imperative	ἀπόλυσον δὲ ἡμῖν τὸν Βαραββᾶν	1	but release to us Barabbas	This is another imperative, and since the crowd cannot command Pilate to do this either, you can also translate it as an expression of what they want. Alternate translation: “and we want you to set Barabbas free instead” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
LUK	23	18	i6pj	figs-exclusive	ἀπόλυσον…ἡμῖν	1	release to us	When the people in the crowd say **us**, they are referring to themselves only, not to Pilate and his soldiers as well. So if your language distinguishes between exclusive and inclusive **us,** you would use the exclusive form here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
LUK	23	18	m613	translate-names	Βαραββᾶν	1	Barabbas	**Barabbas** is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	23	19	vd6b	writing-background	ὅστις ἦν διὰ στάσιν τινὰ γενομένην ἐν τῇ πόλει καὶ φόνον, βληθεὶς ἐν τῇ φυλακῇ	1	He had been put in prison for a certain rebellion that happened in the city, and for murder	Luke provides this background information to explain to his readers who Barabbas was. Alternate translation: “Now Barabbas was a man whom the Romans had put in prison because he had led a rebellion in Jerusalem and he had killed people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
LUK	23	19	qdv7	figs-activepassive	ὅστις ἦν…βληθεὶς ἐν τῇ φυλακῇ	1	He had been put in prison	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who did the action. Alternate translation: “The Romans had put him in prison” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	23	19	zl1f	figs-explicit	διὰ στάσιν τινὰ γενομένην ἐν τῇ πόλει	1	for a certain rebellion that happened in the city	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state explicitly that Barabbas led this rebellion against the Roman government. Alternate translation: “because he had led a rebellion in Jerusalem against the Roman government” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	23	20	vbp4	writing-pronouns	πάλιν…προσεφώνησεν αὐτοῖς	1	again addressed them	The pronoun **them** refers to the religious leaders who had accused Jesus and the crowd that was shouting for him to be executed. Alternate translation: “spoke again to the religious leaders and to the people in the crowd” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
LUK	23	20	t1i2	grammar-connect-logic-result	θέλων ἀπολῦσαι τὸν Ἰησοῦν	1	desiring to release Jesus	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could put this phrase before the previous one, as UST does, since it gives the reason why Pilate spoke to the leaders and the crowd again. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
LUK	23	21	m614	translate-unknown	σταύρου, σταύρου αὐτόν	1	Crucify, crucify him	As a note to [14:27](../14/27.md) explains, the Romans executed some criminals by nailing them to a wooden beam with crossbar and setting the beam upright so that the criminals would slowly suffocate. That was what it meant to **crucify** someone. Alternate translation: “Nail him to a cross! Execute him!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	23	21	m615	figs-imperative	σταύρου, σταύρου αὐτόν	1	Crucify, crucify him	This is an imperative, but since the crowd cannot command Pilate to do this, you can translate it as an expression of what they want. Alternate translation: “We want you to nail him to a cross to execute him!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
LUK	23	22	iz5v	translate-ordinal	ὁ…τρίτον εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτούς	1	he spoke to them a third time	If your language does not use ordinal numbers, you can use a cardinal number here. Alternate translation: “Pilate spoke to the crowd again, for time number three” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
LUK	23	22	ck75	figs-rquestion	τί γὰρ κακὸν ἐποίησεν οὗτος?	1	For what evil has this one done?	Pilate does not expect the crowd to tell him what Jesus has done wrong. Rather, he is using the question form to emphasize to the crowd that Jesus is innocent. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “There is no reason to execute this man, because he has not done anything wrong!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	23	22	de5a		οὐδὲν αἴτιον θανάτου εὗρον ἐν αὐτῷ	1	No cause for death have I found in him	Alternate translation: “I have not found any grounds to convict him of a crime for which he should be executed”
LUK	23	22	mij1	figs-explicit	παιδεύσας οὖν αὐτὸν, ἀπολύσω	1	Therefore, having punished him, I will release him	See the note to this same sentence in [23:16](../23/16.md). Pilate should have released Jesus without punishment, because he was innocent. It seems that Pilate decided to punish Jesus anyway to try to satisfy the Jewish leaders. However, since Luke does not provide this explanation in his book, you probably should not add it to your translation. But you could make explicit that Pilate is saying he is not going to execute Jesus. Alternate translation: “So I will not execute him, but whip him, and then let him go” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	23	22	m616	figs-synecdoche	παιδεύσας…αὐτὸν, ἀπολύσω	1	having punished him, I will release him	Pilate is not going to administer this punishment personally. Rather, he will have his soldiers do it. Alternate translation: “I will have my soldiers whip him, and then I will release him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
LUK	23	23	sni4	figs-metonymy	φωναῖς μεγάλαις	1	with loud voices	Luke is describing the shouts of the crowd figuratively by reference to the **voices** that the people used to make them. Alternate translation: “with loud shouts” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	23	23	pst8	figs-activepassive	αὐτὸν σταυρωθῆναι	1	for him to be crucified	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who would do the action. Alternate translation: “that Pilate have his soldiers crucify Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	23	23	pgz9	figs-personification	κατίσχυον αἱ φωναὶ αὐτῶν	1	their voices prevailed	Luke speaks figuratively of the **voices** as if they were a living thing that actively overcame Pilate’s reluctance. Alternate translation: “the crowd kept shouting until they convinced Pilate” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
LUK	23	24	m617	grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ	1	And	Luke uses this word to introduce the results of what the previous sentence described. Because the people in the crowd overcame his reluctance with their shouts, Pilate agreed to do what they wanted. Alternate translation: “So” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
LUK	23	24	tfw2		γενέσθαι τὸ αἴτημα αὐτῶν	1	for their demand to happen	Alternate translation: “to do what the crowd was demanding”
LUK	23	25	nwd3	figs-explicit	τὸν…βεβλημένον εἰς φυλακὴν	1	the one who had been put in prison	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state explicitly that this means Barabbas. Alternate translation: “Barabbas, whom the Romans had put in prison” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	23	25	t66f	figs-activepassive	βεβλημένον εἰς φυλακὴν	1	who had been put in prison	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who did the action. Alternate translation: “whom the Romans had put in prison” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	23	25	z8v8	figs-personification	τὸν δὲ Ἰησοῦν παρέδωκεν τῷ θελήματι αὐτῶν	1	he handed over Jesus to their will	Luke speaks figuratively of the **will** of the people as if it were a living thing into whose custody Pilate delivered Jesus. Alternate translation: “but he ordered his soldiers to do to Jesus what the crowd had demanded” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
LUK	23	26	s9kc		ὡς ἀπήγαγον αὐτόν	1	as they led him away	Alternate translation: “while the soldiers were leading Jesus away from where Pilate had judged him”
LUK	23	26	ysu3	figs-explicit	ἐπιλαβόμενοι Σίμωνά…ἐπέθηκαν	1	seizing Simon … they put	Luke assumes that his readers will know that Roman soldiers had the authority to compel people to carry their loads. Be sure that your translation does not suggest that the soldiers arrested Simon or that he had done anything wrong. Alternate translation: “making use of their authority, they conscripted Simon … and put” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	23	26	m618	writing-background	Σίμωνά, τινα Κυρηναῖον ἐρχόμενον ἀπ’ ἀγροῦ	1	Simon, a certain Cyrenean coming from the country	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could treat this information about this man, where he was from, and what he was doing as background information and put it first in the verse, as UST does. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
LUK	23	26	m619	writing-participants	Σίμωνά, τινα Κυρηναῖον	1	Simon, a certain Cyrenean	Luke uses this phrase to introduce this new character into the story. Alternate translation: “a man named Simon, who was from the city of Cyrene” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
LUK	23	26	x5qz	translate-names	Σίμωνά	1	Simon	**Simon** is the name of a man. See how you translated it in [4:38](../04/38.md). (It is the same name there, even though it is the name of a different person.) (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	23	26	m620	translate-names	Κυρηναῖον	1	Cyrenean	The term **Cyrenean** is a name that refers to a person who is from the city of Cyrene. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	23	26	i5ua		ἐρχόμενον ἀπ’ ἀγροῦ	1	coming from the country	Alternate translation: “who was coming into Jerusalem from the countryside”
LUK	23	26	fub3		ἐπέθηκαν αὐτῷ τὸν σταυρὸν	1	they put the cross on him	Alternate translation: “the soldiers put the cross on his shoulders”
LUK	23	26	y3p6		ὄπισθεν τοῦ Ἰησοῦ	1	to carry behind Jesus	Alternate translation: “and made him walk along behind Jesus carrying it”
LUK	23	27	ad9f		ἠκολούθει…αὐτῷ πολὺ πλῆθος τοῦ λαοῦ, καὶ γυναικῶν	1	a great crowd of the people was following him, and of women	The women were part of the large crowd. They were not in a separate crowd of their own. Alternate translation: “a great crowd of people, which included women, was following him”
LUK	23	27	s7gx	writing-background	καὶ γυναικῶν αἳ ἐκόπτοντο καὶ ἐθρήνουν αὐτόν	1	and of women who were mourning and wailing for him	Luke provides this background information to help readers understand what happens next, when Jesus speaks to these women. It might be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “Now the crowd included women who were mourning and wailing for Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
LUK	23	27	m621	translate-symaction	ἐκόπτοντο	1	mourning	See the note to this term at [8:52](../08/52.md), and see how you translated it there. It could mean that the women were pounding on their chests as a sign of grief, as was customary in this culture, or it could mean more generally that they were expressing their sorrow over what was happening to Jesus. Alternate translation: “pounding on their chests” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
LUK	23	27	bp3x		ἠκολούθει…αὐτῷ	1	was following him	Here, the word **following** is not figurative. It does not mean that these people were Jesus’ disciples. Alternate translation: “were walking along behind him”
LUK	23	28	nl38	figs-metaphor	θυγατέρες Ἰερουσαλήμ	1	Daughters of Jerusalem	As in [13:34](../13/34.md), Jesus is figuratively describing people who live in Jerusalem as if they were the children of the city and it was their mother. Alternate translation: “You women who live in Jerusalem” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	23	28	wi15	figs-explicit	ἐφ’ ἑαυτὰς κλαίετε, καὶ ἐπὶ τὰ τέκνα ὑμῶν	1	weep for yourselves and for your children	Jesus does not say specifically why the women should weep for themselves and for their children, but the implication from what he says in [23:31](../23/31.md) is that they should weep because even worse things are going to happen to them. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “weep for yourselves and for your children, because even worse things are going to happen to you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	23	29	s9uj	translate-versebridge	ὅτι	1	For	Jesus is giving the reason why the women of Jerusalem should weep for themselves and their children, as he told them to do in the previous verse. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could put this reason before the result by combining this verse and the previous one into a verse bridge. See the suggestions in the note about the similar situation in [22:16](../22/16.md) for how you might do this. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge]])
LUK	23	29	rd8v	figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	behold	Jesus is using the term **behold** to get the women to focus their attention on what he is about to say. Alternate translation: “indeed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	23	29	bjb7	figs-idiom	ἔρχονται ἡμέραι ἐν αἷς	1	the days are coming in which	Jesus is using the term **days** figuratively to refer to a specific time. Alternate translation: “there will be a time when” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	23	29	xi9e	writing-pronouns	ἐν αἷς ἐροῦσιν	1	in which they will say	Here Jesus is using the pronoun **they** in an indefinite sense. He does not have specific individuals in mind. Alternate translation: “when people will say” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
LUK	23	29	m622	figs-quotesinquotes	ἐροῦσιν, μακάριαι αἱ στεῖραι, καὶ αἱ κοιλίαι αἳ οὐκ ἐγέννησαν, καὶ μαστοὶ οἳ οὐκ ἔθρεψαν	1	they will say, ‘Blessed are the barren, yes, the wombs that did not give birth and the breasts that did not nurse.’	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “people will say that women are fortunate if they never had children, if they never gave birth or nursed babies” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	23	29	rgj1	figs-parallelism	αἱ στεῖραι, καὶ αἱ κοιλίαι αἳ οὐκ ἐγέννησαν, καὶ μαστοὶ οἳ οὐκ ἔθρεψαν	1	the barren, yes, the wombs that did not give birth and the breasts that did not nurse	After speaking of women who were **barren**, that is, who did not have children, Jesus describes the same women in more detail. He is likely using repetition for emphasis. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could combine these phrases, as UST does. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
LUK	23	29	m623	figs-synecdoche	αἱ κοιλίαι αἳ οὐκ ἐγέννησαν, καὶ μαστοὶ οἳ οὐκ ἔθρεψαν	1	the wombs that did not give birth and the breasts that did not nurse	These are two figures of speech in which Jesus is using one part of a person to represent the entire person. Alternate translation: “women who have never given birth or nursed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
LUK	23	30	te1i	grammar-connect-time-simultaneous	τότε	1	Then	Here, **then** does not mean that people would say this after what they said in the previous verse. Rather, it means that they would say this at the same time that they were saying that. Alternate translation: “At that time” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous]])
LUK	23	30	u1x1	writing-pronouns	ἄρξονται λέγειν	1	they will begin to say	Here Jesus is likely using the pronoun **they** in an indefinite sense, as in the previous verse. He probably does not have specific individuals in mind. However, the general reference may be to the people of Jerusalem, as UST suggests. Alternate translation: “people will begin to say” or “the people of Jerusalem will begin to say” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
LUK	23	30	m624	figs-apostrophe	λέγειν τοῖς ὄρεσιν, πέσετε ἐφ’ ἡμᾶς; καὶ τοῖς βουνοῖς, καλύψατε ἡμᾶς	1	to say to the mountains, ‘Fall on us,’ and to the hills, ‘Cover us’	Jesus is saying that at this time people will figuratively address something they know cannot hear them in order to express in a strong way what they are feeling. Alternate translation: “to say that they wished the mountains would fall on them and the hills would cover them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe]])
LUK	23	30	m625	figs-quotesinquotes	λέγειν τοῖς ὄρεσιν, πέσετε ἐφ’ ἡμᾶς; καὶ τοῖς βουνοῖς, καλύψατε ἡμᾶς	1	to say to the mountains, ‘Fall on us,’ and to the hills, ‘Cover us’	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “to tell the mountains to fall on them and the hills to cover them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	23	30	m626	figs-imperative	πέσετε ἐφ’ ἡμᾶς…καλύψατε ἡμᾶς	1	Fall on us … Cover us	This is an imperative, but since the people cannot order the mountains and hills to do this, they would be using the imperative to express their wishes. Alternate translation: “We wish you would fall on us … We wish you would cover us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
LUK	23	30	m627	figs-explicit	πέσετε ἐφ’ ἡμᾶς…καλύψατε ἡμᾶς	1	Fall on us … Cover us	The people do not want the mountains and hills to fall on them to harm them, but rather to protect them. Alternate translation: “We wish you would fall on us to protect us … We wish you would cover us to protect us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	23	30	m628	figs-exclusive	πέσετε ἐφ’ ἡμᾶς…καλύψατε ἡμᾶς	1	Fall on us … Cover us	When the people say **us**, they are referring to themselves only, not to the mountains and hills as well. So here, use the exclusive form of **us** if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
LUK	23	31	nkk3	figs-metaphor	ὅτι εἰ ἐν τῷ ὑγρῷ ξύλῳ, ταῦτα ποιοῦσιν; ἐν τῷ ξηρῷ, τί γένηται?	1	For if they do these things in the moist tree, what will happen in the dry?	This is a figure of speech based on the idea that dry wood catches fire much more easily than moist wood. The fire, in turn, represents terrible things that people will experience. Jesus is saying that under the present relatively stable conditions, it was difficult for his enemies to arrest him and sentence him to death. In the future, conditions will become so desperate and chaotic that people will be able to do much worse things much more easily. He is probably referring to what conditions will be like during the siege and destruction of Jerusalem, which he described in [21:20-24](../21/20.md). If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the meaning of this metaphor in your translation, and you could represent the metaphor itself as a simile, as UST does. Alternate translation: “If people are able to do this when conditions are good, what will they do when conditions become very bad?” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	23	31	y238	figs-rquestion	ὅτι εἰ ἐν τῷ ὑγρῷ ξύλῳ, ταῦτα ποιοῦσιν; ἐν τῷ ξηρῷ, τί γένηται?	1	For if they do these things in the moist tree, what will happen in the dry?	Jesus does not expect the women to tell him what people will do in the future. Rather, he is using the question form for emphasis. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “Since people are doing this when conditions are good, they will certainly do much worse when conditions become very bad!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	23	31	m629	writing-pronouns	ταῦτα ποιοῦσιν	1	they do these things	Here Jesus is using the pronoun **they** in an indefinite sense. Alternate translation: “people are doing these things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
LUK	23	31	m630	figs-idiom	ἐν τῷ ὑγρῷ ξύλῳ	1	in the moist tree	This is an idiom. Alternate translation: “when the wood is fresh” or “when the wood is wet” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	23	31	m631	figs-metonymy	ξύλῳ	1	tree	Jesus is using the term **tree** figuratively to refer to wood that comes from a **tree**. Alternate translation: “wood” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	23	31	m632	translate-unknown	ξύλῳ	1	tree	A **tree** is a large plant with a hard exterior that people use for fuel and as building material. If your readers would not know what a **tree** is, or if people do not use wood from a **tree** as fuel in your area, you could use the name of something else that they use for fuel, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “burning material” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	23	31	zt5s	figs-idiom	ἐν τῷ ξηρῷ	1	in the dry	This is an idiom. Alternate translation: “when the wood is dry” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	23	31	m633	figs-nominaladj	ἐν τῷ ξηρῷ	1	in the dry	Jesus is using the adjective **dry** as a noun. In context, the term means **dry** wood. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can supply the noun for clarity. Alternate translation: “with dry wood” or “when the wood is dry” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
LUK	23	32	m634	writing-background	δὲ	1	And	Luke uses this word to introduce background information that will help readers understand what happens next. Alternate translation: “Now” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
LUK	23	32	w8yj	figs-activepassive	ἤγοντο…καὶ ἕτεροι κακοῦργοι δύο σὺν αὐτῷ	1	others, two criminals, were also being led away with him	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who was doing the action. Alternate translation: “with him the soldiers were also leading away two other men, who were criminals,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	23	32	m635	figs-verbs	ἤγοντο…καὶ ἕτεροι κακοῦργοι δύο	1	others, two criminals, were also being led away	If your language does use passive verb forms, and if it also uses a dual form, this verb should be in the dual form if it is passive, since the two criminals would be the subject. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-verbs]])
LUK	23	32	m636	writing-participants	ἤγοντο δὲ καὶ ἕτεροι κακοῦργοι δύο	1	And others, two criminals, were also being led away	Luke uses this phrase to introduce these new characters into the story. Alternate translation: “And there were two other men, who were criminals, who were also being led away” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
LUK	23	32	m2nh	figs-distinguish	ἕτεροι κακοῦργοι δύο	1	others, two criminals	This does not mean “two other criminals,” which would imply that Jesus was also a criminal. Jesus was innocent, even though the Romans were treating him as if he were a criminal. Be sure that this distinction is clear in your translation. Alternate translation: “two other men, who actually were criminals” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish]])
LUK	23	32	m637	figs-activepassive	ἀναιρεθῆναι	1	to be put to death	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “so that they could execute them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	23	33	wj2q	writing-pronouns	ὅτε ἦλθον ἐπὶ τὸν τόπον	1	when they came to the place	The pronoun **they** includes the soldiers, the criminals, and Jesus. Alternate translation: “when they all arrived at the place” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
LUK	23	33	m638	figs-activepassive	τὸν καλούμενον	1	that is called	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “that people call” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	23	33	m639	translate-names	Κρανίον	1	The Skull	**The Skull** is the name of a place. Even though it consists of an article and a common noun, translate it following the conventions of your language for names. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	23	33	i3vx	writing-pronouns	ἐσταύρωσαν αὐτὸν	1	they crucified him	In this case the pronoun **they** refers to the Roman soldiers. Alternate translation: “the Roman soldiers crucified Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
LUK	23	33	m640	translate-unknown	ἐσταύρωσαν αὐτὸν	1	they crucified him	See how you translated the term “crucify” in [23:21](../23/21.md). Alternate translation: “the Roman soldiers nailed Jesus to a cross to execute him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	23	33	bjr2	figs-nominaladj	ὃν μὲν ἐκ δεξιῶν, ὃν δὲ ἐξ ἀριστερῶν	1	one at the right and one at the left	Luke is using the adjectives **right** and **left** as nouns to indicate locations. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can supply a noun such as “side” for clarity. Alternate translation: “they crucified one criminal at Jesus’ right side and the other criminal at Jesus’ left side” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
LUK	23	34	m641	translate-textvariants		0	But Jesus said, “Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing”	See the discussion of textual issues at the end of the General Notes to this chapter to decide whether to include this sentence in your translation. The next four notes below discuss translation issues in the sentence, for those who decide to include it. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
LUK	23	34	m642	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	δὲ	1	But	Luke uses this word to introduce a contrast between what the Roman soldiers were doing to Jesus and the way in which Jesus responded. It would appropriate to indicate a strong contrast here. Alternate translation: “Nevertheless” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
LUK	23	34	m643	grammar-connect-logic-result		0	Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could reverse the order of the phrases in Jesus’ prayer, since the first phrase gives the reason for the result that Jesus is requesting in the second phrase. Alternate translation: “Father, they do not know what they are doing, so please forgive them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
LUK	23	34	m644	guidelines-sonofgodprinciples		0	Father	This is an important title for God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
LUK	23	34	m645	figs-imperative		0	forgive them	This is an imperative, but it should be translated as a request, rather than as a command. It may be helpful to add an expression such as “please” to make this clear. Alternate translation: “please forgive them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
LUK	23	34	qbj8	writing-pronouns	διαμεριζόμενοι δὲ τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτοῦ, ἔβαλον κλῆρον	1	Then, dividing up his garments, they threw lots	The pronoun **they** refers to the Roman soldiers. Alternate translation: “Then the Roman soldiers threw lots to decide which of them would get each piece of Jesus’ clothing” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
LUK	23	34	uk4s	translate-unknown	ἔβαλον κλῆρον	1	they threw lots	The term **lots** refers to objects with different markings on various sides that were used to decide randomly among several possibilities. They were tossed onto the ground to see which marked side would come up on top. If your readers would not be familiar with **lots**, you could state that they were “something like dice,” as UST does. But if your readers would also not be familiar with dice, then you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “the Roman soldiers gambled” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	23	35	a2h5	figs-explicit	καὶ ἵστήκει, ὁ λαὸς θεωρῶν ἐξεμυκτήριζον, δὲ καὶ οἱ ἄρχοντες	1	And the people stood by watching, and the rulers were also ridiculing him	The implication is that the **people** who **stood by watching** were also **ridiculing** Jesus. Alternate translation: “People had come to watch the crucifixion and they ridiculed Jesus, and the Jewish leaders ridiculed him as well” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	23	35	m646	figs-explicit	οἱ ἄρχοντες	1	the rulers	**Rulers** refers specifically to the Jewish leaders, not to the Roman **rulers** of the area. Alternate translation: “the Jewish leaders” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	23	35	t7mb	figs-irony	ἄλλους ἔσωσεν	1	He saved others	Here the Jewish leaders are using irony. They do not really believe that Jesus **saved** other people. Alternate translation: “He supposedly saved other people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])
LUK	23	35	m647	figs-explicit	ἄλλους ἔσωσεν	1	He saved others	In context, the Jewish leaders are implicitly referring to how Jesus **saved** others by doing miracles on their behalf. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “He supposedly saved other people by doing miracles for them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	23	35	m648	figs-hypo	ἄλλους ἔσωσεν, σωσάτω ἑαυτόν, εἰ οὗτός ἐστιν ὁ Χριστὸς, τοῦ Θεοῦ, ὁ ἐκλεκτός	1	He saved others, let him save himself, if he is the Christ of God, the Chosen One	The Jewish leaders are mockingly suggesting a hypothetical situation. Alternate translation: “Suppose he really is the Messiah whom God has sent. Then he ought to be able to save himself; after all, he supposedly saved others” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
LUK	23	35	m3f6	figs-explicit	σωσάτω ἑαυτόν	1	let him save himself	The implication is that Jesus ought to be able to save himself from dying on the cross, if he is the Messiah and can do miracles. Alternate translation: “let him do a miracle to save himself from dying on the cross” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	23	35	a963	figs-nominaladj	ὁ ἐκλεκτός	1	the Chosen One	The leaders are using the adjective **Chosen** as a noun. ULT adds the term **One** to show this. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate the term with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “the One whom God has chosen” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
LUK	23	35	m649	translate-names	ὁ ἐκλεκτός	1	the Chosen One	This is a title, not a description, so translate it following the conventions in your language for titles, for example, by capitalizing the main words. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	23	36	b3jz	figs-explicit	ἐνέπαιξαν δὲ αὐτῷ καὶ οἱ στρατιῶται, προσερχόμενοι ὄξος προσφέροντες αὐτῷ	1	Then the soldiers also mocked him, coming up and offering him vinegar	Luke does not say specifically in what way the soliders **mocked** Jesus by offering him **vinegar**, that is, the sour wine that was their common drink. This could mean: (1) since Luke records in the next verse that the soldiers spoke of Jesus being the “king of the Jews,” the common drink may have been intended to show that they did not really believe he was a king, since a king would have drunk fine wine. Alternate translation: “Then the soldiers also mocked him by coming and offering him cheap sour wine, which was not what a real king would drink” (2) the soldiers may have **mocked** Jesus just by **offering** him something to drink, but then not giving it to him, even though he would have been very thirsty. Alternate translation: “Then the soldiers also mocked him by coming and offering him some of their sour wine but then not giving him any to drink” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	23	37	x5wr	figs-hypo	εἰ σὺ εἶ ὁ Βασιλεὺς τῶν Ἰουδαίων, σῶσον σεαυτόν	1	If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself	The soldiers are mockingly suggesting a hypothetical situation. Alternate translation: “Suppose you really are the King of the Jews. Then save yourself” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
LUK	23	37	m650	figs-explicit	σῶσον σεαυτόν	1	save yourself	The implication is that Jesus ought to be able to save himself from dying on the cross. Alternate translation: “do a miracle to save yourself from dying on that cross” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	23	38	l5be	figs-metonymy	ἦν δὲ καὶ ἐπιγραφὴ ἐπ’ αὐτῷ	1	there was also an inscription over him	Luke is referring figuratively to a placard that the soldiers placed above Jesus by association with the fact that it bore an **inscription**, that is, something that the soldiers had written on it. Alternate translation: “The soldiers also attached a placard at the top of Jesus’ cross on which they had written” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	23	38	w7aw	figs-irony	ἦν δὲ καὶ ἐπιγραφὴ ἐπ’ αὐτῷ	1	there was also an inscription over him	The soliders did not really believe that Jesus was **the King of the Jews**. Rather, putting up this placard was another of the ways in which they mocked him. So the sign said the opposite of what the people who wrote it actually believed. Alternate translation: “the soldiers also attached a placard at the top of Jesus’ cross on which they had written mockingly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])
LUK	23	39	m651	figs-activepassive	κρεμασθέντων	1	having been hung	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who did the action. Alternate translation: “whom the soldiers had hung on a cross next to Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	23	39	z9ej		ἐβλασφήμει αὐτόν	1	blasphemed him	As in [22:65](../22/65.md), the term **blasphemed** here likely has the general sense of “insulted,” although technically this criminal was guilty of blasphemy in the more specific sense, since he was suggesting that Jesus was not the Messiah. Alternate translation: “insulted him”
LUK	23	39	tmy7	figs-rquestion	οὐχὶ σὺ εἶ ὁ Χριστός?	1	Are you not the Christ?	The criminal is using the question form to mock Jesus. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “I thought you were supposed to be the Messiah!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	23	39	g6uk	figs-irony	σῶσον σεαυτὸν καὶ ἡμᾶς	1	Save yourself and us	The criminal did not really think that Jesus could rescue himself and the two criminals from dying by crucifixion. Instead, he is telling Jesus to do this in order to suggest that Jesus actually cannot do it. So he is saying the opposite of what he actually believes. Alternate translation: “But it looks like you can’t save yourself or us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])
LUK	23	39	m652	figs-exclusive	ἡμᾶς	1	us	Since this criminal is using the term **us** to mean himself and the other criminal, but not Jesus, the term **us** would be exclusive here, if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
LUK	23	40	lb4e	figs-hendiadys	ἀποκριθεὶς δὲ ὁ ἕτερος ἐπιτιμῶν αὐτῷ ἔφη	1	But answering, the other, rebuking him, said	Together the two words **answering** and **said** mean that the second criminal rebuked the first one in response to what he said to Jesus. You could combine these words into a single expression. Alternate translation: “But the other criminal responded, rebuking him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
LUK	23	40	m653	figs-nominaladj	ὁ ἕτερος	1	the other	Luke is using the adjective **other** as a noun in order to indicate a particular person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can supply the noun “criminal” for clarity. Alternate translation: “the other criminal” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
LUK	23	40	nk1r	figs-rquestion	οὐδὲ φοβῇ σὺ τὸν Θεόν, ὅτι ἐν τῷ αὐτῷ κρίματι εἶ?	1	Do you not even fear God, since you are under the same judgment?	The second criminal does not expect the first criminal to tell him whether he fears God. Rather, the second criminal is using the question form to rebuke the first criminal. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “You ought to fear God, since you are dying on a cross just as he is!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	23	40	m654	figs-explicit	οὐδὲ φοβῇ σὺ τὸν Θεόν, ὅτι ἐν τῷ αὐτῷ κρίματι εἶ?	1	Do you not even fear God, since you are under the same judgment?	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could bring out the implications of this statement more explicitly. Alternate translation: “You ought to fear God and show more respect for this godly man, since you are dying on a cross just as he is, and you will soon have to face God and answer for your actions!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	23	40	m655	figs-metonymy	ἐν τῷ αὐτῷ κρίματι εἶ	1	you are under the same judgment	The second criminal is using the word **judgment** figuratively to mean the punishment to which the first criminal was sentenced when the Romans pronounced **judgment** on him. Alternate translation: “you are being executed on a cross just as he is” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	23	41	qyp6	figs-exclusive	ἡμεῖς…ἐπράξαμεν…ἀπολαμβάνομεν	1	we … we are receiving … we did	The second criminal, speaking to the first criminal, is using the term **we** to mean himself and the first criminal. So **we** would be inclusive in all these cases, if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
LUK	23	41	m656	figs-verbs	ἡμεῖς…ἐπράξαμεν…ἀπολαμβάνομεν	1	we … we are receiving … we did	Since the term **we** refers to two people here, it would be in the dual form if your language uses that form. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-verbs]])
LUK	23	41	i4gm	figs-ellipsis	ἡμεῖς…δικαίως	1	we justly	The second criminal is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could supply these words from the context. Alternate translation: “we are receiving this punishment justly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
LUK	23	41	m657	figs-nominaladj	ἄξια…ὧν ἐπράξαμεν	1	worthy of what we did	The second criminal is using the adjective **worthy** as a noun. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this with an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “a just punishment for what we did” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
LUK	23	41	nu35	figs-nominaladj	οὗτος	1	this one	The second criminal is using the adjective **this** as a noun in order to indicate a particular person, Jesus. ULT supplies the noun **one** to show this. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this with an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “this man” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
LUK	23	42	mht9	writing-pronouns	καὶ ἔλεγεν	1	And he said	The pronoun **he** refers to the second criminal, who continues speaking, now to Jesus. Alternate translation: “The second criminal then said” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
LUK	23	42	j9d9	figs-idiom	μνήσθητί μου	1	remember me	As in [1:72](../01/72.md), the word **remember** here figuratively describes Jesus thinking about this second criminal and considering what action he can take on his behalf. It does not suggest that Jesus would forget about him. Alternate translation: “do what you can to help me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	23	42	m658	figs-imperative	μνήσθητί μου	1	remember me	This is an imperative, but it should be translated as a polite request rather than as a command. It may be helpful to add an expression such as “please” to make this clear. Alternate translation: “please do what you can to help me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
LUK	23	42	zyv3	figs-idiom	ὅταν ἔλθῃς ἐν τῇ βασιλείᾳ σου	1	when you come into your kingdom	To **come into** a **kingdom** means to begin to rule as king, as UST indicates. Alternate translation: “when you begin to rule as king” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	23	43	abcv	writing-pronouns	εἶπεν αὐτῷ	1	he said to him	The pronoun **he** refers to Jesus, and the pronoun **him** refers to the second criminal. Alternate translation: “Jesus said to this criminal” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
LUK	23	43	n6w9		ἀμήν, σοι λέγω	1	Truly I say to you	Jesus says this to emphasize what he is about to tell the criminal. Alternate translation: “I can assure you”
LUK	23	43	m659		σήμερον μετ’ ἐμοῦ ἔσῃ ἐν τῷ Παραδείσῳ	1	today you will be with me in paradise	See the discussion in the General Notes to this chapter of how the term **today** belongs with this promise that Jesus is making to the criminal, and not with the introduction to the statement. Alternate translation: “you will be with me in paradise today”
LUK	23	43	f1fl		τῷ Παραδείσῳ	1	in paradise	See the discussion in the General Notes to this chapter of the term **paradise**. Alternate translation: “in the place where people whom God has accepted go when they die”
LUK	23	44	m660	writing-background	καὶ ἦν ἤδη	1	And it was already	Luke uses this phrase to introduce background information that will help readers understand what happens next. He explains that it was about noon so that readers will appreciate how extraordinary it was that the entire sky became dark. Alternate translation: “Now by this time it was” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
LUK	23	44	x7fl		ὡσεὶ ὥρα ἕκτη	1	about the sixth hour	In this culture, people began counting the hours each day beginning around daybreak at six o’clock in the morning. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this in the way the people of your culture reckon time. Alternate translation: “about noon”
LUK	23	44	m661	translate-ordinal	ὡσεὶ ὥρα ἕκτη	1	about the sixth hour	If you decide to translate this in the way that the biblical culture reckoned time, but your language does not use ordinal numbers, you can use a cardinal number here. Alternate translation: “around hour six” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
LUK	23	44	q4t3		σκότος ἐγένετο ἐφ’ ὅλην τὴν γῆν	1	darkness was over the whole land	The term translated as **land** could refer to: (1) a particular area. Alternate translation, as in UST: “it became dark throughout that whole area” (2) the earth. Alternate translation: “darkness covered the entire earth”
LUK	23	44	m662	figs-metonymy	σκότος ἐγένετο ἐφ’ ὅλην τὴν γῆν	1	darkness was over the whole land	This could also be a figurative reference to the sky, since it is **over** the **land**. Alternate translation: “the entire sky became dark” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	23	44	e8zn		ἕως ὥρας ἐνάτης	1	until the ninth hour	This phrase also expresses the way people in this culture began counting the hours each day beginning around daybreak at six o’clock in the morning. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this in the way the people of your culture reckon time. Alternate translation: “until three o’clock in the afternoon”
LUK	23	44	m663	translate-ordinal	ἕως ὥρας ἐνάτης	1	until the ninth hour	If you decide to translate this in the way that the biblical culture reckoned time, but your language does not use ordinal numbers, you can use a cardinal number here. Alternate translation: “until hour nine” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
LUK	23	45	hjt3	figs-personification	τοῦ ἡλίου ἐκλειπόντος	1	The sun failed	This means figuratively that **the sun**, as if it were an active agent, **failed** to give its light. Luke is speaking from an observational perspective. The sun was still shining above the darkness, but its light could not be seen through the darkness. Alternate translation: “It was too dark even to see the light of the sun” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
LUK	23	45	m664	translate-symaction	ἐσχίσθη δὲ τὸ καταπέτασμα τοῦ ναοῦ μέσον	1	the curtain of the temple was torn in the middle	See the General Notes to this chapter for an explanation of the symbolic significance of this action. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
LUK	23	45	ssh2	figs-explicit	τὸ καταπέτασμα τοῦ ναοῦ	1	the curtain of the temple	Luke assumes that his readers will know that he is referring to the curtain that separated the Most Holy Place from the rest of the temple. Alternate translation: “the curtain in front of the Most Holy Place” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	23	45	ah4k	figs-activepassive	ἐσχίσθη	1	was torn	If your readers would misunderstand this, you can express this with an active form, and you can state who did the action. Alternate translation: “God tore” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	23	45	m665	figs-explicit	μέσον	1	in the middle	The implication, as the General Notes to this chapter explain, is that God tearing **the curtain** opened the way into the Most Holy Place. And so **in the middle** means not “across the middle,” from side to side, but “down through the middle,” from top to bottom. Alternate translation: “into two pieces, from top to bottom” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	23	46	z1fq	figs-idiom	φωνήσας φωνῇ μεγάλῃ	1	crying out with a loud voice	This is an idiom that means Jesus raised the volume of his **voice**. Alternate translation: “crying out loudly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	23	46	r4ub	guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	Πάτερ	1	Father	**Father** is an important title for God. Alternate translation: “God my Father” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
LUK	23	46	mix5	figs-metonymy	εἰς χεῖράς σου παρατίθεμαι τὸ Πνεῦμά μου	1	into your hands I entrust my spirit	Jesus is using God’s **hands** figuratively to represent God’s care. Alternate translation: “I give my spirit to you, knowing you will care for it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	23	46	m666		τὸ Πνεῦμά μου	1	my spirit	The **spirit** of a person lives on after they die. So you could also translate this as a reference to Jesus’ life after death. Alternate translation: “my life”
LUK	23	46	bd6y	figs-euphemism	ἐξέπνευσεν	1	he breathed out	Luke is describing the death of Jesus in a discreet way. Alternate translation: “he died” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
LUK	23	47	p6lh	figs-explicit	ὁ ἑκατοντάρχης	1	the centurion	The implication is that this was the Roman officer who was in charge of the other Roman soldiers who crucified Jesus. Alternate translation: “the Roman officer in charge of the crucifixion” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	23	47	m667	figs-explicit	τὸ γενόμενον	1	the thing having happened	This expression is singular and so it refers to the immediately preceding event, the death of Jesus. (The expression is plural in the next verse, where it refers to all of the events of the crucifixiion.) If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “how Jesus had entrusted his spirit to God when he died” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	23	47	m668		ἐδόξαζεν τὸν Θεὸν λέγων	1	glorified God, saying	This means that the centurion **glorified God** by what he said. Alternate translation: “brought honor to God by saying”
LUK	23	47	c2ti		ὁ ἄνθρωπος οὗτος δίκαιος ἦν	1	this man was righteous	Alternate translation: “this man had not done anything wrong”
LUK	23	48	gt8y	figs-explicit	συνπαραγενόμενοι…ἐπὶ τὴν θεωρίαν ταύτην	1	that had come together for this spectacle	The term **spectacle** describes something that people would look at. It refers here to the crucifixion of Jesus and the two criminals. Alternate translation: “who had gathered to watch the crucifixions” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	23	48	whs7	figs-explicit	ὑπέστρεφον	1	returned	The implication is that the people in the crowds **returned** to their homes. Alternate translation: “returned to their homes” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	23	48	ft9q	translate-symaction	τύπτοντες τὰ στήθη	1	beating their breasts	As in [18:13](../18/13.md), this was a physical expression of great sorrow. Alternate translation: “hitting their chests to express their great sorrow” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
LUK	23	49	m669	figs-nominaladj	πάντες οἱ γνωστοὶ αὐτῷ	1	all the ones acquainted with him	Luke is using the adjective **acquainted** as a noun in order to indicate a group of people. ULT adds the term **ones** to show this. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this with an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “all the people who knew Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
LUK	23	49	m670	figs-explicit	πάντες οἱ γνωστοὶ αὐτῷ	1	all the ones acquainted with him	These means implicitly all the people in the crowd that had come to watch the crucifixion who knew Jesus. It does not mean the disciples, since they had fled and were hiding. Rather, it means other people in Jerusalem who knew Jesus personally, which could include people such as the ones who lent him the colt in [19:30-33](../19/30.md) and the one who provided the room for the Passover meal in [22:11-13](../22/11.md). If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “all the people in the crowd who knew Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	23	49	xzh8	figs-explicit	γυναῖκες αἱ συνακολουθοῦσαι αὐτῷ ἀπὸ τῆς Γαλιλαίας	1	the women who followed him from Galilee	Here, **followed** does not have the figurative meaning of “became a disciple.” Rather, the implication is that the women whom Luke describes in [8:2-3](../08/02.md), who accompanied Jesus and his disciples and provided for them out of their own means, had traveled with the group here to Jerusalem. Alternate translation: “the women who helped Jesus and his disciples, who had traveled with him from Galilee” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	23	49	s74u		ταῦτα	1	these things	Alternate translation: “what happened”
LUK	23	50	cbj7	figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	behold	Luke uses the term **behold** to call the reader’s attention to what he is about to say. Your language may have a similar expression that you can use here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	23	50	ud7p	writing-participants	ἀνὴρ ὀνόματι Ἰωσὴφ, βουλευτὴς ὑπάρχων, ἀνὴρ ἀγαθὸς καὶ δίκαιος	1	a man named Joseph was a council member, a good and righteous man	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new character into the story. If your language has its own way of doing that, you can use it here in your translation. It may be helpful to make this more than one sentence. Alternate translation: “there was a man named Joseph who was a member of the Sanhedrin. He was a good and righteous man” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
LUK	23	50	m671	translate-names	Ἰωσὴφ	1	Joseph	**Joseph** is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	23	50	wx2z	figs-explicit	βουλευτὴς	1	a council member	The term **council** refers implicitly to the Sanhedrin, the Jewish ruling council whose name Luke provides in [22:66](../22/66.md). You could use that name here. If so, see how you translated it there. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	23	50	m672	figs-doublet	ἀνὴρ ἀγαθὸς καὶ δίκαιος	1	a good and righteous man	The terms **good** and **righteous** mean similar things. Luke may be using repetition for emphasis. Alternate translation: “a very upright man” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
LUK	23	51	m673	writing-background	(οὗτος οὐκ ἦν συνκατατεθειμένος τῇ βουλῇ καὶ τῇ πράξει αὐτῶν)	1	(he had not agreed with the council and their action)	Luke provides this background information about Joseph to help readers understand what happens in the next verse, when Joseph asks Pilate for permission to bury Jesus’ body. It may be helpful to make this a continuation of the last sentence in the previous verse, since it also shows that Joseph was a “good and righteous man,” as that sentence says. Alternate translation: “who had not agreed with the action of the council” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
LUK	23	51	m674	figs-hendiadys	τῇ βουλῇ καὶ τῇ πράξει αὐτῶν	1	the council and their action	Luke is using a figure of speech in which two nouns are connected with the word **and**, and one of the nouns describes the other. Alternate translation: “the action of the council” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
LUK	23	51	ddr1	figs-explicit	τῇ βουλῇ καὶ τῇ πράξει αὐτῶν	1	the council and their action	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state explicitly what this means. Alternate translation: “the decision of the Sanhedrin to condemn Jesus for blasphemy” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	23	51	rba6	figs-explicit	ἀπὸ Ἁριμαθαίας, πόλεως τῶν Ἰουδαίων	1	from Arimathea, a city of the Jews	Since Joseph was a member of the Sanhedrin, he had likely come to live in Jerusalem, so Luke would mean that he was originally **from Arimathea**. Joseph had not come from Arimathea to Jerusalem for this occasion. Alternate translation: “who was originally from Arimathea, a city in Judea” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	23	51	m675	translate-names	Ἁριμαθαίας	1	Arimathea	**Arimathea** is the name of a city. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	23	51	m676	figs-idiom	ὃς προσεδέχετο τὴν Βασιλείαν τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	who was waiting for the kingdom of God	As in [2:25](../02/25.md) and [2:38](../02/38.md), the term **waiting** does not mean passively **waiting** for something to happen, but eagerly anticipating something that someone wants to happen. See how you translated the term in those places. Alternate translation: “who was eagerly anticipating the coming of the kingdom of God” or “who was looking forward to the coming of the kingdom of God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	23	52	tk6r	figs-explicit	οὗτος	1	This one	**This one** implicitly means Joseph. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that it was Joseph who went to Pilate by using his name, as UST does, or by saying “this man.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	23	52	m677	figs-explicit	οὗτος, προσελθὼν τῷ Πειλάτῳ, ᾐτήσατο τὸ σῶμα τοῦ Ἰησοῦ	1	This one, approaching Pilate, requested the body of Jesus	The implication is that Joseph requested the body of Jesus so that he could give it a proper burial. Ordinarily, to make crucifixion as gruesome a death as possible, the Romans left the dead bodies of people who had been crucified on the crosses to be eaten by wild animals, and they then burned whatever remained in the Valley of Hinnom where, as a note to [12:5](../12/05.md) explains, refuse was thrown and fires burned continually. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain why Joseph asked for Jesus’ body. You could also specify that Pilate gave Joseph permission to bury Jesus, as UST does. Alternate translation: “This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus so that he could bury it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	23	53	ec9d	grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ	1	And	Luke uses the word **And** to introduce the results of what the previous sentence described. When Pilate gave Joseph permission to take Jesus’ body down from the cross and bury it, Joseph did so. Alternate translation: “So” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
LUK	23	53	f5bq	translate-unknown	ἐνετύλιξεν αὐτὸ σινδόνι	1	he wrapped it in a linen cloth	This was the burial custom in this culture. If your readers would not be familiar with such a custom, you could describe it more specifically, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “and he wrapped it in a fine linen burial cloth” or “and he prepared it for burial” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	23	53	yy3n	translate-unknown	μνήματι λαξευτῷ	1	a hewn tomb	This means specifically a burial place that had been cut or chiseled out of rock, most likely into the face of a cliff, as UST suggests. You could express that more specifically, or you could use a general expression if there are no rock cliffs in your area and readers might not understand the meaning. Alternate translation: “a tomb that had been chiseled out of rock” or “a special burial place” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	23	53	m5wu	figs-doublenegatives	οὗ οὐκ ἦν οὐδεὶς οὔπω κείμενος	1	where no one ever had lain	Here Luke uses a triple negative in Greek for emphasis, “where no one not yet had not lain.” This stresses the honor that Joseph was showing Jesus by putting his body in a tomb that was being used for the very first time. If your language uses multiple negatives for emphasis, it would be appropriate to use that construction here. You might express the emphasis in other ways, and it may also be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “No body had ever before been put in that tomb” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
LUK	23	54	m678	grammar-connect-time-background	καὶ	1	And	Luke uses **and** to introduce background information that will help readers understand what happens next. Alternate translation: “Now” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background]])
LUK	23	54	tia9	figs-explicit	ἡμέρα ἦν παρασκευῆς	1	it was the Day of Preparation	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state explicitly what this **day** was used in **preparation** for. Alternate translation: “the day when people made preparations for the Sabbath, the Jewish day of rest, since they could not do any work then” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	23	54	b4i1	figs-metaphor	Σάββατον ἐπέφωσκεν	1	the Sabbath was dawning	For the Jews, the day began at sunset. But Luke speaks figuratively of this day **dawning** to mean that it was about to begin, even though this would happen at sunset rather than at sunrise. Alternate translation: “it was nearly sunset, when the Sabbath would begin” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	23	55	pu3i	figs-idiom	αἵτινες ἦσαν συνεληλυθυῖαι ἐκ τῆς Γαλιλαίας αὐτῷ	1	who had come out of Galilee with him	The expression **had come out** is an idiom that means to have traveled from a place. Alternate translation: “who had traveled from the region of Galilee with Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	23	55	m679	figs-ellipsis	κατακολουθήσασαι	1	having followed after	Luke is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could supply these words from the context. Alternate translation: “followed Joseph when he took the body of Jesus away” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
LUK	23	55	m680	figs-hendiadys	τὸ μνημεῖον καὶ ὡς ἐτέθη τὸ σῶμα αὐτοῦ	1	the tomb and how his body was laid	Luke is using a figure of speech in which two phrases are connected with the word **and**, and one of the phrases describes the other. Alternate translation: “the tomb where Joseph laid the body of Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
LUK	23	55	nhd9	figs-activepassive	ὡς ἐτέθη τὸ σῶμα αὐτοῦ	1	how his body was laid	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who did the action. Alternate translation: “how Joseph laid the body of Jesus there” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	23	56	sm68	figs-explicit	ὑποστρέψασαι	1	returning	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state where the women returned. Alternate translation: “returning to the place where they were staying in Jerusalem” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	23	56	mj6q	figs-explicit	ἡτοίμασαν ἀρώματα καὶ μύρα	1	they prepared spices and ointments	In keeping with the burial customs of the time, the women prepared these **spices and ointments** to put on Jesus’ body, to honor him and to counteract the smell of decay. Alternate translation: “they prepared spices and ointments to put on Jesus’ body” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	23	56	m681	translate-unknown	ἀρώματα καὶ μύρα	1	spices and ointments	The **spices** were sweet-smelling substances that were dry, and the **ointments** were sweet-smelling substances that were moist. If your readers would not be familiar with **spices and ointments**, you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “sweet-smelling substances” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	23	56	uzk9		ἡσύχασαν	1	they rested	Alternate translation: “the women did not do any work”
LUK	23	56	tk6s		κατὰ τὴν ἐντολήν	1	according to the commandment	Alternate translation: “as Moses had commanded in the law”
LUK	24	intro	r5qx			0		# Luke 24 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>1. The women go to Jesus’ tomb and find it empty (24:1-12)<br>2. Two disciples meet Jesus on a journey to Emmaus (24:13-35)<br>3. Jesus, risen from the dead, appears to his disciples (24:36-53)<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### The loyalty of the women<br><br>Many of Luke’s original readers would have thought that women were less important than men. But Luke carefully demonstrates that some women who loved Jesus very much showed him greater loyalty than the twelve disciples did. While the disciples ran away and hid, the women lovingly cared for Jesus’ body, and as a result, they were the first to learn that he had risen from the dead.<br><br>### Resurrection<br><br>Luke wants his readers to understand that Jesus came alive again in a physical body ([Luke 24:38-43](../24/38.md)).<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### “the third day”<br><br>This expression occurs three times in this chapter, in [24:7](../24/07.md), [24:21](../24/21.md), and [24:46](../24/46.md). See the explanation of this expression in the note to Luke [18:33](../18/33.md). In the idiom of this culture, today was the “first day,” tomorrow was the “second day,” and the day after tomorrow was the “third day.” By that way of reckoning time, since Jesus died on a Friday, when he rose from the dead on a Sunday, that was the “third day.”<br><br>### Two men in bright shining robes<br><br>Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John all write about angels in white clothing speaking with the women at Jesus’ tomb. Matthew and John call them angels, while Mark and Luke call them men, but that is only because the angels appeared in human form. Luke and John write about both angels, while Matthew and Mark write about only one of them. It would be best to translate each of these passages as it appears in ULT without trying to make the passages all say exactly the same thing. (See: [Matthew 28:1-2](../mat/28/01.md) and [Mark 16:5](../mrk/16/05.md) and [Luke 24:4](../luk/24/04.md) and [John 20:12](../jhn/20/12.md))
LUK	24	1	m682	figs-explicit	τῇ…μιᾷ τῶν σαββάτων	1	on the first of the week	This implicitly means the **first** day of the week. Alternate translation: “on the first day of the week” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	24	1	r62f	translate-ordinal	τῇ…μιᾷ τῶν σαββάτων	1	on the first of the week	Here Luke is actually using a cardinal number, “one,” to mean **first**. If your language does not use ordinal numbers, you can also use a cardinal number here in your translation. Alternate translation: “on day one of the week” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
LUK	24	1	m683	figs-idiom	ὄρθρου βαθέως	1	deeply at dawn	This is an idiom. Alternate translation: “at the first light of dawn” or “as dawn was just beginning to break” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	24	1	qg7a	writing-pronouns	ἐπὶ τὸ μνῆμα ἦλθαν	1	they came to the tomb	The pronoun **they** refers to the women whom Luke describes in [23:55-56](../23/55.md). Alternate translation: “these women returned to the tomb” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
LUK	24	2	jq9p		εὗρον…τὸν λίθον ἀποκεκυλισμένον	1	they found the stone rolled away	Alternate translation: “they saw that the stone had been rolled away”
LUK	24	2	l6uk	figs-activepassive	τὸν λίθον ἀποκεκυλισμένον	1	the stone rolled away	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “that someone had rolled away the stone” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	24	2	t4mf	figs-explicit	τὸν λίθον	1	the stone	Luke assumes that his readers will know that this was a large, cut, round stone that was big enough to completely block the entrance to the tomb. It had been put in place to seal off the entrance, and it would have required several people to move it. Alternate translation: “the large stone that had been put in place at the entrance to the tomb” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	24	3	m684		εἰσελθοῦσαι	1	having entered	Alternate translation: “once they entered the tomb”
LUK	24	3	elq2	figs-explicit	οὐχ εὗρον τὸ σῶμα τοῦ Κυρίου Ἰησοῦ	1	they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus	You can state explicitly that they did not find the body because it was not there. Alternate translation: “they discovered that the body of the Lord Jesus was not there” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	24	4	bmt4	writing-newevent	καὶ ἐγένετο	1	And it happened that	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a significant development in this episode. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for this purpose. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
LUK	24	4	m685	grammar-connect-time-sequential	καὶ	2	and	Luke uses this word to indicate that this event, the appearance of the two men, came after the events he has just described, the women discovering that the tomb was empty and wondering about that. Alternate translation: “then” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
LUK	24	4	m686	figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	behold	Luke uses the term **behold** to calls the reader’s attention to what he is about to say. Your language may have a similar expression that you can use here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	24	5	c11i	writing-pronouns	ἐμφόβων…γενομένων αὐτῶν…εἶπαν πρὸς αὐτάς	1	as they became terrified … they said to them	The first instance of **they** refers to the women, while the second instance refers to the men. Alternate translation: “as the women became terrified … the men said to them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
LUK	24	5	n5xf	translate-symaction	κλινουσῶν τὰ πρόσωπα εἰς τὴν γῆν	1	bowed their faces toward the ground	Looking down at **the ground** was a gesture of respect towards these men. Alternate translation: “respectfully lowered their gaze” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
LUK	24	5	abcw	figs-verbs	εἶπαν πρὸς αὐτάς	1	they said to them	If your language uses dual forms for verbs, use that form here, since two men are speaking. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-verbs]])
LUK	24	5	fs3y	figs-rquestion	τί ζητεῖτε τὸν ζῶντα μετὰ τῶν νεκρῶν?	1	Why are you seeking the living among the dead?	The men do not expect the women to tell them why they are looking for a living person in a tomb. Rather, the men are using the question form to make an announcement. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate their words as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “You should not be looking for Jesus here, because he is no longer dead, he is alive again!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	24	5	m687	figs-nominaladj	τὸν ζῶντα μετὰ τῶν νεκρῶν	1	the living among the dead	The men are using the adjectives **living** and **dead** as nouns to refer to groups of people. (The term **living** is actually a participle that functions here as an adjective.) Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate these with equivalent phrases. Alternate translation: “someone who is alive among the bodies of people who have died” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
LUK	24	6	m688	figs-idiom	ἠγέρθη	1	has been raised	The term **raised** is an idiom that means “brought back to life.” Alternate translation: “has been brought back to life” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	24	6	awf1	figs-activepassive	ἠγέρθη	1	has been raised	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who has done the action. Alternate translation: “God has made him alive again” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	24	6	s8k5		μνήσθητε ὡς ἐλάλησεν ὑμῖν	1	Remember how he spoke to you	Alternate translation: “Remember that he said to you”
LUK	24	6	m689	figs-you	ὑμῖν	1	you	The word **you** is plural. It refers to the women, and possibly also to Jesus’ disciples. If your language has a form of **you** that includes both the addressees and a larger group besides, it would be appropriate to use it here. Alternate translation: “all of you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
LUK	24	6	m690		ὑμῖν, ἔτι ὢν ἐν τῇ Γαλιλαίᾳ	1	to you, still being in Galilee	Alternate translation: “to you when he was still in Galilee”
LUK	24	7	sj3u	figs-quotations	λέγων…ὅτι	1	saying that	These words introduce an indirect quotation. You could also translate what follows as a direct quotation, as UST does. However, that would be a quotation within a quotation, and you may wish to avoid that by leaving what follows as an indirect quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
LUK	24	7	pl6b	figs-activepassive	τὸν Υἱὸν τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου…παραδοθῆναι	1	for the Son of Man to be delivered	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “for someone to betray the Son of Man” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	24	7	m691	figs-123person	τὸν Υἱὸν τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου	1	the Son of Man	When Jesus said this, he was referring to himself in the third person. If you decide to represent this as a direct quotation, and if your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this in the first person. Alternate translation: “me, the Son of Man” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
LUK	24	7	m692	figs-explicit	τὸν Υἱὸν τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου	1	the Son of Man	See how you translated this title in [5:24](../05/24.md). Alternate translation: “him, the Messiah” or, if you are translating as a direct quotation in the first person, “me, the Messiah” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	24	7	e4ca	figs-metaphor	εἰς χεῖρας ἀνθρώπων ἁμαρτωλῶν	1	into the hands of sinful men	As in [9:44](../09/44.md), **hands** here figuratively represent power and control. Alternate translation: “and give sinful men power over him” or, if you are translating as a direct quotation in the first person, “and give sinful men power over me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	24	7	m693	figs-activepassive	καὶ σταυρωθῆναι	1	and to be crucified	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who would do the action. Alternate translation: “and for those sinful men to crucify him” or, if you are translating as a direct quotation in the first person, “and for those sinful men to crucify me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	24	7	m694	figs-explicit	καὶ τῇ τρίτῃ ἡμέρᾳ ἀναστῆναι	1	and on the third day to rise up	See how you translated this in [9:22](../09/22.md). Alternate translation: “and after spending the next full day in the grave, to come back to life on the day after that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	24	7	dta4	translate-ordinal	τῇ τρίτῃ ἡμέρᾳ	1	on the third day	If your language does not use ordinal numbers, you can use a cardinal number here. Alternate translation: “on day three” or, depending on how your culture reckons time, “on day two” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
LUK	24	7	m695	figs-metonymy	ἀναστῆναι	1	to rise up	Jesus spoke figuratively of coming back to life in this way, since it involved coming **up** out of the grave. Alternate translation: “to come back to life” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	24	8	rew5	figs-metonymy	ἐμνήσθησαν τῶν ῥημάτων αὐτοῦ	1	they remembered his words	Luke is using the term **words** figuratively to describe the statement that Jesus made using words. Alternate translation: “the women remembered what Jesus had said” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	24	9	iz68	figs-nominaladj	τοῖς ἕνδεκα	1	the Eleven	This expression is equivalent to “the Twelve,” which occurs in [8:1](../08/01.md) and several other places in the book. See how you translated it there. Luke now says **the Eleven** because Judas Iscariot was no longer part of the group. You may have decided to translate the nominal adjective “Twelve” with an equivalent phrase. If so, you could do the same thing here. Alternate translation: “the 11 men who remained of those whom Jesus had appointed to be apostles” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
LUK	24	9	m696	translate-names	τοῖς ἕνδεκα	1	the Eleven	Alternatively, you may have decided in [8:1](../08/01.md) to translate “the Twelve” as a title, even if your language does not ordinarily use adjectives as nouns. If so, you can do the same thing with **the Eleven** here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	24	9	fnh6	figs-explicit	καὶ πᾶσιν τοῖς λοιποῖς	1	and to all the rest	Implicitly this means all the other disciples of Jesus who were together with the 11 apostles at that time.

LUK	24	10	m697	translate-names	Μαγδαληνὴ Μαρία	1	Mary Magdalene	**Mary** is the name of a woman, and **Magdalene** is a distinguishing term that most likely means that she came from the town of Magdala. See how you translated this in [8:2](../08/02.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	24	10	m698	translate-names	Ἰωάννα	1	Joanna	**Joanna** is the name of a woman. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

LUK	24	11	m700	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	καὶ	1	And	Luke uses this word to introduce a contrast between the exciting good news that the women were sharing and the disbelieving reaction of the people they shared it with. Alternate translation: “But” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
LUK	24	11	apl7	figs-metonymy	τὰ ῥήματα ταῦτα	1	these words	Luke is using the term **words** figuratively to describe the report that the women gave using words. Alternate translation: “what the women were saying” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	24	11	m701	figs-metaphor	ἐνώπιον αὐτῶν	1	before them	Luke uses this expression, which means “in front them,” to mean “where they could see.” Seeing, in turn, figuratively means attention and judgment. Alternate translation: “in their opinion” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	24	11	m702	grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ	2	and	This phrase describes the result of the fact that the report seemed like nonsense to the apostles and other believers. Alternate translation: “so” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
LUK	24	11	m703	writing-pronouns	ἠπίστουν αὐταῖς	1	they disbelieved them	The word **they** refers to the apostles and other believers, and the word **them** refers to the women. Alternate translation: “so the apostles and other believers did not believe the women” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
LUK	24	12	rm1d	figs-idiom	ἀναστὰς	1	rising up	This expression is an idiom that means to take initiative. It does not necessarily mean that Peter had been sitting or lying down and then stood up. Alternate translation: “taking initiative” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	24	12	ax6s	figs-explicit	παρακύψας	1	stooping down	Peter had to bend over in order to see inside the tomb because tombs cut in solid rock were very low. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “bending at the waist in order to look into the low tomb” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	24	12	m704		βλέπει	1	he sees	To call attention to a development in the story, Luke uses the present tense in past narration. See how you decided to approach this usage in [7:40](../07/40.md). If it would not be natural to use the present tense in your language, you can use the past tense in your translation. Alternate translation: “he saw”
LUK	24	12	n1tg	figs-explicit	τὰ ὀθόνια μόνα	1	only the linen cloths	The phrase **the linen cloths** refers to the cloths that Joseph of Arimathea used to wrap Jesus’ body when he was buried, as described in [23:53](../23/53.md). The implication is that the body of Jesus was no longer in the tomb. Alternate translation: “the linen cloths in which Jesus’ body had been wrapped, but the body was not there” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	24	12	m705		ἀπῆλθεν πρὸς ἑαυτὸν, θαυμάζων τὸ γεγονός	1	he went away, wondering to himself what had happened	This phrase can be understood in two different ways, depending on how the words in it are grouped together. Different versions of the Bible interpret this differently. If there is already a version of the Bible in your area, see how it translates this. You may wish to translate it in the same way. Otherwise, we recommend that you follow the reading of ULT. (1) If the grouping is “he went away, to himself wondering,” then the meaning is as in ULT and UST. (2) If the grouping is “he went away to himself, wondering,” then the meaning is that Peter went back to his own home. Alternate translation: “he went away to his home, wondering what had happened”
LUK	24	13	emc5	writing-newevent	ἰδοὺ	1	behold	Luke uses the word **behold** to introduce a new event in the story. If your language has a similar expression that it uses for this same purpose, you can use it here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
LUK	24	13	m706	writing-background	δύο ἐξ αὐτῶν ἐν αὐτῇ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ, ἦσαν πορευόμενοι εἰς κώμην ἀπέχουσαν	1	on that same day, two of them were going to a distant village	Luke provides this background information to help readers understand what happens next. Alternate translation: “there were two disciples who were going to a distant village on that same day” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
LUK	24	13	e8gx	writing-pronouns	δύο ἐξ αὐτῶν	1	two of them	The word **them** refers to Jesus’ disciples, but not specifically to the apostles, since at the end of this episode, these two men return to Jerusalem and report to the apostles. Alternate translation: “two of Jesus’ disciples” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
LUK	24	13	s5n1	figs-explicit	ἐν αὐτῇ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ	1	on that same day	Alternate translation: “on the same day when the women found that the tomb was empty” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	24	13	m707		σταδίους ἑξήκοντα ἀπὸ Ἰερουσαλήμ, ᾗ ὄνομα Ἐμμαοῦς	1	that was named Emmaus, 60 stadia from Jerusalem	It may be helpful to make this a separate sentence. Alternate translation: “The name of the village was Emmaus, and it was 60 stadia from Jerusalem”
LUK	24	13	d8jk	translate-names	Ἐμμαοῦς	1	Emmaus	**Emmaus** is the name of a village. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	24	13	cea7	translate-bdistance	σταδίους ἑξήκοντα	1	60 stadia	The word **stadia** is the plural of “stadium,” a Roman measurement of distance equivalent to about 185 meters or a little over 600 feet.

LUK	24	14	m708	figs-explicit	πάντων τῶν συμβεβηκότων τούτων	1	all these things that had happened	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state explicitly what **these things** means. Alternate translation: “how Jesus had been arrested and crucified, and how the women had said his body was no longer in the tomb” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	24	15	m709	writing-newevent	καὶ ἐγένετο	1	And it happened	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a significant development in this episode. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for this purpose. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
LUK	24	15	b3sl	writing-pronouns	αὐτὸς Ἰησοῦς	1	Jesus himself	The word **himself** emphasizes the fact that it was truly Jesus who joined them as they walked. This was not a vision in which Jesus only appeared to be there. Alternate translation: “Jesus, risen from the dead” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])

Alternate translation: “But God prevented them from recognizing him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
LUK	24	16	m711	figs-metaphor	οἱ δὲ ὀφθαλμοὶ αὐτῶν ἐκρατοῦντο τοῦ μὴ ἐπιγνῶναι αὐτόν	1	But their eyes were being held so as not to recognize him	Luke uses the term **held** figuratively, as if someone were physically holding back the eyes, to mean “restrained.” Alternate translation: “But God prevented them from recognizing him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	24	16	m712	figs-activepassive	οἱ δὲ ὀφθαλμοὶ αὐτῶν ἐκρατοῦντο τοῦ μὴ ἐπιγνῶναι αὐτόν	1	But their eyes were being held so as not to recognize him	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who was doing the action. Alternate translation: “But God prevented them from recognizing him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	24	17	xak8	figs-youdual	αὐτούς…ἀντιβάλλετε…περιπατοῦντες…ἐστάθησαν	1	them … you are exchanging … you are walking … they stood still	Since Jesus is speaking to two men, all of these expressions would be in the dual form, if your language uses that form. (Your language might even put the adjective **gloomy**, which is plural in Greek, in the dual, since it describes the two men.) (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
LUK	24	17	m713	figs-metonymy	οἱ λόγοι οὗτοι οὓς ἀντιβάλλετε πρὸς ἀλλήλους	1	these words that you are exchanging with each other	Jesus is using the term **words** figuratively to describe what the men had been saying using words.

LUK	24	17	m714		ἐστάθησαν, σκυθρωποί	1	they stood still, gloomy	Alternate translation: “they stopped walking and looked sad”
LUK	24	18	m715	figs-hendiadys	ἀποκριθεὶς δὲ εἷς ὀνόματι Κλεοπᾶς εἶπεν	1	Then, answering, one named Cleopas said	Together the two words **answering** and **said** mean that Cleopas responded to what Jesus asked him.

LUK	24	18	bqc9	translate-names	Κλεοπᾶς	1	Cleopas	**Cleopas** is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	24	18	qx7m	figs-rquestion	σὺ μόνος παροικεῖς Ἰερουσαλὴμ καὶ οὐκ ἔγνως τὰ γενόμενα ἐν αὐτῇ ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ταύταις?	1	Are you alone visiting Jerusalem and have not known the things that have happened in her in these days?	Cleopas does not expect Jesus to tell him whether he is the only visitor to Jerusalem who does not know what has recently happened in the city. Rather, Cleopas is using the question form to show his surprise, since he expects that everyone would know about these events. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate his words as a statement or exclamation. Alternate translation: “You must be the only person visiting Jerusalem who does not know what has just happened in the city!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	24	18	m717	writing-pronouns	ἐν αὐτῇ	1	in her	Conventionally, Greek referred to cities with feminine pronouns. Your language may use a different gender. You could also use a noun. Alternate translation: “in it” or “in that city” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
LUK	24	18	m718	figs-idiom	ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ταύταις	1	in these days	Cleopas is using the term **days** figuratively to refer to a specific time. Alternate translation: “at this time” or “recently” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	24	19	aj5c	figs-explicit	ποῖα	1	What kind	This implicitly means, “**What kind** of things?” But by asking about the quality of the events, rather than just the fact of the events (“What things?”), Jesus is acknowledging that they must have been very special. Alternate translation: “What kind of things?” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	24	19	m719	figs-verbs	οἱ…εἶπαν	1	they said	Since two men are speaking, this would be in the dual form, if your language uses that form. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-verbs]])
LUK	24	19	m720	translate-names	Ἰησοῦ τοῦ Ναζαρηνοῦ	1	Jesus the Nazarene	The term **Nazarene** is a name that refers to a person who is from the city of Nazareth.

LUK	24	19	m721	figs-idiom	ἀνὴρ, προφήτης	1	a man, a prophet	This is an idiomatic way of speaking about a person in an honorable way. Alternate translation: “a distinguished prophet” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	24	19	m722	figs-metonymy	δυνατὸς ἐν ἔργῳ καὶ λόγῳ	1	powerful in work and word	The two men are using the term **work** figuratively to describe the things that Jesus did, and the term **word** figuratively to describe the things that Jesus said. Alternate translation: “who did great miracles and taught profound things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	24	19	x25r	figs-metaphor	ἐναντίον τοῦ Θεοῦ καὶ παντὸς τοῦ λαοῦ	1	in front of God and all the people	This expression means “while God and all the people were watching.” In the case of **God**, it means figuratively that God gave Jesus the power to do miracles and to teach profound things. In the case of **the people**, it means that the miracles and teachings of Jesus amazed the people when they saw and heard them. Alternate translation: “as God empowered him, to the amazement of all the people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	24	19	m723	figs-hyperbole	παντὸς τοῦ λαοῦ	1	all the people	This is a generalization for emphasis. Alternate translation: “great crowds of people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
LUK	24	20	m724	figs-exclusive	ἡμῶν	1	our	This is a reference to the Jewish leaders, and the two men likely recognize Jesus as a fellow Jew, so the word **our** would be inclusive here, if your language marks that form. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
LUK	24	20	e5zt	figs-metonymy	παρέδωκαν αὐτὸν…εἰς κρίμα θανάτου	1	delivered him to a judgment of death	The men are using the **judgment of death**, that is, the death sentence that the Romans passed on Jesus, figuratively to represent the Romans themselves.

LUK	24	20	m725	figs-synecdoche	καὶ ἐσταύρωσαν αὐτόν	1	and crucified him	The men speak as if their **chief priests** and **rulers** crucified Jesus themselves. They are speaking figuratively, describing all of the people who were responsible for the crucifixion of Jesus, including the crowds, Pilate, and the Roman soldiers by reference to the Jewish leaders, who set the process in motion by stirring up the crowds and persuading Pilate. Alternate translation: “so that he was crucified” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
LUK	24	21	ei9t	figs-exclusive	ἡμεῖς…ἠλπίζομεν	1	we were hoping	The men are speaking of themselves and likely their fellow disciples as well, but not of Jesus, so **we** would be exclusive here, if your language marks that form. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
LUK	24	21	ljb1	figs-metaphor	ὁ μέλλων λυτροῦσθαι τὸν Ἰσραήλ	1	the one who was going to redeem Israel	See how you translated the similar expression in [2:38](../02/38.md). The word **redeem** means literally to “buy back,” for example, to buy someone’s freedom from slavery, but the men are using it in a figurative sense here. Alternate translation: “the person who was going to bring God’s blessings and favor back to the people of Israel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	24	21	m726	figs-personification	τὸν Ἰσραήλ	1	Israel	The men are speaking of all the Israelites as if they were a single person, their ancestor, **Israel**. Alternate translation: “the people of Israel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

LUK	24	21	sg3g	figs-explicit	τρίτην ταύτην ἡμέραν ἄγει, ἀφ’ οὗ ταῦτα ἐγένετο	1	he is spending this third day since these things happened	By saying **he is spending this third day**, the men are referring to Jesus as if he were alive. However, they are actually saying how long he has been dead. They are going to tell how the women reported that his grave was empty, and they find it unbelievable that anyone who had been dead that long would have gotten up out of the grave. See how you translated the expression **the third day** in 9:22, and express this in the way that your culture reckons time. Alternate translation: “the Romans put him to death on the day before yesterday” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	24	21	xqc3	translate-ordinal	τρίτην ταύτην ἡμέραν ἄγει, ἀφ’ οὗ ταῦτα ἐγένετο	1	he is spending this third day since these things happened	If your language does not use ordinal numbers, you can use a cardinal number here. Alternate translation: “this is day three since these things happened to him” or, depending on how your culture reckons time, “this is day two since these things happened to him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
LUK	24	22	a3j9		γυναῖκές τινες ἐξ ἡμῶν	1	some women among us	Alternate translation: “some women in our group”
LUK	24	22	m727	figs-exclusive	ἡμῶν…ἡμᾶς	1	us … us	The men are speaking of themselves and their fellow disciples, but not of Jesus, so **us** would be exclusive in both instances here, if your language marks that form. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
LUK	24	22	du1v		γενόμεναι ὀρθριναὶ ἐπὶ τὸ μνημεῖον	1	having been at the tomb early	The men are using this expression to refer to the **women**, not to themselves. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here and continue it into the next verse. Alternate translation: “They went to his tomb early this morning”
LUK	24	23	m728		καὶ μὴ εὑροῦσαι τὸ σῶμα αὐτοῦ, ἦλθαν	1	and not finding his body, they came	If you began a new sentence at the end of the previous verse, you can continue it here. Alternate translation: “but they did not find his body, so they came to us”
LUK	24	24	m729		τινες τῶν σὺν ἡμῖν	1	some of those with us	Alternate translation: “some of the men in our group”
LUK	24	24	m730	figs-exclusive	ἡμῖν	1	us	The men are speaking of themselves and their fellow disciples, but not of Jesus, so **us** would be exclusive here, if your language marks that form. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
LUK	24	24	m731	figs-explicit	εὗρον οὕτως, καθὼς καὶ αἱ γυναῖκες εἶπον	1	they found it thus, just as the women had indeed said	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate the implications of this statement explicitly. Alternate translation: “they found that the body of Jesus was not in the tomb, just as the women had said” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	24	24	fkw9	writing-pronouns	αὐτὸν δὲ οὐκ εἶδον	1	they did not see him	The pronoun **him** refers to Jesus. Alternate translation: “they did not see Jesus himself” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
LUK	24	25	m732	figs-nominaladj	ἀνόητοι	1	foolish ones	Jesus is using the adjective **foolish** as a noun. ULT adds the term **ones** to show this. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate the term with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “you foolish people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
LUK	24	25	m733	figs-youdual	ἀνόητοι	1	foolish ones	Jesus is speaking to two men, so the word “you” would be in the dual form if your language marks that form, if you choose to use that word in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
LUK	24	25	vg3z	figs-metaphor	καὶ βραδεῖς τῇ καρδίᾳ, τοῦ πιστεύειν	1	and slow in heart to believe	The term **heart** figuratively represents the mind. Alternate translation: “who have such difficulty believing with your minds” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	24	25	m734	figs-metonymy	καὶ βραδεῖς τῇ καρδίᾳ, τοῦ πιστεύειν	1	and slow in heart to believe	The word **slow** figuratively represents difficulty, since someone who has difficulty doing something will do it slowly. Alternate translation: “who have such difficulty believing with your minds” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	24	25	m735	figs-hyperbole	πᾶσιν οἷς ἐλάλησαν οἱ προφῆται	1	all that the prophets have spoken	The term **all** is a generalization that refers specifically to what the prophets said about the Messiah. Alternate translation: “what the prophets said about the Messiah” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
LUK	24	26	n85k	figs-rquestion	οὐχὶ ταῦτα ἔδει παθεῖν τὸν Χριστὸν καὶ εἰσελθεῖν εἰς τὴν δόξαν αὐτοῦ?	1	Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer these things, and to enter into his glory?	Jesus is using the question form to remind the disciples about what the prophets said. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate his words as a statement or exclamation. Alternate translation: “The Messiah had to suffer these things in order to enter into his glory!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	24	26	m736	grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ εἰσελθεῖν εἰς τὴν δόξαν αὐτοῦ	1	and to enter into his glory	This is not a second thing that it was necessary for the Messiah to do. Rather, this is the result for which it was necessary for the Messiah to do the first thing. Alternate translation: “in order to enter into his glory” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
LUK	24	26	f8es	figs-abstractnouns	εἰσελθεῖν εἰς τὴν δόξαν αὐτοῦ	1	to enter into his glory	If your readers would misunderstand the abstract noun **glory**, you could express the idea behind it with an adjective such as “glorious.” Alternate translation: “to receive a glorious position” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
LUK	24	27	g4t7	figs-metonymy	Μωϋσέως…τῶν προφητῶν	1	Moses … the prophets	Luke is using the name **Moses** figuratively to refer to the part of Scripture that Moses wrote, and the term **the prophets** to refer to the part of Scripture that they wrote. Alternate translation: “the writings of Moses … the writings of the prophets” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	24	27	m737		καὶ ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν προφητῶν	1	and from all the prophets	The term **beginning** applies just to the writings of Moses. Jesus began with that part of Scripture, and he then continued teaching from the writings of the prophets. Alternate translation: “and then from all the writings of the prophets” or “and continuing with all the writings of the prophets”
LUK	24	28	m738	figs-verbs	ἤγγισαν εἰς τὴν κώμην οὗ ἐπορεύοντο	1	they drew near to the village where they were going	The first **they** refers to Jesus and the two disciples, while the second **they** refers only to the two disciples, so **they were going** would be in the dual form, if your language uses that form. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-verbs]])
LUK	24	28	cdj2	figs-explicit	αὐτὸς προσεποιήσατο πορρώτερον πορεύεσθαι	1	he acted as if he would travel farther	This means that the two disciples understood from Jesus’ actions that he was continuing on to another destination. Perhaps he kept walking on the road when they turned off to enter Emmaus. There is no indication that Jesus deceived them with words. Alternate translation: “Jesus seemed to be heading farther down the road” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	24	29	m739	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	καὶ	1	And	Luke uses this word to introduce a contrast between what it appeared Jesus was going to do and what the two disciples wanted him to do. Alternate translation: “But” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
LUK	24	29	m740	figs-verbs	παρεβιάσαντο…ἡμῶν…αὐτοῖς	1	they urged … us … them	This verb, as well as these two pronouns, would be in the dual form, if your language marks that form, since they apply to the two disciples. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-verbs]])
LUK	24	29	pn4d	figs-ellipsis	παρεβιάσαντο αὐτὸν	1	they urged him	Luke is telling this story in a concise way, and he does not say what the two disciples urged Jesus to do. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could supply that information from the context. Alternate translation: “they urged him to stay overnight in the house with them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
LUK	24	29	m741	figs-exclusive	ἡμῶν	1	us	The men are speaking of themselves but not of Jesus, so **us** would be exclusive here, if your language marks that form. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

Alternate translation: “You are to do this starting here in Jerusalem” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	24	48	wp38	figs-explicit	ὑμεῖς μάρτυρες τούτων	1	You are witnesses of these things	The implication is that because the disciples are **witnesses** of the things that happened to Jesus, they are the ones who should go and tell others about these things, from their own firsthand experience. Alternate translation: “You saw everything that happened to me, and now you must go and tell others what you saw” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	24	49	m2lm	figs-explicit	τὴν ἐπαγγελίαν τοῦ Πατρός μου	1	the promise of my Father	This implicitly means the Holy Spirit.

Alternate translation: “what my Father promised” or “the Holy Spirit, as my Father promised” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	24	49	ynm2	guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	τοῦ Πατρός μου	1	my Father	**Father** is an important title for God. Alternate translation: “God my Father” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
LUK	24	49	m784	figs-imperative	ὑμεῖς δὲ καθίσατε	1	But you stay	This is an emphatic imperative. Alternate translation: “But be sure that you stay” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])

LUK	24	49	c4iv	figs-metaphor	ἕως οὗ ἐνδύσησθε…δύναμιν	1	until you put on power	Jesus speaks figuratively of this **power** as if it were clothing that the disciples would **put on**. Alternate translation: “until you receive power” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	24	49	l46b	figs-metonymy	ἐξ ὕψους	1	from heaven	Jesus uses the term **heaven** to refer to God figuratively by association, since heaven is the abode of God. Alternate translation: “from God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	24	50	bd6p	translate-names	ἕως πρὸς Βηθανίαν	1	as far as towards Bethany	**Bethany** is the name of a village outside Jerusalem. See how you translated it in [19:29](../19/29.md). Alternate translation: “to a place near the village of Bethany” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	24	50	cm9a	translate-symaction	ἐπάρας τὰς χεῖρας αὐτοῦ	1	lifting up his hands	This was something that Jewish priests did when they blessed people. Alternate translation: “lifting up his hands in spiritual authority” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
LUK	24	51	dzr3	writing-newevent	καὶ ἐγένετο	1	And it happened that	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a significant development in this episode. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for this purpose. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
LUK	24	51	clx9	figs-activepassive	ἀνεφέρετο εἰς τὸν οὐρανόν	1	he was carried up into heaven	Since Luke does not specify who carried Jesus up to heaven, we do not know whether God himself did this or one or more angels did it. If your language would have to specify who did the carrying, it may be better to say “went” instead, as UST does. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

LUK	24	53	wa3d	figs-hyperbole	διὰ παντὸς	1	through all	Luke means that the disciples were in the temple **through all** the hours that the temple was open.

LUK	24	53	edm3	figs-synecdoche	ἐν τῷ ἱερῷ	1	in the temple	Only priests were allowed to enter the **temple** building. Luke is using the word for the entire building to refer to one part of it. Alternate translation: “in the temple courtyard” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
