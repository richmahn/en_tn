LUK	front	intro	uk55			0		# Introduction to the Gospel of Luke<br>## Part 1: General Introduction<br><br>### Outline of the Book of Luke<br><br>1. Dedication to Theophilus (1:1–4)<br>2. Prologue<br>  * The birth of John the Baptist (1:5–80)<br>  * The birth and youth of Jesus (2:1–51)<br>  * The ministry of John the Baptist (3:1–20)<br>  * The baptism, genealogy, and temptation of Jesus (3:21–4:13)<br>3. The teaching and healing ministry of Jesus in Galilee (4:14–9:50)<br>4. Jesus teaches along his journey to Jerusalem<br>  * Judgment by God, and people’s judgments about Jesus (9:51–13:21)<br>  * Who will be part of the kingdom of God (13:22–17:10)<br>  * Responding to Jesus by welcoming or rejecting him (17:11–19:27)<br>5. Jesus in Jerusalem<br>  * Jesus’ entry into Jerusalem (19:28–44)<br>  * Jesus teaches in the temple: conflict over his identity and authority (19:45–21:38)<br>  * Jesus’ death, burial, and resurrection (22:1–24:53)<br><br>### What is the Gospel of Luke about?<br><br>The Gospel of Luke is one of four books in the New Testament that describe the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. These books are called “gospels,” which means “good news.” Their authors wrote about different aspects of who Jesus was and what he did. Luke wrote his gospel for a person named Theophilus and dedicated it to him. Luke wrote an accurate description of the life and teachings of Jesus so that Theophilus would be certain that what he had been taught about Jesus was true. However, Luke expected that what he wrote would encourage all followers of Jesus.<br><br>### How should the title of this book be translated?<br><br>Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “The Gospel of Luke” or “The Gospel according to Luke.” Or they may choose a different title, such as “The Good News about Jesus that Luke Wrote.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])<br><br>### Who wrote the Book of Luke?<br><br>This book does not give the name of its author. However, the same person who wrote this book also wrote the Book of Acts, which is also dedicated to Theophilus. In parts of the Book of Acts, the author uses the word “we.” This indicates that the author traveled with Paul. Most scholars think that Luke was this person traveling with Paul. Therefore, since early Christian times, most Christians have recognized Luke as the author of both the Gospel of Luke and the Book of Acts.<br><br>Luke was a medical doctor. His way of writing shows that he was an educated man. He was probably a Gentile. Luke himself probably did not witness what Jesus said and did. But he tells Theophilus in his dedication that he talked to many people who did.<br><br>## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts<br><br>### The kingdom of God<br><br>The “kingdom of God” is a major concept in the Gospel of Luke. It is very rich in meaning. It includes the idea of eternal life in the presence of God, but it also includes the idea of what the earth will be like in the future when God rules everything, and the idea of life on earth right now, when and where God’s wishes are carried out fully. The unifying concept behind all of these ideas is that of God ruling and of people embracing God’s rule over their lives. Wherever the expression “the kingdom of God” occurs, translation notes will suggest communicating the idea behind the abstract noun “kingdom” with some phrase that uses the verb “rule.” UST models this approach consistently. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])<br><br>### Why does Luke write so much about the final week of Jesus’ life?<br><br>Luke wrote much about Jesus’ final week. He wanted his readers to think deeply about Jesus’ final week and his death on the cross. He wanted people to understand that Jesus willingly died on the cross so that God could forgive them for sinning against him. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])<br><br>### What are the roles of women in the Gospel of Luke?<br><br>Luke described women in a very positive way in his gospel. For example, he often showed women being more faithful to God than most men. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faithful]])<br><br>## Part 3: Important Translation Issues<br><br>### What are the Synoptic Gospels?<br><br>The Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke are called the Synoptic Gospels because they tell the story of many of the same events. The word “synoptic” means to “see together.”<br><br>Passages are considered “parallel” when they are the same or almost the same among two or three gospels. When translating parallel passages, translators should use the same wording and make them as similar as possible.<br><br>### Why does Jesus refer to himself as the “Son of Man”?<br><br>In the gospels, Jesus calls himself the “Son of Man.” This is a reference to Daniel [7:13–14](../dan/07/13.md). In that passage, there is a person who is described as like a “son of man.” That means that the person was someone who looked like a human being. God gave authority to this “son of man” to rule over the nations forever. All people will worship him forever.<br><br>Jews of Jesus’ time did not use “Son of Man” as a title for anyone. But Jesus used it for himself to help them understand who he truly was. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sonofman]])<br><br>Translating the title “Son of Man” can be difficult in many languages. Readers may misunderstand a literal translation. Translators can consider alternatives, such as “The Human One.” It may also be helpful to include a footnote to explain the title.<br><br>### Major issues in the text of the Book of Luke<br><br>ULT follows the readings of the most accurate ancient manuscripts of the Bible. However, there may already be older versions of the Bible in the translators’ regions that follow the readings of other manuscripts. In the most significant cases, the General Notes to the chapters in which these differences occur will discuss them and recommend approaches. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
LUK	1	intro	f1b5			0		# Luke 01 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>1. Dedication to Theophilus (1:1–4)<br>2. The angel Gabriel announces to Zechariah that his wife Elizabeth is going to bear a son, John the Baptist (1:5–25)<br>3. The angel Gabriel announces to Mary that she is going to become the mother of Jesus (1:26–38)<br>4. Mary goes to visit Elizabeth (1:39–56)<br>5. John the Baptist is born (1:57–80)<br><br>Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. ULT does this with the poetry in Mary’s song about becoming the mother of Jesus in 1:46–55 and Zechariah’s song about the birth of his son John the Baptist in 1:68–79.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### “He will be called John”<br><br>Most people in the ancient Near East would give a child the same name as someone in their families. People were surprised that Elizabeth and Zechariah named their son John because there was no one else in their family with that name.
LUK	1	1	qhd9	figs-activepassive	περὶ τῶν πεπληροφορημένων ἐν ἡμῖν πραγμάτων	1	concerning the things that have been fulfilled among us	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “about those things that have happened among us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	1	1	hyp6	figs-exclusive	ἐν ἡμῖν	1	among us	Luke dedicates this book to a man named Theophilus. It is no longer known exactly who he was. But since Luke says in [1:4](../01/04.md) that he wants Theophilus to know that the things he has been taught are reliable, it appears that he was a follower of Jesus. So the word **us** here would include him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
LUK	1	2	hud2	figs-metonymy	οἱ…αὐτόπται…γενόμενοι	1	who…were eyewitnesses	The term **eyewitness** describes someone who saw something happen personally, “with their own eyes.” The term describes such a person figuratively by reference to something associated with sight, the eye. Alternate translation: “who…saw these things personally” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	1	2	z9dq	figs-metonymy	ὑπηρέται…τοῦ λόγου	1	servants of the word	The term **word** figuratively describes the things that the people who brought the message conveyed by using words. Alternate translation: “servants of the message” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	1	2	l000	figs-metaphor	ὑπηρέται…τοῦ λόγου	1	servants of the word	The people who brought this message were actually serving God by doing that. But Luke describes them figuratively as **servants of the word**, as if they were serving the message from God. Alternate translation: “served God by telling people his message” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	1	3	fud1	writing-background	παρηκολουθηκότι ἄνωθεν πᾶσιν ἀκριβῶς	1	having carefully investigated everything from the beginning	Luke provides this background information to explain that he was careful to find out exactly what happened. He probably talked to different people who saw what happened to make sure that what he wrote down about these events was correct. Alternate translation: “because I have conducted careful research and interviews” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
LUK	1	3	l001	figs-youformal	σοι…κράτιστε Θεόφιλε	1	you…most excellent Theophilus	If your language has a formal form of **you** that it uses to address a superior respectfully, it would be appropriate to use that form here. There are many other places in the book of Luke where your language might use formal **you**, and these notes will not address all of them. Rather, as you translate, use formal and informal **you** in the way that would be most natural in your language. The notes will address a few cases where a careful decision should be made between the two forms. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youformal]])
LUK	1	3	nr63		κράτιστε Θεόφιλε	1	most excellent Theophilus	Luke is dedicating this work to Theophilus, and within his dedication, this is the conventional personal greeting. If it would be more customary in your language and culture, you could put this greeting in [1:1](../01/01.md) at the start of the dedication, and so at the very beginning of the book. Alternate translation: “To most excellent Theophilus”
LUK	1	3	vhj8		κράτιστε	1	most excellent	Luke uses this term to address Theophilus in a way that shows honor and respect. This may mean that Theophilus was an important government official. In your translation, it would be appropriate to use the form of address that your culture uses for people of high status. Alternate translation: “Honorable”
LUK	1	3	h7q1	translate-names	Θεόφιλε	1	Theophilus	This name means “friend of God.” It may describe this man’s character, or it may have been his actual name. Most translations treat it as a name. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	1	4	l002	figs-activepassive	ὧν κατηχήθης λόγων	1	the things that you have been taught	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who did the action. Alternate translation: “what people have taught you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	1	4	l003	figs-explicit	ὧν κατηχήθης λόγων	1	the things that you have been taught	Luke assumes that Theophilus will know that he means what he has been **taught** about Jesus. Alternate translation: “what people have taught you about Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	1	5	gb16	writing-newevent	ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις Ἡρῴδου βασιλέως τῆς Ἰουδαίας	1	In the days of Herod, king of Judea	This time reference introduces a new event. Alternate translation: “During the time when King Herod ruled over Judea” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
LUK	1	5	l004	figs-idiom	ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις	1	In the days of	Luke uses the term **days** figuratively here to refer a particular period of time. Alternate translation: “During the time when” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	1	5	l005	translate-names	Ἡρῴδου	1	Herod	This is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	1	5	l006	translate-names	Ἰουδαίας	1	Judea	This is the name of a kingdom. (It was not an independent kingdom at this time. Herod ruled it as a vassal of the Roman Empire.) (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	1	5	a4q9	writing-participants	ἐγένετο…ἱερεύς τις	1	there was a certain priest	This phrase introduces a new character in a story. If your language has an expression of its own that serves this purpose, you can use it here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
LUK	1	5	l007	translate-names	Ζαχαρίας	1	Zechariah	This is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	1	5	l228	figs-explicit	ἐξ ἐφημερίας Ἀβιά	1	from the division of Abijah	Luke assumes that his readers will know that this expression refers one of the different groups of priests who each served in the temple for a certain number of days at a time, and that the name of the group means that Abijah was the ancestor of these priests. Alternate translation: “who belonged to the group of priests who were descended from Abijah” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	1	5	gzw1	translate-names	Ἀβιά	1	Abijah	This is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	1	5	d3ua	figs-metaphor	γυνὴ αὐτῷ ἐκ τῶν θυγατέρων Ἀαρών	1	his wife was from the daughters of Aaron	The word **daughters** here figuratively means “descendants.” Alternate translation: “his wife was a descendant of Aaron” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	1	5	nnu9	figs-explicit	ἐκ τῶν θυγατέρων Ἀαρών	1	from the daughters of Aaron	This means implicitly that she, like Zechariah, was descended from the line of priests going back to Aaron, the first high priest. Alternate translation: “his wife also came from the line of priests” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	1	5	l008	translate-names	Ἐλεισάβετ	1	Elizabeth	This is the name of a woman. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	1	6	uu87	figs-metaphor	ἐναντίον τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	in front of God	Luke uses this expression to mean “where God could see them.” Seeing, in turn, figuratively means attention and judgment. Alternate translation: “in God’s judgment” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	1	6	l009	figs-metaphor	πορευόμενοι πάσαις ταῖς ἐντολαῖς καὶ δικαιώμασιν τοῦ Κυρίου	1	walking…in all the commandments and statutes of the Lord	The term **walking** figuratively means “obeying.” Alternate translation: “obeying…everything that the Lord had commanded” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	1	6	csc9	figs-doublet	πάσαις ταῖς ἐντολαῖς καὶ δικαιώμασιν τοῦ Κυρίου	1	in all the commandments and statutes of the Lord	The words **commandments** and **statutes** mean similar things. Luke uses the two terms together to make a comprehensive statement. You do not need to repeat both words in your translation if that might be confusing for your readers. Alternate translation: “everything that the Lord had commanded” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
LUK	1	7	c7cj	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	καὶ	1	But	This word indicates a contrast, showing that what follows is the opposite of what would be expected. People expected that if they did what was right, God would allow them to have children. Although this couple did what was right, they did not have any children. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
LUK	1	7	l010	figs-idiom	ἀμφότεροι προβεβηκότες ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις αὐτῶν	1	they had both advanced in their days	To have moved forward or to have **advanced** means figuratively to have aged. Alternate translation: “they had both grown old” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	1	7	l011	figs-idiom	ἀμφότεροι προβεβηκότες ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις αὐτῶν	1	they had both advanced in their days	Luke uses the term **days** figuratively here to refer a particular time, the lifetimes of Zechariah and Elizabeth. Alternate translation: “they had both grown old” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	1	8	jr7f	writing-newevent	ἐγένετο δὲ	1	And it happened that	This phrase marks a shift from the background information that Luke has been providing about the participants to the first event in their story. If your language has a similar expression that it uses to introduce an event, you can use it here in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
LUK	1	8	l012	grammar-connect-logic-result	ἐν τῷ ἱερατεύειν αὐτὸν ἐν τῇ τάξει τῆς ἐφημερίας αὐτοῦ	1	in his performing as priest in the order of his division	If it would be clearer in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the results that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “because it was his group’s turn, Zechariah was serving as a priest” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
LUK	1	8	vyl8	figs-metaphor	ἐν τῷ ἱερατεύειν αὐτὸν…ἔναντι τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	in his performing as priest before God	The expression **before God**, that is, “in front of God,” means that Zechariah was offering his service as a priest in the presence of God. Alternate translation: “while Zechariah was serving God as a priest” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	1	8	abc1	writing-pronouns	ἐν τῷ ἱερατεύειν αὐτὸν	1	in his performing as priest	The pronoun **his** refers to Zechariah. Alternate translation: “while Zechariah was serving as a priest” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
LUK	1	8	wed9	writing-background	ἐν τῇ τάξει τῆς ἐφημερίας αὐτοῦ	1	in the order of his division	This is background information that explains why Zechariah was serving as a priest at this time. Alternate translation: “because it was his group’s turn to serve” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
LUK	1	9	vq5g	writing-background	κατὰ τὸ ἔθος τῆς ἱερατείας, ἔλαχε	1	according to the custom of the priesthood, he came up by lot	Luke is providing background information about how the priests selected members of their group to perform specific duties. Alternate translation: “The priests chose him in their customary way, by casting a lot” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
LUK	1	9	l013	grammar-connect-logic-result	τοῦ θυμιᾶσαι, εἰσελθὼν εἰς τὸν ναὸν τοῦ Κυρίου	1	to enter into the temple of the Lord to burn incense	ULT puts these phrases in the chronological order of what Zechariah needed to do. If it would be clearer in your language, you could put them in logical order instead. Alternate translation: “to burn incense, and so he went into the temple to do that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
LUK	1	9	pa9c	translate-unknown	ἔλαχε	1	came up by lot	A **lot** was a marked stone that was thrown or rolled on the ground in order to help decide something. The priests believed that God would guide the lot and show them which priest he wanted them to choose for a particular duty. If your culture has a similar object, you can use the word for that in your language here. Alternate translation: “by casting a marked stone” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	1	9	ph9z	translate-unknown	τοῦ θυμιᾶσαι	1	to burn incense	The word **incense** describes a substance that gives off a sweet smell when it is burned. The priests were to burn it as an offering to God each morning and evening on a special altar inside the temple. If your language has a word for this substance, you can use it here. Alternate translation: “to burn a substance that would create a sweet smell as an offering to God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	1	10	bjl6	figs-hyperbole	πᾶν τὸ πλῆθος…τοῦ λαοῦ	1	the whole crowd of the people	This expression, if taken literally, could mean every single one of the Jews, but it is actually a generalization that Luke is using to emphasize how big this crowd was. Alternate translation: “A large number of people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
LUK	1	10	ntl8	figs-explicit	ἔξω	1	outside	This word refers implicitly to the enclosed area or courtyard that surrounded the temple. Alternate translation: “in the courtyard outside the temple building” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	1	10	uwu7	figs-metaphor	τῇ ὥρᾳ τοῦ θυμιάματος	1	at the hour of the incense offering	The word **hour** figuratively means “time.” This could mean either the morning or evening time for the incense offering. Alternate translation: “when it was time to offer the incense” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	1	11	b8b7	grammar-connect-time-simultaneous	δὲ	1	Then	This word indicates that the event it introduces took place at the same time as the event the story has just related. If it would be clearer in your language, you could show this relationship by using a phrase such as “right at that time.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous]])
LUK	1	11	c8ss	figs-idiom	ὤφθη…αὐτῷ	1	appeared to him	When Luke says that the angel **appeared**, this does not mean that Zechariah simply saw the angel in a vision. Rather, this expression indicates that the angel was actually present with Zechariah. Alternate translation: “suddenly was there with Zechariah” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	1	12	r3aa	figs-parallelism	ἐταράχθη Ζαχαρίας…φόβος ἐπέπεσεν ἐπ’ αὐτόν	1	Zechariah was troubled…fear fell on him	These two phrases mean similar things. Luke is using them together to emphasize how afraid Zechariah was. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine these phrases. Alternate translation: “Zechariah became very afraid” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
LUK	1	12	d1zm	figs-explicit	ἰδών	1	when he saw him	The implication is that Zechariah was afraid because the angel appeared glorious and powerful. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. (Luke has just said that Zechariah was righteous and blameless, so it would be good not to leave your readers with the impression that he had done something wrong and was afraid that the angel was going to punish him for it.) Alternate translation: “when he saw how glorious and powerful the angel was” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	1	12	l014	figs-metaphor	φόβος ἐπέπεσεν ἐπ’ αὐτόν	1	fear fell upon him	Luke is using the expression **fell upon** figuratively to speak of fear as if it attacked and overcame Zechariah. Alternate translation: “This made him very afraid” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	1	12	sfb1	figs-personification	φόβος ἐπέπεσεν ἐπ’ αὐτόν	1	fear fell upon him	Luke describes Zechariah’s **fear** figuratively as if it were something that could actively attack and overpower him. Alternate translation: “This made him very afraid” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
LUK	1	13	ki8l	figs-imperative	μὴ φοβοῦ	1	Do not be afraid	While the angel speaks these words in the form of a command, he is actually telling Zechariah something to help and encourage him. Alternate translation: “You do not need to be afraid” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
LUK	1	13	es4l	figs-activepassive	εἰσηκούσθη ἡ δέησίς σου	1	your prayer has been heard	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who has done the action. Alternate translation: “God has heard your prayer” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	1	13	l015	figs-idiom	εἰσηκούσθη ἡ δέησίς σου	1	your prayer has been heard	This is an idiom that means that God is going to give Zechariah what he has been asking for. Alternate translation: “God is going to give you what you have been asking for” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	1	13	l016	figs-declarative	καὶ καλέσεις τὸὄνομα αὐτοῦ Ἰωάννην	1	you will call his name John	The angel is using a statement as a command in order to tell Zechariah what to do. Alternate translation: “You are to name him John” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative]])
LUK	1	13	l017	figs-idiom	καλέσεις τὸὄνομα αὐτοῦ Ἰωάννην	1	call his name John	The expression **call his name** is an idiom that means to give a child a name. Alternate translation: “name him John” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	1	13	l018	translate-names	Ἰωάννην	1	John	This is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	1	14	n654	figs-doublet	ἔσται χαρά σοι καὶ ἀγαλλίασις	1	there will be joy and gladness to you	The words **joy** and **gladness** mean the same thing. The angel uses them together for emphasis. Alternate translation: “you will be very happy” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
LUK	1	14	q1p8	grammar-connect-logic-result	ἐπὶ τῇ γενέσει αὐτοῦ	1	at his birth	The word **at** introduces the reason why many people will rejoice. Alternate translation: “because he has been born” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
LUK	1	15	td57	grammar-connect-logic-result	ἔσται γὰρ μέγας	1	For he will be great	The word **for** introduces the reason why people will rejoice because John has been born. Alternate translation: “This will be because they will be able to tell that he is going to be a great man” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
LUK	1	15	sz79	figs-metaphor	ἐνώπιον τοῦ Κυρίου	1	before the Lord	This expression means “in front of the Lord,” that is, “where the Lord can see him.” Sight, in turn, figuratively represents attention and judgment. Alternate translation: “God will consider him to be very important” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	1	15	abc2	figs-doublenegatives	οὐ μὴ πίῃ	1	he must never drink	The phrase **must never** translates two negative words in Greek. The angel uses them together to emphasize how important it is that the child not drink wine or strong drink. If your language can use two negatives together for emphasis without them cancelling each other to create a positive meaning, it would be appropriate to use that construction here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
LUK	1	15	hgb9	figs-activepassive	Πνεύματος Ἁγίου πλησθήσεται	1	he will be filled with the Holy Spirit	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “the Holy Spirit will fill him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	1	15	l019	figs-metaphor	Πνεύματος Ἁγίου πλησθήσεται	1	he will be filled with the Holy Spirit	The angel speaks figuratively as if John would be a container that the Holy Spirit would fill. He means that the Holy Spirit will empower and influence John. Be sure that in your translation, this does not sound similar to what an evil spirit might do to in taking control of a person. Alternate translation: “the Holy Spirit will empower him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	1	15	ie95		ἔτι ἐκ κοιλίας μητρὸς αὐτοῦ	1	even from his mother’s womb	Alternate translation: “while he is still in his mother’s womb” or “even before he is born”

Alternate translation: “he will cause many of the people of Israel to repent and obey the Lord” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	1	16	l020	figs-metaphor	πολλοὺς τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ	1	many of the sons of Israel	The word **sons** here figuratively means “descendants.” This expression envisions all of the Israelites as if they were their ancestor Jacob, who was also known as Israel. Alternate translation: “many of the people of Israel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	1	16	l021	translate-names	Ἰσραὴλ	1	Israel	This is the name of a man. Luke uses it many times in this book. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	1	17	c52s	figs-idiom	αὐτὸς προελεύσεται ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ	1	he will go before him	To **go before** is an idiom that indicates that before the Lord comes, John will announce to the people that the Lord is going to come to them. Alternate translation: “John will announce that the Lord is coming” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	1	17	p472	figs-doublet	ἐν πνεύματι καὶ δυνάμει Ἠλεία	1	in the spirit and power of Elijah	In this context, the words **spirit** and **power** mean similar things. The angel may be using them together for emphasis. Alternate translation: “with the same great power that Elijah had” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
LUK	1	17	l022	figs-hendiadys	ἐν πνεύματι καὶ δυνάμει Ἠλεία	1	in the spirit and power of Elijah	Alternatively, the angel may be expressing a single idea by using two words connected with **and.** The term **power** may tell what kind of **spirit** Elijah had. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the meaning with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “in the powerful spirit of Elijah” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
LUK	1	17	l023	translate-names	Ἠλεία	1	Elijah	This is the name of a man, a great prophet of Israel. It occurs several times in this book. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	1	17	w32h	figs-personification	ἐπιστρέψαι καρδίας πατέρων ἐπὶ τέκνα	1	to turn the hearts of fathers back to their children	The angel speaks of the **heart** as if it were a living thing that could be turned to go in a different direction.

Luke relates in [3:10-14](../03/10.md) how John encouraged reconciliation in a variety of different relationships. Alternate translation: “to restore broken relationships” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
LUK	1	17	l024	figs-explicit	ἐπιστρέψαι καρδίας πατέρων ἐπὶ τέκνα	1	to turn the hearts of fathers back to their children	It is assumed that readers will know that this is what the prophet Malachi had said Elijah would do before the Lord came. The implication in context is that John will fulfill this prophecy by using the same empowerment that Elijah had. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “to restore broken relationships, just as the prophet Malachi said Elijah would do before the Lord came” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	1	17	l025	figs-explicit	ἀπειθεῖς…ἀπειθεῖς ἐν φρονήσει δικαίων	1	to turn…the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous	Gabriel is using the term **wisdom** in the Old Testament sense, as a moral term that refers to choosing the way in life that God has shown to be best. The people who make this choice are **righteous**, meaning that God considers them to be living in the right way. Alternate translation: “to lead people who are disobeying God to choose his ways and become people who live right” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	1	17	j49j	figs-nominaladj	ἀπειθεῖς…δικαίων	1	the disobedient…the righteous	Gabriel is using the adjectives **disobedient** and **righteous** as nouns, to refer groups of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate these words with equivalent phrases. Alternate translation: “people who are disobeying God…people who live right” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
LUK	1	17	ujs1	figs-explicit	λαὸν κατεσκευασμένον	1	a people prepared	You could state explicitly in your translation what the people will be prepared to do. Alternate translation: “a people who will be prepared to believe his message” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

LUK	1	18	l026	grammar-connect-logic-result	γάρ	1	For	This word introduces the reason why Zechariah wants a sign. He and his wife are both too old to have children, so he is finding it hard to believe what the angel has told him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
LUK	1	18	l027	figs-idiom	προβεβηκυῖα ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις αὐτῆς	1	my wife is advanced in her days	Zechariah is using two idioms. As in [1:7](../01/07.md), to be **advanced** means figuratively to have aged, and **days** figuratively refers a particular period of time, in this case the lifetime of Elizabeth. Alternate translation: “my wife has also grown old” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	1	19	l028	figs-hendiadys	ἀποκριθεὶς ὁ ἄγγελος εἶπεν	1	answering the angel said	Together the words **answering** and **said** mean that the angel responded to the question that Zechariah asked. Alternate translation: “the angel responded” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
LUK	1	19	p3jn	figs-declarative	ἐγώ εἰμι Γαβριὴλ, ὁ παρεστηκὼς ἐνώπιον τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	I am Gabriel, the one standing before God	Gabriel says this in the form of a statement, but he means it as a rebuke to Zechariah. The presence of an angel coming directly from God should be enough proof for him. Alternate translation: “You should have believed me—Gabriel, coming to you straight from God!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative]])
LUK	1	19	l029	translate-names	Γαβριὴλ	1	Gabriel	This is the name of an angel. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

LUK	1	19	pd7h	figs-activepassive	ἀπεστάλην λαλῆσαι πρὸς σὲ	1	I was sent to speak to you	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who did the action. Alternate translation: “God sent me to speak to you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	1	20	x9qk	figs-metaphor	καὶ ἰδοὺ	1	and behold	The term **behold** focuses the attention of the listener on what the speaker is about to say. Though it literally means “look” or “see,” in this case seeing figuratively means giving notice and attention. Alternate translation: “Pay attention!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	1	20	l030	figs-explicit	ἔσῃ σιωπῶν καὶ μὴ δυνάμενος λαλῆσαι	1	you will be silent, and not able to speak	The implication is that God will make this happen, to show that Zechariah should have believed what Gabriel told him. Alternate translation: “God will make you completely unable to speak” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	1	20	g5t1	figs-doublet	σιωπῶν καὶ μὴ δυνάμενος λαλῆσαι	1	silent, and not able to speak	These two phrases mean the same thing. Gabriel uses the repetition to emphasize how complete the silence of Zechariah will be. Alternate translation: “completely unable to speak” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
LUK	1	20	q6y3	figs-metonymy	οὐκ ἐπίστευσας τοῖς λόγοις μου	1	you did not believe my words	Gabriel uses the term **words** figuratively to describe the content of his message, by reference to something associated with it, the words he used to communicate it.

LUK	1	21	e14e	grammar-connect-time-simultaneous	καὶ	1	And	This word marks a shift in the story from what happened inside the temple to what happened outside. Alternate translation: “While that was happening” or “While the angel and Zechariah were talking” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous]])
LUK	1	22	h6vt	grammar-connect-logic-result	ἐπέγνωσαν ὅτι ὀπτασίαν ἑώρακεν ἐν τῷ ναῷ. καὶ αὐτὸς ἦν διανεύων αὐτοῖς, καὶ διέμενεν κωφός	1	they concluded that he had seen a vision in the temple; and he was making signs to them, and remained unable to speak	If it would be clearer in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the action that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “He kept on making signs to them but said nothing. So they concluded that he must have seen a vision while he was in the temple” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
LUK	1	22	r2ak	figs-explicit	ἐπέγνωσαν ὅτι ὀπτασίαν ἑώρακεν ὀπτασίαν	1	they perceived that he had seen a vision	Gabriel was actually present with Zechariah in the temple. He explains in [1:19](../01/19.md) that God sent him there. The people, not knowing this, assumed that Zechariah had seen a vision. While the Greek says that they “perceived” this, it means that they thought they recognized what had happened. Alternate translation: “they thought that he had seen a vision” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	1	23	duy9	writing-newevent	καὶ ἐγένετο	1	And it happened that	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
LUK	1	23	l032	figs-activepassive	ὡς ἐπλήσθησαν αἱ ἡμέραι τῆς λειτουργίας αὐτοῦ	1	when the days of his priestly service were fulfilled	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who did the action. Alternate translation: “when Zechariah had finished his time of service at the temple” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	1	23	l033	figs-idiom	αἱ ἡμέραι τῆς λειτουργίας αὐτοῦ	1	the days of his priestly service	Luke uses the term **days** figuratively here to refer a particular time. Alternate translation: “his time of service at the temple” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	1	23	sa5y	figs-explicit	ἀπῆλθεν εἰς τὸν οἶκον αὐτοῦ	1	he went away to his home	This expression indicates implicitly that Zechariah did not live in Jerusalem, where the temple was located. Luke indicates in [1:39](../01/39.md) that Zechariah and Elizabeth lived instead in a city in the hill country of Judah, the area to the south of Jerusalem. Alternate translation: “he traveled back to his hometown” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	1	24	l034	grammar-connect-time-sequential	δὲ	1	And	This word indicates that the events the story will now relate came after the events it has just described. Alternate translation: “Then” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
LUK	1	24	cda2	figs-idiom	μετὰ δὲ ταύτας τὰς ἡμέρας	1	after these days	Luke uses the term **days** here to refer figuratively to a particular period of time, specifically, the time when Zechariah was serving in the temple. Alternate translation: “after Zechariah had finished serving at the temple” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	1	24	kpw1	figs-explicit	περιέκρυβεν ἑαυτὴν μῆνας πέντε	1	she hid herself for five months	This expression means that Elizabeth did not leave her house during that time. She seems to state the reason for this in the next verse. She had felt disgraced because she was not able to have children. But if stayed in her house for **five months**, the next time people saw her, her pregnancy would show, and it would be clear that she was able to have children. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “She did not leave her house for five months so that by the next time people saw her, it would be clear that she was going to have a baby” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	1	25	w8yq	figs-exclamations	οὕτως μοι πεποίηκεν Κύριος	1	Thus the Lord has done for me	This is a positive exclamation. Elizabeth is very happy with what the Lord has done for her. If it would be clearer in your language, you could show this by making it a separate sentence and indicating with the conventions of your language that it is an exclamation. Alternate translation: “What a marvelous thing the Lord has done for me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations]])
LUK	1	25	z1xr	figs-explicit	οὕτως μοι πεποίηκεν Κύριος	1	Thus the Lord has done for me	It is implicit that Elizabeth is referring to the fact that the Lord has allowed her to become pregnant. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “What a marvelous thing the Lord has done for me by allowing me to become pregnant” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	1	25	pn2a	figs-idiom	ἐπεῖδεν	1	he looked upon me	The expression **looked upon** here is an idiom that means “shown regard for” or “treated well.” Alternate translation: “he treated me kindly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	1	25	lx3p	figs-explicit	ἀφελεῖν ὄνειδός μου ἐν ἀνθρώποις	1	to take away my disgrace among people	By **disgrace**, Elizabeth means the shame she felt because she was not able to have children. Alternate translation: “so that I no longer have to feel ashamed when I am around other people because I cannot have children” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	1	26	v9w2	figs-explicit	ἐν…τῷ μηνὶ τῷ ἕκτῳ	1	in the sixth month	Luke assumes that readers will recognize that this does not mean the sixth month of the year, but the sixth month of Elizabeth’s pregnancy. If you think there could be some confusion about this, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “after Elizabeth had been pregnant for six months” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	1	26	l035	translate-ordinal	τῷ μηνὶ τῷ ἕκτῳ	1	in the sixth month	If your language does not use ordinal numbers, you can use a cardinal number here. Alternate translation: “during month 6” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
LUK	1	26	rl4c	figs-activepassive	ἀπεστάλη ὁ ἄγγελος Γαβριὴλ ἀπὸ τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	the angel Gabriel was sent from God	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “God sent the angel Gabriel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	1	26	l036	translate-names	Γαλιλαίας	1	Galilee	**Galilee** is the name of a region. It occurs many times in this book. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	1	26	l037	translate-names	Ναζαρὲτ	1	Nazareth	**Nazareth** is the name of a city. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	1	27	l038	writing-participants	ἀνδρὶ, ᾧ ὄνομα Ἰωσὴφ	1	a man whose name was Joseph	This introduces Joseph as a new character in the story. If your language has an expression of its own that serves this purpose, you can use it here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
LUK	1	27	l039	translate-names	Ἰωσὴφ	1	Joseph	This is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	1	27	tzh2	figs-metaphor	ἐξ οἴκου Δαυεὶδ	1	of the house of David	In this expression, the word **house** describes all the people descended from a particular person. The term views all of those descendants figuratively as if they were one household living together. Alternate translation: “who was a descendant of King David” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	1	27	l040	writing-background	ἐξ οἴκου Δαυεὶδ	1	of the house of David	This is background information that helps identify Joseph further. It is important for readers to know because it means that as [1:32](../01/32.md) indicates, Jesus, as the adoptive son of Joseph, will be an eligible successor to King David as the Messiah. Alternate translation: “who came from the royal line of David” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
LUK	1	27	w9tm	writing-participants	τὸ ὄνομα τῆς παρθένου Μαριάμ	1	the name of the virgin was Mary	This introduces Mary as a new character in the story.

LUK	1	27	l041	translate-names	Μαριάμ	1	Mary	This is the name of a woman. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	1	28	i7h4	figs-idiom	χαῖρε	1	Rejoice	This word was used as a greeting. Alternate translation: “Greetings” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	1	28	bp2n		κεχαριτωμένη	1	favored one	Alternate translation: “you who have received great grace” or “you who have received special kindness”
LUK	1	28	jmq9	figs-idiom	ὁ Κύριος μετὰ σοῦ	1	The Lord is with you	The expression **with you** is an idiom that indicates favor and acceptance. Alternate translation: “The Lord is pleased with you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	1	29	l042	figs-metonymy	ἐπὶ τῷ λόγῳ	1	by his words	Luke is using the term **words** figuratively to mean what Gabriel said by using words. Alternate translation: “by what he said” or “when he said this” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	1	29	ytx7		διελογίζετο ποταπὸς εἴη ὁ ἀσπασμὸς οὗτος	1	she was considering what kind of greeting this might be	Alternate translation: “she wondered why an angel would greet her in this way”
LUK	1	30	l043	grammar-connect-logic-result	μὴ φοβοῦ, Μαριάμ; εὗρες γὰρ χάριν παρὰ τῷ Θεῷ	1	Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God	If it would be clearer in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the action that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “God is showing you his kindness, Mary, so you do not need to be afraid” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
LUK	1	30	d3rx	figs-imperative	μὴ φοβοῦ	1	Do not be afraid	While the angel speaks these words in the form of a command, he is actually telling Mary something that he thinks will help and encourage her. Alternate translation: “You do not need to be afraid” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
LUK	1	30	a3eb	figs-activepassive	εὗρες…χάριν παρὰ τῷ Θεῷ	1	you have found favor with God	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “God is showing you his kindness” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	1	31	l044	figs-metaphor	καὶ ἰδοὺ	1	And behold	As in [1:20](../01/20.md), **behold** is a term that focuses the attention of the listener on what the speaker is about to say. Alternate translation: “Listen carefully now” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	1	31	fi5q	figs-explicitinfo	συνλήμψῃ ἐν γαστρὶ, καὶ τέξῃ υἱόν	1	you will conceive in your womb and bear a son	The phrase **conceive in your womb** might seem to express unnecessary extra information, and so if you represent all of it in your language, that might not seem natural. However, the details are important here. The expression emphasizes that Jesus was a human son born of a human mother. So be sure to translate this expression in a way that conveys that. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo]])
LUK	1	31	l045	figs-declarative	καλέσεις τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ Ἰησοῦν	1	you will call his name Jesus	As in [1:13](../01/13.md), Gabriel is using a statement as a command in order to tell Mary what to do. Alternate translation: “You are to name him Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative]])

LUK	1	32	l048	figs-idiom	κληθήσεται Υἱὸς Ὑψίστου	1	He…will be called the Son of the Most High	To **be called** is an idiom that means “to be.” (This idiom occurs three times in this episode and in a few other places in the book, such as [1:76](../01/76.md), [2:23](../02/23.md), and [15:19](../15/19.md).) Alternate translation: “He will be the Son of the Most High” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	1	32	hl55	guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	κληθήσεται Υἱὸς Ὑψίστου	1	He…will be called the Son of the Most High	Gabriel is not saying only that **Son of the Most High** is a title by which Jesus will be known. Instead, just as the previous verse described how Jesus was a human son born of a human mother, his statement here indicates that Jesus was also the divine Son of a divine Father. You may want to show this by employing capitalization or whatever other convention your language uses to indicate divinity. Alternate translation: “He will be the Son of the Most High” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
LUK	1	32	ip26	figs-activepassive	κληθήσεται Υἱὸς Ὑψίστου	1	He…will be called the Son of the Most High	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “He will be the Son of the Most High” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	1	32	z74z	figs-idiom	Ὑψίστου	1	the Most High	This is an idiomatic way of referring to God, as the fuller expression “the Most High God” in [8:38](../08/38.md) shows. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate the phrase that way in order to explain its meaning. Or, you could simply reproduce the phrase in the simpler form in which it occurs here in order to show your readers one of the ways in which the people of this time referred to God. Alternate translation: “the Most High God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	1	32	lwd9	figs-metonymy	δώσει αὐτῷ…τὸν θρόνον Δαυεὶδ, τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ	1	will give to him the throne of his father David	The **throne** figuratively represents a king’s authority to rule. Alternate translation: “will give him authority to rule as king as his ancestor David did” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	1	32	l049	figs-metaphor	δώσει αὐτῷ…τὸν θρόνον Δαυεὶδ, τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ	1	will give to him the throne of his father David	The term **father** here figuratively means “ancestor,” but since a line of kings is in view, it also indicates that Jesus will be a successor to David. Alternate translation: “will give him authority to rule as a successor to his ancestor David” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	1	33	l050	figs-parallelism	βασιλεύσει…εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας; καὶ τῆς βασιλείας αὐτοῦ, οὐκ ἔσται τέλος	1	he will reign…to the ages, and there will be no end of his kingdom	These two phrases mean similar things. Gabriel uses them together to emphasize how certain it is that Jesus will always rule. Because Gabriel is making a proclamation, he is speaking in a form much like poetry. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if the repetition might be confusing, you could connect the phrases with a word other than **and**, in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: “he will rule…forever, yes, his kingship will always continue” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
LUK	1	33	l051	figs-metaphor	τὸν οἶκον Ἰακὼβ	1	the house of Jacob	In this expression, the word **house** figuratively describes all the people descended from a particular person, in this case Jacob, who was also known as Israel. Alternate translation: “the people of Israel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	1	33	l052	translate-names	Ἰακὼβ	1	Jacob	This is the name of a man. Luke uses it a few more times in this book. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	1	33	l053	figs-idiom	εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας	1	to the ages	This is an idiom. The term **ages** means long periods of time. Alternate translation: “forever” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	1	33	q516	figs-litotes	τῆς βασιλείας αὐτοῦ, οὐκ ἔσται τέλος	1	there will be no end of his kingship	This is a figure of speech that expresses a strong positive meaning by using a negative word together with a word that is the opposite of the intended meaning. Alternate translation: “his kingship will always continue” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
LUK	1	33	l054	figs-abstractnouns	τῆς βασιλείας αὐτοῦ, οὐκ ἔσται τέλος	1	there will be no end of his kingship	The abstract noun **kingship** refers to the action of a king reigning. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind this word with a verb such as “reign.” Alternate translation: “he will always continue to reign” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
LUK	1	34	cf3b	figs-explicit	πῶς ἔσται τοῦτο	1	How will this be	The implication is that even though Mary did not understand how this could happen, she did not doubt that it would happen. This is clear from the way that Gabriel responds positively and encouragingly to her, by contrast to the way he rebuked Zechariah in [1:18](../01/18.md) for his similar-sounding question. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this explicitly. Alternate translation: “I believe you, though I do not understand how this could happen” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	1	34	fqt7	figs-euphemism	ἄνδρα οὐ γινώσκω	1	I have not known a man	Mary uses a polite expression to say that she had not engaged in sexual activity. Alternate translation: “I am a virgin” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])

LUK	1	35	l056	figs-parallelism	Πνεῦμα Ἅγιον ἐπελεύσεται ἐπὶ σέ, καὶ δύναμις Ὑψίστου ἐπισκιάσει σοι	1	The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you	These two phrases mean similar things. Once again Gabriel is speaking in a form much like Hebrew poetry. It would be good here as well to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if the repetition might be confusing, you could connect the phrases with a term other than **and**, in order to show that the second phrase is repeating and clarifying the meaning of the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: “The Holy Spirit will come to you, yes, the power of God will cover you like a shadow” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
LUK	1	35	x53s	figs-metaphor	δύναμις Ὑψίστου ἐπισκιάσει σοι	1	the power of the Most High will overshadow you	It was the **power** of God that would supernaturally cause Mary to become pregnant even while she still remained a virgin. It is not clear exactly how this happened, since Gabriel speaks figuratively as if God’s power had a shadow in order to describe it. But make sure that your translation does not imply that there was any physical or sexual union involved. This was a miracle. It might work well to retain Gabriel’s language and change the metaphor to a simile. Alternate translation: “the power of the Most High will cover you like a shadow” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	1	35	l057	figs-idiom	Ὑψίστου	1	the Most High	See how you translated the expression **the Most High** in [1:32](../01/32.md). Alternate translation: “the Most High God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	1	35	l058	figs-idiom	διὸ καὶ τὸ γεννώμενον Ἅγιον κληθήσεται, Υἱὸς Θεοῦ	1	Therefore, the holy one who will be born will be called the Son of God	As in [1:32](../01/32.md), to **be called** is an idiom that means “to be.” Alternate translation: “Therefore, this holy baby will be the Son of God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	1	35	k866	guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	διὸ καὶ τὸ γεννώμενον Ἅγιον κληθήσεται, Υἱὸς Θεοῦ	1	Therefore, the holy one who will be born will be called the Son of God	Gabriel is not saying only that **Son of God** is a title by which Jesus will be known. Instead, this is a further statement that Jesus would be the divine Son of a divine Father. (Gabriel says **Therefore**, indicating that this will be the result of the process he has just described.) You may want to show this by employing capitalization or whatever other convention your language uses to indicate divinity. Alternate translation: “Therefore, this holy baby will be the Son of God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
LUK	1	35	vrz6	figs-activepassive	τὸ γεννώμενον Ἅγιον κληθήσεται, Υἱὸς Θεοῦ	1	the holy one who will be born will be called the Son of God	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “this holy baby will be the Son of God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	1	35	l059	figs-parallelism	τὸ γεννώμενον Ἅγιον κληθήσεται, Υἱὸς Θεοῦ	1	the holy one who will be born will be called the Son of God	Depending on how the Greek is understood, this could be another parallel statement. Alternate translation: “The one who will be born will be holy. Yes, he will be the Son of God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
LUK	1	36	lx9k	figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	Behold	This term focuses the attention of the listener on what the speaker is about to say. Alternate translation: “Consider this” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	1	36	f88l		καὶ αὐτὴ συνείληφεν υἱὸν ἐν γήρει αὐτῆς	1	she also has conceived a son in her old age	Make sure that your translation does not make it does not sound as if both Mary and Elizabeth were old when they conceived. Alternate translation: “she has also become pregnant with a son, even though she is already very old”
LUK	1	36	hck2	figs-idiom	οὗτος μὴν ἕκτος ἐστὶν αὐτῇ	1	this is the sixth month for her	This is an idiom. Alternate translation: “she is now in the sixth month of her pregnancy” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

Alternate translation: “God is able to do anything he says” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
LUK	1	37	l061	figs-metonymy	οὐκ ἀδυνατήσει παρὰ τοῦ Θεοῦ πᾶν ῥῆμα	1	every word will not be impossible for God	The term **word** has two possible meanings here. (1) Since Mary uses the same term figuratively in the next verse to describe the message that Gabriel has brought from God, Gabriel may be using it to mean that message as well. Alternate translation: “God is able to do anything he says” (2) Gabriel may be using the term in a general sense to mean “thing.” Alternate translation: “everything is possible with God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	1	38	tef1	figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	Behold	**Behold** here means more literally “look,” that is, “Look at me,” by which Mary means, “This is who I am.” Alternate translation: “I am” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

LUK	1	38	l062	figs-metonymy	κατὰ τὸ ῥῆμά σου	1	according to your word	The term **word** here figuratively describes the message that Gabriel has brought. Alternate translation: “just as you have said” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

LUK	1	39	l063	figs-idiom	ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ταύταις	1	in those days	Luke uses the term **days** figuratively here to refer a particular time. Alternate translation: “Around that same time” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	1	39	wj5i	figs-idiom	ἀναστᾶσα	1	arose	This is an idiom that means not just that Mary stood up, but that she took action to get an enterprise under way. Alternate translation: “started out” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

LUK	1	41	ya5v	figs-metaphor	ἐσκίρτησεν	1	leaped	Luke says that Elizabeth’s baby **leaped**, but this was not literally possible.

LUK	1	79	cnh7	figs-doublet	τοῖς ἐν σκότει καὶ σκιᾷ θανάτου καθημένοις	1	those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death	These two phrases work together to emphasize the deep spiritual darkness that people are in before God shows them mercy. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine the phrases. Alternate translation: “people who do not know the truth at all” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
LUK	1	79	s3eb	figs-metaphor	κατευθῦναι τοὺς πόδας ἡμῶν εἰς ὁδὸν εἰρήνης	1	to guide our feet into the path of peace	Zechariah is using the word **guide** figuratively to mean “teach,” and the expression **the path of peace** figuratively to represent living at peace with God. Alternate translation: “to teach us how to live at peace with God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	1	79	l101	figs-synecdoche	κατευθῦναι τοὺς πόδας ἡμῶν εἰς ὁδὸν εἰρήνης	1	to guide our feet into the path of peace	Zechariah is using the term **feet** figuratively to represent the whole person.

Alternate translation: “Then” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
LUK	1	80	a8bz		ἐκραταιοῦτο πνεύματι	1	became strong in spirit	This expression could mean one of two things. (1) As in [1:47](../01/47.md), the word **spirit** could mean the inner part of a person. Alternate translation: “he developed a strong character” (2) Luke could be describing how God kept the promise that Gabriel made to Zechariah in [1:15](../01/15.md), that the Holy Spirit would empower his son. Alternate translation: “the Holy Spirit empowered him”
LUK	1	80	eh9j	figs-explicit	ἦν ἐν ταῖς ἐρήμοις	1	he was in the wilderness	This expression means implicitly that John went to live there. Luke does not say at what age John did this. Alternate translation: “he went to live in the wilderness” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	1	80	qu12		ἕως ἡμέρας ἀναδείξεως αὐτοῦ	1	until the day of his public appearance	The term **until** does not indicate a stopping point. John continued to live out in the wilderness even after he started preaching publicly. In your translation, be sure that this is clear to your readers. Alternate translation: “through the time when he began to preach in public”
LUK	1	80	ie4l	figs-idiom	ἡμέρας ἡμέρας ἀναδείξεως αὐτοῦ	1	the day of his public appearance	Luke uses the term **day** figuratively here to refer a particular time. Alternate translation: “the time when he began to preach in public” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

LUK	2	intro	dw6t			0		# Luke 02 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>1. Jesus is born in the city of Bethlehem (2:1–20)<br>2. Joseph and Mary dedicate Jesus, and Simeon and Anna speak about him (2:21–40)<br>3. Jesus goes to Jerusalem with his parents for Passover (2:41–52)<br><br>Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. ULT does this with the poetry in the song of the angels about Jesus’ birth in 2:14 and in Simeon’s song about Jesus in 2:29–32.<br><br>## Important textual issues in this chapter<br><br>### “his father and mother”<br>In [2:33](../02/33.md), the most accurate ancient manuscripts read “his father and mother.” ULT follows that reading. Some other ancient manuscripts read “Joseph and his mother.” That reading indicates that Joseph was not the biological father of Jesus, since Mary conceived him as a virgin. However, Joseph was the adoptive father of Jesus, and so the reading “his father and mother” is not incorrect. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it has. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading in ULT.

LUK	2	1	e9m5	writing-newevent	ἐγένετο	1	it happened that	Luke uses this phrase to show that this is the beginning of an account.

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
LUK	2	1	gda6	figs-personification	ἐξῆλθεν δόγμα παρὰ	1	a decree went out from	The **decree** did not go out by itself, even though Luke speaks figuratively as if it did.

LUK	2	1	jtz3	writing-participants	Καίσαρος Αὐγούστου	1	Caesar Augustus	**Caesar** was the title of the emperor of the Roman Empire.

If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “that all the people living in the Roman Empire had to list their names on the tax rolls” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	2	1	m39d	figs-metonymy	τὴν οἰκουμένην	1	the world	The term **world** refers specifically to the part of the world that Caesar Augustus ruled.

LUK	2	4	l107	figs-idiom	ἀνέβη	1	went up	Luke says **went up** because Joseph had to go up into the mountains to travel from Nazareth to Bethlehem. Alternate translation: “traveled” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	2	4	kz78	figs-explicit	εἰς πόλιν Δαυεὶδ, ἥτις καλεῖται Βηθλέεμ	1	to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem	Bethlehem was known as **the city of David** because King David had come from there. Luke includes this detail because it indicates why Bethlehem was important, even though it was a small town. Not only had the line of David’s dynasty originated there, the prophet Micah had said that the future Messiah would be born there. Alternate translation: “to the town known as Bethlehem, where King David had come from” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	2	4	l108	figs-activepassive	ἥτις καλεῖται Βηθλέεμ	1	which is called Bethlehem	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “whose name is Bethlehem” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	2	4	l109	figs-hendiadys	εἶναι αὐτὸν ἐξ οἴκου καὶ πατριᾶς Δαυείδ	1	he was of the house and family line of David	Luke is expressing a single idea by using two terms, **house** and **family line**, connected with **and.** The term **family line** indicates the significance of Joseph being a descendant of David. It means that any son of his, natural or adopted, would be an eligible successor to King David as the Messiah. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the meaning of these two terms with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “he was descended from the royal line of David” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
LUK	2	4	s7a7	figs-metaphor	ἐξ οἴκου…Δαυείδ	1	of the house…of David	As in [1:27](../01/27.md), the word **house** figuratively describes all the people descended from a particular person. Alternate translation: “a descendant of King David” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

Alternate translation: “Because Mary was engaged to Joseph, she had to travel with him so that he could list their names together” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
LUK	2	5	ne7a	figs-explicit	Μαριὰμ, τῇ ἐμνηστευμένῃ αὐτῷ	1	Mary, who was engaged to him	In this culture, an engaged couple was considered legally married, although there would not have been physical intimacy between them until after the wedding.

LUK	2	6	w4is	figs-explicit	ἐν τῷ εἶναι αὐτοὺς ἐκεῖ	1	while they were there	This phrase refers to Joseph and Mary being in Bethlehem.

LUK	2	6	zr62	figs-activepassive	ἐπλήσθησαν αἱ ἡμέραι τοῦ τεκεῖν αὐτήν	1	the days were fulfilled for her to deliver	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form.

LUK	2	7	qq48	figs-explicit	ἐσπαργάνωσεν αὐτὸν	1	wrapped him in strips of cloth	In some cultures, mothers help their babies feel secure by wrapping them tightly in cloth or in a blanket. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly Alternate translation: “wrapped cloths tightly around him to make him feel secure” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	2	7	s97r	translate-unknown	ἀνέκλινεν αὐτὸν ἐν φάτνῃ	1	laid him in a manger	A **manger** was a box or frame in which people put hay or other food for animals to eat. It was most likely clean, and it may have had something soft and dry like hay in it that would have provided a cushion for the baby. In this culture, animals were often kept near a home to keep them safe and so that their owners could feed them easily. Mary and Joseph stayed in a space that was ordinarily used for animals for those reasons. Alternate translation: “put him in a box that held hay for animals” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	2	7	yj6j	figs-explicit	διότι οὐκ ἦν αὐτοῖς τόπος ἐν τῷ καταλύματι	1	there was no room for them in the inn	There was probably **no room** because so many people had come to Bethlehem to register.

LUK	2	7	l114	translate-unknown	ἐν τῷ καταλύματι	1	in the inn	This term could mean an inn where travelers stayed overnight. However, Luke uses the same term in [22:11](../22/11.md) to refer to a room in a house. So it could also mean “guest room.” Alternate translation: “there was no guest room available for them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	2	8	l115	writing-background	καὶ	1	And	Luke uses this term to introduce background information about some new characters.

LUK	2	10	hnr7	figs-imperative	μὴ φοβεῖσθε	1	Do not be afraid	As in [1:13](../01/13.md), while the angel speaks these words in the form of a command, he is really telling the shepherds something to help and encourage them. Alternate translation: “You do not need to be afraid” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
LUK	2	10	l118	figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ γὰρ	1	for behold	The term **behold** focuses the attention of the listener on what the speaker is about to say. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “Now listen to this” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

LUK	2	11	l119	figs-activepassive	ἐτέχθη ὑμῖν σήμερον Σωτὴρ	1	today has been born for you…a Savior	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “a Savior has been born for you today” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

LUK	2	12	snr9	figs-explicit	ὑμῖν τὸ σημεῖον	1	the sign to you	This could mean one of two things. (1) It could be a sign that would help the shepherds recognize the baby.

LUK	2	13	b54a	figs-metaphor	πλῆθος στρατιᾶς οὐρανίου	1	a multitude of the heavenly army	This phrase could refer to a literal **army** of angels, or it could be speaking figuratively of a large organized group of angels. Alternate translation: “a large group of angels from heaven” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	2	13	e2gp	figs-hendiadys	αἰνούντων τὸν Θεὸν καὶ λεγόντων	1	praising God and saying	Luke is expressing a single idea by using two verbs connected with **and.** The angels said these words in order to praise God.

LUK	2	14	p1fm		δόξα ἐν ὑψίστοις Θεῷ	1	Glory in the highest to God	This could mean one of two things. (1) The angels could be describing where God should receive honor.

Alternate translation: “Give the highest honor to God”

LUK	2	15	s4js	figs-exclusive	διέλθωμεν… ἴδωμεν…ἡμῖν	1	Let us…go… let us see…to us	The shepherds are speaking to one another, so if your language distinguishes between exclusive and inclusive **us**, use the inclusive form here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

LUK	2	40	xr2p	figs-metaphor	χάρις Θεοῦ ἦν ἐπ’ αὐτό	1	the grace of God was upon him	As in [2:25](../02/25.md), **upon** is a spatial metaphor. Alternate translation: “God blessed him in special ways” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

LUK	2	42	f7e7	figs-idiom	ἀναβαινόντων αὐτῶν	1	they went up	Jerusalem was on top of a mountain, so Israelites customarily spoke of going **up** to Jerusalem. Alternate translation: “they traveled” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	2	42	d52y		κατὰ τὸ ἔθος τῆς ἑορτῆς	1	according to the custom of the feast	Alternate translation: “when it was time for the feast”
LUK	2	42	g8aa	figs-explicit	τῆς ἑορτῆς	1	the feast	Implicitly this means the Feast of Passover. It was called a **feast** because it involved eating a ceremonial meal. Alternate translation: “the Feast of Passover” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	2	43	e5en	figs-activepassive	καὶ τελειωσάντων τὰς ἡμέρας	1	when the days were completed	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who did the action.

LUK	2	44	l163	figs-explicit	καὶ ἀνεζήτουν αὐτὸν	1	and they sought him	The implication is that Jesus’ parents looked for him among their friends and relatives once the whole group that was traveling together had stopped for the night. That way they could easily go around among everyone. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “and once the group had stopped for the night, then they looked for him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	2	46	llz4	writing-newevent	καὶ ἐγένετο	1	And it happened that	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
LUK	2	46	yy11	figs-synecdoche	ἐν τῷ ἱερῷ	1	in the temple	Since only priests could enter the **temple** building, this implicitly means the **temple** courtyard. Luke is using the word for the entire building to refer to one part of it. Alternate translation: “in the temple courtyard” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
LUK	2	46	n1tl		ἐν μέσῳ τῶν διδασκάλων	1	in the midst of the teachers	Alternate translation: “among the teachers” or “surrounded by the teachers”

LUK	2	47	pgu4	figs-hendiadys	ἐπὶ τῇ συνέσει καὶ ταῖς ἀποκρίσεσιν αὐτοῦ	1	at his understanding and his answers	Luke may be expressing a single idea by using two words connected with **and.** The term **understanding** may tell what characterized Jesus’ **answers**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the meaning with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “at his wise answers” or “at the understanding with which he answered” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
LUK	2	48	llk9	writing-pronouns	καὶ ἰδόντες αὐτὸν	1	And when they saw him	Alternate translation: “When Mary and Joseph found Jesus there” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
LUK	2	48	f1ry	figs-rquestion	τί ἐποίησας ἡμῖν οὕτως?	1	why have you treated us thus?	Mary is using the question form to rebuke Jesus indirectly for not going back home with them, causing them to worry about him.

LUK	2	49	l165	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	καὶ	1	And	Luke uses this word to draw a contrast between how readers might have expected Jesus to respond in this situation and how he actually responded.

Alternate translation: “But” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
LUK	2	49	r8eh	figs-rquestion	τί ὅτι ἐζητεῖτέ με?	1	Why is it that you were searching for me?	Jesus is making a statement, not really asking a question.

LUK	2	49	va82	figs-rquestion	οὐκ ᾔδειτε ὅτι ἐν τοῖς τοῦ πατρός μου δεῖ εἶναί με?	1	Did you not know that I must be in the things of my Father?	Once again Jesus is making a statement, not really asking a question, but using a question form to challenge his parents respectfully. Alternate translation: “You should have known that I would be involved in my Father’s business” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	2	49	p6aj		ἐν τοῖς τοῦ πατρός μου	1	in the things of my Father	This phrase could mean one of two things. (1) Jesus could be saying that he needed to be involved in the things that God was concerned about.

Alternate translation: “in my Father’s temple” or “here in the temple”
LUK	2	49	n76z	guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	τοῦ πατρός μου	1	my Father	At age 12, Jesus, the Son of God, understood that God was his real Father. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])

LUK	2	51	h2i9	figs-idiom	καὶ κατέβη μετ’ αὐτῶν	1	he went down with them	Jerusalem was on top of a mountain, so Israelites customarily spoke of going **down** when they traveled from Jerusalem to some other place. Alternate translation: “Jesus went back home with Mary and Joseph” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	2	51	zl2q	figs-activepassive	ἦν ὑποτασσόμενος αὐτοῖς	1	he was subjected to them	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “he obeyed them” or “he was obedient to them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	2	51	ceu3	figs-metaphor	διετήρει πάντα τὰ ῥήματα ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ αὐτῆς	1	kept all these things in her heart	As in [2:19](../02/19.md), the **heart** here figuratively represents the thoughts and emotions. Alternate translation: “carefully remembered all these things” or “reflected carefully on what all these things meant” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	2	52	gb25	figs-abstractnouns	Ἰησοῦς προέκοπτεν τῇ σοφίᾳ, καὶ ἡλικίᾳ	1	Jesus was increasing in wisdom and stature	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate the ideas behind the abstract nouns **wisdom** and **stature** with adjectives. These two terms refer to mental and physical growth. Alternate translation: “Jesus steadily became wiser and stronger” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
LUK	2	52	y5qk	figs-abstractnouns	χάριτι παρὰ Θεῷ καὶἀνθρώποις	1	in favor with God and people	If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **favor** with verbs. This phrase refers to spiritual and social growth. Alternate translation: “God blessed him more and more, and people admired him more and more” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
LUK	3	intro	tkg5			0		# Luke 03 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>1. John the Baptist begins preaching and baptizing (3:1–22)<br>2. The list of Jesus’ ancestors (3:23–38)<br><br>Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. ULT does this with the poetry in 3:4–6, which Luke is quoting from the Old Testament about John the Baptist.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Justice<br>John’s instructions to the soldiers and tax collectors in Luke 3:12–15 are things that a person who wanted to live rightly would find reasonable and willingly do. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/justice]] and Luke [3:12-15](./12.md))<br><br>### Genealogy<br>A genealogy is a list that records a person’s ancestors or descendants. Such lists were very important in determining who had the right be king, because the king’s authority was usually passed down or inherited from his father. It was also common for other important people to have a recorded genealogy.<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Metaphor<br><br>Prophecy often involves the use of metaphors to express its meaning. Spiritual discernment is needed for proper interpretation of the prophecy. The prophecy that Luke quotes in 3:4–6 from Isaiah 40:3–5 is an extended metaphor that describes the ministry of John the Baptist. See the individual notes to 3:4–6 for recommendations about how to translate this passage. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### “Herod locked up John in prison”<br>This statement could cause confusion because Luke says that John was imprisoned, and then he implies that John was still able to baptize Jesus. But Luke makes this statement in anticipation of Herod’s imprisonment of John. It describes something that was still in the future at the time of the other events in the narrative. See the first note to 3:19 for a further explanation.
LUK	3	1	l167	writing-newevent	ἐν ἔτει δὲ πεντεκαιδεκάτῳ τῆς ἡγεμονίας Τιβερίου Καίσαρος	1	in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar	This verse and the beginning of the next one are an extended time reference that introduces a new event. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “Everything that the angels and inspired people had said about John and Jesus began to come true during the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
LUK	3	1	l168	translate-ordinal	ἐν ἔτει δὲ πεντεκαιδεκάτῳ	1	in the fifteenth year	If your language does not use ordinal numbers, you can use a cardinal number here. Alternate translation: “in year 15” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
LUK	3	1	l169	writing-participants	Τιβερίου Καίσαρος	1	Tiberius Caesar	As in [2:1](../02/01.md), **Caesar** is the title of the emperor of the Roman Empire. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “King Tiberius, who ruled the Roman Empire” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
LUK	3	1	l170	translate-names	Τιβερίου	1	Tiberius	**Tiberius** is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	3	1	v22w	translate-names	Ποντίου Πειλάτου…Ἡρῴδου…Φιλίππου…Λυσανίου	1	Pontius Pilate…Herod…Philip…Lysanias	These are the names of men. The **Herod** mentioned here is not the same one as in [1:5](../01/05.md). Rather, it is his son. Luke mentions him many further times in this book. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	3	1	uv8h	translate-names	τῆς Ἰουδαίας…τῆς Γαλιλαίας…τῆς Ἰτουραίας καὶ Τραχωνίτιδος…τῆς Ἀβειληνῆς	1	Judea…Galilee…Ituraea and Trachonitis…Abilene	These are names of territories. Like **Galilee**, the name **Judea** occurs many times in this book. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	3	1	l171	translate-unknown	τετραρχοῦντος	1	tetrarch	In the Roman Empire, a **tetrarch** was the governor of one of four divisions of a country or province. If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a general term. Alternate translation: “ruler” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	3	2	d3m8	figs-explicit	ἐπὶ ἀρχιερέως Ἅννα καὶ Καϊάφα	1	during the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas	Usually there would only have been one high priest, but at this point the Romans were appointing the high priests for Judea, and there had been some intrigue surrounding Annas. One Roman official had appointed him some years earlier, but ten years after that, another official deposed him and named his son-in-law Caiaphas high priest instead. However, the Jews still recognized Annas’s claim to the position. It would probably be best to state the matter as simply as possible for your readers. Alternate translation: “while Annas and Caiaphas were both serving as the high priest” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	3	2	dg8p	figs-personification	ἐγένετο ῥῆμα Θεοῦ	1	the word of God came	Luke speaks of God’s message as though it were a living thing that could come to the person whom God wanted to speak it. Alternate translation: “God gave a message” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
LUK	3	2	l172	figs-metonymy	ἐγένετο ῥῆμα Θεοῦ	1	the word of God came	The term **word** figuratively describes the message that God gave John to say by using words. Alternate translation: “God gave a message” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	3	3	l173	grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ	1	And	Luke uses this word to introduce the results of what the previous sentence described. Alternate translation: “As a result” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
LUK	3	3	l174	translate-names	τοῦ Ἰορδάνου	1	the Jordan	This is the name of a river. Alternate translation: “the Jordan River” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	3	3	w2pu	figs-abstractnouns	κηρύσσων βάπτισμα μετανοίας	1	preaching a baptism of repentance	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate the ideas behind the abstract nouns **baptism** and **repentance** with other phrases. Alternate translation: “preaching that people should let him immerse them in the river to show that they wanted to live a new life” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
LUK	3	3	cnm1	figs-abstractnouns	εἰς ἄφεσιν ἁμαρτιῶν	1	for the forgiveness of sins	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate the ideas behind the abstract noun **forgiveness** with a verb such as “forgive.” Alternate translation: “and that they wanted God to forgive their sins” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
LUK	3	4	zf6m	figs-activepassive	ὡς γέγραπται ἐν βίβλῳ λόγων Ἠσαΐου τοῦ προφήτου	1	As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “As the book says that records the sayings of the prophet Isaiah” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	3	4	l175	figs-metonymy	λόγων Ἠσαΐου τοῦ προφήτου	1	the words of Isaiah the prophet	Luke is using the term **words** figuratively to refer to the sayings of Isaiah, which he used words to articulate. Alternate translation: “the sayings of the prophet Isaiah” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	3	4	b86g	figs-quotemarks	φωνὴ βοῶντος ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ	1	A voice of one calling out in the wilderness	From this phrase through to the end of [3:6](../03/06.md), Luke quotes from the book of Isaiah. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by setting off all of this material with quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
LUK	3	4	l176	figs-metonymy	φωνὴ βοῶντος ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ	1	A voice of one calling out in the wilderness	The term **voice** refers figuratively to what this person is saying, by association with the means they are using to say it. Alternate translation: “Someone is calling out in the wilderness and saying” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	3	4	l177	figs-quotesinquotes	ἑτοιμάσατε τὴν ὁδὸν Κυρίου; εὐθείας ποιεῖτε τὰς τρίβους αὐτοῦ	1	Make ready the way of the Lord, make his paths straight	Everything from this phrase through to the end of [3:6](../03/06.md) is a quotation within a quotation. Luke is quoting from the book of Isaiah, and Isaiah is quoting the words of the person calling out in the wilderness. It would be best to indicate that by punctuating this material as a second-level quotation, since Luke is quoting from Scripture. However, if your language does not put one direct quotation within another, you could translate this material as an indirect quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	3	4	rzv1	figs-parallelism	ἑτοιμάσατε τὴν ὁδὸν Κυρίου; εὐθείας ποιεῖτε τὰς τρίβους αὐτοῦ	1	Make ready the way of the Lord, make his paths straight	These two phrases mean similar things. They are both telling people to make a good road for the Lord to travel on. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be helpful to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if the repetition might be confusing, you could connect the phrases with another phrase that would show the relationship between them. Alternate translation: “Prepare a good road for the Lord to travel on, and do this by making sure that it follows a straight path” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
LUK	3	4	h9xl	figs-metaphor	ἑτοιμάσατε τὴν ὁδὸν Κυρίου	1	Make ready the way of the Lord	This is a figurative way of telling people to get ready to listen to the Lord’s message when it comes. They are to do this by giving up their sins. Alternate translation: “Give up your sins so that you will be ready to listen to the Lord’s message when it comes” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	3	5	wk8m	figs-metaphor	πᾶσα φάραγξ πληρωθήσεται, καὶ πᾶν ὄρος καὶ βουνὸς ταπεινωθήσεται	1	Every valley will be filled, and every mountain and hill will be made low	This is a continuation of the figurative description of making a good road that began in the previous verse. When people prepare the road for an important person who is coming, they make sure that the road is level by taking material from high places and using it to fill in low places. However, this is also a description of the effects that the coming of the Lord will have on people. It is a statement similar to the one Mary makes in [1:52](../01/52.md), “He has thrown down rulers from their thrones and he has raised up the lowly.” Metaphors in Scripture can have more than one reference like this. So we recommend that you translate the words directly and not provide a non-figurative explanation, even if your language does not customarily use such figures of speech. If you want to explain the meanings of the metaphor, we recommend that you do that in a footnote rather than in the Bible text. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	3	5	e52x	figs-activepassive	πᾶσα φάραγξ πληρωθήσεται	1	Every valley will be filled	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form. Since people would be doing this action in one sense of the metaphor, but God would be doing the action in another sense of the metaphor, it might be best not to be specific about who will do the action. Alternate translation: “Someone will fill in every valley” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	3	5	s66m	figs-activepassive	καὶ πᾶν ὄρος καὶ βουνὸς ταπεινωθήσεται	1	and every mountain and hill will be made low	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, following the same principle as for the previous phrase. Alternate translation: “and someone will make every mountain and hill low” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	3	5	l178	figs-metaphor	ἔσται τὰ σκολιὰ εἰς εὐθείαν, καὶ αἱ τραχεῖαι εἰς ὁδοὺς λείας	1	the crooked roads will become straight, and the rough roads will become smooth	This too is both a continuation of the figurative description of making a good road and a description of the effects that the coming of the Lord will have on people. Something that is **crooked** becoming **straight** and something that is **rough** becoming **smooth** can be seen as metaphors for repentance and a change in a person’s way of life. And so we recommend once again that you translate the words directly and not provide a non-figurative explanation in the text of your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	3	6	l179	figs-metonymy	πᾶσα σὰρξ	1	all flesh	Luke is describing people figuratively by reference to something associated with them, the flesh they are made of. Alternate translation: “all people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	3	6	l180	figs-metaphor	ὄψεται	1	will see	The term **see** is a figurative way of referring to recognition and understanding. Alternate translation: “will recognize” or “will understand” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	3	6	du1b	figs-abstractnouns	ὄψεται…τὸ σωτήριον τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	will see the salvation of God	If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **salvation** with a verb such as “save.” Alternate translation: “will understand how God saves people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
LUK	3	6	l181	figs-quotesinquotes	τὸ σωτήριον τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	the salvation of God	After this phrase, Isaiah ends his quotation from the person who is calling out in the wilderness. If you decided in [3:4](../03/04.md) to mark these words as a second-level quotation, indicate the end of that quotation here with whatever convention your language uses. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	3	6	l182	figs-quotemarks	τὸ σωτήριον τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	the salvation of God	After this phrase, Luke also ends his quotation from the book of Isaiah. If you decided in [3:4](../03/04.md) to mark this as a first-level quotation, indicate that ending here with whatever punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the end of a first-level quotation. See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
LUK	3	7	sxn9	figs-activepassive	βαπτισθῆναι ὑπ’ αὐτοῦ	1	to be baptized by him	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “for him to baptize them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	3	7	b724	figs-idiom	γεννήματα ἐχιδνῶν	1	Offspring of vipers	The expression **offspring of** is an idiom that means a person shares the qualities of something. John is using dangerous poisonous snakes to represent evil. Alternate translation: “You evil people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	3	7	l183	translate-unknown	γεννήματα ἐχιδνῶν	1	Offspring of vipers	If your readers would not recognize the name **vipers**, which refers to dangerous poisonous snakes, you could say something more general. Alternate translation: “You are evil, like poisonous snakes” or “You are evil, like poisonous animals” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	3	7	mcq5	figs-rquestion	τίς ὑπέδειξεν ὑμῖν φυγεῖν ἀπὸ τῆς μελλούσης ὀργῆς?	1	Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?	John is making a statement, not asking a question. He does not expect the people in the crowds to tell him who warned them. Instead, he is using the question form to challenge the people to think about what they believe baptism will do for them. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or exclamation. Alternate translation: “You cannot escape from God’s wrath just by being baptized!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	3	7	g7tw	figs-metonymy	ἀπὸ τῆς μελλούσης ὀργῆς	1	the coming wrath	John is using the word **wrath** to refer figuratively to God’s punishment, because the punishment is an expression of God’s wrath or displeasure over sin. Alternate translation: “from the punishment that God is sending” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	3	8	pz16	figs-metaphor	ποιήσατε…καρποὺς ἀξίους τῆς μετανοίας	1	produce fruits worthy of repentance	John is figuratively comparing a person’s behavior to fruit. Just as a plant is expected to produce fruit that is appropriate for that kind of plant, a person who says that he has repented is expected to live righteously. Alternate translation: “do the good things that will show that you have stopped sinning” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	3	8	l184	figs-abstractnouns	ἀξίους τῆς μετανοίας	1	worthy of repentance	If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **repentance** with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “that will show that you have stopped sinning” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
LUK	3	8	l185	figs-quotesinquotes	μὴ ἄρξησθε λέγειν ἐνἑαυτοῖς, πατέρα ἔχομεν τὸν Ἀβραάμ	1	do not begin to say within yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father’	**We have Abraham as our father** is a quotation within a quotation. Luke is quoting John’s words to the crowd, and John is quoting something that the crowds might wrongly think. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “do not try to reassure yourselves with the thought that Abraham is your father” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	3	8	l186	figs-metaphor	πατέρα ἔχομεν τὸν Ἀβραάμ	1	We have Abraham as our father	**Father** here figuratively means “ancestor.” Alternate translation: “Abraham is our ancestor” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	3	8	l187	figs-exclusive	πατέρα ἔχομεν τὸν Ἀβραάμ	1	We have Abraham as our father	John is suggesting something the people might say about themselves, as opposed to others, so if your language distinguishes between exclusive and inclusive “we” and “us,” use the exclusive form here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
LUK	3	8	l188	figs-metaphor	πατέρα ἔχομεν τὸν Ἀβραάμ	1	We have Abraham as our father	The word **father** here figuratively means “ancestor.” Alternate translation: “Abraham is our ancestor” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	3	8	pft3	figs-explicit	πατέρα ἔχομεν τὸν Ἀβραάμ	1	We have Abraham as our father	If it would be unclear to your readers why they would say this, you may also add the implied information: Alternate translation: “Abraham is our ancestor, so God would not punish us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	3	8	gbp2	figs-metaphor	δύναται ὁ Θεὸς ἐγεῖραι τέκνα τῷ Ἀβραάμ ἐκ τῶν λίθων τούτων	1	God is able to raise up children for Abraham from these stones	The expression **raise up** is a spatial metaphor. It envisions that if God did turn the stones into people who were descendants of Abraham, then the people would be standing up in front of everyone, no longer lying in the riverbed as the stones were. Alternate translation: “God is able create descendants for Abraham out of these stones” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	3	8	l189	figs-metaphor	τέκνα τῷ Ἀβραάμ	1	children for Abraham	The word **children** here figuratively means “descendants.” Alternate translation: “descendants for Abraham” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

LUK	3	9	r5pa	figs-activepassive	ἡ ἀξίνη πρὸς τὴν ῥίζαν τῶν δένδρων κεῖται	1	the ax is already set against the root of the trees	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “the person who is going to cut down the tree has already placed his ax against the roots” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	3	9	l190	figs-metaphor	ἡ ἀξίνη πρὸς τὴν ῥίζαν τῶν δένδρων κεῖται	1	the ax is already set against the root of the trees	This is a figurative way of saying that punishment is just about to begin. Alternate translation: “God is even now getting his punishment ready” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	3	9	l8it	figs-activepassive	πᾶν…δένδρον μὴ ποιοῦν καρπὸν καλὸν ἐκκόπτεται καὶ εἰς πῦρ βάλλεται	1	every tree that does not produce good fruit is chopped down and thrown into the fire	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with active forms. Alternate translation: “this person will chop down every tree that does not produce good fruit and throw it into the fire” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	3	9	l191	figs-metaphor	πᾶν…δένδρον μὴ ποιοῦν καρπὸν καλὸν ἐκκόπτεται καὶ εἰς πῦρ βάλλεται	1	every tree that does not produce good fruit is chopped down and thrown into the fire	This is a figurative way of describing punishment. Alternate translation: “God will certainly punish every person who does not do what is right” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	3	10	ak6i	figs-quotemarks	ἐπηρώτων αὐτὸν…λέγοντες	1	kept asking him, saying	Luke uses the word **saying** to introduce his quotation of what the crowds were asking John. Here and throughout the book, if you indicate the quotation in some other way, such as with quotation marks or with some other punctuation or convention that your language uses, you do not need to represent this word in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
LUK	3	11	g3ip	figs-hendiadys	ἀποκριθεὶς δὲ ἔλεγεν αὐτοῖς	1	So answering he said to them	Together the words **answering** and **said** mean that John responded to the question that the crowds asked. Alternate translation: “So he responded to them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
LUK	3	11	vuk3	figs-explicit	ὁ ἔχων βρώματα, ὁμοίως ποιείτω	1	let him do the same	The implication is that anyone who has extra food should share it, just as a person with an extra tunic should share that. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “if anyone has extra food, he should share that as well” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	3	12	pp3s	figs-activepassive	ἦλθον…βαπτισθῆναι	1	came to be baptized	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who did the action. Alternate translation: “came because they wanted John to baptize them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	3	12	l192		Διδάσκαλε	1	Teacher	This is a respectful title. You can translate it with an equivalent term that your language and culture would use,
LUK	3	13	v9ls	figs-explicit	μηδὲν πλέον…πράσσετε	1	Collect nothing more	The implication is that tax collectors had been demanding more money than they should have been collecting. John tells them to stop doing that. Alternate translation: “Do not demand extra money” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	3	13	m136	figs-activepassive	παρὰ τὸ διατεταγμένον ὑμῖν	1	than what you have been ordered	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who did the action. Alternate translation: “beyond what the Romans have authorized you to collect” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	3	14	w2d8	figs-exclusive	τί ποιήσωμεν καὶ ἡμεῖς?	1	And us, what should we do?	The soliders are speaking about themselves, as opposed to others, so if your language distinguishes between exclusive and inclusive **we** and “us,” use the exclusive form here. You could make this two sentences. Alternate translation: “How about us soldiers? What must we do?” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
LUK	3	14	l3mz	figs-explicit	μηδὲ συκοφαντήσητε	1	do not accuse falsely	The implication is that soldiers were making false charges against people in order to extort money from them.

LUK	3	14	bvy5	figs-activepassive	καὶ ἀρκεῖσθε τοῖς ὀψωνίοις ὑμῶν	1	and be contented with your wages	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “instead, let the amount you are paid satisfy you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	3	14	l193	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	καὶ	3	and	This word introduces draws a contrast between what the soldiers had been doing and what they should have been doing. Alternate translation: “instead” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
LUK	3	15	pgp3	grammar-connect-time-background	προσδοκῶντος δὲ τοῦ λαοῦ	1	And the people were expecting	Luke is providing this background information to help readers understand what happens next. You can introduce his statement with a word that will indicate this. Alternate translation: “Now the people were expecting” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background]])
LUK	3	15	l194	figs-explicit	προσδοκῶντος δὲ τοῦ λαοῦ	1	And the people were expecting	The implication is that the people were expecting the Messiah. If it would be clearer in your language, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “Now the people were expecting the Messiah” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	3	15	czb7	figs-metaphor	διαλογιζομένων…ἐν ταῖς καρδίαις αὐτῶν	1	wondering in their hearts	Luke uses the term **hearts** figuratively here to represent the people’s minds. Alternate translation: “wondering in their minds” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	3	16	fn1u	figs-explicit	ἀπεκρίνατο λέγων πᾶσιν ὁ Ἰωάννης	1	John answered, saying to them all	John’s statement clearly implies that John himself is not the Messiah. It may be helpful to state this explicitly for your readers. Alternate translation: “John clarified that he was not the Messiah by saying to them all” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	3	16	l195	figs-hendiadys	ἀπεκρίνατο λέγων…ὁ Ἰωάννης	1	John answered, saying	Together the words **answered** and **saying** mean that John responded to what the people were wondering about him. Alternate translation: “John responded” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
LUK	3	16	wj3h		ἐγὼ…ὕδατι βαπτίζω ὑμᾶς	1	I…baptize you with water	Alternate translation: “I…baptize you using water” or “I…baptize you by means of water”
LUK	3	16	k3hg	figs-explicit	οὐκ εἰμὶ ἱκανὸς λῦσαι τὸν ἱμάντα τῶν ὑποδημάτων αὐτοῦ	1	I am not worthy to untie the strap of his sandals	Untying the straps of sandals was a duty of a slave. John is saying implicitly that the one who is coming will be so great that he is not even worthy to be his slave. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “I am not even worthy to be his slave” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	3	16	jjp1	figs-metaphor	αὐτὸς ὑμᾶς βαπτίσει ἐν Πνεύματι Ἁγίῳ, καὶ πυρί	1	He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire	John is using literal baptism, which puts a person under water, to speak figuratively of spiritual baptism, which puts people under the influence of the Holy Spirit, who purifies them. Alternate translation: “He will put you under the influence of the Holy Spirit, who will purify you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	3	16	c1an	figs-metaphor	αὐτὸς ὑμᾶς βαπτίσει…πυρί	1	He will baptize you…with fire	The word **fire** is intended figuratively, and it suggests a fuller metaphor. Jesus will not immerse people in actual fire. Be sure that this is clear to your readers. Alternate translation: “He will baptize you…to purify you, as precious metals are purified in fire” or “He will baptize you…to clear away your sins, as fire clears away underbrush” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	3	17	jzm4	figs-metaphor	οὗ τὸ πτύον ἐν τῇ χειρὶ αὐτοῦ	1	whose winnowing fork is in his hand	John is saying figuratively that the Messiah will come prepared to judge people right away. You could express this metaphor as a simile in your translation. Alternate translation: “He will already be prepared to judge people, just like a farmer who is ready to thresh grain” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	3	17	l196	figs-idiom	οὗ τὸ πτύον ἐν τῇ χειρὶ αὐτοῦ	1	whose winnowing fork is in his hand	The phrase **in his hand** is an idiom that means he has the tool all ready to use. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here in your translation. Alternate translation: “He has his winnowing fork ready to use” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	3	17	b1ap	translate-unknown	πτύον	1	winnowing fork	This is a tool for tossing wheat into the air to separate the wheat grain from the chaff. The heavier grain falls back down, and the wind blows away the unwanted chaff. This tool is similar to a pitchfork. If you have a similar tool in your culture, you can use the word for it here. Otherwise, you can use a phrase that would express the meaning. Alternate translation: “tool for threshing grain” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	3	17	gf8n	translate-unknown	διακαθᾶραι τὴν ἅλωνα αὐτοῦ	1	to thoroughly clear off his threshing floor	The threshing floor was the place where wheat was stacked in preparation for threshing.

LUK	3	17	gt3q	figs-exmetaphor	συναγαγεῖν τὸν σῖτον εἰς τὴν ἀποθήκην αὐτοῦ	1	to gather the wheat into his storehouse	John continues to speak figuratively to describe how the coming Messiah will judge people. The wheat is the part of the crop that is useful. It represents people who are obedient to God, who will be welcomed into his presence. You could express this metaphor as a simile in your translation. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “He will welcome those who are obedient to God, just as a farmer stores good grain in his barn” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])
LUK	3	17	ky8j	figs-exmetaphor	τὸ δὲ ἄχυρον κατακαύσει πυρὶἀσβέστῳ	1	but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire	John continues to speak figuratively to describe how the coming Messiah will judge people. The chaff is the husk that surrounds the grain. It is not useful for anything, so people burn it up. You could express this metaphor as a simile in your translation. Alternate translation: “but he will punish those who are disobedient to God, just as a farmer burns up the useless chaff” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])
LUK	3	18	tyj9		πολλὰ…καὶ ἕτερα παρακαλῶν	1	also exhorting many other things	Alternate translation: “saying many other things to warn them”
LUK	3	19	l197	writing-background	δὲ	1	But	Luke uses this term to introduce some background information to the story. In this verse and the next one, he tells what later happened to John. This had not yet happened at this time. When Luke says in [3:21](../03/21.md) that Jesus was baptized, he means that John was still there and that John baptized Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
LUK	3	19	jj3q	translate-unknown	ὁ…Ἡρῴδης ὁ τετράρχης	1	Herod the tetrarch	See how you translated the term **tetrarch** in [3:1](../03/01.md) Alternate translation: “Herod, who ruled the region of Galilee” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

Alternate translation: “because John had rebuked him for marrying Herodias, his brother’s former wife” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	3	19	cu4v	figs-explicit	ἐλεγχόμενος ὑπ’ αὐτοῦ περὶ Ἡρῳδιάδος, τῆς γυναικὸς τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ αὐτοῦ	1	having been rebuked by him concerning Herodias, the wife of his brother	The implication is that Herod’s brother was still alive. That made this marriage a violation of the law of Moses. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “because John had rebuked him for marrying Herodias, his brother’s former wife, while his brother was still alive, which the law of Moses forbade” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	3	20	p2xw	figs-synecdoche	κατέκλεισεν τὸν Ἰωάννην ἐν φυλακῇ	1	he locked John up in prison	Herod did not do this by himself, Rather, as a ruler, he probably ordered his soldiers to lock John up. Luke is speaking figuratively of Herod, one person who was involved in this action, to mean everyone who was involved. Alternate translation: “he had his soldiers lock John up in prison” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
LUK	3	21	l199	figs-events	ἐγένετο δὲ	1	and it happened that	The previous verse says that Herod put John in prison. It might be helpful to make it clear that the account that starts in this verse happened before John was arrested. UST does that by starting this verse with, “But before John was put in prison.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-events]])
LUK	3	21	phe6	writing-newevent	ἐγένετο δὲ	1	and it happened that	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
LUK	3	21	r2x1	figs-activepassive	βαπτισθῆναι ἅπαντα τὸν λαὸν	1	when all the people were being baptized	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who did the action. Alternate translation: “While John was baptizing all the people who came to him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	3	21	l200	figs-hyperbole	ἅπαντα τὸν λαὸν	1	all the people	The phrase **all the people** is a generalization for emphasis. Alternate translation: “all the people who came to him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

LUK	3	21	i5zg	figs-activepassive	ἀνεῳχθῆναι τὸν οὐρανὸν	1	the heavens were opened	You could say this with an active form. This was more than a simple clearing of the clouds, but it is not clear exactly what the expression means, so it may be best not to try to specify what happened too exactly. Alternate translation: “the sky opened up” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	3	22	q2yh	figs-personification	φωνὴν ἐξ οὐρανοῦ γενέσθαι	1	a voice came from heaven	Luke speaks figuratively of this **voice** as if it were a living thing that could come from heaven to earth. Alternate translation: “God spoke from heaven and said” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
LUK	3	22	h7tn	guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	ὁ Υἱός μου	1	my…Son	This is an important title for Jesus, the Son of God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
LUK	3	23	uvm3	writing-background	καὶ	1	And	Luke uses this word to introduce background information about Jesus’ age and ancestors. Alternate translation: “Now” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
LUK	3	23	d3sh	figs-idiom	αὐτὸς ἦν Ἰησοῦς ἀρχόμενος ὡσεὶ ἐτῶν τριάκοντα	1	Jesus himself was beginning about 30 years old	This is an idiomatic expression, and it could mean one of two things. (1) The word **beginning** could be a reference to Jesus starting his own ministry. UST follows this interpretation. Alternate translation: “Jesus himself was about thirty years old when he began his ministry” (2) Luke could also be saying that Jesus had just turned 30 was when he was baptized. Alternate translation: “Jesus himself was just thirty years old at this time” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	3	23	z2xa	figs-activepassive	ὢν υἱός, ὡς ἐνομίζετο, Ἰωσὴφ	1	He was the son (as it was assumed) of Joseph	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who did the action. Alternate translation: “People assumed that he was the son of Joseph” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

Consider how people normally list ancestors in your language. Use the same wording throughout the whole list. Possible formats are (1) “He was the son…of Joseph, the son of Heli, the son of Matthat, the son of Levi, the son of Melchi, the son of Jannai, the son of Joseph” or (2) “He was the son…of Joseph. Joseph was the son of Heli. Heli was the son of Matthat. Matthat was the son of Levi. Levi was the son of Melchi. Melchi was the son of Jannai. Jannai was the son of Joseph” or (3) “His father…was Joseph. Joseph’s father was Heli. Heli’s father was Matthat. Matthat’s father was Levi. Levi’s father was Melchi. Melchi’s father was Jannai.

LUK	4	1	n1xx	writing-newevent	Ἰησοῦς δὲ	1	Then Jesus	Luke uses this expression to return to the story after providing background information about Jesus’ ancestors. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could include a phrase that would provide continuity with the previous episode in the story. Alternate translation: “After John had baptized Jesus, then Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
LUK	4	1	l201	translate-names	τοῦ Ἰορδάνου	1	the Jordan	This is the name of a river. Alternate translation: “the Jordan River” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

LUK	4	2	bls8	figs-verbs	ἡμέρας τεσσεράκοντα πειραζόμενος ὑπὸ τοῦ διαβόλου	1	for 40 days being tempted by the devil	The Greek verb indicates that the temptation continued throughout the forty days. You can make this clear in your translation, as UST does: “While he was there, the devil kept tempting him for 40 days” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-verbs]])
LUK	4	2	hg5p	figs-activepassive	πειραζόμενος ὑπὸ τοῦ διαβόλου	1	being tempted by the devil	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “the devil kept tempting him” or “the devil kept trying to persuade him disobey God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	4	2	k47d	writing-pronouns	καὶ οὐκ ἔφαγεν οὐδὲν	1	he did not eat anything	Make sure that it is clear in your translation that the word **he** refers to Jesus, not to the devil. Alternate translation: “Jesus did not eat anything” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
LUK	4	3	bg52	figs-explicit	εἶπεν…ὁ διάβολος	1	the devil said	The devil either holds a stone in his hand or points to a nearby stone. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “The devil picked up a stone and said” or “The devil pointed to a stone and said” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	4	3	l202	grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical	εἰ Υἱὸς εἶ τοῦ Θεοῦ, εἰπὲ τῷ λίθῳ τούτῳ, ἵνα γένηται ἄρτος	1	If you are the Son of God, speak to this stone so that it might become bread	The devil is suggesting that this is a hypothetical condition, that the **stone** will only become **bread** if Jesus is the **Son of God**. The devil is speaking as if it is uncertain who Jesus is in order to challenge him to do this miracle to prove that he really is the **Son of God**. Alternate translation: “Prove that you are the Son of God by commanding this stone to become bread” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical]])
LUK	4	3	y7yf	guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	Υἱὸς…τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	the Son of God	This is an important title for Jesus. Even the devil knew its significance. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
LUK	4	4	l203	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	καὶ	1	And	This word introduces a contrast between the devil wanting Jesus to turn the stone into bread and Jesus refusing to do that. Alternate translation: “But” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
LUK	4	4	kde3	figs-explicit	ἀπεκρίθη πρὸς αὐτὸν ὁ Ἰησοῦς, γέγραπται	1	Jesus to answered him, “It is written”	Jesus clearly implies in his answer that he is rejecting the devil’s challenge.

Alternate translation: “Jesus replied, ‘No, I will not do that, because it is written’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	4	4	l204	figs-quotesinquotes	γέγραπται, ὅτι οὐκ ἐπ’ ἄρτῳ μόνῳ ζήσεται ὁ ἄνθρωπος	1	It is written, ‘Man will not live on bread alone’	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation.

LUK	4	4	hr5a	figs-activepassive	γέγραπται	1	It is written	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say what is doing the action. Alternate translation: “The Scriptures say” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	4	4	ek2z	figs-synecdoche	οὐκ ἐπ’ ἄρτῳ μόνῳ ζήσεται ὁ ἄνθρωπος	1	Man will not live on bread alone	The word **bread** refers to food in general. Jesus quotes this scripture to explain why he will not turn the stone into bread. It means that food by itself, without God, is not enough to sustain a person in life. Alternate translation: “It is not just having food that makes a person truly alive” or “God says there are more important things than food” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
LUK	4	4	l205	figs-gendernotations	ὁ ἄνθρωπος	1	Man	**Man** has a generic sense here that refers to all people. Alternate translation: “People” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])

LUK	4	5	jxi9	figs-explicitinfo	ἐν στιγμῇ χρόνου	1	in an instant of time	In your language, it might seem that the phrase **an instant of time** expresses unnecessary extra information. If so, you can abbreviate it. Alternate translation: “in an instant” or “in a short time” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo]])
LUK	4	6	l206	figs-activepassive	ἐμοὶ παραδέδοται	1	it has been handed over to me	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who did the action. Alternate translation: “God has given me authority over all these kingdoms” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	4	6	dcx6	figs-explicit	ἐμοὶ παραδέδοται	1	it has been handed over to me	The word **it** likely refers back to the singular antecedent **all this authority**, that is, the authority over these kingdoms. So the word you use to translate **it** should agree with **authority** in gender and number and in any other distinctions that your language marks. Alternate translation: “God has given me authority over all these kingdoms” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	4	7	g7h9	figs-explicit	ἐὰν προσκυνήσῃς ἐνώπιον ἐμοῦ	1	if you will bow in worship before me	The implication is that the devil wants visible, direct worship that will be an official act of submission.

LUK	4	7	l207	figs-metaphor	ἐνώπιον	1	before	The term **before** here means “in front of.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	4	7	uca7		ἔσται σοῦ πᾶσα	1	it will all be yours	Alternate translation: “I will give you all of these kingdoms”
LUK	4	8	v8ca	figs-hendiadys	ἀποκριθεὶς ὁ Ἰησοῦς εἶπεν αὐτῷ	1	answering, Jesus said to him	Together the words **answering** and **said** mean that Jesus responded to the offer that the devil made. Alternate translation: “Jesus responded to him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
LUK	4	8	l208	figs-quotesinquotes	γέγραπται, Κύριον τὸν Θεόν σου προσκυνήσεις καὶ αὐτῷ μόνῳ λατρεύσεις	1	It is written, ‘You will worship the Lord your God, and you will serve only him.’	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “It is written that one must worship the Lord his God and serve only him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	4	8	m4tc	figs-explicit	γέγραπται	1	It is written	Jesus clearly implies in his answer that he is rejecting the devil’s challenge.

Alternate translation: “You must worship the Lord your God, and you must serve only him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative]])
LUK	4	8	q8ni	figs-youcrowd	προσκυνήσεις	1	You will worship	It may not be clear here whether to use the singular or plural form of **you** because this is a short quotation from the Scriptures and the context is not given. The word is actually singular because, even though Moses said this to the Israelites as a group, each individual person was supposed to obey this command. So in your translation, use the singular form of **you** if your language marks that distinction. In general these notes will not discuss whether **you** is singular or plural when this should be clear from the context. But they will address ambiguous cases such as this one. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd]])
LUK	4	9	j8r6	translate-unknown	τὸ πτερύγιον	1	the highest point	This term refers to the tip or extremity of something. If you have a similar term in your language, you could use it here. Alternate translation: “the apex” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

The devil is speaking as if it is uncertain who Jesus is in order to challenge him to do this miracle to prove that he really is the **Son of God**. Alternate translation: “Prove that you are the Son of God by jumping safely from this great height” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical]])
LUK	4	9	j9nx	guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	Υἱὸς…τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	the Son of God	This is an important title for Jesus. Even the devil knew its significance. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
LUK	4	9	i81s	figs-explicit	βάλε σεαυτὸν ἐντεῦθεν κάτω	1	throw yourself down from here	The exact location of the part of the temple that Luke describes is uncertain. However, the implication is that it was one of the places on the temple roof from which people would fall several hundred feet into the Kidron Valley if they jumped or slipped off. Make sure it is clear in your translation that this would ordinarily have been a deadly fall. Alternate translation: “jump from this great height” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	4	10	l209	figs-quotesinquotes	γέγραπται γὰρ, ὅτι τοῖς ἀγγέλοις αὐτοῦ ἐντελεῖται περὶ σοῦ, τοῦ διαφυλάξαι σε	1	For it is written, ‘He will give orders to his angels regarding you, to protect you’	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation.

LUK	4	10	f5dn	figs-explicit	γέγραπται γὰρ	1	For it is written	The devil implies that his quote from the Psalms means that if Jesus really is the Son of God, he will not be hurt if he jumps from this great height. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly, as UST does. Alternate translation: “You will not be hurt, because it is written” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	4	10	s2g4	figs-activepassive	γέγραπται	1	it is written	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say what is doing the action. Alternate translation: “the Scriptures say” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

LUK	4	11	l211	figs-synecdoche	μήποτε προσκόψῃς πρὸς λίθον τὸν πόδα σου	1	lest you strike your foot against a stone	The Scriptures are figuratively using one way of being hurt to mean all ways of being hurt. Alternate translation: “so that you will not get hurt” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

LUK	4	12	l213	figs-quotesinquotes	εἴρηται, οὐκ ἐκπειράσεις Κύριον τὸν Θεόν σου	1	It is said, ‘You will not put the Lord your God to the test.’	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “It is said that one must not put the Lord his God to the test” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])

LUK	4	13	nc2c	figs-explicit	συντελέσας πάντα πειρασμὸν	1	when he had finished every temptation	This does not imply that the devil was successful in his temptation. Jesus resisted every attempt. This can be stated clearly. Alternate translation: “after the devil had repeatedly failed to persuade Jesus to sin” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	4	13	qqd7	figs-explicit	ἄχρι καιροῦ	1	until an opportune time	New Testament Greek had two words for time. The first referred to chronological time, that is, the passage of time. The second word referred to the right time to do something. ULT is using the phrase **an opportune time** to translate that second word. If your language makes this same distinction, use the corresponding word in your own translation. Alternate translation: “until the time was right to try again” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	4	14	yfc3	writing-newevent	καὶ	1	And	Luke uses this word to introduce a new event in the story. Alternate translation: “Then” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])

LUK	4	14	dhj7	figs-personification	φήμη ἐξῆλθεν…περὶ αὐτοῦ	1	news about him went out	Luke speaks figuratively of this **news** as if it were something that could **go out** actively by itself.

LUK	4	14	hah9		καθ’ ὅλης τῆς περιχώρου	1	throughout the entire surrounding region	Alternate translation: “everywhere around Galilee”

LUK	4	17	i9hn	figs-activepassive	ἐπεδόθη αὐτῷ βιβλίον τοῦ προφήτου Ἠσαΐου	1	the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who did the action. Alternate translation: “someone brought him the scroll of the prophet Isaiah” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	4	17	l216	figs-explicit	ἐπεδόθη αὐτῷ βιβλίον τοῦ προφήτου Ἠσαΐου	1	the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him	Since Jesus looked for a specific passage in the scroll, and since he said that it was being fulfilled right at that time, it is likely that Jesus requested this particular scroll. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “at his request, someone brought him the scroll of the prophet Isaiah” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	4	17	x52a	translate-unknown	βιβλίον τοῦ προφήτου Ἠσαΐου	1	the scroll of the prophet Isaiah	This refers to a **scroll**, a long, wide roll of special paper, on which someone had written the words that **Isaiah** had spoken many years before.

LUK	4	18	q96y	figs-metaphor	ἔχρισέν με	1	he has anointed me	In the Old Testament, ceremonial oil was poured on a person when they were given the authority to assume an office or do a special task.

Alternate translation: “he has appointed me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	4	18	l6ac	figs-nominaladj	πτωχοῖς… τυφλοῖς	1	the poor…the blind	Luke is using the adjectives **poor** and **blind** as nouns, to refer to groups of people.

LUK	4	19	z262	figs-idiom	κηρύξαι ἐνιαυτὸν Κυρίου δεκτόν	1	to proclaim the favorable year of the Lord	Luke is using the term **year** figuratively to refer a particular time.

LUK	4	20	sm11	figs-explicit	πτύξας τὸ βιβλίον	1	rolling up the scroll	A scroll was closed by rolling it like a tube to protect the writing inside it. Alternate translation: “closing the scroll by rolling it up” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

LUK	5	intro	axr7			0		# Luke 05 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>1. Jesus calls Peter and his fellow fishermen to be his disciples (5:1–11)<br>2. Jesus travels to various towns teaching and healing (5:12–26)<br>3. Jesus calls Levi to be his disciple (5:27–32)<br>4. Jesus teaches about fasting (5:33–39)<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### “You will catch men”<br><br>Peter, James, and John were fishermen. When Jesus told them that they would catch men, he was using a metaphor to tell them he wanted them to help people believe the good news about him. See the last note to 5:10. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/disciple]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])<br><br>### Sinners<br><br>When the people of Jesus’ time spoke of “sinners,” they were talking about people who did not obey the law of Moses. But when Jesus said that he came to call “sinners,” he meant that only people who understand that they are sinners who have disobeyed God can be his followers. This is true even if they are not what most people think of as “sinners.” (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])<br><br>### Fasting and Feasting<br><br>People would fast, or not eat food for a long time, when they were sad or in order to show God that they were sorry for their sins. When they were happy, such as during weddings, they would have feasts, or meals where they would eat much food. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/fast]])<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Healthy and sick people<br><br>To correct the Pharisees, Jesus speaks of healthy people who do not need a doctor. This does not mean that there are people who do not need Jesus. Rather, Jesus was explaining why he spent time with people whom the Pharisees considered to be “sinners.” See the notes to 5:31–32. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Implicit information<br><br>In several parts of this chapter, as in other places in the book, Luke does not explain information that his original readers would already have understood. Modern readers might not know some of those things, so they might have trouble understanding all that Luke is communicating. The alternate translations in these notes and the readings in UST often illustrate how that information can be presented so that modern readers will be able to understand these passages. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])<br><br>### Past Events<br><br>Parts of this chapter are sequences of events that have already happened. In a given passage, Luke sometimes writes as if the events have already happened while other events are still in progress (even though they are complete at the time he writes). This can cause difficulty in translation by creating an illogical order of events. It may be necessary to make these consistent by writing as if all the events have already happened.
LUK	5	1	zc8q	writing-newevent	ἐγένετο δὲ	1	And it happened that	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
LUK	5	1	wsf8	figs-metonymy	ἀκούειν τὸν λόγον τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	the word of God	Luke uses the term **word** figuratively here to describe the things that Jesus said by using words. Alternate translation: “the message Jesus was bringing from God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	5	1	p6im	translate-names	τὴν λίμνην Γεννησαρέτ	1	the lake of Gennesaret	This is another name for the body of water also known as the Sea of Galilee. Galilee was on the west side of this lake, and the land of Gennesaret was on the east side, so it was called by both names. Some English versions translate this as the proper name of the body of water. Alternate translation: “Lake Gennesaret” or “the Sea of Galilee” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	5	2	t96r	figs-explicit	ἔπλυνον τὰ δίκτυα	1	were washing their nets	The implication is that they were cleaning their fishing nets to maintain them so that they could keep using them to catch fish. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “were washing their nets to keep them clean and in good working order” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	5	3	f7z8		ὃ ἦν Σίμωνος	1	which was Simon’s	Alternate translation: “the one that belonged to Simon”
LUK	5	3	liq1		ἠρώτησεν αὐτὸν ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς ἐπαναγαγεῖν ὀλίγον	1	asked him to put out a little from the land	Alternate translation: “asked Simon to move the boat away from the shore”
LUK	5	3	rc1z	figs-explicit	καθίσας	1	he sat down	As in [4:20](../04/20.md), sitting was the customary position for teaching in this culture. Alternate translation: “he sat down, as teachers did” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	5	3	vbx7		ἐδίδασκεν ἐκ τοῦ πλοίου τοὺς ὄχλους	1	was teaching the crowds from the boat	Jesus was in the boat a short distance from the shore and he was speaking to the people who were on the shore. Alternate translation: “was teaching the people while he sat in the boat”
LUK	5	4	rk9p	figs-explicit	ὡς δὲ ἐπαύσατο λαλῶν	1	when he stopped speaking	The implication is that Jesus had been **speaking** in order to teach the people.

LUK	5	5	l245	figs-hendiadys	ἀποκριθεὶς Σίμων εἶπεν	1	answering Simon said	Together the words **answering** and **said** mean that Simon responded to Jesus’ instructions to take the boat out and let down the nets. Alternate translation: “Simon responded” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
LUK	5	5	wbb1	figs-metonymy	ἐπὶ δὲ τῷ ῥήματί σου	1	at your word	Peter uses the term **word** figuratively here to refer to what Jesus commanded him by using words. Alternate translation: “because you have told me to do this” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	5	7	n2fp		κατένευσαν	1	they signaled to	The Greek text does not specify how they **signaled**, but since they were some distance from the shore, it may have been by waving their arms rather than by calling out. You can use a general expression here. Alternate translation: “they summoned”
LUK	5	7	pr7m	figs-explicit	βυθίζεσθαι αὐτά	1	they began to sink	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state the reason for this explicitly. Alternate translation: “they began to sink because the fish were so heavy” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	5	8	r8j9	translate-symaction	προσέπεσεν τοῖς γόνασιν Ἰησοῦ	1	he fell down at the knees of Jesus	Be sure that it is clear in your translation that Peter did not fall down accidentally. Rather, bowing or lying down in front of Jesus was a sign of humility and respect. Alternate translation: “bowed down in front of Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
LUK	5	8	j67m	figs-gendernotations	ἀνὴρ ἁμαρτωλός	1	a sinful man	The word **man** here means “adult male,” not the more general “human being.” So Peter is not saying generally, “I am a sinful person.” He really does mean, “I personally am a sinful man.” Be sure that that is clear in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
LUK	5	9	l246	figs-personification	θάμβος…περιέσχεν αὐτὸν	1	amazement had seized him	Luke describes Peter’s **amazement** figuratively as if it were something that could actively take hold of him.

LUK	5	10	k4ft	writing-participants	κοινωνοὶ τῷ Σίμωνι	1	partners with Simon	Luke provides this information to introduce these new participants in the story. Alternate translation: “who were Simon’s partners in the fishing business” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
LUK	5	10	u6zs	figs-metaphor	ἀνθρώπους ἔσῃ ζωγρῶν	1	you will be catching men	Jesus is using the image of catching fish figuratively to describe gathering people to follow him. Alternate translation: “you will gather people for me” or “you will persuade people to become my disciples” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	5	11	abca		τὴν γῆν	1	the land	Alternate translation: “the shore”
LUK	5	12	j1xy	writing-newevent	καὶ ἐγένετο	1	and it happened that	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
LUK	5	12	l248	figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	behold	Luke uses the term **behold** to calls the reader’s attention to what he is about to say. Your language may have a similar expression that you can use here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	5	12	r35h	writing-participants	ἀνὴρ πλήρης λέπρας	1	a man full of leprosy	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new character into the story. If your language has its own way of doing that, you can use it here in your translation. Alternate translation: “there was a man there who was covered with leprosy” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
LUK	5	12	i3zk	figs-idiom	πεσὼν ἐπὶ πρόσωπον	1	fell on his face	This is an idiom that means that he bowed down. Make sure that it is clear in your translation that the man did not fall down accidentally. Alternate translation: “knelt down and touched the ground with his face” or “bowed down to the ground” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	5	12	m4k2		ἐὰν θέλῃς	1	if you are willing	Alternate translation: “if you want to”
LUK	5	12	x7ss	figs-declarative	δύνασαί με καθαρίσαι	1	you can make me clean	The man is actually using this statement to make a request. Alternate translation: “please make me clean” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative]])
LUK	5	12	ys5f	figs-explicit	με καθαρίσαι	1	make me clean	The man talks about becoming **clean** ceremonially, but it is implicit that he has become unclean because of his leprosy, so he is really asking Jesus to heal him of this disease. Alternate translation: “heal me from leprosy” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	5	13	ziz1	figs-imperative	καθαρίσθητι	1	Be clean	This was not a command that the man was capable of obeying. Instead, this was a command that directly caused the man to be healed. Alternate translation: “I heal you from your leprosy” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
LUK	5	13	l48a	figs-personification	ἡ λέπρα ἀπῆλθεν ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ	1	the leprosy went away from him	Luke speaks figuratively of the man’s **leprosy** as if it were something that could actively go **away from him**. Alternate translation: “the man no longer had leprosy” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
LUK	5	14	q18t	figs-quotations	αὐτὸς παρήγγειλεν αὐτῷ, μηδενὶ εἰπεῖν, ἀλλὰ ἀπελθὼν	1	he instructed him to tell no one, but, “Go”	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate all of Jesus’ instructions as a direct quotation. Alternate translation: “He instructed him, ‘Do not tell anyone, but go’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
LUK	5	14	l249	figs-explicit	μηδενὶ εἰπεῖν	1	to tell no one	The implication is that the man is not to tell anyone that Jesus healed him. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation, as a direct quotation: “Do not tell anyone that you have been healed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	5	14	v1wn	figs-explicit	προσένεγκε περὶ τοῦ καθαρισμοῦ σου καθὼς προσέταξεν Μωϋσῆς	1	offer a sacrifice for your cleansing, as Moses commanded	Jesus assumes that the man will know that the law required a person who had been healed from a skin disease to make a specific sacrifice. This made the person ceremonially clean and they could participate once again in community religious activities. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “offer the sacrifice that Moses commanded so that you can become ceremonially clean once again” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	5	14	jk14	figs-explicit	εἰς μαρτύριον αὐτοῖς	1	for a testimony to them	A priest would have to examine the man and certify that he had been healed before he would be allowed to offer this sacrifice. Alternate translation: “to certify for everone that you have been healed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	5	14	nz37	writing-pronouns	αὐτοῖς	1	them	This could mean either “the priests,” which is the interpretation that UST follows, or “all the people.” You could say either as an alternate translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
LUK	5	15	ng3z	figs-personification	διήρχετο…μᾶλλον ὁ λόγος περὶ αὐτοῦ	1	the word about him spread even more	Luke speaks figuratively of this **word** as if it were something that could spread around actively by itself. This expression means that more and more people told others about what Jesus was doing. Alternate translation: “people spread the news about Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
LUK	5	15	q4t2	figs-metonymy	ὁ λόγος περὶ αὐτοῦ	1	the word about him	Luke uses the term **word** figuratively to describes the news about Jesus that people spread by using words. Alternate translation: “the news about Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	5	15	l250	figs-activepassive	θεραπεύεσθαι	1	to be healed	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who did the action. Alternate translation: “for Jesus to heal them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	5	16	l251		αὐτὸς…ἦν ὑποχωρῶν	1	he was withdrawing	This verb indicates habitual action. Alternate translation: “he often withdrew”
LUK	5	16	sv6f		ταῖς ἐρήμοις	1	deserted places	Alternate translation: “places where there were no other people”
LUK	5	17	mb8m	writing-newevent	καὶ ἐγένετο	1	And it happened that	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
LUK	5	17	l252	figs-hyperbole	ἐκ πάσης κώμης τῆς Γαλιλαίας, καὶ Ἰουδαίας	1	from every village of Galilee and Judea	Luke generalizes by saying **every** in order to emphasize from how many different villages these religious leaders came. Alternate translation: “from villages throughout Galilee and Judea” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
LUK	5	17	l253	figs-metaphor	δύναμις Κυρίου ἦν εἰς τὸ ἰᾶσθαι αὐτόν	1	power from the Lord was upon him to heal	As often in this book, **upon** is a spatial metaphor. In this case, it means that the power of the Lord was with Jesus in a special way, specifically, to enable him to heal people. Alternate translation: “the Lord was giving Jesus special power to heal people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	5	18	l254	figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	behold	Luke uses the term **behold** to calls the reader’s attention to what he is about to say. Your language may have a similar expression that you can use here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	5	18	cl7s	writing-participants	ἄνδρες φέροντες ἐπὶ κλίνης ἄνθρωπον ὃς ἦν παραλελυμένος	1	men carrying on a mat a man who was paralyzed	Luke uses this phrase to introduce these new characters into the story. If your language has its own way of doing that, you can use it here in your translation. Alternate translation: “there were some men who were carrying a paralyzed man on a mat” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
LUK	5	18	l9q8	translate-unknown	κλίνης	1	a mat	This was a portable bed that could also be used to transport a person. Alternate translation: “a stretcher” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	5	18	z2n2		ἦν παραλελυμένος	1	who was paralyzed	Alternate translation: “who was unable to move by himself”
LUK	5	18	abc6	figs-metaphor	ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ	1	before him	The term **before** here means “in front of.” Alternate translation: “in front of Jesus” or “where Jesus could see him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	5	19	y491	grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ μὴ εὑρόντες ποίας εἰσενέγκωσιν αὐτὸν διὰ τὸν ὄχλον	1	And not finding a way to bring him in because of the crowd	If it would be clearer in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the action that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “But because the crowd of people had filled the house, they could not find a way to bring the man inside” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
LUK	5	19	rkm6	figs-explicit	διὰ τὸν ὄχλον	1	because of the crowd	The implication is that they could not enter because the crowd was so large that there was no room for them. Alternate translation: “because the crowd of people had filled the house” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	5	19	s7bm	figs-explicit	ἀναβάντες ἐπὶ τὸ δῶμα	1	they went up onto the roof	In this culture, houses had flat roofs, and many houses had a staircase outside that provided access to **the roof**. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “they went up the outside staircase onto the flat roof of the house” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	5	19	abc7		καθῆκαν αὐτὸν	1	and let him down	Alternate translation: “and lowered the man down”
LUK	5	19	l255	figs-ellipsis	εἰς τὸ μέσον	1	into the midst	Luke is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need to be complete. Alternate translation: “into the midst of the people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
LUK	5	19	l85u	figs-metaphor	ἔμπροσθεν τοῦ Ἰησοῦ	1	before Jesus	The term **before** here means “in front of.” Alternate translation: “in front of Jesus” or “where Jesus could see him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	5	20	l83a	figs-explicit	καὶ ἰδὼν τὴν πίστιν αὐτῶν	1	And seeing their faith	The implication is that through their actions, Jesus recognized that the friends of this paralyzed man strongly believed that he could heal him. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly Alternate translation: “When Jesus recognized that the man’s friends were convinced that he could heal him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	5	20	z4ek		ἄνθρωπε	1	Man	This was a general word that people used in this culture when speaking to a man whose name they did not know. If your language has a term that it uses for this same purpose, you can use it in your translation here. Alternate translation: “Friend”
LUK	5	20	c7r7	figs-activepassive	ἀφέωνταί σοι αἱ ἁμαρτίαι σου	1	your sins are forgiven you	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who did the action. Alternate translation: “I forgive your sins” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	5	21	l256	translate-unknown	οἱ γραμματεῖς	1	the scribes	Here and elsewhere in the book, this term does not refer to people who make copies of documents. Rather, it refers to people who were teachers of the Jewish law, which they had studied extensively. Alternate translation: “the teachers of the Jewish law” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	5	21	l257	translate-names	οἱ Φαρισαῖοι	1	the Pharisees	This is the name of an important and powerful group of Jewish religious leaders in Jesus’ time. The name occurs many times in this book. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	5	21	ie5h	figs-explicit	διαλογίζεσθαι	1	to debate	These men were not debating or arguing out loud, since the next verse shows that this was rather something they were thinking. So this implicitly means that they were wondering. Alternate translation: “to wonder” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	5	21	l258	figs-quotemarks	λέγοντες	1	saying	Luke uses the word **saying** to introduce his quotation of what the religious leaders were thinking. If you indicate the quotation in some other way, such as with quotation marks or with some other punctuation or convention that your language uses, you do not need to represent this word in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
LUK	5	21	a86c	figs-rquestion	τίς ἐστιν οὗτος ὃς λαλεῖ βλασφημίας?	1	Who is this who speaks blasphemies?	These religious leaders do not expect someone to tell them who Jesus is. Instead, they are using the question form to emphasize how inappropriate they think it is for Jesus to tell someone that he forgives their sins. As the next sentence explains, they think this mean Jesus was claiming to be God, and so in their view, he would be speaking **blasphemies**. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could translate their words as a statement or exclamation. Alternate translation: “This man is speaking blasphemies!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	5	21	s21n	figs-rquestion	τίς δύναται ἀφιέναι ἁμαρτίας εἰ μὴ μόνος ὁ Θεός?	1	Who can forgive sins but God alone?	Once again the religious leaders are using a question form for emphasis, and you can translate their words as a statement or exclamation. Alternate translation: “No one can forgive sins but God alone!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	5	22	z4k5	figs-explicit	ἐπιγνοὺς…τοὺς διαλογισμοὺς αὐτῶν	1	knowing their thoughts	This phrase indicates that they were reasoning silently, so the implication is that Jesus sensed what they were thinking. Alternate translation: “sensing what they were thinking” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	5	22	l259	figs-hendiadys	ἀποκριθεὶς εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτούς	1	answering said to them	Together the words **answering** and **said** mean that Jesus responded to what the religious leaders were thinking. Alternate translation: “responded to them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
LUK	5	22	et8f	figs-rquestion	τί διαλογίζεσθε ἐν ταῖς καρδίαις ὑμῶν?	1	Why are you debating in your hearts?	Jesus does not expect the religious leaders to explain why they are thinking these things. Instead, he is using the question form to emphasize that they should not be thinking them. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could translate his words as a statement or exclamation. Alternate translation: “You should not be thinking these things!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	5	22	p2hj	figs-metaphor	διαλογίζεσθε ἐν ταῖς καρδίαις ὑμῶν	1	debating in your hearts	The term **hearts** figuratively represents the thoughts of these people. Alternate translation: “thinking these things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	5	23	zid2	figs-rquestion	τί ἐστιν εὐκοπώτερον, εἰπεῖν, ἀφέωνταί σοι αἱ ἁμαρτίαι σου, ἢ εἰπεῖν, ἔγειρε καὶ περιπάτει?	1	Which is easier, to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven you,’ or to say, ‘Get up and walk?’	Jesus is using the form of a question in order to teach. He wants to make the scribes and Pharisees reflect on the situation and realize something. There are many implications. For example, these religious leaders may take the question in the sense, “Which is easier to get away with saying?” The answer would be, “Your sins are forgiven,” because people don’t expect visual proof of that, whereas if someone says, “Get up and walk,” and nothing happens, then that proves the speaker doesn’t have the power to heal. But Jesus likely intends the question in a different sense: “Which is the easier way to deal with a situation like this?” It appears that the man’s sickness has something to do with his sins, because Jesus forgives them. So in such a situation, it would not be sufficient to say, “Get up and walk,” since it would address the effect but not the cause. But to say, “Your sins are forgiven,” would deal with both the cause and the effect, so that would be the easier way to deal with the situation. But there are many other implications that could also be drawn out as well—too many to include in the text of a translation. Rather, since the question form is intrinsic to Jesus’ teaching method, you may simply wish to retain it in your translation. However, to show that he is teaching, not asking for information, you could introduce his question with a phrase that indicates its purpose. Alternate translation: “Think about this. Which is easier, to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven you,’ or to say, ‘Get up and walk?’ ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	5	23	l260	figs-quotesinquotes	τί ἐστιν εὐκοπώτερον, εἰπεῖν, ἀφέωνταί σοι αἱ ἁμαρτίαι σου, ἢ εἰπεῖν, ἔγειρε καὶ περιπάτει?	1	Which is easier, to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven you,’ or to say, ‘Get up and walk?’	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “Is it easier to tell someone that his sins are forgiven, or to tell him to get up and walk?” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	5	24	f1lu	figs-123person	ὅτι ὁ Υἱὸς τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου	1	that the Son of Man	Jesus is referring to himself in the third person. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this in the first person. Alternate translation: “that I, the Son of Man” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
LUK	5	24	l261	figs-explicit	ὅτι ὁ Υἱὸς τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου	1	that the Son of Man	The title **Son of Man** is equivalent to “Messiah.” Jesus uses it to claim that role subtly and implicitly. You may want to translate this title directly into your language. On the other hand, if you think it would be helpful to your readers, you could state what it means. Alternate translation: “that the Messiah” or, in the first person, “that I, the Messiah” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	5	24	l262	figs-imperative	ἔγειρε	1	get up	As in [5:13](../05/13.md), this was not a command that the man was able to obey. Instead, this was a command that directly caused the man to be healed. Alternate translation: “I heal you, so you can get up” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
LUK	5	25	agg3	figs-explicit	καὶ παραχρῆμα ἀναστὰς	1	And immediately he got up	The implication is that the man was able to get up because Jesus had healed him. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “And all at once the man was healed, so he got up” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

LUK	5	27	abc8	writing-pronouns	ἐξῆλθεν	1	he went out	The pronoun **he** refers to Jesus. Alternate translation: “Jesus left that house” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
LUK	5	27	xf15		ἐθεάσατο τελώνην	1	saw a tax collector	The word that Luke uses for **saw** indicates that Jesus gave careful attention to this man when he saw him. Alternate translation: “observed a tax collector” or “looked carefully at a tax collector”
LUK	5	27	l266	figs-idiom	ἀκολούθει μοι	1	Follow me	In this context, to **follow** someone means to become that person’s disciple. Alternate translation: “Become my disciple” or “Come, follow me as your teacher” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	5	27	b3tr	figs-imperative	ἀκολούθει μοι	1	Follow me	This is not a command, but an invitation. Jesus is encouraging Levi to do this if he wants. Alternate translation: “I want you to become my disciple” or “I invite you to come and follow me as your teacher” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
LUK	5	28	phw9	figs-hyperbole	καταλιπὼν πάντα	1	leaving everything behind	The word **everything** here is a generalization that refers to Levi’s position as a tax collector and the advantages that came with it.

LUK	5	28	abc0	figs-events	καταλιπὼν πάντα, ἀναστὰς	1	leaving everything behind, he got up	If it would be clearer in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases. Alternate translation: “he got up and left everything behind” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-events]])
LUK	5	29	l267	grammar-connect-time-sequential	καὶ	1	And	Luke uses this word to indicate that the event he will now relate came after the event he has just described. Alternate translation: “Then” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
LUK	5	29	g6yt	writing-pronouns	ἐν τῇ οἰκίᾳ αὐτοῦ	1	in his house	The pronoun **his** refers to Levi, not to Jesus. Alternate translation: “in his own house” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
LUK	5	29	ip2m	translate-unknown	κατακείμενοι	1	reclining to eat	In this culture, the manner of eating at a feast was to lie on a couch and prop oneself up with the left arm on some pillows. Alternate translation: “lying on banqueting couches” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	5	30	n82u	writing-pronouns	πρὸς τοὺς μαθητὰς αὐτοῦ	1	to his disciples	In this case, the pronoun **his** refers to Jesus, not to Levi. Alternate translation: “to Jesus’ disciples” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
LUK	5	30	tmm5	figs-rquestion	διὰ τί μετὰ τῶν τελωνῶν καὶ ἁμαρτωλῶν ἐσθίετε καὶ πίνετε?	1	Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?	The Pharisees and scribes are using the question form to express their disapproval. They believed that religious people should separate themselves from people whom they considered to be sinners If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate their words as a statement or exclamation. Alternate translation: “You should not eat and drink with sinful tax collectors!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	5	30	pi2x	figs-you	ἐσθίετε καὶ πίνετε	1	you eat and drink	The word **you** is plural, since the Pharisees are speaking to the disciples as a group, not to one particular disciple. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
LUK	5	30	l268	figs-merism	ἐσθίετε καὶ πίνετε	1	eat and drink	The Pharisees are figuratively using the two components of a meal to mean an entire meal. Alternate translation: “share meals” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
LUK	5	30	ze7y	figs-hendiadys	μετὰ τῶν τελωνῶν καὶ ἁμαρτωλῶν	1	with tax collectors and sinners	The Pharisees may be expressing a single idea by using two words connected with **and.** The previous verse says that there were many **tax collectors** at this banquet. So the term **sinners** may tell what the Pharisees thought these **tax collectors** were. Alternate translation: “with sinful tax collectors” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
LUK	5	31	l269	figs-hendiadys	ἀποκριθεὶς ὁ Ἰησοῦς εἶπεν	1	answering Jesus said	Together the words **answering** and **said** mean that Jesus responded to what the religious leaders were complaining about. Alternate translation: “Jesus responded” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
LUK	5	31	t6iv	writing-proverbs	οὐ χρείαν ἔχουσιν οἱ ὑγιαίνοντες ἰατροῦ, ἀλλὰ οἱ κακῶς ἔχοντες	1	People who are well do not have need of a physician, but those who have sickness	Jesus begins his response by quoting or creating a proverb, a short saying about something that is generally true in life. This proverb draws a figurative comparison. Just as sick people need to see a doctor to be healed, so sinners need to see Jesus in order to be forgiven and restored. But since Jesus explains the comparison in the next verse, you do not need to explain it here. Rather, you can translate the proverb itself in a way that will be meaningful in your language and culture. Alternate translation: “People who are well do not need to see a doctor, people who are sick do” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-proverbs]])
LUK	5	31	i9gn	figs-ellipsis	ἀλλὰ οἱ κακῶς ἔχοντες	1	but those who have sickness	The proverb expresses the idea compactly, and so it leaves out some words. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could supply those words. Alternate translation: “rather, it is people who are sick who need a doctor” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
LUK	5	32	g993	figs-nominaladj	δικαίους	1	the righteous	Luke is using the adjective **righteous** as a noun, to refer to a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way.

LUK	5	32	l270	figs-ellipsis	ἀλλὰ ἁμαρτωλοὺς εἰς μετάνοιαν	1	but sinners to repentance	Once again Jesus expresses the idea compactly and leaves out some words.

LUK	5	32	l271	figs-abstractnouns	εἰς μετάνοιαν	1	to repentance	If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **repentance** with a verb. Alternate translation: “to repent” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
LUK	5	33	f6g6	writing-pronouns	οἱ δὲ εἶπαν	1	Then they said	The word **they** refers to the Pharisees and scribes. Alternate translation: “Then the religious leaders said” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
LUK	5	33	l272	figs-explicit	Ἰωάννου	1	John	The Pharisees and scribes assume that Jesus will know that they are referring to **John** the Baptist. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “John the Baptist” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	5	33	l273	figs-explicit	οἱ δὲ σοὶ ἐσθίουσιν καὶ πίνουσιν	1	But those of yours eat and drink	There is an implied challenge and question in this observation. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state it explicitly. Alternate translation: “But your disciples do not fast, and we want you to tell us why” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	5	33	l274	figs-merism	ἐσθίετε καὶ πίνετε	1	eat and drink	The Pharisees are figuratively using the two components of a meal to mean an entire meal. Alternate translation: “continue to have meals” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
LUK	5	34	l275	figs-doublenegatives	μὴ δύνασθε τοὺς υἱοὺς τοῦ νυμφῶνος ἐν ᾧ ὁ νυμφίος μετ’ αὐτῶν ἐστιν ποιῆσαι νηστεύειν?	1	You cannot make the sons of the bridal chamber fast while the bridegroom is with them, can you	The first word of this sentence in Greek is a negative word that can be used to turn a negative statement into a question that answer. ULT shows this by adding **can you?** Your language may have other ways of asking a question that expects a negative answer, for example, by changing the word order of a positive statement. Translate this in the way that would be clearest in your language. Alternate translation: “Can you actually make the groom’s party at a wedding fast while the groom is still with them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
LUK	5	34	hxe1	figs-rquestion	μὴ δύνασθε τοὺς υἱοὺς τοῦ νυμφῶνος ἐν ᾧ ὁ νυμφίος μετ’ αὐτῶν ἐστιν ποιῆσαι νηστεύειν?	1	You cannot make the sons of the bridal chamber fast while the bridegroom is with them, can you?	Jesus is using the question form to teach. He wants the scribes and Pharisees to reflect on the actions of his disciples in light of a situation they are already familiar with. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or exclamation. Alternate translation: “No one tells the groom’s party at a wedding to fast while the groom is still with them!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	5	34	q9k2	figs-idiom	τοὺς υἱοὺς τοῦ νυμφῶνος	1	the sons of the bridal chamber	The expression **sons of** is a Hebrew idiom that means a person shares the qualities of something. In this case, Jesus is describing people who share the quality of being an integral part of a wedding. These are the male friends who attend the groom during the ceremony and the festivities. Alternate translation: “the groom’s party” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	5	35	z8ex	figs-idiom	ἐλεύσονται δὲ ἡμέραι καὶ	1	But the days will indeed come	Jesus is using the term **days** figuratively here to refer a particular time. Alternate translation: “But there will certainly be a time” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	5	35	he9p	figs-metaphor	ἀπαρθῇ ἀπ’ αὐτῶν ὁ νυμφίος	1	the bridegroom will be taken away from them	Jesus is speaking of himself figuratively as the **bridegroom**, and of his disciples as the groom’s party. He does not explain the metaphor, so you do not need to explain it in your translation unless you think your readers will not understand it. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	5	35	l276	figs-activepassive	ἀπαρθῇ ἀπ’ αὐτῶν ὁ νυμφίος	1	the bridegroom will be taken away from them	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “someone will take the bridegroom away from them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	5	35	l277	figs-idiom	ἐν ἐκείναις ταῖς ἡμέραις	1	in those days	Jesus is again using the term **days** figuratively to refer a particular time. Alternate translation: “at that time” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

Alternate translation: “Then he gave them this illustration to help them understand better” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])
LUK	5	36	qz5e		ἐπιβάλλει ἐπὶ ἱμάτιον παλαιόν	1	sews it onto an old garment	Alternate translation: “uses it to patch an old garment”
LUK	5	36	xj2y	figs-hypo	εἰ δὲ μή γε	1	But if not	Jesus uses this expression to introduce a hypothetical situation that explains the reason why a person would not actually mend a garment in that way. It may be helpful to make this a separate sentence. Alternate translation: “Suppose someone did do that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
LUK	5	37	n35t	translate-unknown	ἀσκοὺς	1	wineskins	These were bags made out of animal skins for holding wine. If your readers would not be familiar with **wineskins**, you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “leather bags” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	5	37	l278	figs-hypo	εἰ δὲ μή γε	1	But if not	Jesus uses this expression once again to introduce a hypothetical situation that explains the reason why a person would not put new wine in an old wineskin. Alternate translation: “Suppose someone did do that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
LUK	5	37	ac7w	figs-explicit	ῥήξει ὁ οἶνος ὁ νέος τοὺς ἀσκούς	1	the new wine would burst the wineskins	When the new wine fermented and expanded, it would break the old skins because they could no longer stretch out. Jesus’ audience would have understood this information about wine fermenting and expanding and about old leather losing its suppleness. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state it explicitly. Alternate translation: “the new wine would burst the old wineskins because they would no longer be able to expand when the wine fermented” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	5	37	dw18	figs-activepassive	αὐτὸς ἐκχυθήσεται	1	it would be spilled out	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “the wine would spill out of the bags” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	5	37	l279	figs-activepassive	οἱ ἀσκοὶ ἀπολοῦνται	1	the wineskins would be destroyed	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “the leather bags would tear and become useless” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	5	38	ijm3		ἀσκοὺς καινοὺς	1	new wineskins	See how you translated the term **wineskins** in [5:37](../05/37.md). Alternate translation: “fresh leather bags”
LUK	5	39	l280	figs-ellipsis	οὐδεὶς πιὼν παλαιὸν θέλει νέον	1	No one, after drinking the old, wants the new	Jesus is leaving out some of the words. You can supply them in your translation if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “No one who is used to drinking old wine wants to try new wine” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
LUK	5	39	pvn9	figs-metaphor	οὐδεὶς πιὼν παλαιὸν θέλει νέον	1	No one, after drinking the old, wants the new	Jesus is figuratively contrasting the old teaching of the religious leaders with his own new teaching. The point is that people who are used to the old teaching are not receptive to the new things that he is bringing. Jesus does not explain the metaphor, so you do not need to explain it in your translation unless you think your readers will not understand it. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	6	intro	vv2y			0		# Luke 06 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>1. Jesus teaches about the Sabbath (6:1–11)<br>2. Jesus chooses twelve apostles (6:12–16)<br>3. Jesus teaches about being his disciple (6:17–49)<br><br>The long teaching in Luke 6:20-49 begins with blessings and woes that are similar to the beginning of the long teaching in Matthew 5-7. That part of Matthew has traditionally been called the “Sermon on the Mount.” The teaching here in Luke has many other similarities with the one in Matthew’s gospel. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/kingdomofgod]])<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### “Eating the grain”<br><br>When the disciples plucked and ate the grain in a field they were walking through on the Sabbath (Luke 6:1), the Pharisees said that they were breaking the law of Moses. The Pharisees said this because they thought that the disciples were doing work by picking the grain, and so they were disobeying God’s command to rest and not work on the Sabbath. The Pharisees did not think the disciples were stealing. That is because the law of Moses told farmers to allow travelers to pluck and eat small amounts of grain from plants in fields that they traveled through or near. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/works]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sabbath]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### The twelve disciples<br><br>The following are the lists of the twelve disciples:<br><br>In Matthew:<br><br>Simon (Peter), Andrew, James son of Zebedee, John son of Zebedee, Philip, Bartholomew, Thomas, Matthew, James son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot.<br><br>In Mark:<br><br>Simon (Peter), Andrew, James the son of Zebedee and John the son of Zebedee (to whom he gave the name Boanerges, that is, sons of thunder), Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot.<br><br>In Luke:<br><br>Simon (Peter), Andrew, James, John, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Simon (who was called the Zealot), Judas the son of James, and Judas Iscariot.<br><br>The man whom Luke calls Jude the son of James is probably the same man whom Matthew and Mark call Thaddaeus. However, you do not need to explain that in your translation or give both names. You can translate Luke’s list as he wrote it, and allow Bible teachers to explain the reason for the difference.
LUK	6	1	c4sa	writing-newevent	ἐγένετο δὲ	1	And it happened that	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
LUK	6	1	x5zk	translate-unknown	σπορίμων	1	the grainfields	These were large sections of land where people had scattered wheat seed in order to grow more wheat. Wheat is a kind of **grain** plant, and **grain** is a type of large grass that has edible seeds. If your readers would not be familiar with this type of plant, you could use a general expression in your translation. Alternate translation: “the areas where people were growing plants with edible seeds” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	6	1	rl46	translate-unknown	στάχυας	1	heads of grain	The **heads** are the topmost part of the **grain** plant. They hold the mature, edible seeds. Alternate translation: “the parts that held the seeds” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	6	1	h9fy	figs-explicit	ψώχοντες ταῖς χερσίν	1	rubbing them in their hands	The implication is that they did this to separate out the grain seeds. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “rubbing them in their hands to separate the seeds from the other parts of the plant” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	6	2	z32z	figs-rquestion	τί ποιεῖτε ὃ οὐκ ἔξεστιν τοῖς Σάββασιν?	1	Why are you doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath?	The Pharisees are using the question form to make an accusation. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate their words as a statement or exclamation. Alternate translation: “You are doing something that the law does not permit you to do on the Sabbath!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	6	2	m76z	figs-explicit	τί ποιεῖτε ὃ οὐκ ἔξεστιν τοῖς Σάββασιν?	1	Why are you doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath?	The Pharisees considered even the small action of plucking and rubbing heads of grain to be harvesting, and therefore work. You could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “You are harvesting grain, and that is work that the law does not permit you to do on the Sabbath!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	6	2	dum1	figs-you	τί ποιεῖτε	1	Why are you doing	The word **you** here is plural. It refers to the disciples. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

LUK	6	3	vih6	figs-rquestion	ὐδὲ τοῦτο ἀνέγνωτε, ὃ ἐποίησεν Δαυεὶδ ὅτε ἐπείνασεν αὐτὸς, καὶ οἱ μετ’ αὐτοῦ ὄντες	1	Have you not read this, what David did when he was hungry, he and those who were with him	Jesus does not expect the Pharisees to tell him whether they have read this passage in the Scriptures. Instead, he is using the question form to emphasize that the Pharisees should have learned a principle from that passage that indicates that they are wrong to criticize the disciples. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could translate his words as a statement. It may be helpful to make this a separate sentence. Alternate translation: “The Scriptures suggest otherwise, in the passage that tells what David did when he and those who were with him were hungry.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	6	4	l282		ὡς εἰσῆλθεν εἰς τὸν οἶκον τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	how he entered into the house of God	If you made the first part of the quotation in [6:3](../06/03.md) a separate sentence, begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “He entered into the house of God”
LUK	6	4	l283	figs-metaphor	τὸν οἶκον τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	the house of God	Jesus speaks figuratively of the tabernacle as the **house of God** as if it were the place where God lived, since God’s presence was there. Alternate translation: “the tabernacle” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	6	4	yyh2	translate-unknown	τοὺς ἄρτους τῆς Προθέσεως	1	the bread of the presence	This phrase refers to loaves of **bread** that were placed on a table in the temple as an offering to God. They represented how the people of Israel lived in the **presence** of God. Alternate translation: “the bread that was offered to God” or “the bread that showed God lived among the people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	6	4	l284		οὐκ ἔξεστιν φαγεῖν, εἰ μὴ μόνους τοὺςἱερεῖς	1	which is not lawful to eat, except only for the priests	It may be helpful to make this a separate senence. Alternate translation: “The law says that only the priests can eat that bread”
LUK	6	5	h453	figs-123person	ὁ Υἱὸς τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου	1	the Son of Man	Jesus is speaking of himself in the third person. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this in the first person. Alternate translation: “I, the Son of Man” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
LUK	6	5	l285	figs-explicit	ὁ Υἱὸς τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου	1	the Son of Man	See how you translated this title in [5:24](../05/24.md). Alternate translation: “I, the Messiah” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	6	5	xy9h	figs-metaphor	Κύριός ἐστιν τοῦ Σαββάτου	1	is Lord of the Sabbath	The title **Lord** figuratively describes Jesus’ authority over the Sabbath. Alternate translation: “has authority over the Sabbath” or, if you translated in the first person, “have authority over the Sabbath” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	6	6	p1ee	writing-newevent	ἐγένετο δὲ	1	And it happened that	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
LUK	6	6	d44q	writing-participants	ἦν ἄνθρωπος ἐκεῖ	1	there was a man there	This expression introduces a new character into the story. If your language has an expression of its own that serves this purpose, you can use it here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
LUK	6	6	t77y	translate-unknown	ἡ χεὶρ αὐτοῦ ἡ δεξιὰ ἦν ξηρά	1	his right hand was withered	This means that the man’s **hand** was damaged in such a way that he could not stretch it out. It was probably bent almost into a fist, making it look smaller. Alternate translation: “his right hand was shriveled” or “his right hand was atrophied” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	6	7	q3sh	writing-pronouns	παρετηροῦντο…αὐτὸν	1	were watching him	The word **him** refers to Jesus, not to the man with the withered hand. Alternate translation: “were watching Jesus carefully” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
LUK	6	7	c1qe	figs-ellipsis	ἵνα εὕρωσιν κατηγορεῖν αὐτοῦ	1	so that they might find to accuse him	Luke is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete.

LUK	6	8	d7zu	figs-explicit	στῆθι εἰς τὸ μέσον	1	stand in the midst	The implication is that Jesus wanted this man to stand where everyone could see him. Alternate translation: “stand here where everyone can see you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

Jesus asks this question to get the Pharisees to admit that it is legitimate to heal on the Sabbath. The intent of the question is therefore rhetorical. Jesus is not trying to obtain information, he wants someone to admit that something is true. However, Jesus says, “I ask you,” so this question is not like other rhetorical questions that might appropriately be translated as statements. This one should be translated as a question. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

LUK	6	10	x77k	figs-imperative	ἔκτεινον τὴν χεῖρά σου	1	Stretch out your hand	This was not a command that the man was capable of obeying.

LUK	6	10	hce1	figs-activepassive	ἀποκατεστάθη ἡ χεὶρ αὐτοῦ	1	his hand was restored	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “his hand became healthy again” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

LUK	6	11	l288	figs-explicit	τί ἂν ποιήσαιεν τῷ Ἰησοῦ	1	what they might do to Jesus	The implication is that these religious leaders perceived Jesus as a threat and they wanted to get rid of him. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly, as UST does. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	6	12	e4s7	writing-newevent	ἐγένετο δὲ	1	And it happened that	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])

LUK	6	12	l289		ἐξελθεῖν αὐτὸν εἰς τὸ ὄρος	1	he went out to the mountain	While the term **mountain** is definite here, it does not seem to refer to a specific, identifiable mountain. Rather, as many languages do, here the Greek is using a definite expression in a general sense. Alternate translation: “Jesus went up a mountain” or “Jesus climbed a high hill”

LUK	6	13	zgh6		οὓς καὶ ἀποστόλους ὠνόμασεν	1	whom he also named apostles	The term **apostle** comes from a Greek word that originally meant “messenger” or “delegate.” It took on a specialized meaning within the community of Jesus’ followers to mean one of the 12 men whom Jesus chose to be his authoritative representatives. Many languages have borrowed the Greek word to use in this sense. But if your language has developed its own special term for this role, use it in your translation. Alternate translation: “and he appointed them to be apostles”

LUK	6	24	cs2e	figs-explicit	ἀπέχετε τὴν παράκλησιν ὑμῶν	1	you have received your comfort	Jesus is drawing a series of contrasts between what the poor and the rich have now and what they will have later. So the implication is that while the rich have enjoyed ease and prosperity in this life, if they become complacent in those things, they will not enjoy it afterwards. Alternate translation: “you have already received in this life anything that will make you comfortable” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	6	25	l305	figs-idiom	οὐαὶ ὑμῖν	1	woe to you	See how you translated this in [6:24](../06/24.md). Alternate translation: “how terrible it is for you” or “trouble will come to you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

LUK	6	27	l5rz	writing-participants	ἀλλὰ ὑμῖν λέγω τοῖς ἀκούουσιν	1	But I say to you who are listening	Jesus uses this phrase to broaden his audience to the entire crowd, beyond his disciples. At the same time, the phrase also calls everyone to focus their attention on what Jesus is about to say. It may be helpful to make this a separate sentence. Alternate translation: “Now I want all of you to listen carefully to what I am about to say” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
LUK	6	27	pz5r	figs-parallelism	ἀγαπᾶτε τοὺς ἐχθροὺς ὑμῶν, καλῶς ποιεῖτε τοῖς μισοῦσιν ὑμᾶς	1	love your enemies and do good to those who hate you	These two phrases mean similar things. Jesus is using repetition to emphasize the importance of what he is saying. You do not need to repeat both phrases in your translation if that would be confusing for your readers. However, there is a slight difference in meaning, and you could also choose to bring that out in your translation. The second phrase specifies in what way followers of Jesus are to **love** their enemies. They are to do this in a practical way by helping them. Alternate translation: “do good things for people even if they are hostile to you” or “show love to your enemies who hate you by doing things to help them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

Jesus is using repetition to emphasize the importance of what he is saying. You do not need to repeat both phrases in your translation if that would be confusing for your readers. Instead, you could combine them into a single phrase. However, there is a slight difference in meaning, and you could also choose to bring that out in your translation. The second phrase specifies one in which followers of Jesus can **bless** people who mistreat them. They can pray for them. Alternate translation: “Ask God to bless people who say and do bad things to you” or “Say good things to people who say bad things to you, and even if someone treats you badly, pray that God will help them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
LUK	6	29	a7ri	figs-hypo	τῷ τύπτοντί σε	1	To the one who strikes you on the cheek, offer also the other	Jesus is a hypothetical situation to teach. Alternate translation: “Suppose someone hits you on one side of your face. Then turn your face so that he could also strike the other side” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
LUK	6	29	l308	figs-youcrowd	σε…σου	1	you…your	Even though Jesus is still speaking to his disciples and the crowd, he is now addressing an individual situation, so **you** and **your** are singular in this verse. But if the singular forms of these pronouns would not be natural in your language for someone who was speaking to a group of people, you could use the plural forms in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd]])
LUK	6	29	d5qi		ἐπὶ τὴν σιαγόνα	1	on the cheek	Alternate translation: “on one side of your face”
LUK	6	29	eq83	figs-explicit	πάρεχε καὶ τὴν ἄλλην	1	offer also the other	It may be helpful to state the implicit purpose of this action.

LUK	6	29	ic4n	figs-litotes	καὶ τὸν χιτῶνα μὴ κωλύσῃς	1	also do not withhold your tunic	Jesus uses a figure of speech here that expresses a positive meaning by using a negative word together with a word that is the opposite of the intended meaning. Alternate translation: “give him your tunic as well” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])

LUK	6	30	l310	figs-youcrowd	σε…σὰ	1	you…yours	Even though Jesus is speaking to his disciples and the crowd, he is addressing another individual situation here, so **you** and **yours** are singular in this verse. If the singular forms of these pronouns would not be natural in your language, you can use the plural forms in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd]])
LUK	6	30	ts8c	figs-hypo	ἀπὸ τοῦ αἴροντος τὰ σὰ, μὴ ἀπαίτει	1	from the one who takes away what is yours, do not ask for it back	Jesus is using another hypothetical situation to teach.

LUK	6	31	l311	figs-gendernotations	καθὼς θέλετε ἵνα ποιῶσιν ὑμῖν οἱ ἄνθρωποι	1	as you desire that men would do to you	Jesus is using the term **men** in a generic sense that includes all people. Alternate translation: “what you wish people would do for you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
LUK	6	31	l312	figs-you	ὑμῖν	1	you	Jesus now returns to speaking to his disciples and the crowd about general situations, so **you** is plural here and in the following verses. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
LUK	6	32	qh81	figs-rquestion	ποία ὑμῖν χάρις ἐστίν?	1	what credit is that to you?	Jesus is using the question form as a teaching tool here, to make a point and get his listeners to reflect on it.

LUK	6	33	l313	figs-rquestion	ποία ὑμῖν χάρις ἐστίν?	1	what credit is that to you?	Once again Jesus is using the question form as a teaching tool. You could translate his words as a statement here as well. Alternate translation: “God will not reward you for doing that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	6	34	l314	figs-rquestion	ποία ὑμῖν χάρις ἐστίν?	1	what credit is that to you?	Jesus is using the question form once again as a teaching tool.

LUK	6	34	kgc9	figs-nominaladj	ἵνα ἀπολάβωσιν τὰ ἴσα	1	so that they may receive back the same things	The adjective **same** functions as a noun here. It is plural, and ULT supplies the noun **things** to show that. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this with an equivalent phrase. The adjective is also neuter, and this is a use of the neuter plural in Greek to refer to a single thing in order to describe it in its entirety. Alternate translation: “expecting that everything they lent will be repaid” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
LUK	6	35	s8j7		μηδὲν ἀπελπίζοντες	1	expecting nothing in return	Alternate translation: “without expecting the person to pay you back”
LUK	6	35	l315	grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ	3	and	This word introduces the results of what has been said so far in this verse. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “Then” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
LUK	6	35	ly98		ἔσται ὁ μισθὸς ὑμῶν πολύς	1	your reward will be great	Your language may require you to say who will do this action. Alternate translation: “God will reward you greatly”
LUK	6	35	zw5k	figs-metaphor	υἱοὶ Ὑψίστου	1	sons of the Most High	This is a figurative expression. Even so, it would probably be best to translate **sons** with the same word that your language would naturally use to refer to a human son or child. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	6	35	l316	figs-gendernotations	υἱοὶ Ὑψίστου	1	sons of the Most High	Jesus is using the word **sons** in a generic sense that includes all people. Alternate translation: “children of the Most High” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
LUK	6	35	qr5x		υἱοὶ Ὑψίστου	1	sons of the Most High	Make sure that the word **sons** or “children” in your translation is plural and not capitalized, if your language uses that convention for titles, so that readers do not confuse this expression with the title for Jesus, **the Son of the Most High**, which occurs in [1:32](../01/32.md) and [8:28](../08/28.md).
LUK	6	35	l317	figs-idiom	Ὑψίστου	1	the Most High	See how you translated the expression **the Most High** in [1:32](../01/32.md). Review the note there if that would be helpful. Alternate translation: “the Most High God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	6	35	l318	figs-nominaladj	τοὺς ἀχαρίστους καὶ πονηρούς	1	the ungrateful and evil	Jesus is using the adjectives **ungrateful** and **evil** here as nouns, to refer groups of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this pair of words with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “people who are ungrateful and evil” or “people who do not thank God and who do wrong things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
LUK	6	36	n28w	figs-metaphor	ὁ Πατὴρ ὑμῶν	1	your Father	This is a figurative expression. God is not the **Father** of humans in the same actual way that he is the **Father** of Jesus. Even so, it would probably be best to translate **Father** with the same word that your language would naturally use to refer to a human father. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that this means God. Alternate translation: “God your Father” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	6	37	a8c7		μὴ κρίνετε	1	do not judge	Your language may require you to specify the object of **judge**. Alternate translation: “Do not judge other people”
LUK	6	37	e8fb	figs-activepassive	οὐ μὴ κριθῆτε	1	you will certainly not be judged	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who would do the action. Jesus does not say exactly who would not judge. There are two possibilities. Alternate translations: (1) “God will not judge you” or (2) “other people will not judge you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	6	37	vkl8		καὶ μὴ καταδικάζετε	1	do not condemn	Your language may require you to specify the object of **condemn**. Alternate translation: “Do not condemn other people”
LUK	6	37	gz37	figs-activepassive	οὐ μὴ καταδικασθῆτε	1	you will certainly not be condemned	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who would do the action. Jesus does not say exactly who would not condemn. There are two possibilities. Alternate translations: (1) “God will not condemn you” or (2) “other people will not condemn you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	6	37	l319		ἀπολύετε	1	Forgive	Your language may require you to specify the object of **Forgive**. Alternate translation: “Forgive other people”
LUK	6	37	a22w	figs-activepassive	ἀπολυθήσεσθε	1	you will be forgiven	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who would do the action. Jesus does not say exactly who would forgive. There are two possibilities. Alternate translations: (1) “God will forgive you” or (2) “other people will forgive you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	6	38	ryf8	figs-activepassive	δοθήσεται ὑμῖν	1	it will be given to you	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who would do the action. Jesus does not say exactly who will give. There are two possibilities. Alternate translation: (1) “God will give to you” or (2) “other people will give to you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	6	38	q8sq	figs-metaphor	μέτρον καλὸν, πεπιεσμένον σεσαλευμένον ὑπερεκχυννόμενον, δώσουσιν εἰς τὸν κόλπον ὑμῶν	1	a good measure—pressed down, shaken together, spilling over—they will pour into your lap	Jesus speaks figuratively of either of God or people giving like generous grain merchant. The word **they** is indefinite, so it does not necessarily refer to people rather than to God. You could represent this metaphor as a simile in your translation. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “Like a generous grain merchant who presses down the grain and shakes it together and pours in so much that it fills a container and spills over, God will give you a generous amount” or “Like a generous grain merchant who presses down the grain and shakes it together and pours in so much that it fills a container and spills over, people will give you a generous amount” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	6	38	l320	figs-activepassive	πεπιεσμένον σεσαλευμένον ὑπερεκχυννόμενον, δώσουσιν εἰς τὸν κόλπον ὑμῶν	1	pressed down, shaken together, spilling over—they will pour into your lap	These are all passive verb forms in Greek. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate them with active verbal phrases. See the alternate translation in the previous note. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	6	38	l321	translate-unknown	τὸν κόλπον ὑμῶν	1	your lap	This is a reference to the way people in this culture would form a pocket or carrying pouch from the folds of the front of their robes. If you readers would not be familiar with this practice, you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “the folds of your robe” or “a container” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	6	38	fp26	figs-activepassive	ᾧ…μέτρῳ μετρεῖτε, ἀντιμετρηθήσεται ὑμῖν	1	with the measure by which you measure, it will be measured back to you	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who would do the action. Jesus does not say exactly who will measure. There are two possibilities. Alternate translation: (1) “God will give to you in just as generous or stingy a way as you give to others” or (2) “people will give to you in just as generous or stingy a way as you give to others” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	6	39	bw7f	figs-parables	εἶπεν δὲ καὶ παραβολὴν αὐτοῖς	1	Then he also told them a parable	Jesus is giving a brief illustration that teaches something true in a way that is easy to understand and remember. Alternate translation: “Then he gave them this illustration to help them understand better” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])
LUK	6	39	l322	figs-gendernotations	μήτι δύναται τυφλὸς τυφλὸν ὁδηγεῖν?	1	A blind man is not able to guide a blind man, is he?	The word translated **blind man** here is masculine, but Jesus is using it in a generic sense that includes all people. Alternate translation: “Can one person who is blind guide another person who is blind?” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
LUK	6	39	l323	figs-doublenegatives	μήτι δύναται τυφλὸς τυφλὸν ὁδηγεῖν?	1	A blind man is not able to guide a blind man, is he?	The first word of this sentence in Greek is a negative word that can be used to turn a negative statement into a question that expects a negative answer. ULT shows this by adding **is he?** Your language may have other ways of asking a question that expects a negative answer, for example, by changing the word order of a positive statement. Translate this in the way that would be clearest in your language. Alternate translation: “Can one person who is blind really guide another person who is blind?” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
LUK	6	39	kyt1	figs-rquestion	μήτι δύναται τυφλὸς τυφλὸν ὁδηγεῖν?	1	A blind man is not able to guide a blind man, is he?	Jesus is not expecting the people in the crowd to tell him whether one **blind** person can guide another. He is using the question form as a teaching tool, to make a point and get his listeners to reflect on it. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate his words as a statement. Alternate translation: “We all know that one blind person cannot guide another blind person” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	6	39	nm4v	figs-metaphor	τυφλὸς	1	blind man	The **blind** person figuratively represents someone who has not yet been fully trained and taught as a disciple. But since Jesus explains this figure in the next three verses, you do not need to explain it explicitly here in your own translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	6	39	f4xj	figs-rquestion	οὐχὶ ἀμφότεροι εἰς βόθυνον ἐμπεσοῦνται?	1	Would not both fall into a pit?	Jesus is using this question as well as a teaching tool. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate his words as a statement. Alternate translation: “Both of them would certainly fall into a ditch” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	6	40	ipr9	figs-metaphor	οὐκ ἔστιν μαθητὴς ὑπὲρ τὸν διδάσκαλον	1	A disciple is not above his teacher	The word **above** creates a spatial metaphor. Alternate translation: “A disciple is not better than his teacher” or “A disciple is not greater than his teacher” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	6	40	l324	figs-explicit	οὐκ ἔστιν μαθητὴς ὑπὲρ τὸν διδάσκαλον	1	A disciple is not above his teacher	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state what this implicitly means. Alternate translation: “A disciple does not know more than his teacher” or “A disciple is not wiser than his teacher” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	6	40	a6ym	figs-activepassive	κατηρτισμένος…πᾶς	1	everyone having been fully trained	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “every disciple whose teacher has fully taught him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	6	41	l7vj	figs-rquestion	τί…βλέπεις τὸ κάρφος τὸ ἐν τῷ ὀφθαλμῷ τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ σου, τὴν δὲ δοκὸν τὴν ἐν τῷ ἰδίῳ ὀφθαλμῷ οὐ κατανοεῖς?	1	why do you look at the speck of wood that is in the eye of your brother, but you do not notice the log that is in your own eye?	Jesus is using this question as a teaching tool. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could translate his words as a statement. Alternate translation: “do not look at the speck in your brother’s eye while ignoring the log in your own eye” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	6	41	jpt3	figs-metaphor	τί…βλέπεις τὸ κάρφος τὸ ἐν τῷ ὀφθαλμῷ τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ σου	1	why do you look at the speck of wood that is in the eye of your brother	This is a metaphor. Alternate translation: “you should not criticize the less important faults of a fellow believer” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	6	41	l325	figs-youcrowd	βλέπεις…σου…τῷ ἰδίῳ…οὐ κατανοεῖς	1	you look…your…you do not notice…your own	Even though Jesus is still speaking to his disciples and the crowd, he is addressing an individual situation here, so **you** and **your** are singular in this verse. But if the singular forms of these pronouns would not be natural in your language, you can use the plural forms in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd]])
LUK	6	41	j1r5	translate-unknown	κάρφος	1	the speck of wood	If your readers would not be familiar with **wood**, in your translation you can use a phrase that describes the smallest thing that commonly falls into a person’s eyes in your culture, or you can use a general expression. Alternate translation: “the grain of sand” or “the tiny object” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	6	41	ud6q	figs-metaphor	τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ	1	your brother	The term **brother** figuratively refers to a fellow believer in Jesus. Alternate translation: “a fellow believer” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	6	41	l326	figs-gendernotations	τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ	1	your brother	This fellow believer could be either a man or a woman, so be sure that this is clear in your translation, for example, by using both the masculine and feminine forms of the word for “believer.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
LUK	6	41	ssu3	figs-metaphor	τὴν δὲ δοκὸν τὴν ἐν τῷ ἰδίῳ ὀφθαλμῷ οὐ κατανοεῖς	1	but you do not notice the log that is in your own eye	This is a metaphor. Alternate translation: “while ignoring your own serious faults” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	6	41	l327	figs-hyperbole	τὴν…δοκὸν τὴν ἐν τῷ ἰδίῳ ὀφθαλμῷ	1	the log that is in your own eye	A log could not literally go into a person’s eye. Jesus is exaggerating to emphasize his point and make it memorable. Alternate translation: “your own serious faults” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
LUK	6	41	h9a4	translate-unknown	δοκὸν	1	the log	You could translate this with the term for the kind of long, large piece of **wood** that people in your culture would encounter. Or if your readers would not be familiar with **wood**, you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “the beam” or “the plank” or “the large object” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	6	42	l345	figs-youcrowd	πῶς δύνασαι λέγειν τῷ ἀδελφῷ σου	1	How can you say to your brother	Jesus is speaking to his disciples and the crowd, but he is addressing an individual situation, so **you** and **your** are singular here. (The terms **you**, **your**, and **yourself** are also singular throughout the rest of this verse, because either Jesus is addressing an individual situation, or one person is addressing another in fictional dialogue.) If the singular forms of these pronouns would not be natural in your language, you can use the plural forms in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd]])
LUK	6	42	rkk6	figs-rquestion	πῶς δύνασαι λέγειν	1	How can you say	Jesus is using this question as a teaching tool, not to ask for information. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could translate his words as a statement. Alternate translation: “You should not say” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	6	42	l346	figs-metaphor	τῷ ἀδελφῷ σου, ἀδελφέ, ἄφες	1	to your brother, ‘Brother, let me’	The term **brother** figuratively means a fellow believer in Jesus. So in its first instance here, you could translate the term the way you did in [6:41](../06/41.md). But since it is realistic that in dialogue one believer might address another believer as **Brother** or “Sister,” you could retain the figurative term in its second instance. Alternate translation: “to a fellow believer, ‘Brother,’ or ‘Sister, let me’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	6	42	l328	figs-metaphor	ἄφες ἐκβάλω τὸ κάρφος τὸ ἐν τῷ ὀφθαλμῷ σου	1	let me take out the speck of wood that is in your eye	This is a metaphor. Alternate translation: “let me help you correct some of your faults” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	6	42	l329	figs-metaphor	αὐτὸς τὴν ἐν τῷ ὀφθαλμῷ σοῦ δοκὸν οὐ βλέπων	1	you yourself do not see the log that is in your own eye	This is a metaphor. Alternate translation: “you yourself are not correcting your own serious faults” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	6	42	l330	figs-hyperbole	τὴν ἐν τῷ ὀφθαλμῷ σοῦ δοκὸν	1	the log that is in your own eye	A log could not literally go into a person’s eye. Jesus is continuing to exaggerate to emphasize his point and make it memorable. Alternate translation: “your own serious faults” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
LUK	6	42	l331	figs-metaphor	ἔκβαλε πρῶτον τὴν δοκὸν ἐκ τοῦ ὀφθαλμοῦ σοῦ	1	first take out the log from your own eye	This is a metaphor. Alternate translation: “first recognize and correct your own serious faults” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	6	42	l332	figs-metaphor	τὸ κάρφος τὸ ἐν τῷ ὀφθαλμῷ τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ σου ἐκβαλεῖν	1	take out the speck of wood that is in the eye of your brother	This is a metaphor. Alternate translation: “help a fellow believer correct his or her faults” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	6	43	ezb4	grammar-connect-logic-result	γάρ	1	For	Jesus uses this word to introduce the reason for what the previous sentence said. Alternate translation: “This is because” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
LUK	6	43	u159	figs-litotes	οὐ…ἐστιν δένδρον καλὸν ποιοῦν καρπὸν σαπρόν	1	there is no good tree that produces rotten fruit	Jesus is using a figure of speech that expresses a positive meaning by using a negative word together with a word that is the opposite of the intended meaning. Alternate translation: “a healthy tree naturally produces good fruit” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
LUK	6	43	pi3u	figs-metaphor	οὐ…ἐστιν δένδρον καλὸν ποιοῦν καρπὸν σαπρόν	1	there is no good tree that produces rotten fruit	This is a metaphor. Alternate translation: “a person of good character naturally says and does helpful things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	6	43	l333	figs-litotes	οὐδὲ…δένδρον σαπρὸν ποιοῦν καρπὸν καλόν	1	nor…any rotten tree that produces good fruit	Jesus is once again expressing a positive meaning figuratively by using a negative word together with a word that is the opposite of the intended meaning. Alternate translation: “an unhealthy tree naturally produces bad fruit” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
LUK	6	43	l334	figs-metaphor	οὐδὲ…δένδρον σαπρὸν ποιοῦν καρπὸν καλόν	1	nor…any rotten tree that produces good fruit	This is a metaphor. Alternate translation: “but a person of bad character naturally says and does harmful things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	6	44	z1vz	figs-activepassive	ἕκαστον…δένδρον ἐκ τοῦ ἰδίου καρποῦ γινώσκεται	1	each tree is known by its own fruit	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who does the action. Alternate translation: “people recognize a tree by the fruit that it bears” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	6	44	l335	figs-metaphor	ἕκαστον…δένδρον ἐκ τοῦ ἰδίου καρποῦ γινώσκεται	1	each tree is known by its own fruit	This is a metaphor. Alternate translation: “each person’s words and actions reveal his or her character” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	6	44	l336	figs-parallelism	οὐ γὰρ ἐξ ἀκανθῶν συλλέγουσιν σῦκα, οὐδὲ ἐκ βάτου σταφυλὴν τρυγῶσιν	1	they do not gather figs from a thornbush, nor do they gather grapes from a briar bush	These two phrases mean the same thing. Jesus is using repetition for emphasis and to capture the interest of his listeners. You do not need to put both phrases in your translation if that might be confusing for your readers. Instead, you could combine them into a single general expression. Alternate translation: “people do not collect the kind fruit that grows on a tree or a vine from a small, thorny bush” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
LUK	6	44	ns81	translate-unknown	ἀκανθῶν	1	a thornbush	This term refers to a kind of plant that has sharp protective spines on its stem. If your readers would not know what a **thornbush** is, in your translation you could use the name of another plant that does not produce edible fruit. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	6	44	ux87	translate-unknown	βάτου	1	a briar bush	This term refers to a kind of plant that has thorny stems growing in dense clusters. If your readers would not know what a **briar bush** is, in your translation you could use the name of another plant that does not produce edible fruit. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	6	45	fd19	figs-gendernotations	ὁ ἀγαθὸς ἄνθρωπος	1	The good man	The word **man** here refers to any person, male or female. Alternate translation: “A righteous person” or “a moral person” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
LUK	6	45	kz5k	figs-metaphor	ἐκ τοῦ ἀγαθοῦ θησαυροῦ τῆς καρδίας	1	from the good treasure of his heart	Jesus is speaking figuratively of the good thoughts of a righteous person as if they were treasures stored deep inside that person. Alternate translation: “the good things that he keeps deep inside himself” or “the good things that he values deeply” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	6	45	i93l	figs-metaphor	τῆς καρδίας	1	of his heart	In this expression, the **heart** figuratively represents the thoughts and emotions. Alternate translation: “that he keeps deep inside himself” or “that he values deeply” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	6	45	gpn9	figs-metaphor	προφέρει τὸ ἀγαθόν	1	produces what is good	Producing what is good, the way a tree would produce fruit, is a metaphor for doing what is good. Alternate translation: “does what is good” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	6	45	l337	figs-ellipsis	ἐκ τοῦ πονηροῦ	1	from evil	For rhetorical purposes, Jesus is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would ordinarily need in order to be complete. The meaning can be inferred from earlier in the sentence. Alternate translation: “from the evil treasure of his heart” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
LUK	6	45	y2cj	figs-metaphor	ἐκ τοῦ πονηροῦ	1	from evil	Once the meaning is inferred, it is clear that Jesus is speaking figuratively of the evil thoughts of a wicked person as if they were treasures stored deep inside that person, and of the **heart** figuratively to represent the thoughts and emotions. Alternate translation: “from the evil things that he keeps deep inside himself” or “from the evil things that he values deeply” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	6	45	l338	figs-metaphor	ἐκ…περισσεύματος καρδίας λαλεῖ τὸ στόμα αὐτοῦ	1	out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks	In this expression as well, the **heart** figuratively represents the thoughts and emotions. Alternate translation: “what a person is thinking and feeling is expressed in what he says” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	6	45	jc6z	figs-synecdoche	ἐκ…περισσεύματος καρδίας λαλεῖ τὸ στόμα αὐτοῦ	1	out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks	The phrase **his mouth** represents the person as a whole, in the action of speaking. Alternate translation: “what a person is thinking and feeling comes out in what he says” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
LUK	6	46	a4av		τί…με καλεῖτε Κύριε, Κύριε	1	why do you call me, ‘Lord, Lord’	The repetition of these words indicates that these people regularly called Jesus **Lord**. Alternate translation: “why are you always calling me ‘Lord’”
LUK	6	47	wwu5		πᾶς ὁ ἐρχόμενος πρός με…ὑποδείξω ὑμῖν τίνι ἐστὶν ὅμοιος	1	Everyone who is coming to me…I will show you what he is like	If it would be clearer in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases. Alternate translation: “I will tell you what every person is like who comes to me”
LUK	6	47	l339	figs-metonymy	μου τῶν λόγων	1	my words	Jesus uses the term **words** figuratively to refer to the teachings he is giving by using words. Alternate translation: “my teachings” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	6	47	i3tg	figs-simile	ὑποδείξω ὑμῖν τίνι ἐστὶν ὅμοιος	1	I will show you what he is like	Jesus says this to introduce the simile in the next verse. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
LUK	6	48	l340	figs-gendernotations	ἀνθρώπῳ οἰκοδομοῦντι οἰκίαν	1	a man building a house	Jesus is using the word **man** in the generic sense here. Alternate translation: “a person building a house” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
LUK	6	48	cw41	translate-unknown	ἔσκαψεν καὶ ἐβάθυνεν καὶ ἔθηκεν θεμέλιον ἐπὶ τὴν πέτραν	1	dug down and dug deep and laid a foundation on the rock	The **foundation** is the part of a **house** that connects it to the ground. People in Jesus’ time dug down into the ground until they reached a layer of solid **rock**, and then they began to build **on the rock**. You could describe this more fully in your translation. Alternatively, if the people of your culture would not be familiar with laying the **foundation** of a **house** on bedrock, you could instead describe how they would ensure that a dwelling was safe and stable. Alternate translation: “dug down deep enough to reach a layer of solid rock and set the foundation of the house on it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	6	48	l341	figs-hendiadys	ἔσκαψεν καὶ ἐβάθυνεν	1	dug down and dug deep	This phrase expresses a single idea by using two words connected with **and.** The expression **dug deep** tells what goal the person had when he or she **dug down**.

LUK	6	48	tu5j	figs-activepassive	διὰ τὸ καλῶς οἰκοδομῆσθαι αὐτήν	1	because it had been built well	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who did the action. Alternate translation: “because the person had built it well” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	6	49	sjf5	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	δὲ	1	But	Jesus uses this word to draw a strong contrast to the previous person who built with a foundation. Alternate translation: “However” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])

You could describe this more fully in your translation. Alternatively, if the people of your culture would not be familiar with that building method, you can use the same image for creating a stable building that you used there in your translation.

LUK	7	intro	u8gj			0		# Luke 07 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>1. Jesus does miracles in Capernaum and Nain (7:1–17)<br>2. Jesus responds to messengers from John the Baptist and then teaches about John (7:18–35)<br>3. A woman anoints Jesus with perfume (7:36–50)<br><br>Some translations set quotations from the Old Testament farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text. ULT does this with the quoted material in 7:27.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Centurion<br><br>A centurion was a Roman military commander. The centurion who asked Jesus to heal his slave (Luke 7:2) was doing some unusual things. A Roman soldier, especially an officer, would almost never go to a Jew for help, and most wealthy people did not love or care for their slaves. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/centurion]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]])<br><br>### John’s Baptism<br><br>This chapter refers again to the baptism of John (7:29). John baptized people who wanted to show that they knew they were sinners and that they were sorry for their sin. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/repent]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])<br><br>### “Sinners”<br><br>In 7:34, Jesus describes how the Pharisees said he was a friend of “sinners.” These Jewish leaders thought that such people did not understand the law of Moses, and so they were disobeying it. That is why they called them “sinners.” In reality, it was the leaders who were sinful, because they rejected Jesus, the Savior whom God had sent. This situation can be understood as irony. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])<br><br>### Washing feet<br><br>The feet of the people in the ancient Near East were very dirty because they wore sandals and the roads and trails were dusty and muddy. Only slaves washed other people’s feet. The woman who washed Jesus’ feet was showing him great honor.

LUK	7	5	cny7	figs-inclusive	τὸ ἔθνος ἡμῶν	1	our nation	This refers to the Jewish people.

LUK	7	6	l350	grammar-connect-logic-result	δὲ	1	And	Luke uses this word to show that Jesus went with the elders either after they pleaded with him, which ULT indicates with “Then,” or because they pleaded with him, which UST indicates with “So.” Use the expression in your translation that you think will be clearest for your readers.

LUK	7	6	ez29	figs-idiom	ὑπὸ τὴν στέγην μου εἰσέλθῃς	1	that you would come under my roof	This phrase **come under my roof** is an idiom that means “come into my house.” If your language has an idiom that means “come into my dwelling,” consider using it here in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	7	7	m9ue	figs-metonymy	εἰπὲ λόγῳ	1	speak with a word	The centurion understood that Jesus could heal the servant just by speaking. Jesus did not need to travel all the way to his home. The term **word** expresses the means by which Jesus would speak. Alternate translation: “just give a command” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	7	7	m6v8		ὁ παῖς μου	1	my servant	This is not the same word for **servant** that Luke and the centurion use in the rest of this passage.

LUK	7	9	tpz9	writing-pronouns	ἐθαύμασεν αὐτόν	1	he marveled at him	The term **him** refers to the centurion. Alternate translation: “he was amazed at the centurion” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])

He did not expect Gentiles to have this kind of **faith**, yet this man did. It may be helpful to say this explicitly in your translation. Alternate translation: “I have not found anyone among the Israelites who trusts me as much as this Gentile does” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	7	9	l351	figs-metonymy	οὐδὲ ἐν τῷ Ἰσραὴλ	1	not even in Israel	Jesus used the name of the nation, **Israel**, to represent the people who belong to that nation. Alternate translation: “not…anyone among the Israelites” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	7	9	l352	figs-idiom	τοσαύτην πίστιν εὗρον	1	have I found such faith	The term **found** is an idiom here. The word does not suggest that Jesus was searching for something he had lost. Alternate translation: “have I encountered such faith” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	7	10	g4ny	figs-activepassive	οἱ πεμφθέντες	1	those who had been sent	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who did the action. Alternate translation: “the friends whom the Roman officer had sent to Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	7	11	l353	writing-newevent	καὶ ἐγένετο	1	And it happened	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
LUK	7	11	l354	figs-idiom	ἐν τῷ ἑξῆς	1	on the next day	This expression could mean literally the next day, as ULT says, or Luke may be using the term **day** figuratively to refer a particular time, as UST suggests by saying “soon after that.” You could say either thing in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	7	11	dmz7	translate-names	Ναΐν	1	Nain	This is the name of a city. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

LUK	7	12	l356	figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	behold	Luke uses the term **behold** to calls the reader’s attention to what he is about to say. Your language may have a similar expression that you can use here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	7	12	l357	writing-participants	ἐξεκομίζετο τεθνηκὼς	1	one who had died was being carried out	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new character into the story. If your language has its own way of doing that, you can use it here in your translation. Alternate translation: “there was a man who had died, and he was being carried out of the city” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
LUK	7	12	zr69	figs-activepassive	ἐξεκομίζετο τεθνηκὼς	1	one who had died was being carried out	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who was doing the action.

LUK	7	12	l358	figs-explicit	ἐξεκομίζετο	1	was being carried out	Luke assumes that his readers will know that the people were carrying the man out of the city in order to bury him.

LUK	7	12	i5iv	figs-explicit	μονογενὴς υἱὸς τῇ μητρὶ αὐτοῦ; καὶ αὐτὴ ἦν χήρα	1	the only begotten son of his mother (and she was a widow)	The implication is that in this culture, when her son died, the woman lost her only means of support, since her husband had also died. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “Now he was his mother’s only son, and she was a widow, so he had been her only means of support” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	7	13	l359		ὁ Κύριος	1	the Lord	Luke refers to Jesus here by a respectful title. Alternate translation: “Jesus” or “the Lord Jesus”
LUK	7	13	fa42	figs-explicit	ἐσπλαγχνίσθη ἐπ’ αὐτῇ	1	was moved with compassion for her	The implication is that feeling compassion led Jesus to want to do something for this woman.

LUK	7	14	quy9	translate-unknown	τῆς σοροῦ	1	the bier	This was a stretcher or bed used to move the body to the burial place. It was not necessarily something in which the body was buried.

LUK	7	16	rf1k	figs-personification	ἔλαβεν…φόβος πάντας	1	fear seized all of them	Luke speaks of this **fear** figuratively as if it were something that could actively take hold of everyone in the crowd. Alternate translation: “they all became very afraid” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
LUK	7	16	l361	figs-idiom	προφήτης μέγας ἠγέρθη ἐν ἡμῖν	1	A great prophet has been raised among us	The term **raised** here is an idiom. Alternate translation: “God has caused one of us to become a great prophet” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

LUK	7	17	g4zt	figs-personification	ἐξῆλθεν ὁ λόγος οὗτος…περὶ αὐτοῦ	1	this word about him went out	Luke speaks figuratively of this **word** (that is, those sayings) as if it were something that could spread around actively by itself. His expression means that people said these things about Jesus to other people, and those people then repeated them to still more people. Alternate translation: “people spread these sayings about Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
LUK	7	18	r11g	writing-newevent	ἀπήγγειλαν Ἰωάννῃ οἱ μαθηταὶ αὐτοῦ περὶ πάντων τούτων	1	his disciples reported to John concerning all these things	This sentence introduces a new event in the story.

LUK	7	18	r11g	writing-newevent	οἱ μαθηταὶ αὐτοῦ	1	his disciples	The term **his** refers to John the Baptist, not to Jesus. Alternate translation: “the disciples of John” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
LUK	7	18	l362	figs-explicit	Ἰωάννῃ	1	John	Luke assumes that his readers will know he is referring to John the Baptist. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “John the Baptist” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	7	18	jf5m	figs-explicit	πάντων τούτων	1	all these things	The implication is that this refers to Jesus healing the centurion’s servant and restoring the life of the widow’s son. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “all the things that Jesus had just done” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

LUK	7	19	l364		λέγων	1	to say	Alternate translation: “to ask”

LUK	7	19	l400	figs-explicit	ὁ ἐρχόμενος	1	the one who is coming	This expression implicitly means “the Messiah.” If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “the Messiah” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

Alternate translation: “the men told Jesus that John the Baptist had sent them to him to ask, ‘Are you the one who is coming, or should we expect someone else?’” or “the men said, ‘John the Baptist has sent us to you to ask if you are the one who is coming, or whether we expect someone else.’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	7	20	l366	translate-names	Ἰωάννης ὁ Βαπτιστὴς	1	John the Baptist	John’s disciples use the term **Baptist** here as a title to identify the man named John who had sent them. The term means “one who baptizes.” Because the word “Baptist” is associated with a group of churches in many parts of the world, if it would be clearer in your language, you could use a different form of the word as a title, as UST does. Alternatively, you could use a phrase. Alternate translation: “John the Baptizer” or “John, the one who baptizes” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	7	20	l367		λέγων	1	to say	Alternate translation: “to ask”

LUK	7	21	ys1b	figs-idiom	ἐν ἐκείνῃ τῇ ὥρᾳ	1	In that hour	Luke uses the term **hour** figuratively here to refer a specific time. Alternate translation: “At that time” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	7	21	a7sm	figs-ellipsis	ἐθεράπευσεν πολλοὺς ἀπὸ νόσων, καὶ μαστίγων, καὶ πνευμάτων πονηρῶν	1	healed many from sicknesses and afflictions and evil spirits	Luke is telling the story in a compressed way here, and he does not distinguish clearly between healing of sickness and deliverance from evil spirits. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could make that distinction more explicitly. Alternate translation: “he healed many people of sicknesses that they were suffering from, and he drove evil spirits out of many people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
LUK	7	21	l370	figs-hendiadys	νόσων, καὶ μαστίγων	1	sicknesses and afflictions	The phrase **sicknesses and afflictions** expresses a single idea by using two words connected with **and.** The word **afflictions** describes the effect of the **sicknesses** on the people who had them.

Alternate translation: “sicknesses that they were suffering from” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])

LUK	7	22	lcm2	figs-hendiadys	ἀποκριθεὶς εἶπεν αὐτοῖς	1	answering he said to them	Together the words **answering** and **said** mean that after healing and delivering many people, Jesus responded to the question that John’s messengers had asked him. Alternate translation: “Jesus responded to the messengers whom John had sent” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
LUK	7	22	l372	figs-youdual	πορευθέντες…εἴδετε	1	you have gone…you have seen	Since Jesus is speaking to two men, **you** would be dual, if your language uses that form. Otherwise, the word would be plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
LUK	7	22	fvz7	figs-activepassive	λεπροὶ καθαρίζονται…νεκροὶ ἐγείρονται, πτωχοὶ εὐαγγελίζονται	1	lepers are being cleansed…the dead are being raised back to life, the poor are being told the gospel	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say all of these things with active forms. Alternate translation: “people who had leprosy no longer have that disease…people who were dead are coming back to life, poor people are hearing the good news” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	7	22	l373	figs-explicit	λεπροὶ καθαρίζονται	1	lepers are being cleansed	As in [5:12](../05/12.md), since the lepers were unclean because of their leprosy, the implication is that Jesus healed them from the disease. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “people who had leprosy no longer have that disease” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	7	22	qbe3	figs-nominaladj	κωφοὶ…νεκροὶ…πτωχοὶ	1	the deaf…the dead…the poor	Luke is using these adjectives as nouns. If your language does not use adjectives that way, you can translate them with noun phrases. Alternate translation: “people who were deaf…people who were dead…poor people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
LUK	7	23	y4px	figs-activepassive	μακάριός ἐστιν ὃς ἐὰν μὴ σκανδαλισθῇ ἐν ἐμοί	1	blessed is anyone who is not offended by me	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “God will bless the person who always continues to trust me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	7	23	i7zh	figs-litotes	μὴ σκανδαλισθῇ ἐν ἐμοί	1	who is not offended by me	Jesus is using a figure of speech here that expresses a strong positive meaning by using a negative word together with a word that is the opposite of the intended meaning. Alternate translation: “who always continues to trust me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
LUK	7	24	abcd	writing-pronouns	ἤρξατο λέγειν	1	he began to say	The word **he** refers to Jesus here. Alternate translation: “Jesus began to say” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
LUK	7	24	h9dw	figs-rquestion	τί ἐξήλθατε εἰς τὴν ἔρημον θεάσασθαι? κάλαμον ὑπὸ ἀνέμου σαλευόμενον?	1	What did you go out into the desert to see? A reed shaken by the wind?	Jesus is using these questions as a teaching tool. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could show that consequently he expects a negative answer. You could also translate these words as a statement. Alternate translation: “Did you go out into the desert just to see a reed that the wind was shaking? Of course not!” or “Surely you did not go out into the desert just to see a reed that the wind was shaking.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	7	24	l374	figs-activepassive	κάλαμον ὑπὸ ἀνέμου σαλευόμενον	1	A reed shaken by the wind	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “A reed that the wind was shaking” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	7	24	gbv9	figs-explicit	κάλαμον ὑπὸ ἀνέμου σαλευόμενον	1	A reed shaken by the wind	The implication seems to be that a reed swaying in the breeze by the banks of the Jordan River is a commonplace sight that no one would make a trip out into the desert just to see. Alternate translation: “An ordinary thing such as a reed that the wind was shaking” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	7	25	tcp3	figs-rquestion	ἀλλὰ τί ἐξήλθατε ἰδεῖν? ἄνθρωπον ἐν μαλακοῖς ἱματίοις ἠμφιεσμένον?	1	But what did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothes?	Jesus is using these questions as a teaching tool. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could show that consequently he expects a negative answer. You could also translate these words as a statement. Alternate translation: “Did you go out to see a man wearing splendid clothing? Of course not!” or “You certainly did not go out to see a man wearing splendid clothing.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	7	25	a1wu	figs-explicit	ἄνθρωπον ἐν μαλακοῖς ἱματίοις ἠμφιεσμένον?	1	A man dressed in soft clothes?	Luke assumes that readers will know that John wore crude, rugged clothing. Like his residence in the desert, his clothing was a symbolic protest against the established order. As such, it would have been offensive rather than attractive. So no one would have gone out to see a person dressed that way. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “A man wearing splendid clothing? You would not have gone to hear John if that was what you wanted to see” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	7	25	l375	figs-explicit	ἐν μαλακοῖς ἱματίοις ἠμφιεσμένον	1	dressed in soft clothes	This refers to luxurious clothes, since normal clothing was rough. Alternate translation: “wearing splendid clothing” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	7	25	l376	figs-activepassive	ἐν μαλακοῖς ἱματίοις ἠμφιεσμένον	1	dressed in soft clothes	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “wearing splendid clothing” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	7	25	l377	figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	behold	Jesus uses the term **behold** to get the crowd to focus their attention on what he is about to say. Alternate translation: “listen carefully now” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	7	25	nn75	figs-explicit	τοῖς βασιλείοις	1	king’s palaces	A palace is a large, elaborate house where a king or queen would live. The implication is that a celebrity-watcher might go to a palace to try to catch a glimpse of royalty. But certainly no one would go out into the desert to try to see someone famous. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	7	26	ym8l	figs-rquestion	ἀλλὰ τί ἐξήλθατε ἰδεῖν? προφήτην?	1	But what did you go out to see? A prophet?	Jesus is giving the answer to the repeated question that he has been using as a teaching tool. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could show that this time the question leads to a positive answer. You could also translate this as a statement. Alternate translation: “Did you go out to see a prophet? Yes, that was why!” or “You actually went out to see a prophet.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	7	26	ix16		ναί, λέγω ὑμῖν	1	Yes, I say to you	Jesus says this to emphasize the importance of what he will say next. Alternate translation: “Now listen carefully”
LUK	7	26	r7ud	figs-idiom	περισσότερον προφήτου	1	more than a prophet	This is an idiom that means that John was indeed a prophet, but that he was even greater than a typical prophet. Alternate translation: “not just an ordinary prophet” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	7	27	cg3r	figs-activepassive	οὗτός ἐστιν περὶ οὗ γέγραπται	1	This is he concerning whom it is written	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who did the action. Alternate translation: “This is the one about whom one of the prophets wrote” or “John is the one about whom the prophet Malachi wrote” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	7	27	wt2m	figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	Behold	God, speaking through the prophet Malachi, uses the term **Behold** to emphasize the importance of what he is about to say. Alternate translation: “Now pay attention” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	7	27	s8hg	figs-metaphor	πρὸ προσώπου σου	1	before your face	The term **face** figuratively means the front of a person. Alternate translation: “ahead of you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	7	27	cc5u	figs-you	σου…σου	1	your…you	The words **your** and **you** are singular in both cases because God is speaking to the Messiah individually in the quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
LUK	7	27	l378	figs-metaphor	ὃς κατασκευάσει τὴν ὁδόν σου ἔμπροσθέν σου	1	who will prepare your way before you	While this literally means “prepare a good road for you to travel on,” as in [3:4](../03/04.md) this actually means figuratively to help get people ready for the coming of the Messiah. Alternate translation: “who will help people get ready for you to come” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	7	28	yz6b		λέγω ὑμῖν	1	I say to you	Jesus uses this phrase to focus the crowd’s attention on what he will say next. Alternate translation: “Now listen carefully”
LUK	7	28	rr11	figs-idiom	ἐν γεννητοῖς γυναικῶν	1	among those born of women	This is an idiom that refers to all people. Alternate translation: “of all the people who have ever lived” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	7	28	gfz7	figs-litotes	μείζων…Ἰωάννου οὐδείς ἐστιν	1	no one is greater than John	Jesus is using a figure of speech here that expresses a strong positive meaning by using a negative term together with a word that is the opposite of the intended meaning. Alternate translation: “John is the greatest” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
LUK	7	28	c33u	figs-nominaladj	ὁ…μικρότερος	1	the least	Jesus is using the adjective **least** as a noun, to refer to kind of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “the least important person” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
LUK	7	28	l379	figs-abstractnouns	ἐν τῇ Βασιλείᾳ τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	in the kingdom of God	See how you decided to translate the phrase **the kingdom of God** in [4:43](../04/43.md). If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **kingdom** with a verb such as “rule.” Alternate translation: “whose life God is ruling” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
LUK	7	28	r81b	figs-explicit	μείζων αὐτοῦ ἐστιν	1	is greater than he	The implication is that being part of the kingdom of God is greater than any human distinctive. So anyone who is part of God’s kingdom is greater than even John, whom Jesus said was the greatest person who had ever lived before the coming of the kingdom. Alternate translation: “is greater than John is because they are part of something greater than anything that is human” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	7	29	idv8	grammar-connect-logic-result	ἐδικαίωσαν τὸν Θεόν, βαπτισθέντες τὸ βάπτισμα Ἰωάννου	1	declared God to be righteous, having been baptized with the baptism of John	If it would be clearer in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the action that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “because they had come to John for baptism, declared God to be righteous” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
LUK	7	29	m5cn	figs-explicit	ἐδικαίωσαν τὸν Θεόν	1	declared God to be righteous	The implication is that the people agreed that God had been right to send John to tell them to repent of their sins. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “agreed that God had been right to send John to tell them to repent of their sins” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	7	29	s9v6	figs-activepassive	βαπτισθέντες τὸ βάπτισμα Ἰωάννου	1	having been baptized with the baptism of John	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “because they had come to John for baptism” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	7	30	l380	translate-unknown	νομικοὶ	1	lawyers	Here and elsewhere in the book, the term **lawyer** does not mean someone who would represent clients and argue cases in court or draw up legal documents. Rather, it refers to an expert in the law of Moses and its application to various situations. Alternate translation: “experts in the Jewish law” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	7	30	v8f5	grammar-connect-logic-result	τὴν βουλὴν τοῦ Θεοῦ ἠθέτησαν εἰς ἑαυτούς, μὴ βαπτισθέντες ὑπ’ αὐτοῦ	1	rejected the purpose of God for themselves, not having been baptized by him	If it would be clearer in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the action that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “because they had not come to John for baptism, rejected what God wanted them to do” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
LUK	7	30	wqc3	figs-activepassive	μὴ βαπτισθέντες ὑπ’ αὐτοῦ	1	not having been baptized by him	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “because John had not baptized them” or “because they had not come to John for baptism” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	7	31	cs1j	figs-rquestion	τίνι οὖν ὁμοιώσω τοὺς ἀνθρώπους τῆς γενεᾶς ταύτης, καὶ τίνι εἰσὶν ὅμοιοι?	1	To what, then, will I compare the men of this generation? And what are they like?	Jesus is using these questions as a teaching tool, to introduce a comparison. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate them as statements. Alternate translation: “This is what I compare the people of this time to. This is what they are like” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	7	31	ix8z	figs-parallelism	τίνι οὖν ὁμοιώσω τοὺς ἀνθρώπους τῆς γενεᾶς ταύτης, καὶ τίνι εἰσὶν ὅμοιοι?	1	To what, then, will I compare the men of this generation? And what are they like?	These two phrases mean the same thing. Jesus is using repetition for emphasis and to capture the interest of his listeners. You do not need to put both phrases in your translation if that might be confusing for your readers. Alternate translation: “What should I compare the people of this time to?” or “This is what I compare the people of this time to” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
LUK	7	31	ec4k	figs-gendernotations	τοὺς ἀνθρώπους τῆς γενεᾶς ταύτης	1	the men of this generation	Jesus is using the term **men** in a generic sense that includes all people. Alternate translation: “the people of this generation” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
LUK	7	32	n8yp	figs-simile	ὅμοιοί εἰσιν	1	They are like	These words are the beginning of Jesus’ comparison. His opponents complain about John being too austere, and they complain about him not being austere enough, just like children who complain when other children don’t dance with them, and then complain again when they don’t cry with them. Since Jesus explains this comparison in the next two verses, you do not need to explain it here in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
LUK	7	32	f7hg	translate-unknown	ἀγορᾷ	1	marketplace	This means a large, open-air area where people come to sell their goods. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	7	32	l381	figs-metonymy	ηὐλήσαμεν ὑμῖν	1	We played a flute for you	The children are referring to the **flute** to indicate that they played a happy, upbeat tune, for which the **flute** was well suited. Alternate translation: “We played a happy tune for you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	7	32	xgg9	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	καὶ οὐκ ὠρχήσασθε	1	and you did not dance	The children are expressing a contrast between what they expected their playmates to do and what those playmates actually did. Alternate translation: “but you did not dance” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
LUK	7	32	m2k3	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	καὶ οὐκ ἐκλαύσατε	1	and you did not wail	Once again the children are expressing a contrast between what they expected their playmates to do and what those playmates actually did. Alternate translation: “but you did not cry” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
LUK	7	33	kbc7	figs-synecdoche	μὴ ἐσθίων ἄρτον	1	neither eating bread	This could mean one of two things. Either way, Jesus is using one kind of food, **bread**, figuratively to represent all kinds of food. (1) It could refer to the way that John lived on whatever he could find to eat in the desert. Alternate translation: “not eating regular food” (2) It could mean that John often went without eating as a devotional practice. Alternate translation: “frequently fasting” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
LUK	7	33	wka1	figs-quotesinquotes	λέγετε, δαιμόνιον ἔχει	1	you say, ‘He has a demon’	Luke is quoting Jesus, and Jesus is quoting what the Pharisees were saying about John. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “you say that he has a demon” or “you accuse him of having a demon” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	7	34	k33e	figs-123person	ὁ Υἱὸς τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου	1	the Son of Man	Jesus is referring to himself here in the third person. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this in the first person. Alternate translation: “I, the Son of Man” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
LUK	7	34	l382	figs-explicit	ὁ Υἱὸς τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου	1	the Son of Man	See how you translated this title in [5:24](../05/24.md). In this case the title highlights Jesus’ identification with humanity in the special role that God has given him. Alternate translation: “I, the Messiah” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	7	34	s1um	figs-quotesinquotes	λέγετε, ἰδοὺ, ἄνθρωπος φάγος καὶ οἰνοπότης, φίλος τελωνῶν καὶ ἁμαρτωλῶν	1	you say, ‘Behold, a man, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and of sinners!	Luke is quoting Jesus, and Jesus is quoting what the Pharisees were saying about him. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “you say that he eats and drinks too much and that he is a friend of tax collectors and sinners” or (if you used the first person for the title “Son of Man”) “you say that I eat and drink too much and that I am a friend of tax collectors and sinners” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	7	34	l383	figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	Behold	This term focuses the attention of the listener on what the speaker is about to say. Alternate translation: “Now this is” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	7	34	am9s		ἄνθρωπος φάγος	1	a man, a glutton	Alternate translation: “a man who is a glutton” or “a man who eats too much”
LUK	7	34	chu4		ἄνθρωπος…οἰνοπότης	1	a man,…a drunkard	Alternate translation: “a man who is a drunkard” or “a man who drinks too much alcohol”
LUK	7	35	ba4g	writing-proverbs	ἐδικαιώθη ἡ σοφία ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν τέκνων αὐτῆς	1	wisdom is justified by all her children	This appears to be a proverb, a short popular saying of the culture, that Jesus applied to this situation. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “the saying is true that wisdom is justified by all her children” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-proverbs]])
LUK	7	35	l384	figs-idiom	ἐδικαιώθη ἡ σοφία ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν τέκνων αὐτῆς	1	wisdom is justified by all her children	This proverb likely uses a Hebrew idiom in which the “sons” or **children** of a thing share its qualities. Alternate translation: “wisdom is justified by people who are wise themselves” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	7	35	l385	figs-activepassive	ἐδικαιώθη ἡ σοφία ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν τέκνων αὐτῆς	1	wisdom is justified by all her children	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “wise people recognize when someone else is following a wise course” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	7	36	fd2c	writing-newevent	ἠρώτα δέ τις αὐτὸν τῶν Φαρισαίων, ἵνα φάγῃ μετ’ αὐτοῦ	1	Then one of the Pharisees requested him to eat with him	This phrase introduces a new event. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
LUK	7	36	lhd4	writing-participants	τις…τῶν Φαρισαίων	1	one of the Pharisees	This phrase also introduces the Pharisee into the story. In [7:40](../07/40.md), Jesus addresses him as Simon. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could give his name here, as UST does. Alternate translation: “a Pharisee named Simon” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
LUK	7	36	dy31	translate-unknown	κατεκλίθη	1	he reclined to eat	See how you translated this in [5:29](../05/29.md). It was the custom in this culture for dinner guests to eat while lying comfortably around the table on banqueting couches. Alternate translation: “he took his place at the table” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	7	37	l386	figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	behold	Luke uses the term **behold** to calls the reader’s attention to what he is about to say. Your language may have a similar expression that you can use here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	7	37	a9iu	writing-participants	γυνὴ ἥτις ἦν ἐν τῇ πόλει	1	there was a woman in the city	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new character into the story. If your language has its own way of doing that, you can use it here in your translation. Alternate translation: “there was woman who lived in that city” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
LUK	7	37	x4sk	figs-explicit	ἁμαρτωλός	1	who was a sinner	Luke is speaking from the perspective of the Pharisee when he says that the woman was a **sinner**. Since the Pharisee would likely not have known her personally, this is an implicit reference to her reputation. She may have been a prostitute, as UST suggests. Alternate translation: “who had a reputation for living a sinful life” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	7	37	l387	figs-explicit	κομίσασα	1	she brought	In this culture, if people wanted to hear what someone’s special dinner guest had to say, they were allowed to come and stand around the walls of the banqueting hall and listen, even if they had not been invited to share in the meal. And so this woman was allowed to enter and listen to Jesus. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that specifically. Alternate translation: “she came into the banquet hall as a visitor, bringing” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	7	37	apx8	translate-unknown	ἀλάβαστρον	1	an alabaster jar	The word **alabaster** is the name of a soft, white stone. People stored precious and valuable items in jars made from alabaster. Alternate translation: “a jar made of soft, white stone” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	7	37	a954	translate-unknown	μύρου	1	of perfumed oil	This oil had fragrant additives. To make a nice smell, people would rub the oil on themselves or sprinkle their clothing with it. Alternate translation: “that contained oil with perfume in it” See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	7	38	v5xh	figs-explicitinfo	ταῖς θριξὶν τῆς κεφαλῆς αὐτῆς	1	with the hair of her head	In your language, it might seem that this phrase expresses unnecessary extra information. If so, you can abbreviate it. Alternate translation: “with her hair” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo]])
LUK	7	38	i93v		ἤλειφεν τῷ μύρῳ	1	anointing them with the perfumed oil	Alternate translation: “pouring perfume on them”
LUK	7	39	u455	figs-quotemarks	εἶπεν ἐν ἑαυτῷ λέγων	1	he said to himself, saying	As noted in [3:10](../03/10.md), Luke often uses the word **saying** to introduce a quotation. Particularly in cases like this one, if you indicate the quotation in some other way, such as with quotation marks, you do not need to represent this word in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
LUK	7	39	xc9v	grammar-connect-condition-contrary	οὗτος εἰ ἦν προφήτης, ἐγίνωσκεν ἂν τίς καὶ ποταπὴ ἡ γυνὴ, ἥτις ἅπτεται αὐτοῦ, ὅτι ἁμαρτωλός ἐστιν	1	If this man were a prophet, he would know who and of what type the woman is who is touching him, that she is a sinner	This Pharisee is making a conditional statement that sounds hypothetical, but he is already convinced that the condition is not true. He has concluded that Jesus must not be a prophet, because he allowed this sinful woman to touch him, and a prophet would have known she was sinful and not allowed that. Alternate translation: “Jesus must not be a prophet, because if he were, he would know that the woman who is touching him is a sinner” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-contrary]])
LUK	7	39	tbq3	figs-explicit	τίς καὶ ποταπὴ ἡ γυνὴ, ἥτις ἅπτεται αὐτοῦ, ὅτι ἁμαρτωλός ἐστιν	1	who and of what type the woman is who is touching him, that she is a sinner	Simon assumed that a prophet would never allow a sinner to touch him. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state his assumption explicitly. Alternate translation: “that this woman is a sinner, and he would not allow her to touch him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	7	40	l388	figs-hendiadys	ἀποκριθεὶς ὁ Ἰησοῦς εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτόν	1	answering Jesus said to him	Together the words **answering** and **said** mean that Jesus responded to what the Pharisee was thinking. Alternate translation: “Jesus responded to him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
LUK	7	40	u3cg	translate-names	Σίμων	1	Simon	This was the name of the Pharisee who invited Jesus into his home. This was not Simon Peter. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	7	40	l389		ὁ δέ, Διδάσκαλε, εἰπέ, φησίν	1	And he says, “Say it, Teacher!”	
LUK	7	40	l390	figs-imperative	Διδάσκαλε, εἰπέ	1	Say it, Teacher!	Simon is inviting Jesus to speak, not ordering him to speak. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could translate his words as more of an invitation. You could also translate them as a question, as UST does. Alternate translation: “Go ahead and say it.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
LUK	7	40	l391		Διδάσκαλε	1	Teacher	This was a respectful title. You can translate it with an equivalent term that your language and culture would use.
LUK	7	41	sv92	figs-parables	δύο χρεοφιλέται ἦσαν	1	There were two debtors	To help Simon the Pharisee understand what he wants to teach him, Jesus tells him a story. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “Then Jesus told him this story to help him understand. ‘There were two debtors’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])
LUK	7	41	fcq6		δύο χρεοφιλέται ἦσαν δανιστῇ τινι	1	There were two debtors to a certain moneylender	Alternate translation: “Two different people owed money to the same moneylender”
LUK	7	41	snz6	translate-bmoney	δηνάρια πεντακόσια	1	500 denarii	The word **denarii** is the plural of “denarius.” A denarius was a silver coin equivalent to a day’s wage. You could try to express this amount in terms of current monetary values, but that might cause your Bible translation to become outdated and inaccurate, since those values can change over time. So instead you might say something more general, or give the equivalent in wages. Alternate translation: “500 silver coins” or “an amount equivalent to a year and a half’s wages” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney]])
LUK	7	41	i92j	translate-bmoney	ὁ δὲ ἕτερος πεντήκοντα	1	and the other 50	Alternate translation: “the other person owed 50 silver coins” or “the other person owed an amount equal to 50 days’ wages” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney]])
LUK	7	42	l392	figs-ellipsis	μὴ ἐχόντων αὐτῶν ἀποδοῦναι	1	When they did not have to repay	Jesus is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages in order to be complete. He is not saying that the men no longer needed to repay these debts. Rather, he is saying that they did not have enough money to repay the lender what they owed him. Alternate translation: “When they were not able to repay their debts” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
LUK	7	42	lbq6	figs-idiom	ἀμφοτέροις ἐχαρίσατο	1	he forgave them both	This does not mean literally that the lender decided he would not hold their failure to repay against them. Rather, it is an idiom that means that he told them they did not have to repay the money. Alternate translation: “he canceled both of their debts” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	7	43	l393	figs-hendiadys	ἀποκριθεὶς Σίμων εἶπεν	1	Simon answering said	Together the words **answering** and **said** mean that Simon responded to the question that Jesus asked him. Alternate translation: “Simon responded” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
LUK	7	43	l394	figs-ellipsis	ὑπολαμβάνω ὅτι ᾧ τὸ πλεῖον ἐχαρίσατο	1	I suppose that the one to whom he forgave the most	Simon leaves out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages in order to be complete. Alternate translation: “I suppose that the one to whom he forgave the most will love him the most” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
LUK	7	43	uyj6		ὑπολαμβάνω	1	I suppose	Simon was cautious about his answer. Alternate translation: “Probably”

LUK	7	44	l395	figs-rquestion	βλέπεις ταύτην τὴν γυναῖκα?	1	Do you see this woman?	Jesus does not expect Simon to tell him whether he can **see** the **woman**. Rather, he is using the question as a teaching tool, to focus Simon’s attention on her as an example of showing love and gratitude. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate Jesus’ words as a statement. Alternate translation: “I want you to consider this woman.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	7	44	mw7d	figs-explicit	ὕδωρ μοι ἐπὶ πόδας οὐκ ἔδωκας	1	You did not give me water for my feet	It was a basic responsibility of a host to provide **water** and a towel for guests to wash and dry their **feet** after walking on dusty roads. Alternate translation: “You did not provide me with anything to wash my feet, as a considerate host would have done” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	7	44	mw58	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	οὐκ ἔδωκας; αὕτη δὲ	1	You did not give…but she	In this verse and the next two verses, Jesus uses such phrases to contrast Simon’s lack of courtesy with the woman’s extreme actions of gratitude. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
LUK	7	44	am5z	figs-explicit	αὕτη…τοῖς δάκρυσιν ἔβρεξέν μου τοὺς πόδας	1	she has wet my feet with her tears	The woman used **her tears** in place of the missing water.

LUK	7	44	ld62	figs-explicit	καὶ ταῖς θριξὶν αὐτῆς ἐξέμαξεν	1	and wiped them with her hair	The woman used **her hair** in place of the missing towel.

Alternate translation: “and she has dried my feet with her hair in place of the towel you did not provide” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	7	45	xj92	figs-explicit	φίλημά μοι οὐκ ἔδωκας	1	You did not give me a kiss	It was customary in this culture for a host to greet a guest with a **kiss** on the cheek. Simon did not do this for Jesus. Alternate translation: “You did not greet me with a kiss on the cheek, as a welcoming host would have done” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	7	45	r2jj	figs-doublenegatives	οὐ διέλιπεν καταφιλοῦσά μου τοὺς πόδας	1	has not stopped kissing my feet	If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a positive expression to translate this double negative that consists of the negative particle **not** and the negative verb **stopped**. Alternate translation: “has continued to kiss my feet” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
LUK	7	45	u3er	translate-symaction	οὐ διέλιπεν καταφιλοῦσά μου τοὺς πόδας	1	has not stopped kissing my feet	The woman kissed the **feet** of Jesus, rather than his cheek, as a sign of extreme repentance and humility. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “has continued to kiss my feet to show her repentance and humility” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
LUK	7	46	j8wj	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	οὐκ ἤλειψας; αὕτη δὲ	1	You did not anoint…but she	Jesus continues to contrast Simon’s poor hospitality with the actions of the woman. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
LUK	7	46	le9a	figs-explicit	ἐλαίῳ τὴν κεφαλήν μου…ἤλειψας	1	anoint my head with oil	It was the custom in this culture to welcome an honored guest by pouring refreshing olive **oil** on his **head**. Alternate translation: “welcome me by pouring oil on my head” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	7	46	g6va	translate-symaction	ἤλειψεν τοὺς πόδας μου	1	has anointed my feet	The woman greatly honored Jesus by doing this. She demonstrated humility and expressed her own sense of unworthiness by anointing his **feet** instead of his head. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “has anointed my feet to show her humility” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
LUK	7	47	kwc5		λέγω σοι	1	I say to you	This phrase emphasizes the importance of the statement that follows. Alternate translation: “pay attention to this”
LUK	7	47	clu2	figs-activepassive	ἀφέωνται αἱ ἁμαρτίαι αὐτῆς αἱ πολλαί	1	her sins, which were many, have been forgiven	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who has done the action. Alternate translation: “God has forgiven her many sins” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	7	47	jql4		ὅτι ἠγάπησεν πολύ	1	for she loved much	Your language may require you to state the object of **loved**. Alternate translation: “because she greatly loves the one who forgave her”
LUK	7	47	l396	figs-explicit	ὅτι ἠγάπησεν πολύ	1	for she loved much	The implication is that her display of love was the evidence that her sins were forgiven. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “We can tell this because she has shown that she greatly loves the one who forgave her” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	7	47	qd9q	figs-explicit	ᾧ δὲ ὀλίγον ἀφίεται, ὀλίγον ἀγαπᾷ	1	the one to whom little is forgiven loves little	In this sentence Jesus states a general principle. However, he is saying implicitly that Simon specifically has shown very little love for him. A further implication is that **one to whom little is forgiven** is actually someone who thinks he is better than others and does not need to be forgiven for very much, not realizing how much he needs to be forgiven for. Alternate translation: “the person who thinks that God has only had to forgive him for a few things does not show much love, just as you have done” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	7	47	l397	figs-activepassive	ᾧ…ὀλίγον ἀφίεται	1	the one to whom little is forgiven	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who has done the action.

LUK	7	48	c7hj	writing-pronouns	εἶπεν δὲ αὐτῇ	1	Then he said to her	The word **he** refers to Jesus, not to Simon. The word **her** refers to the woman. Alternate translation: “Then Jesus said to the woman” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
LUK	7	48	lq5v	figs-activepassive	ἀφέωνταί σου αἱ ἁμαρτίαι	1	Your sins are forgiven	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who has done the action.

LUK	7	49	enw4		συνανακείμενοι	1	reclining with him to eat	Alternate translation: “who were eating together with him”
LUK	7	49	ie4z	figs-rquestion	τίς οὗτός ἐστιν ὃς καὶ ἁμαρτίας ἀφίησιν?	1	Who is this who even forgives sins?	The religious leaders knew that only God could forgive sins. They did not believe that Jesus was God. So they are using the question form to make an accusation. Alternate translation: “This man is not God, so he cannot forgive sins!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	7	50	lje8	figs-abstractnouns	ἡ πίστις σου σέσωκέν σε	1	Your faith has saved you	If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **faith** with a verb such as “trust.” Alternate translation: “you have trusted in God, and God has saved you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
LUK	7	50	l398	figs-personification	ἡ πίστις σου σέσωκέν σε	1	Your faith has saved you	Jesus speaks figuratively of the woman’s **faith** as if it had actively **saved** her. He means that it provided the conditions for her to receive salvation from God. Alternate translation: “you have trusted in God, and God has saved you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
LUK	7	50	sp2u	figs-explicit	πορεύου εἰς εἰρήνην	1	Go in peace	This was a way of saying goodbye while giving a blessing at the same time. It also reassured the woman, despite the disapproval of the religious leaders. Alternate translation: “May God give you peace as you go” or “You may go now, and do not worry about your sins any more” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	8	intro	ba3i			0		# Luke 08 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>1. Jesus teaches the crowds with parables (8:1–21)<br>2. Jesus calms a storm on the Sea of Galilee (8:22–25)<br>3. Jesus drives out many demons from a man (8:26–39)<br>4. Jesus heals a woman and restores a dead girl to life (8:40–55)<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Miracles<br><br>In this chapter, Jesus makes a storm stop by speaking to it, he makes a dead girl alive by speaking to her, and he makes evil spirits leave a man by speaking to them. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/miracle]])<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Parables<br><br>Parables were short stories that Jesus told so that people who wanted to believe in him could easily understand the lesson he was trying to teach them. But people who did not want to believe in him would not be able to understand the message (Luke 8:4-15).<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Brothers and sisters<br><br>Most people call those who have the same parents they do “brother” and “sister,” and they think of them as the most important people in their lives. Some people also call those with the same grandparents “brother” and “sister.” In this chapter, Jesus says that the most important people to him are those who obey his Father in heaven. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/brother]])<br><br>## Important textual issues in this chapter<br><br>### “having spent all her living on doctors”<br><br>In [8:43](../08/43.md), some ancient manuscripts of the Bible have the phrase “having spent all her living on doctors,” but other manuscripts do not. ULT includes the phrase in its text, but it mentions in a footnote that scholars are divided as to whether it was an original part of the book of Luke. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to include the phrase if it does, but leave it out if it does not include it. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to follow the example of ULT. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
LUK	8	1	i6mi	writing-newevent	καὶ ἐγένετο	1	And it happened that	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
LUK	8	1	l399	figs-idiom	κατὰ πόλιν καὶ κώμην	1	through city and village	This is an idiom. Alternate translation: “around to different cities and villages” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	8	1	l401	figs-abstractnouns	τὴν Βασιλείαν τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	the kingdom of God	See how you decided to translate this phrase in [4:43](../04/43.md). If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **kingdom** with a verb such as “rule.” Alternate translation: “how God would rule” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
LUK	8	1	l402	figs-nominaladj	οἱ δώδεκα	1	the Twelve	Luke is using the adjective **Twelve** as a noun, to refer to a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “his 12 apostles” or “the 12 men whom he had appointed to be apostles” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
LUK	8	1	l403	translate-names	οἱ δώδεκα	1	the Twelve	Alternatively, even if your language does not ordinarily use adjectives as nouns, you may be able to do that in this case, since this is a title by which the apostles were known. Even though it is a number, if you translate it as a title, as ULT does, follow the conventions for titles in your language, for example, capitalizing main words and writing out numbers rather than using digits. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	8	2	g99l	figs-activepassive	αἳ ἦσαν τεθεραπευμέναι ἀπὸ πνευμάτων πονηρῶν καὶ ἀσθενειῶν	1	who had been healed from evil spirits and diseases	This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: “whom Jesus had set free from evil spirits and healed of diseases” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	8	2	jq4g	translate-names	Μαρία ἡ καλουμένη Μαγδαληνή	1	Mary who was called Magdalene	**Mary** is the name of a woman, and **Magdalene** is a distinguishing term that most likely means that she came from the town of Magdala. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	8	2	n4x6	figs-activepassive	Μαρία ἡ καλουμένη Μαγδαληνή	1	Mary who was called Magdalene	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “Mary, who people called Magdalene” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	8	2	l404	figs-explicit	ἀφ’ ἧς δαιμόνια ἑπτὰ ἐξεληλύθει	1	from whom seven demons had gone out	The **demons** did not go **out** on their own. It may be helpful to say explicitly that Jesus drove them out. Alternate translation: “from whom Jesus had driven out seven demons” or “whom Jesus had set free from seven demons” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	8	3	tfz5	translate-names	Ἰωάννα…Σουσάννα	1	Joanna…Susanna	These are the names of two women. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

LUK	8	3	k9m5	figs-idiom	διηκόνουν αὐτοῖς	1	serving them out of their possessions	This is an idiom. Alternate translation: “personally providing what Jesus and his 12 apostles needed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

LUK	8	4	l406	figs-idiom	κατὰ πόλιν	1	by city	This is an idiom. Alternate translation: “from different towns” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	8	4	l407	figs-parables	εἶπεν διὰ παραβολῆς	1	he spoke in a parable	This means that Jesus told a brief story to teach something true in an understandable and memorable way. Alternate translation: “he told them this story to help them understand God’s ways better” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])
LUK	8	5	ndc3		ἐξῆλθεν ὁ σπείρων τοῦ σπεῖραι τὸν σπόρον αὐτοῦ	1	The sower went out to sow his seed	Use either the singular or the plural to translate **seed** in this story, whichever would be more natural in your language.

LUK	8	5	cv1h		ὃ μὲν ἔπεσεν	1	some fell	Alternate translation: “some of the seed fell” or “some of the seeds fell”
LUK	8	5	a5mz	figs-activepassive	κατεπατήθη	1	it was trampled underfoot	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who did the action. Alternate translation: “people walked on it” or “people walked on them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	8	5	n8bw	figs-explicitinfo	τὰ πετεινὰ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ	1	the birds of the sky	In your language, it might seem that this phrase expresses unnecessary extra information. If so, you could abbreviate it. However, you could also use an action clause to keep the sense of **sky**. Alternate translation: “birds” or “birds flew down and” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo]])
LUK	8	5	lt8n		κατέφαγεν αὐτό	1	devoured it	Alternate translation: “ate it all” or “ate them all”
LUK	8	6	k6a4		ἐξηράνθη	1	it withered away	Continue to use either the singular or the plural, whichever would be more natural in your language. Alternate translation: “each plant dried out and shriveled up” or “the plants dried out and shriveled up”
LUK	8	6	ktz7		διὰ τὸ μὴ ἔχειν ἰκμάδα	1	because it had no moisture	Alternate translation: “because there was no water for it in the rock” or “because there was no water for them in the rock”
LUK	8	7	xzq2		ἀπέπνιξαν αὐτό	1	choked it	The thorn plants took all the nutrients, water, and sunlight, so the farmer’s plants could not grow well.

LUK	8	8	q12t	figs-ellipsis	ἑκατονταπλασίονα	1	a hundred times greater	Luke expresses this idea in a compact way. Alternate translation: “a hundred times as much seed as landed in this soil” or “a hundred times as many seeds as landed in this soil” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
LUK	8	8	b92z	figs-metonymy	ὁ ἔχων ὦτα ἀκούειν, ἀκουέτω	1	The one who has ears to hear, let him hear	Jesus uses this phrase to emphasize that what he has just said is important and that it may take some effort to understand and put into practice. The phrase **ears to hear** figuratively represents the willingness to understand and obey, by association with the part of the body by which his listeners would have been taking in his teaching. Alternate translation: “If anyone is willing to understand, let him understand and obey” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	8	8	l408	figs-123person	ὁ ἔχων ὦτα ἀκούειν, ἀκουέτω	1	The one who has ears to hear, let him hear	Since Jesus is speaking directly to his audience, you may prefer to use the second person here. Alternate translation: “If you are willing to listen, then listen” or “If you are willing to understand, then understand and obey” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
LUK	8	8	l409	figs-you	ὁ ἔχων ὦτα ἀκούειν, ἀκουέτω	1	The one who has ears to hear, let him hear	If you choose to translate this in the second person, **you** would be plural, since Jesus is speaking to the crowd. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
LUK	8	9	l410		τίς αὕτη εἴη ἡ παραβολή	1	What is this parable?	Alternate translation: “What does this story mean?”
LUK	8	10	je1f	figs-activepassive	ὑμῖν δέδοται γνῶναι	1	To you has been granted to know	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who did the action. Alternate translation: “God has allowed you to understand” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	8	10	s7xp		τὰ μυστήρια τῆς Βασιλείας τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	the mysteries of the kingdom of God	These are spiritual truths that people had not previously understood. Jesus is now revealing them. Alternate translation: “the secrets of the kingdom of God”
LUK	8	10	l411	figs-abstractnouns	τῆς Βασιλείας τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	the kingdom of God	See how you decided to translate this phrase in [4:43](../04/43.md). If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **kingdom** with a verb such as “rule.” Alternate translation: “how God will rule” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
LUK	8	10	l6sk	figs-ellipsis	τοῖς δὲ λοιποῖς ἐν παραβολαῖς	1	but to the rest in parables	Jesus is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would ordinarily need in order to be complete. Alternate translation: “but I speak in parables to the people who are not my disciples” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
LUK	8	10	l412	figs-quotesinquotes	ἵνα βλέποντες μὴ βλέπωσιν, καὶ ἀκούοντες μὴ συνιῶσιν	1	so that, ‘Seeing, they may not see; and hearing, they may not understand’	Luke is quoting Jesus, and Jesus is quoting the prophet Isaiah. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. For clarity, you could also indicate the source of the words that Jesus is quoting. Alternate translation: “so that as the prophet Isaiah said, though they see, they will not perceive, and though they hear, they will not understand” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	8	10	xtu6		βλέποντες μὴ βλέπωσιν	1	Seeing, they may not see	Some languages may need to state the object of the verb. Alternate translation: “though they see things, they will not understand them” or “though they see things happen, they will not understand what they mean”
LUK	8	10	k4es		ἀκούοντες μὴ συνιῶσιν	1	hearing, they may not understand	Some languages may need to state the object of the verb. Alternate translation: “though they hear instruction, they will not understand the truth”
LUK	8	11	vp8a		ἔστιν δὲ αὕτη ἡ παραβολή	1	the parable is this	Alternate translation: “this is what the story means”
LUK	8	11	hb1t	figs-metonymy	ὁ σπόρος ἐστὶν ὁ λόγος τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	The seed is the word of God	Jesus uses the term **word** figuratively to refer to the message from God that people share by using words. Alternate translation: “The seed represents the message from God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	8	12	xsa7	figs-metaphor	οἱ…παρὰ τὴν ὁδόν εἰσιν οἱ ἀκούσαντες	1	the ones along the path are those who have heard	Jesus begins to explain the figurative meanings of the seeds that fell in different places. Alternate translation: “The seeds that fell along the path represent people who hear the message” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	8	12	h969	figs-metaphor	εἶτα ἔρχεται ὁ διάβολος καὶ αἴρει τὸν λόγον ἀπὸ τῆς καρδίας αὐτῶν	1	but then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts	The parable represented this figuratively as a bird snatching away seeds. Try to use words in your language that retain that image. Alternate translation: “but then the devil comes and snatches the message away from them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	8	12	jb9t	figs-metaphor	εἶτα ἔρχεται ὁ διάβολος καὶ αἴρει τὸν λόγον ἀπὸ τῆς καρδίας αὐτῶν	1	but then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts	The word **hearts** figuratively represents the thoughts and emotions. Alternate translation: “the devil comes and keeps them from understanding and appreciating the message” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	8	12	l413	figs-explicit	εἶτα ἔρχεται ὁ διάβολος καὶ αἴρει τὸν λόγον ἀπὸ τῆς καρδίας αὐτῶν	1	but then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts	Based on the figurative meaning of the parable, the implication is that these people did not appreciate the message deeply, just as seeds could not go down deep into the hard-packed soil of the path. And so the devil would be able to break up their superficial awareness and concentration by distracting them with everyday concerns.

LUK	8	15	pbi7	figs-metaphor	ἐν καρδίᾳ καλῇ καὶ ἀγαθῇ	1	with an honest and good heart	In this expression, the **heart** figuratively represents the thoughts and emotions. Alternate translation: “with genuine intentions” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

LUK	8	17	l418	figs-activepassive	οὐδὲ ἀπόκρυφον ὃ οὐ μὴ γνωσθῇ καὶ εἰς φανερὸν ἔλθῃ	1	nor secret that will not be known and come into visibility	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who will do the action.

LUK	8	17	l419	figs-doublet	οὐδὲ ἀπόκρυφον ὃ οὐ μὴ γνωσθῇ καὶ εἰς φανερὸν ἔλθῃ	1	nor secret that will not be known and come into visibility	The phrases **be known** and **come into visibility** mean similar things.

LUK	8	18	l420		βλέπετε οὖν πῶς ἀκούετε	1	so be careful how you listen	The phrase **be careful** does not mean that listening is dangerous. Rather, it means that people should listen carefully, because, as Jesus has just said, God wants to reveal spiritual secrets. Alternate translation: “so make sure that you listen well” or “so listen carefully and reflect on what you hear”
LUK	8	18	l421	figs-explicit	ὃς ἂν…ἔχῃ, δοθήσεται αὐτῷ	1	whoever has, it will be given to him	The implication in context is that this refers to understanding and believing.

LUK	8	18	bq9f	figs-activepassive	ὃς ἂν…ἔχῃ, δοθήσεται αὐτῷ	1	whoever has, it will be given to him	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form.

LUK	8	18	l422	figs-explicit	καὶ ὃς ἂν μὴ ἔχῃ, καὶ ὃ δοκεῖ ἔχειν ἀρθήσεται ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ	1	whoever does not have, even what he thinks he has will be taken away from him	The implication once again is that this refers to understanding and believing.

LUK	8	19	dw3m		οἱ ἀδελφοὶ	1	his brothers	These were Jesus’ younger brothers—the other sons of Mary and Joseph who were born after Jesus. Since the Father of Jesus was God, and their father was Joseph, they were actually his half-brothers. That detail is not normally translated, but if your language has a specific word for “younger brother,” you can use it here.
LUK	8	20	wr4t	figs-activepassive	ἀπηγγέλη…αὐτῷ	1	it was reported to him	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who did the action. The subject should be plural, since in the next verse Jesus responds to “them.” Alternate translation: “people told him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	8	20	l424	figs-you	σου…σου…σε	1	your…your…you	Since the person who said this was speaking to Jesus alone, **your** and **you** are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
LUK	8	20	un5d		ἰδεῖν θέλοντές σε	1	wanting to see you	Alternate translation: “and they would like to see you”
LUK	8	21	l425	figs-hendiadys	ὁ δὲ ἀποκριθεὶς εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτούς	1	But answering he said to them	Together the two words **answering** and **said** mean that Jesus responded to the information that people gave him. Alternate translation: “But Jesus responded to them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
LUK	8	21	b97u	figs-metaphor	μήτηρ μου καὶ ἀδελφοί μου, οὗτοί εἰσιν οἱ τὸν λόγον τοῦ Θεοῦ ἀκούοντες καὶ ποιοῦντες	1	My mother and my brothers are those who hear and do the word of God	Jesus means figuratively that people who believe and obey the message from God become like a family to one another.

LUK	8	21	edk3	figs-metonymy	τὸν λόγον τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	the word of God	Jesus uses the term **word** figuratively to refer to the message from God that people share by using words. Alternate translation: “the message from God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	8	22	l426	writing-newevent	ἐγένετο δὲ	1	And it happened that	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
LUK	8	22	l427	figs-idiom	ἐν μιᾷ τῶν ἡμερῶν	1	on one of those days	Luke uses the term **days** figuratively to refer a particular time. Alternate translation: “around that time” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

So here Luke is probably describing the result before the reason. If it would be clearer in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the action that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: Jesus said to his disciples, ‘Let us go over to the other side of the lake.’ So they all got into a boat together” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
LUK	8	22	w1pk	translate-names	τῆς λίμνης	1	the lake	This means the Lake of Genneseret, which is also called the Sea of Galilee. But since Jesus would have referred to it simply as “the lake” while he and his disciples were on it, you do not need to use the proper name in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	8	22	btk8	figs-idiom	ἀνήχθησαν	1	they put out	This expression means that they began to travel across the lake in their boat. Alternate translation: “they headed out across the lake” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

LUK	8	23	sf8z	writing-pronouns	ἀφύπνωσεν	1	he fell asleep	The word **he** refers to Jesus. Alternate translation: “Jesus began to sleep” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
LUK	8	23	mdb5	figs-idiom	κατέβη λαῖλαψ ἀνέμου εἰς τὴν λίμνην	1	a windstorm came down on the lake	Luke says **came down** because the weather originated from the sky. Alternate translation: “very strong winds suddenly began to blow on the lake” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	8	23	l429	figs-metonymy	συνεπληροῦντο	1	they were being filled	Luke says **they**, meaning the disciples, to refer figuratively by association to the boat they were in. Alternate translation: “the boat was being filled” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	8	23	l430	figs-activepassive	συνεπληροῦντο	1	they were being filled	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say what was doing the action. Alternate translation: “water started to fill up their boat” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	8	23	uki7	figs-explicit	συνεπληροῦντο	1	they were being filled	The implication is that the strong winds were causing high waves that pushed water over the sides of the boat, and that this water was filling the boat. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “the strong winds were causing high waves that pushed water over the sides of their boat, and the water began to fill it up” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	8	24	l431		λέγοντες, Ἐπιστάτα, Ἐπιστάτα, ἀπολλύμεθα!	1	saying, “Master! Master! We are perishing!”	
LUK	8	24	l432		Ἐπιστάτα	1	Master	This is the title by which disciples addressed their teacher in this culture. If your language and culture have a similar term, you can use it here in your translation.
LUK	8	24	l433	figs-exclusive	ἀπολλύμεθα	1	We are perishing	Since the disciples want Jesus to understand that he is in danger too, the word **we** would include him. Alternate translation: “We’re all going to die” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
LUK	8	24	uhe4		ἐπετίμησεν	1	rebuked	Alternate translation: “spoke sharply to”
LUK	8	24	t1yy	figs-explicitinfo	τῷ κλύδωνι, τοῦ ὕδατος	1	the waves of the water	In your language, it might seem that the wording here expresses unnecessary extra information. If so, you can abbreviate it. However, you could also translate this as expressing emphasis. Alternate translation: “the waves” or “the violent waves” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo]])
LUK	8	24	v1c3	figs-parallelism	ἐπαύσαντο καὶ ἐγένετο γαλήνη	1	they ceased, and there was a calm	These two phrases mean similar things. Luke uses the repetition to emphasize what great power Jesus demonstrated. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine these phrases. However, you could also translate both phrases and show how the second expresses the results of the first. Alternate translation: “the storm ended” or “the storm ended, so that the lake became calm again” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
LUK	8	25	d8c3	figs-rquestion	ποῦ ἡ πίστις ὑμῶν?	1	Where is your faith?	Jesus does not expect his disciples to tell him where their faith is. Rather, he is using the question form to correct them. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or exclamation. Alternate translation: “You should have trusted God!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	8	25	wjv3		τίς ἄρα οὗτός ἐστιν, ὅτι καὶ τοῖς ἀνέμοις ἐπιτάσσει καὶ τῷ ὕδατι, καὶ ὑπακούουσιν αὐτῷ?	1	Who then is this, that he commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him?	If it would be clearer in your language, you could turn this into two sentences, one asking the question, and the other giving the reason for the question. Alternate translation: “Who then is this? He commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him!”
LUK	8	25	f2wp		τίς ἄρα οὗτός ἐστιν	1	Who then is this	This is a genuine question, not a statement in question form. The disciples are looking for information about what kind of person Jesus could be if he can do this. Alternate translation: “What kind of man is this”
LUK	8	25	l434	figs-metonymy	τῷ ὕδατι	1	the water	The disciples are figuratively describing the violent waves that had threatened the boat, by reference to the water that these waves arose from. Alternate translation: “the waves” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

LUK	8	27	l435	figs-ellipsis	ἐξελθόντι…αὐτῷ	1	when he came out	Luke is writing in a compact way here. He means that Jesus **came out** of the boat. Alternate translation: “when Jesus got out of the boat” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
LUK	8	27	hjh5	writing-participants	ἀνήρ τις ἐκ τῆς πόλεως	1	a certain man from the city	This phrase introduces a new character in a story. If your language has an expression of its own that serves this purpose, you can use it here. Alternate translation: “a man who was from the city of Gerasa” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
LUK	8	27	ji6p		ἔχων δαιμόνια	1	who had demons	Alternate translation: “who was controlled by demons” or “whom demons controlled”

LUK	8	28	fak9	translate-symaction	προσέπεσεν αὐτῷ	1	fell down before him	Be sure that it is clear in your translation that the man did not fall down accidentally.

LUK	8	28	m21e	figs-idiom	φωνῇ μεγάλῃ εἶπεν	1	said in a loud voice	This is an idiom that means the man raised the volume of his voice. Alternate translation: “shouted out” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

Alternate translation: “You and I have nothing in common!” or “You have no reason to get involved with me!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	8	28	ptt1	guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	Υἱὲ τοῦ Θεοῦ τοῦ Ὑψίστου	1	Son of the Most High God	This is an important title for Jesus. See how you translated the expression **the Most High** in [1:32](../01/32.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])

You could also put the next sentence in this verse at the end of [8:27](../08/27.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge]])
LUK	8	29	l439	writing-background	πολλοῖς γὰρ χρόνοις	1	For many times	Luke uses this phrase to introduce further background information about what the demon had done to the man before Jesus met him.

LUK	8	29	bey5	figs-activepassive	ἠλαύνετο ὑπὸ τοῦ δαιμονίου	1	he would be driven by the demon	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “the demon would make him go” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	8	30	l440	figs-you	σοι	1	your	Since Luke indicates in the previous verse that Jesus is speaking to **the unclean spirit** here, **your** is singular, even though the demon responds that he is speaking for “many,” and even though in the following verses Luke says **they** and **them** for the multiple demons. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
LUK	8	30	p31w	translate-names	λεγεών	1	Legion	Translate this with a word in your language that refers to a large number of soldiers.

Alternate translation: “the demons begged Jesus to let them go into the pigs” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
LUK	8	32	l443		καὶ ἐπέτρεψεν αὐτοῖς	1	And he gave them permission	Luke does not say specifically why Jesus allowed the demons to go into the pigs. But Jesus did not necessarily do so because the demons begged him. He may have had other reasons of his own. So it would probably be best to translate this in a neutral way, as ULT and UST both do, rather than beginning with a word such as “So,” which would imply that Jesus agreed to this because the demons begged him.
LUK	8	33	na38	grammar-connect-logic-result	ἐξελθόντα δὲ τὰ δαιμόνια	1	Then the demons came out	You could begin this sentence with the word **Then**, as ULT does, to show that this happened next. You could also begin this sentence with the word **So**, as UST does, to show that the demons came of out the man because Jesus told them they could go into the pigs. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
LUK	8	33	gz5x		ὥρμησεν	1	rushed	Alternate translation: “ran very fast”
LUK	8	33	ja6x	figs-activepassive	καὶ ἀπεπνίγη	1	and was drowned	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form. You do not need to specify someone who did this action to the pigs, because no one caused them to drown once they were in the water. Alternate translation: “and drowned” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	8	34	l444	figs-merism	εἰς τὴν πόλιν καὶ εἰς τοὺς ἀγρούς	1	in the city and in the countryside	Luke uses a figure of speech here to refer to that whole region by naming the two constituent parts of it. Alternate translation: “throughout the whole area” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
LUK	8	34	l445	figs-explicit	εἰς τὴν πόλιν καὶ εἰς τοὺς ἀγρούς	1	in the city and in the countryside	You could also translate this more literally. The implication is that this means the city of Gerasa, since Luke says in [8:29](../08/29.md) that Jesus and his disciples came to the region where this city was located. Alternate translation: “in the city of Gerasa and in the surrounding countryside” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	8	35	l446	figs-explicit	ἐξῆλθον	1	they went out	The term **they** here, as well as in the other two instances in this verse, refers to the people of that region, as in [8:37](../08/37.md). The term **went out** indicates the remote area where the man had been living. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say those things explicitly. Alternate translation: “people from all over that region went out to that remote area” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	8	35	ju71		εὗραν…τὸν ἄνθρωπον, ἀφ’ οὗ τὰ δαιμόνια ἐξῆλθεν	1	found the man from whom the demons had gone out	Alternate translation: “saw the man whom the demons had left”
LUK	8	35	l447	figs-activepassive	ἱματισμένον	1	clothed	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “wearing clothes” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

LUK	8	35	x9lp	figs-idiom	καθήμενον…παρὰ τοὺς πόδας τοῦ Ἰησοῦ	1	sitting at the feet of Jesus	This is an idiom. Alternate translation: “sitting on the ground in front of Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	8	35	j89t	figs-explicit	ἐφοβήθησαν	1	they were afraid	The implication is that they were afraid of what else such a powerful person as Jesus might do. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “they were afraid of what else Jesus might do, since they recognized what great power he had” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	8	36	xtf3	figs-ellipsis	οἱ ἰδόντες	1	those who had seen	Alternate translation: “those who had seen what had happened” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
LUK	8	36	kv18	figs-activepassive	ἐσώθη ὁ δαιμονισθείς	1	the one who had been possessed by demons had been saved	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say both of these things with active forms. Alternate translation: “Jesus had delivered the man from the demons who had controlled him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	8	37	l448	figs-hyperbole	ἅπαν τὸ πλῆθος τῆς περιχώρου	1	all the multitude of the region	This phrase means “everyone who lived in that area.” It is a generalization for emphasis, since every single resident of that region did not make this request. Rather, this was the general request of the crowd that came out to see what had happened. Alternate translation: “the crowd that had gathered from the region” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
LUK	8	37	ai7m		τῆς περιχώρου τῶν Γερασηνῶν	1	the region of the Gerasenes	Alternate translation: “the area where the Gerasene people lived”
LUK	8	37	l449	grammar-connect-logic-result	ὅτι φόβῳ μεγάλῳ συνείχοντο	1	for they were seized by great fear	If it would be clearer in your language, you could put this phrase first in the sentence, since it gives the reason for the result that the rest of the sentence describes. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
LUK	8	37	jbh5	figs-activepassive	φόβῳ μεγάλῳ συνείχοντο	1	they were seized by great fear	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “they became very afraid” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	8	37	l450	figs-personification	φόβῳ μεγάλῳ συνείχοντο	1	they were seized by great fear	Luke speaks of this **fear** figuratively as if it were something that could actively take hold of these people. Alternate translation: “they became very afraid” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
LUK	8	37	l451	figs-synecdoche	αὐτὸς δὲ ἐμβὰς, εἰς πλοῖον	1	he got into the boat	Luke figuratively says **he**, meaning Jesus, to describe the entire group of Jesus and his disciples. Alternate translation: “Jesus and his disciples got into the boat” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
LUK	8	37	ue8c	figs-explicit	ὑπέστρεψεν	1	to return	The implication is that Jesus and his disciples were going to return to Galilee. Alternate translation: “to go back across the lake” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	8	38	s25w	figs-events	ἐδεῖτο δὲ αὐτοῦ	1	And the man begged	The events in this verse and the next verse happened before Jesus left in the boat. It may be helpful to state that clearly at the beginning here. Alternate translation: “Before Jesus and his disciples left, the man begged” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-events]])
LUK	8	38	l452	figs-quotations	ἐδεῖτο…αὐτοῦ…εἶναι σὺν αὐτῷ	1	begged him to be with him	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this as a direct quotation, as UST does, breaking the sentence here. Alternate translation: “pleaded with Jesus, ‘Let me go with you!’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
LUK	8	38	abce	writing-pronouns	ἀπέλυσεν δὲ αὐτὸν	1	he sent him away	The word **he** refers to Jesus, and the word **him** refers to the man. Alternate translation: “Jesus sent the man away” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
LUK	8	39	zl3v	figs-metonymy	τὸν οἶκόν σου	1	your house	Jesus is using the word **house** figuratively to mean the people who live in the man’s **house**. Alternate translation: “your household” or “your family” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	8	39	c9nh		διηγοῦ ὅσα σοι ἐποίησεν ὁ Θεός	1	describe all that God has done for you	Alternate translation: “tell them everything about what God has done for you”
LUK	8	39	l453	figs-explicit	καθ’ ὅλην τὴν πόλιν	1	throughout the whole city	The implication is that this means the city of Gerasa, since Luke says in [8:29](../08/29.md) that Jesus and his disciples came to the region where this city was located. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “throughout the whole city of Gerasa” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	8	40	l454	figs-synecdoche	ἐν δὲ τῷ ὑποστρέφειν τὸν Ἰησοῦν	1	Now when Jesus returned	Luke figuratively says **he**, meaning Jesus, to describe the entire group of Jesus and his disciples. Alternate translation: “Now when Jesus returned with his disciples” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
LUK	8	40	yd57	grammar-connect-logic-result	ἀπεδέξατο αὐτὸν ὁ ὄχλος; ἦσαν γὰρ πάντες προσδοκῶντες αὐτόν	1	the crowd welcomed him, for they were all expecting him	If it would be clearer in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the results that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “the crowd had been expecting him, and so they greeted him joyfully” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
LUK	8	41	l455	figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	behold	Luke uses the term **behold** to calls the reader’s attention to what he is about to say. Your language may have a similar expression that you can use here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	8	41	l456	writing-participants	ἦλθεν ἀνὴρ ᾧ ὄνομα Ἰάειρος	1	a man came whose name was Jairus	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new character into the story.

LUK	8	41	epa2	translate-symaction	πεσὼν παρὰ τοὺς πόδας Ἰησοῦ	1	falling at the feet of Jesus	Be sure that it is clear in your translation that Jairus did not fall down accidentally. Rather, bowing or lying down in front of Jesus was a sign of humility and respect for him. Alternate translation: “respectfully bowed down at Jesus’ feet” or “respectfully lay down on the ground in front of Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
LUK	8	42	kq2v	figs-explicit	ἀπέθνῃσκεν	1	was dying	The implication is that Jairus wanted Jesus to heal her. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “was about to die, and he wanted Jesus to heal her” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	8	42	ymb1	figs-explicit	ἐν δὲ τῷ ὑπάγειν αὐτὸν	1	And as he was going	You may need to say first in your language that Jesus had agreed to go with Jairus. You could put that information in a separate sentence. Alternate translation: “So Jesus agreed to go with him. Now as he was on his way” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	8	42	l458	writing-background	δὲ	1	And	Luke uses this word to introduce background information that will help readers understand what happens next. Alternate translation: “Now” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
LUK	8	42	kw2y		οἱ ὄχλοι συνέπνιγον αὐτόν	1	the crowds were crowding around him	Alternate translation: “the people were crowding tightly around Jesus”
LUK	8	43	l7pu	writing-participants	γυνὴ οὖσα	1	there was a woman	This introduces a new character into the story. If your language has an expression of its own that serves this purpose, you can use it here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
LUK	8	43	h9uq	figs-euphemism	ἐν ῥύσει αἵματος	1	with a flow of blood	Luke refers to her condition discreetly by using a mild expression.

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
LUK	8	43	l459	translate-textvariants	ἰατροῖς προσαναλώσασα ὅλον τὸν βίον	1	having spent all her living on doctors	See the discussion of textual issues at the end of the General Notes to this chapter to decide whether to include this phrase in your translation.

LUK	8	43	zb4a	figs-activepassive	οὐκ ἴσχυσεν ἀπ’ οὐδενὸς θεραπευθῆναι	1	was not able to be healed by anyone	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “whom no one had been able to heal” or, if you include the phrase from the textual variant, “who had spent all of her money on doctors, but none of them had been able to heal her” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	8	44	vwe6	translate-unknown	ἥψατο τοῦ κρασπέδου τοῦ ἱματίου αὐτοῦ	1	touched the edge of his cloak	Jewish men wore tassels on the edges of their robes, as commanded in God’s Law. The woman likely **touched** one of those tassles. Alternate translation: “touched a tassel on his robe” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	8	45	c3wm	figs-explicit	οἱ ὄχλοι συνέχουσίν σε καὶ ἀποθλίβουσιν	1	the crowds are crowding around and pressing against you	By saying this, Peter was implying that anyone could have touched Jesus.

Alternate translation: “there are many people crowding around you and pressing in against you, so any one of them might have touched you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	8	45	l461	figs-doublet	συνέχουσίν σε καὶ ἀποθλίβουσιν	1	crowding around and pressing against you	These two expressions mean similar things. Peter is using repetition for emphasis. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine these phrases. Alternate translation: “pressing against you from every side” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
LUK	8	46	u6am	figs-explicit	ἥψατό μού τις	1	Someone touched me	The implication is that Jesus means someone reached out and **touched** him intentionally.

LUK	8	46	zmu9	figs-explicit	ἐγὼ…ἔγνων δύναμιν ἐξεληλυθυῖαν ἀπ’ ἐμοῦ	1	I know power has gone out from me	Jesus did not lose power or become weak. Rather, he recognized that power had gone out from him and healed someone. Alternate translation: “I felt power go out from me and heal someone” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	8	47	cwn4	figs-explicit	ὅτι οὐκ ἔλαθεν	1	that she could not hide	The implication is that she could not hide the fact that she had touched Jesus deliberately.

LUK	8	48	v4m9	figs-idiom	θύγατερ	1	Daughter	This was a kind way of speaking to a woman. Your language may have another way of expressing the same kindness. Alternate translation: “My dear” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	8	48	uja4	figs-abstractnouns	ἡ πίστις σου σέσωκέν σε	1	your faith has saved you	If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **faith** with a verb such as “believe.” Alternate translation: “because you believed, you have become well” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
LUK	8	48	l463	figs-personification	ἡ πίστις σου σέσωκέν σε	1	your faith has saved you	Jesus speaks figuratively of the woman’s **faith** as if it had actively healed her.

LUK	8	49	m58z	figs-explicit	ἔτι αὐτοῦ λαλοῦντος	1	While he was still speaking	This refers implicitly to what Jesus was saying in the previous verse. Alternate translation: “While Jesus was still saying these things to the woman” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	8	49	l465		ἔρχεταί τις	1	someone comes	To call attention to a development in the story, Luke uses the present tense in past narration. See how you decided to approach this usage in [7:40](../07/40.md). If it would not be natural to use the present tense in your language, you can use the past tense in your translation. Alternate translation: “someone came”
LUK	8	49	deu3	figs-metonymy	τις παρὰ τοῦ ἀρχισυναγώγου	1	someone from the synagogue leader	This does not mean someone whom Jairus sent, since Jairus was with Jesus. Rather, this means someone who had been at his house watching with the others over his daughter. Alternate translation: “someone who had been at the home of Jairus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	8	49	id9v	figs-explicit	μηκέτι σκύλλε τὸν διδάσκαλον	1	Do not trouble the Teacher any longer	This statement implies that Jesus will not be able to do anything to help, since the girl is dead.

LUK	8	49	n6ez		τὸν διδάσκαλον	1	the Teacher	This is a respectful title. You can translate it with an equivalent term that your language and culture would use.
LUK	8	50	l466	writing-pronouns	ἀπεκρίθη αὐτῷ	1	he answered him	The word **he** refers to Jesus, and the word **him** refers to Jairus, not the messenger. Jesus did not respond directly to the messenger. Rather, he reassured Jairus, despite the news. Alternate translation: “Jesus said to Jairus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])

LUK	8	51	qal2	grammar-connect-exceptions	οὐκ ἀφῆκεν…τινα…εἰ μὴ	1	he did not allow anyone…except	If, in your language, it would appear that Luke was making a statement here and then contradicting it, you could reword this to avoid using an exception clause.

LUK	8	52	tt9v	translate-symaction	ἔκλαιον…πάντες καὶ ἐκόπτοντο αὐτήν	1	they were all wailing and mourning for her	This was the customary way of showing grief in that culture. The term that ULT translates as **mourning** could mean that the people were pounding on their chests as a sign of grief, although Luke uses a much more specific expression to say that directly in [18:13](../18/13.md). If you think your readers might not understand the significance of these actions, you could explain generally what the people were doing. Or you could describe the actions and say why the people were doing them. Alternate translation: “they were all loudly expressing their grief” or “all the people there were wailing and pounding on their chests to show how sad they were that the girl had died” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])

LUK	8	54	l469	figs-imperative	ἔγειρε	1	arise	This was not a command that the girl was capable of obeying. Instead, this was a command that directly caused her to be raised from the dead. Alternate translation: “your life is restored, so get up” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
LUK	8	55	k6w2	figs-explicit	ἐπέστρεψεν τὸ πνεῦμα αὐτῆς	1	her spirit returned	The people of this time considered life to be the result of the spirit coming into a person. You could express this in the way that would be most meaningful in your culture. Alternate translation: “she started breathing again” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	8	56	c6mp		μηδενὶ εἰπεῖν	1	to tell no one	If it would be clearer in your language, you could make the verb negative and the subject positive. Alternate translation: “not to tell anyone”
LUK	9	intro	uc1r			0		# Luke 09 General Notes<br>### Structure and formatting<br><br>1. Jesus sends his twelve apostles to teach and heal (9:1–9)<br>2. Jesus miraculously feeds 5,000 people (9:10–17)<br>3. Jesus speaks with his disciples about who he is (9:18–27)<br>4. The glory of Jesus is revealed on a mountaintop (9:28–36)<br>5. Jesus drives a demon out of a boy (9:37–43)<br>6. Jesus speaks about being his disciple (9:44–50)<br>7. Jesus begins to travel to Jerusalem (9:51–62)<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Elijah<br><br>God had promised the Jews that the prophet Elijah would return before the Messiah came. So some people who saw Jesus do miracles thought Jesus was Elijah (9:9, 9:19). He was not. However, Elijah did come to earth to speak with Jesus (9:30). (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/christ]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/elijah]])<br><br>### Glory<br><br>Scripture often speaks of God’s glory as a great, brilliant light. When people see this light, they are afraid. Luke says in this chapter that Jesus’ clothing shone with this glorious light so that his followers could see that Jesus truly was God’s Son. At the same time, God told them that Jesus was his Son. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/glory]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/fear]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Paradox<br><br>A paradox is a statement that describes two things that seem as if they cannot both be true at the same time, but which actually are both true. Jesus speaks a paradox in this chapter: “Whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will save it” (9:24).<br><br>### “Receiving”<br><br>This word appears several times in this chapter and means different things. When Jesus says, “If someone receives a little child like this in my name, he also is receiving me, and if someone receives me, he is also receiving the one who sent me” (9:48), he is speaking of people serving the child. When Luke says, “the people there did not receive him” (9:53), he means that the people did not believe in or accept Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/believe]])

LUK	9	1	zqq6	figs-doublet	δύναμιν καὶ ἐξουσίαν	1	power and authority	These two terms mean similar things. Luke uses them together to show that Jesus gave his twelve disciples both the ability and the right to heal people.

LUK	9	3	m7c5		καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτούς	1	And he said to them	It may be helpful to state that Jesus said these things to the disciples before they went out. Alternate translation: “Before the 12 disciples left, Jesus said to them”

LUK	9	3	l475	figs-litotes	μήτε δύο χιτῶνας ἔχειν	1	nor have two tunics	Jesus is using a figure of speech here that expresses a positive meaning by using a negative word together with a word that is the opposite of the intended meaning. When he says that these men should not each have two tunics, he means that they each should only have one tunic. Alternate translation: “and do not bring an extra tunic” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
LUK	9	4	kyw3	figs-explicit	εἰς ἣν ἂν οἰκίαν εἰσέλθητε	1	whatever house you enter into	The implication is that the disciples can **enter** a house because the people living there have welcomed them.

LUK	9	7	l477	figs-explicit	ὅτι Ἰωάννης ἠγέρθη ἐκ νεκρῶν	1	that John had risen from the dead	Luke reports in [3:20](../03/20.md) that Herod put John in prison. When John sends messengers to Jesus in [7:18-19](../07/18.md), he does this from prison. But by this point in the story, John is dead, because Herod has executed him. Luke assumes that his readers will know that. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could tell them explicitly. Alternate translation: “that John the Baptist, whom Herod had executed, had risen from the dead” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	9	7	l478	figs-explicit	Ἰωάννης	1	John	Luke assumes that his readers will know he is referring to John the Baptist. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “John the Baptist” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

Alternate translation: “It cannot be John, because I had his head cut off, so who is this” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	9	9	r98f	figs-synecdoche	Ἰωάννην ἐγὼ ἀπεκεφάλισα	1	I beheaded John	Herod speaks of himself figuratively as the person who did this action, representing the entire group of people who were responsible for it. Herod’s soldiers would actually have carried out the execution, on his orders. Alternate translation: “I commanded my soldiers to cut off John’s head” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
LUK	9	10	p7gf	figs-explicit	ὑποστρέψαντες, οἱ ἀπόστολοι	1	when the apostles returned	The implication is that the apostles returned to where Jesus was. Alternate translation: “when the apostles came back to where Jesus was” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	9	10	aal8	figs-explicit	ὅσα ἐποίησαν	1	as much as they had done	This refers to what they did when they went to the cities where Jesus sent them.

LUK	9	12	l485	translate-names	οἱ δώδεκα	1	the Twelve	You may have decided instead in [8:1](../08/01.md) to translate this as a title, even if your language does not ordinarily use adjectives as nouns. If so, you can do the same thing here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	9	13	l486	figs-litotes	οὐκ εἰσὶν…πλεῖον ἢ	1	There are not more than	The disciples are figuratively expressing a positive meaning by using a negative word together with a word that is the opposite of the intended meaning.

LUK	9	13	tay4	translate-unknown	ἄρτοι πέντε	1	five loaves	This means **loaves** of bread, which are lumps of flour dough that a person has shaped and baked. Alternate translation: “five loaves of bread” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	9	13	vuc1	figs-irony	εἰ μήτι πορευθέντες, ἡμεῖς ἀγοράσωμεν εἰς πάντα τὸν λαὸν τοῦτον βρώματα	1	unless we go and buy food for all these people	The disciples are not making a serious suggestion here. They actually mean to communicate the opposite of the literal meaning of their words. Alternate translation: “and we certainly can not go and buy food for all these people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])
LUK	9	14	c9z5	figs-explicit	ὡσεὶ ἄνδρες πεντακισχίλιοι	1	about 5,000 men	Luke assumes that readers will know that this number does not include the women and children who were likely also present. (This is not a case where a masculine term includes women.) If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “about 5,000 men, not counting the women and children” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	9	14	v44h		κατακλίνατε αὐτοὺς	1	Have them recline to eat	Alternate translation: “Tell them to sit down to eat”

Alternate translation: “the disciples had all the people sit down as Jesus had instructed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

LUK	9	16	gm2v		εὐλόγησεν αὐτοὺς	1	he blessed them	The word **them** refers to the loaves of bread and the fish, not to the people who had sat down to eat. Alternate translation: “he gave thanks for the food”
LUK	9	17	l5ml	figs-activepassive	ἔφαγον καὶ ἐχορτάσθησαν πάντες	1	they all ate and were satisfied	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “they all ate until they had had enough” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

In biblical times, baskets were often made from strong plant materials, such as peels of wood or reeds that grew near the water. If your readers would not be familiar with **baskets**, you could use a general term. Alternate translation: “containers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	9	18	y5a5	writing-newevent	καὶ ἐγένετο	1	And it happened that	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])

LUK	9	22	l493	figs-idiom	καὶ τῇ τρίτῃ ἡμέρᾳ ἐγερθῆναι	1	and to be raised on the third day	In the idiom of this culture, today was the “first day,” tomorrow was the “second day,” and the day after tomorrow was the**third day**. To make sure that this is clear to your readers, you may wish to use a different expression than “the third day” or “day three,” especially if, in your culture, this would mean one day longer than Jesus intends. Otherwise, your readers may be confused when they read later in the book that Jesus died on a Friday and came back to life on a Sunday, if that would be “the second day” or “day two” according to the way your culture reckons time. Alternate translation: “and he will spend the next full day in the grave, but on the day after that, he will come back to life” or (if you translated in the first person) “and I will spend the next full day in the grave, but on the day after that, I will come back to life” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

Luke assumes that his readers will recognize this image from their own culture. But if it would not be familiar to your readers, you could use a more general expression. Alternate translation: “he must be willing every day to suffer and die for my sake” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	9	23	h7j1	figs-metaphor	ἀράτω τὸν σταυρὸν αὐτοῦ καθ’ ἡμέραν	1	let him…take up his cross daily	To **take up** a **cross** figuratively represents being willing to suffer and die.

Jesus does not expect his disciples to tell him what benefit this would be. Rather, he is using the question form as a teaching tool. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate his words as a statement. Alternate translation: “It would not benefit a person to get everything he wanted in this world and yet be lost eternally.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	9	25	l496	figs-activepassive	τί γὰρ ὠφελεῖται ἄνθρωπος	1	what is a man profited	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “what benefit would it be to a person” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this in the first person. Alternate translation: “I, the Son of Man” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
LUK	9	26	l498	figs-explicit	ὁ Υἱὸς τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου	1	the Son of Man	See how you translated the title **Son of Man** in [5:24](../05/24.md). Alternate translation: “I, the Messiah” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	9	26	dl2i	guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	τοῦ Πατρὸς	1	the Father	This is an important title for God. Alternate translation: “God the Father” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
LUK	9	27	ef6j	figs-idiom	λέγω δὲ ὑμῖν ἀληθῶς	1	But I say to you truly	Jesus uses this phrase to emphasize the importance of what he will say next. Alternate translation: “Now listen carefully” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	9	27	m113	figs-123person	εἰσίν τινες τῶν αὐτοῦ ἑστηκότων, οἳ οὐ μὴ γεύσωνται θανάτου, ἕως ἂν ἴδωσιν τὴν Βασιλείαν τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	there are some of those who are standing here who will not taste death until they see the kingdom of God	Jesus is using the third person to talk about the people he is talking to. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this in the second person. Alternate translation: “some of you who are standing here will not die before you see the kingdom of God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
LUK	9	27	j7fc	figs-litotes	οὐ μὴ γεύσωνται θανάτου, ἕως ἂν ἴδωσιν τὴν Βασιλείαν τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	will not taste death until they see the kingdom of God	Jesus is figuratively expressing a positive meaning by using a negative word together with a word that is the opposite of the intended meaning.

LUK	9	27	gj8t	figs-idiom	γεύσωνται θανάτου	1	taste death	This is an idiom. Alternate translation: “die” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	9	27	l499	figs-abstractnouns	τὴν Βασιλείαν τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	the kingdom of God	See how you decided to translate this phrase in [4:43](../04/43.md). If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **kingdom** with a verb such as “rule.” Alternate translation: “God ruling as king” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
LUK	9	28	l500	writing-newevent	ἐγένετο δὲ	1	And it happened that	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
LUK	9	28	si9j	figs-metonymy	μετὰ τοὺς λόγους τούτους	1	after these words	This refers to what Jesus said to his disciples in the preceding verses.

Alternate translation: “after Jesus said these things to his disciples” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	9	29	l501	writing-newevent	ἐγένετο δὲ	1	And it happened that	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new development within this episode. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for this purpose. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
LUK	9	30	p3cd	figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	behold	Luke uses the word **behold** here to alert readers to pay attention to the surprising information that follows. Alternate translation: “suddenly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	9	31	g28p	figs-activepassive	οἳ ὀφθέντες ἐν δόξῃ	1	who were seen in glory	This phrase gives information about how Moses and Elijah looked. If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “who appeared in glorious splendor” or “who were shining brightly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	9	31	cur1	figs-euphemism	τὴν ἔξοδον αὐτοῦ	1	his departure	Luke is using a polite way of referring to Jesus’ death. Alternate translation: “how Jesus would leave this world” or “how Jesus would die” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
LUK	9	31	l502		ἣν ἤμελλεν πληροῦν ἐν Ἰερουσαλήμ	1	which he was about to fulfill in Jerusalem	Alternate translation: “which was soon going to happen in Jerusalem”
LUK	9	32	i29n	writing-background	δὲ	1	And	Luke uses this word to introduce background information about what Peter, James, and John were doing while Jesus was speaking with Moses and Elijah. Alternate translation: “Now” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
LUK	9	32	f8ip	figs-activepassive	βεβαρημένοι ὕπνῳ	1	Peter and those with him were weighted with sleep	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “sleep was weighing heavily upon Peter and James and John” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	9	32	l503	figs-personification	βεβαρημένοι ὕπνῳ	1	Peter and those with him were weighted with sleep	Luke speaks of **sleep** figuratively as if it were something that could be like a weight pressing down on a person. Alternate translation: “Peter and James and John all felt very sleepy” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
LUK	9	32	tw7e	figs-explicit	εἶδον τὴν δόξαν αὐτοῦ	1	they saw his glory	As in [2:9](../02/09.md), the implication is that this **glory** manifested visibly as a bright light.

LUK	9	32	tsj6		καὶ τοὺς δύο ἄνδρας τοὺς συνεστῶτας αὐτῷ	1	and the two men who were standing with him	This refers to Moses and Elijah. Alternate translation: “and they also saw Moses and Elijah”
LUK	9	33	l504	writing-newevent	καὶ ἐγένετο	1	And it happened that	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new development within this episode. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for this purpose. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
LUK	9	33	npk9	writing-pronouns	ἐν τῷ διαχωρίζεσθαι αὐτοὺς ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ	1	as they were going away from him	The word **they** refers to Moses and Elijah, not to the disciples. Alternate translation: “as Moses and Elijah were about to leave Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
LUK	9	33	l505	figs-exclusive	ἡμᾶς…ποιήσωμεν	1	for us…let us make	Since Peter wants to make it possible for Moses and Elijah to stay, when he says **it is good for us to be here**, he likely means “all six of us.” So if your language distinguishes between the exclusive and inclusive **us**, use the inclusive form in this sentence. However, when Peter says to Jesus, “let us make three tents,” he likely means that he and James and John would build them, so in that sentence, use the exclusive form of **us**. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
LUK	9	33	mby6	translate-unknown	σκηνὰς	1	tents	This term describes simple, temporary places in which to sit or sleep. Peter probably had in mind that he and the other two disciples would build them from the materials available on the mountain such as tree branches. Alternate translation: “shelters” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	9	33	l506		μὴ εἰδὼς ὃ λέγει	1	not knowing what he says	To call attention to a development in the story, Luke uses the present tense in past narration. See how you decided to approach this usage in [7:40](../07/40.md). If it would not be natural to use the present tense in your language, you can use the past tense in your translation. It may be helpful to make this a separate sentence. Alternate translation: “He did not know what he was saying”
LUK	9	34	ct1w	writing-pronouns	ταῦτα δὲ αὐτοῦ λέγοντος	1	as he was saying this	Alternate translation: “while Peter was saying these things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
LUK	9	34	e75d	figs-explicit	ἐφοβήθησαν	1	they were afraid	These adult disciples were not afraid of clouds. Rather, given all the unusual things that had already taken place on this mountain, they were afraid of what might happen to them once the cloud came completely over them. Alternate translation: “they were very apprehensive” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	9	34	asa6		εἰσελθεῖν αὐτοὺς εἰς τὴν νεφέλην	1	they entered into the cloud	This can be expressed in terms of what the cloud did. Alternate translation: “the cloud surrounded them”
LUK	9	35	q8xy	figs-explicit	φωνὴ ἐγένετο ἐκ τῆς νεφέλης	1	there was a voice from the cloud	Luke expects readers to understand that this voice could only have belonged to God. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “God spoke to them from the cloud” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	9	35	c3gt	guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	ὁ Υἱός μου	1	my Son	This is an important title for Jesus, the Son of God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
LUK	9	35	l733	figs-activepassive	ὁ ἐκλελεγμένος	1	the one who is chosen	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could indicate who has done the action. Alternate translation: “the one I have chosen” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	9	36	l507		ἐν τῷ γενέσθαι τὴν φωνὴν	1	when the voice had happened	Alternate translation: “after the voice had spoken”
LUK	9	36	l508	figs-idiom	εὑρέθη Ἰησοῦς μόνος	1	Jesus was found alone	The term **found** is an idiom that means “could be found” or “was there.” Alternate translation: “only Jesus was there” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	9	36	l509	figs-activepassive	εὑρέθη Ἰησοῦς μόνος	1	Jesus was found alone	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “only Jesus was there” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	9	36	v9uy	figs-doublet	αὐτοὶ ἐσίγησαν, καὶ οὐδενὶ ἀπήγγειλαν	1	they were silent and told no one	These two phrases mean the same thing. (The Greek verb in the first phrase does not always mean to make no sound. It can also mean to keep a secret.) Luke uses the two phrases together for emphasis. In your translation, you could also use repetition for emphasis, or, if it would be clearer in your language, you could combine the phrases. Alternate translation: “they kept it a secret and did not tell anyone” or “they said nothing about it to anyone” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
LUK	9	36	l510	figs-doublenegatives	οὐδενὶ ἀπήγγειλαν…οὐδὲν	1	told no one…anything	Luke uses a double negative in Greek for emphasis here, “told no one … nothing.” The second negative does not cancel the first to create a positive meaning, “told someone … something.” If for emphasis your language uses double negatives that do not cancel one another, it would be appropriate to use that construction here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
LUK	9	36	l511	figs-idiom	ἐν ἐκείναις ταῖς ἡμέραις	1	in those days	Luke uses the term **days** figuratively here to refer a particular time. Alternate translation: “at that time” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	9	37	q5f5	writing-newevent	ἐγένετο δὲ	1	And it happened that	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
LUK	9	38	l512	figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	behold	Luke uses the term **behold** to calls the reader’s attention to what he is about to say. Your language may have a similar expression that you can use here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	9	38	k35b	writing-participants	ἀνὴρ ἀπὸ τοῦ ὄχλου	1	a man from the crowd	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new character into the story. If your language has its own way of doing that, you can use it here in your translation. Alternate translation: “there was a man in the crowd who” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
LUK	9	38	l513		Διδάσκαλε	1	Teacher	This is a respectful title. You can translate it with an equivalent term that your language and culture would use.
LUK	9	38	l514	figs-idiom	ἐπιβλέψαι ἐπὶ	1	look upon	This is an idiom. Alternate translation: “help” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	9	39	l515	figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	behold	The man uses the term **behold** to calls Jesus’ attention to what he is about to say. Your language may have a similar expression that you can use here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	9	39	ka7j	writing-participants	πνεῦμα	1	a spirit	The man uses this phrase to introduce the spirit into his story. If your language has its own way of doing that, you can use it here in your translation. Alternate translation: “there is an evil spirit that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
LUK	9	39	abm3	translate-unknown	μετὰ ἀφροῦ	1	with foam	When a person is having convulsions, they can have trouble breathing or swallowing. This causes white foam to form around their mouths. Alternate translation: “and foam comes out of his mouth” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	9	39	l516	figs-litotes	μόγις ἀποχωρεῖ ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ	1	it departs from him with difficulty	The man is figuratively expressing a positive meaning by using a negative word together with a word that is the opposite of the intended meaning. Alternate translation: “it attacks him very often” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
LUK	9	39	l517	figs-metaphor	συντρῖβον αὐτόν	1	crushing him	The man speaks figuratively of the spirit as if it were a heavy weight whose attacks crush the boy. This is a reference to the injuries that the spirit causes. Alternate translation: “injuring him badly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	9	41	sdu1	figs-hendiadys	ἀποκριθεὶς δὲ ὁ Ἰησοῦς εἶπεν	1	Then answering Jesus said	Together the two words **answering** and **said** mean that Jesus responded to the man’s request. Alternate translation: “Then Jesus responded” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
LUK	9	41	bi9m	figs-apostrophe	ὦ γενεὰ ἄπιστος καὶ διεστραμμένη, ἕως πότε ἔσομαι πρὸς ὑμᾶς καὶ ἀνέξομαι ὑμῶν?	1	O unbelieving and perverted generation, until when will I be with you and bear with you?	Jesus is speaking figuratively to something that he knows cannot hear him. He is addressing the entire **generation** of people who were living at that time, and they are not all present to hear him. He is doing this to show the people who can hear him, the crowd that has gathered there, how he feels about their generation in a very strong way. If your readers might not understand this kind of figurative speech, you could translate Jesus’ words as if he were speaking directly to the crowd, since they are included in the **generation** that Jesus is figuratively addressing. Alternate translation: “You have all gone wrong because you do not believe, so I hope I do not have to stay here and put up with you for very long!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe]])
LUK	9	41	l518	figs-rquestion	ὦ γενεὰ ἄπιστος καὶ διεστραμμένη, ἕως πότε ἔσομαι πρὸς ὑμᾶς καὶ ἀνέξομαι ὑμῶν?	1	O unbelieving and perverted generation, until when will I be with you and bear with you?	Jesus is using the question form for emphasis. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or exclamation. Alternate translation: “You have all gone wrong because you do not believe, so I hope I do not have to stay here and put up with you for very long!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	9	41	apa3	figs-doublet	ἄπιστος καὶ διεστραμμένη	1	O unbelieving and perverted generation	The terms **unbelieving** and **perverted** mean similar things. Jesus uses them together for emphasis. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine them into a single phrase. Alternate translation: “You have all gone wrong because you do not believe” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
LUK	9	41	qk1w	figs-you	ἕως πότε ἔσομαι πρὸς ὑμᾶς καὶ ἀνέξομαι ὑμῶν?	1	until when will I be with you and bear with you?	In both cases here, **you** is plural in Greek because Jesus is addressing a **generation** that is made up of many people. However, **generation** is a collective noun, and if your language would treat a collective noun as singular in a context like this, you could use the singular form of **you**. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
LUK	9	41	ls7b	figs-you	προσάγαγε ὧδε τὸν υἱόν σου	1	Bring your son here	Jesus is now speaking to the father of the boy, and so **your** is singular here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
LUK	9	42	l519	writing-pronouns	ἔτι…προσερχομένου αὐτοῦ	1	while he was coming	The word **he** refers to the boy, not to the father. Alternate translation: “while the boy was coming” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
LUK	9	43	hz1l	figs-explicit	ἐξεπλήσσοντο δὲ πάντες ἐπὶ τῇ μεγαλειότητι τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	they all marveled at the majesty of God	Jesus performed the miracle, but the crowd recognized that **God** was the power behind the healing. Alternate translation: “they were all amazed that God would work so powerfully through Jesus in this way” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	9	43	d61c	writing-pronouns	πᾶσιν οἷς ἐποίει	1	everything that he was doing	The word **he** refers to Jesus, not to God the Father. Alternate translation: “everything Jesus was doing” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])

LUK	9	44	ygr3	figs-123person	ὁ γὰρ Υἱὸς τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου μέλλει παραδίδοσθαι	1	the Son of Man is going to be handed over	Jesus is speaking about himself in the third person. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this in the first person. Alternate translation: “someone is going to betray me, the Son of Man” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
LUK	9	44	l520	figs-explicit	ὁ γὰρ Υἱὸς τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου μέλλει παραδίδοσθαι	1	the Son of Man is going to be handed over	See how you translated the title **Son of Man** in [5:24](../05/24.md). Alternate translation: “someone is going to betray me, the Messiah” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	9	44	l521	figs-metaphor	εἰς χεῖρας ἀνθρώπων	1	into the hands of men	The term **hands** figuratively represent power and control. Alternate translation: “and give men power over him” or (if you translated in the first person) “and give men power over me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	9	44	l522	figs-explicit	εἰς χεῖρας ἀνθρώπων	1	into the hands of men	It may be helpful to make explicit who these **men** are. Alternate translation: “and give his enemies power over him” or (if you translated in the first person) “and give my enemies power over me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	9	45	l523	figs-metonymy	τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο…περὶ τοῦ ῥήματος τούτου	1	this word…about this word	Luke uses the term **word** figuratively to describe what Jesus said by using words. Alternate translation: “this saying…about this saying” or “this statement…about this statement” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	9	45	ub1r	figs-activepassive	ἦν παρακεκαλυμμένον ἀπ’ αὐτῶν	1	it was hidden from them	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you can say who did the action. Alternate translation: “God hid its meaning from them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	9	46	dh3w	writing-pronouns	ἐν αὐτοῖς	1	among them	Be sure that it is clear in your translation that the word **them** does not include Jesus. He was not arguing, along with the disciples, about who was the **greatest**. Alternate translation: “among the disciples” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
LUK	9	46	l524		τίς ἂν εἴη μείζων αὐτῶν	1	which of them might be the greatest	Alternate translation: “which one of them was the greatest”
LUK	9	47	cx62	figs-metaphor	εἰδὼς τὸν διαλογισμὸν τῆς καρδίας αὐτῶν	1	knowing the reasoning in their hearts	Luke uses the term **hearts** here figuratively to represent the disciples’ thoughts and evaluations. Alternate translation: “knowing what they were thinking” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	9	48	l525	figs-hyperbole	τοῦτο τὸ παιδίον	1	this child	Jesus is using the child as an extreme example. He is illustrating that since he will be present in even the most humble of his followers, the disciples do not need to argue among themselves about which of them is the greatest. Everyone who is working on behalf of Jesus possesses his full honor and dignity. Alternate translation: “even someone as seemingly insignificant as this child” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
LUK	9	48	afx5	figs-metonymy	ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματί μου	1	in my name	The term **name** is a figurative way of referring to a person by reference to something associated with them. Alternate translation: “as someone who is working on my behalf” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

LUK	9	48	awc6	figs-explicit	τὸν ἀποστείλαντά με	1	the one who sent me	Jesus assumes that his disciples will know that this means God. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “God, who sent me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	9	48	zw5t	figs-gendernotations	οὗτός ἐστιν μέγας	1	he is great	Jesus uses the word **he** here in a generic sense that includes both men and women. Alternate translation: “that is the person whom God considers to be great” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
LUK	9	49	uwr3	figs-hendiadys	ἀποκριθεὶς δὲ Ἰωάννης εἶπεν	1	Then answering John said	Together the two words **answering** and **said** mean that John responded to what Jesus had just said. Alternate translation: “Then John responded” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
LUK	9	49	bj41	figs-exclusive	εἴδομέν…μεθ’ ἡμῶν	1	we saw…with us	When John says **we**, he is speaking of himself and some other disciples who spoke to this man, so **we** would be exclusive, if your language uses that form. However, when John says **us**, he seems to be referring to the disciples and Jesus traveling together, and since he is speaking to Jesus, **us** would be inclusive. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
LUK	9	49	py8i	figs-metonymy	ἐν τῷ ὀνόματί σου	1	in your name	The term **name** is a figurative way of referring to a person by reference to something associated with them. This expression means the person was acting with the power and authority of Jesus. Alternate translation: “on your behalf” or “as your representative” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	9	49	l526	figs-metaphor	οὐκ ἀκολουθεῖ μεθ’ ἡμῶν	1	he does not follow with us	In this case, to **follow** Jesus does not seem to mean to be one of his disciples, as in [5:27](../05/27.md), since this man was acting in Jesus’ **name**. Rather, in this context it seems to refer to traveling together in this group with Jesus. Alternate translation: “he does not travel with you in our group” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	9	50	hw85	figs-litotes	μὴ κωλύετε	1	Do not prevent him	Jesus is figuratively expressing a positive meaning by using a negative word together with a word that is the opposite of the intended meaning. This can be stated positively. Alternate translation: “Allow him to continue” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
LUK	9	51	l527	writing-newevent	ἐγένετο δὲ	1	And it happened that	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
LUK	9	51	c8gx	figs-activepassive	ἐν τῷ συνπληροῦσθαι τὰς ἡμέρας τῆς ἀναλήμψεως αὐτοῦ	1	when the days of his being taken up were being fulfilled	If it would be clearer in your language, you could use active verbal forms in place of these two passive forms, and in the second case you could say who would do the action. Alternate translation: “when it was almost time for God to take him up” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	9	51	l528	figs-idiom	ἐν τῷ συνπληροῦσθαι τὰς ἡμέρας	1	when the days…were being fulfilled	Luke uses the term **days** figuratively here to refer a particular time. Alternate translation: “when it was almost time” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	9	51	l529	figs-explicit	τῆς ἀναλήμψεως αὐτοῦ	1	of his being taken up	The implication is that God would take Jesus back up to heaven, and the further implication is that this would be after Jesus died. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say one or both of those things explicitly. Alternate translation: “for God to take him up to heaven” or “for him to die and for God to take him back up to heaven” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	9	51	mq2d	figs-idiom	τὸ πρόσωπον ἐστήρισεν	1	he set his face	This is an idiom. Alternate translation: “he firmly decided” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	9	52	l530	figs-metaphor	πρὸ προσώπου αὐτοῦ	1	before his face	The term **face** figuratively means the front of a person. Alternate translation: “ahead of him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	9	52	l531	translate-names	κώμην Σαμαρειτῶν	1	a Samaritan village	The term **Samaritan** is a name that refers to a place that is in the region of Samaria or to a person who is from that region. Samaria was between Galilee and Judea, and the people who lived there were not Jewish and they were hostile to the Jews. The terms **Samaritan** and Samaria occur several times in this book. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	9	52	b6ct	figs-idiom	ὡς ἑτοιμάσαι αὐτῷ	1	so as to prepare for him	This means to make arrangements in anticipation of his arrival there, such as for food to eat, a place to stay, and possibly also a place to speak. Alternate translation: “to arrange his accommodations” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	9	53	v61k		οὐκ ἐδέξαντο αὐτόν	1	they did not welcome him	Alternate translation: “the Samaritans did not want him to stay with them”
LUK	9	53	l532	figs-synecdoche	τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ ἦν πορευόμενον εἰς Ἰερουσαλήμ	1	his face was going to Jerusalem	Luke is using one part of Jesus to represent all of him. Luke may use the **face** because Jesus was facing in the direction he was traveling. Or this may echo the expression “he set his face” in [9:52](../09/52.md). Alternate translation: “he was traveling toward Jerusalem” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
LUK	9	53	n62j	figs-explicit	ὅτι τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ ἦν πορευόμενον εἰς Ἰερουσαλήμ	1	because his face was going to Jerusalem	The Samaritans and the Jews hated each other. Therefore the Samaritans did not want to help Jesus travel to Jerusalem, which was the Jewish capital and the place where the Jews held their major religious observances. Alternate translation: “because they did not want to help any Jew make a journey to Jerusalem” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	9	54	a8sf	figs-metaphor	ἰδόντες	1	saw	The word **saw** figuratively represents notice and attention. Alternate translation: “recognized that the Samaritans were not going to accommodate Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	9	54	y4rq	figs-explicit	θέλεις εἴπωμεν πῦρ καταβῆναι ἀπὸ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ καὶ ἀναλῶσαι αὐτούς?	1	do you want us to tell fire to come down from heaven and consume them?	James and John suggested this method of judgment because they knew that this was how the prophets such as Elijah had called down judgment upon people who rejected God. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “do you want us to tell fire to come down from heaven to consume them, as Elijah did” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	9	54	l533	figs-exclusive	θέλεις εἴπωμεν	1	do you want us to tell	By **us**, James and John mean themselves, but not Jesus, so **us** is exclusive. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
LUK	9	55	pj6b	writing-pronouns	στραφεὶς…ἐπετίμησεν αὐτοῖς	1	he turned and rebuked them	The term **them** refers to James and John. Jesus did not condemn the Samaritans, as the disciples expected. Alternate translation: “Jesus turned around and rebuked James and John” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
LUK	9	57	l534		τις	1	someone	This was not one of the disciples. Alternate translation: “a certain person”
LUK	9	58	yq5n	figs-merism	αἱ ἀλώπεκες φωλεοὺς ἔχουσιν, καὶ τὰ πετεινὰ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ κατασκηνώσεις	1	The foxes have dens, and the birds of the sky have nests	Jesus is using a figure of speech. By naming a creature that lives on land and a creature that flies in the air, Jesus is referring to all creatures. Alternate translation: “Every creature has a place to live” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
LUK	9	58	anv9	translate-unknown	αἱ ἀλώπεκες	1	the foxes have dens	The word **foxes** describes land animals that are similar to small dogs. The word **dens** refers to holes that these animals dig in the ground as shelters. If your readers would not be familiar with this animal and its habits, you could describe them in general terms. Alternate translation: “little animals live in holes in the ground” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	9	58	c88m	figs-explicitinfo	τὰ πετεινὰ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ	1	the birds of the sky	In your language, it might seem that this phrase expresses unnecessary extra information. If so, you could abbreviate it. However, you could also use an action clause to keep the sense of **sky**, to complement the idea of “ground” in the previous phrase. Alternate translation: “birds” or “birds that fly in the air” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo]])
LUK	9	58	r7vq	figs-123person	ὁ…Υἱὸς τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου	1	the Son of Man	Jesus is speaking about himself in the third person. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this in the first person. Alternate translation: “I, the Son of Man” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
LUK	9	58	l535	figs-explicit	ὁ…Υἱὸς τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου	1	the Son of Man	See how you translated the title **Son of Man** in [5:24](../05/24.md). Alternate translation: “I, the Messiah” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	9	58	l536	figs-explicit	οὐκ ἔχει ποῦ τὴν κεφαλὴν κλίνῃ	1	does not have anywhere to lay his head	Jesus implies that if this person were to follow him, he too might not have a home. Alternate translation: “does not have a home anywhere, so if you become my disciple, expect that you will not have a home either” or (if you translated in the first person) “do not have a home anywhere, so if you become my disciple, expect that you will not have a home either” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	9	58	l537	figs-metonymy	οὐκ ἔχει ποῦ τὴν κεφαλὴν κλίνῃ	1	does not have anywhere to lay his head	This expression figuratively means “does not have anywhere to sleep,” by association with something that a person does in order to sleep, **lay** down his **head**. And a place to sleep, by association, means a home, since that is where people sleep. Alternate translation: “does not have a home anywhere” or (if you translated in the first person) “do not have a home anywhere” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	9	58	ff62	figs-hyperbole	οὐκ ἔχει ποῦ τὴν κεφαλὴν κλίνῃ	1	does not have anywhere to lay his head	Jesus actually did find places to sleep wherever he went to teach and heal, but he says figuratively that he has no such place at all to emphasize that he has no permanent home. Alternate translation: “does not have a permanent home” or (if you translated in the first person) “do not have a permanent home” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
LUK	9	59	l538	figs-metaphor	ἀκολούθει μοι	1	Follow me	As in [5:27](../05/27.md), to **follow** Jesus means to become one of his disciples. Alternate translation: “I want you to be one of my disciples” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	9	59	l539		ἐπίτρεψόν μοι ἀπελθόντι, πρῶτον θάψαι τὸν πατέρα μου	1	permit me to go first to bury my father	It is unclear whether the man’s father had died and that he would bury him immediately, or whether the man wanted to wait for a longer amount of time until his father died so that he could bury him then. The main point is that the man wanted to do something else first before going with Jesus. Alternate translation: “before I do that, let me go and bury my father”
LUK	9	59	l540	figs-metonymy	ἐπίτρεψόν μοι ἀπελθόντι, πρῶτον θάψαι τὸν πατέρα μου	1	permit me to go first to bury my father	One possible meaning of this expression is that the man wanted to wait until he had received his inheritance from his father so that he could live on that money while traveling with Jesus. If so, then he would be referring to the inheritance by association with his father’s death, and he would be referring to his father’s death by association with his burial. Alternate translation: “let me wait until I receive my inheritance” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	9	60	l541	figs-metaphor	ἄφες τοὺς νεκροὺς θάψαι τοὺς ἑαυτῶν νεκρούς	1	Let the dead bury their own dead	Jesus does not mean literally that dead people will bury other dead people. Instead, the expression **the dead** likely refers figuratively to those who do not follow Jesus and so are spiritually dead. Alternate translation: “Let people who are not concerned about spiritual things take care of everyday matters” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	9	60	l542	figs-nominaladj	τοὺς νεκροὺς	1	the dead	Jesus is using the adjective **dead** as a noun to refer to a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “people who are dead” or “people who are not concerned about spiritual things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
LUK	9	60	l543	figs-abstractnouns	τὴν Βασιλείαν τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	the kingdom of God	See how you decided to translate this phrase in [4:43](../04/43.md). If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **kingdom** with a verb such as “rule.” Alternate translation: “how God will rule” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
LUK	9	61	l544	figs-metaphor	ἀκολουθήσω σοι	1	I will follow you	As in [5:27](../05/27.md), to **follow** Jesus means to become one of his disciples. Alternate translation: “I want to be one of your disciples” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	9	61	l545		πρῶτον δὲ ἐπίτρεψόν μοι	1	but first permit me	Alternate translation: “but before I do that, please let me”
LUK	9	61	l546	figs-metonymy	τοῖς εἰς τὸν οἶκόν μου	1	those in my home	This person is referring figuratively to his family by association with where they live. Alternate translation: “my family” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	9	62	l547	figs-metaphor	οὐδεὶς ἐπιβαλὼν τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ ἐπ’ ἄροτρον καὶ βλέπων εἰς τὰ ὀπίσω, εὔθετός ἐστιν τῇ Βασιλείᾳ τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	No one, having put his hand on a plow, yet looking to the things behind, is fit for the kingdom of God	Jesus responds with an illustration that is designed to teach this person about what is required to be his disciple. He means that a person is not suitable for the kingdom to God if his past loyalties are more important to him. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain this illustration. Alternate translation, add: “No one can plow straight if he is looking backwards, and in the same way, no one will be useful in the kingdom of God if his past loyalties are more important to him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	9	62	l548	figs-synecdoche	οὐδεὶς ἐπιβαλὼν τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ ἐπ’ ἄροτρον	1	No one, having put his hand on a plow	Jesus refers figuratively to a person using a plow by describing one part of that activity, guiding the plow with the **hand**. Alternate translation: “No one who is using a plow” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
LUK	9	62	l553	translate-unknown	οὐδεὶς ἐπιβαλὼν τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ ἐπ’ ἄροτρον	1	No one, having put his hand on a plow	A **plow** is a tool that farmers use to break up soil to prepare a field for planting. Plows have sharp, pointed prongs that dig into the soil. They usually have handles that the farmer uses to guide the plow. If your readers would not be familiar with this kind of tool, you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “No one who needs to go straight forward” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	9	62	l549	figs-explicit	βλέπων εἰς τὰ ὀπίσω	1	looking to the things behind	The implication is that anyone who is looking backwards while plowing cannot guide the plow where it needs to go. That person must focus on looking forward in order to plow well. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “looking backwards, and so not going in the right direction” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	9	62	l550	figs-abstractnouns	εὔθετός ἐστιν τῇ Βασιλείᾳ τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	is fit for the kingdom of God	See how you decided to translate the phrase **the kingdom of God** in [4:43](../04/43.md). If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **kingdom** with a verb such as “rule.” Alternate translation: “can really let God rule his life” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
LUK	10	intro	z899			0		# Luke 10 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>1. Jesus sends seventy-two disciples to teach and heal (10:1–24)<br>2. Jesus tells the Parable of the Good Samaritan (10:25–37)<br>3. Jesus visits Mary and Martha (10:38–43)<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Harvest<br><br>Harvest refers to the time when people gather in the food they have planted so they can eat it some of it right away and store the rest for future use. Jesus uses this as a metaphor to teach his followers that they need to go and tell other people about him so that those people can become part of God’s kingdom. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]])<br><br>### Neighbor<br><br>The Jews helped their Jewish neighbors who needed help, and they expected their Jewish neighbors to help them. Jesus wanted them to understand that people who were not Jews were also their neighbors, so he told them a story about this (10:29-37). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])<br><br>## Important textual issues in this chapter<br><br>### “72”<br><br>In 10:1 and 10:17, some ancient manuscripts of the Bible read “72,” but others read “70.” ULT reads “72,” but it mentions in a footnote that scholars are divided as to which number was originally in the book of Luke.<br><br>### “Jesus”<br><br>In 10:39, many of the best ancient manuscripts read “Jesus,” but some read “the Lord.” ULT reads “Jesus.”<br><br>In both of these cases, if a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it has. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to follow the example of ULT. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
LUK	10	1	u8l6	writing-newevent	μετὰ δὲ ταῦτα	1	And after these things	Luke uses this phrase to mark a new event in the story. If your language has a similar expression that it uses for this same purpose, you can use that here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
LUK	10	1	l551		ὁ Κύριος	1	the Lord	Luke refers to Jesus here by a title that shows his authority. Alternate translation: “Jesus” or “the Lord Jesus”
LUK	10	1	m75c	translate-textvariants	ἑβδομήκοντα δύο	1	72	See the discussion of textual issues at the end of the General Notes to this chapter to decide whether to say **72** or “70” in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
LUK	10	1	g8ka	figs-idiom	ἀπέστειλεν αὐτοὺς ἀνὰ δύο	1	sent them out by twos	This is an idiom. Alternate translation: “sent them out two by two” or “sent them out in in groups of two” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	10	1	l554	figs-metaphor	πρὸ προσώπου αὐτοῦ	1	before his face	The term **face** figuratively means the front of a person. Alternate translation: “ahead of him” or “to prepare the way for him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	10	2	fx9w	figs-events	ἔλεγεν δὲ πρὸς αὐτούς	1	And he said to them	Jesus said these things to the 72 disciples before they actually went out. Alternate translation: “He had said to them” or “Before they went out, he told them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-events]])
LUK	10	2	ju6z	figs-metaphor	ὁ μὲν θερισμὸς πολύς, οἱ δὲ ἐργάται ὀλίγοι	1	The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few	This statement means, “There is a big crop, but there are not enough workers to bring it in.” Jesus is speaking figuratively. Alternate translation: “There are many people who are ready to enter God’s kingdom, but there are not enough disciples to help them understand how to do that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	10	2	l555	figs-exmetaphor	τοῦ Κυρίου τοῦ θερισμοῦ	1	the Lord of the harvest	Jesus continues to speak figuratively and extends his metaphor by describing God as **the Lord of the harvest**. Alternate translation: “God, who leads people to believe”
LUK	10	2	l556	figs-exmetaphor	ὅπως ἐργάτας ἐκβάλῃ εἰς τὸν θερισμὸν αὐτοῦ	1	that he would send out laborers into his harvest	Jesus extends his metaphor even further by describing disciples who help others to trust in him as **laborers** in the **harvest**. Alternate translation: “to send more disciples to go and help people trust in me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])
LUK	10	3	x732	figs-explicit	ὑπάγετε	1	Go	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say explicitly where Jesus wants these disciples to go. Alternate translation: “Go to the cities and places where I am sending you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	10	3	l557	figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	Behold	Jesus uses the term **behold** to get his disciples to focus their attention on what he is about to say. Alternate translation: “Listen carefully now” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	10	3	u8h7	figs-simile	ἀποστέλλω ὑμᾶς ὡς ἄρνας ἐν μέσῳ λύκων	1	I send you out as lambs in the midst of wolves	Wolves attack and kill sheep. This simile is a warning to the disciples whom Jesus is sending out that there will be people who will want to harm them. You could explain the meaning of this figurative expression in your translation. (However, you could also reproduce the simile, as suggested in the next note.) Alternate translation: “when I send you out, there are going to be some people who will want to harm you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
LUK	10	3	l558	translate-unknown	ἀποστέλλω ὑμᾶς ὡς ἄρνας ἐν μέσῳ λύκων	1	I send you out as lambs in the midst of wolves	Jesus’ disciples would have known that **lambs** are gentle animals that have been domesticated for their wool, milk, meat, and leather, and that **wolves** are predatory land animals, similar to large dogs, that hunt and kill in packs. If you would like to reproduce the simile, but your readers would not be familiar with these animals, you could use general terms. Alternate translation: “I am sending you out like harmless animals that will encounter a pack of predators” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	10	3	l559	figs-you	ὑμᾶς	1	you	Since Jesus is speaking to these 72 disciples as a group, **you** is plural here and through [10:12](../10/12.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
LUK	10	4	l560	figs-idiom	μὴ βαστάζετε βαλλάντιον, μὴ πήραν, μὴ ὑποδήματα	1	Do not carry a money bag, nor a sack, nor sandals	Jesus is using the word **carry** in an idiomatic sense here to mean “bring along.” He is not envisioning that these disciples might carry their sandals in their hands. Alternate translation: “Do not bring any money or provisions or extra clothes with you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	10	4	fz6p	figs-metonymy	μὴ βαστάζετε βαλλάντιον, μὴ πήραν, μὴ ὑποδήματα	1	Do not carry a money bag, nor a sack, nor sandals	While Jesus probably means what he says literally about not bringing these specific items, he is also using them figuratively with larger meanings. The **money bag** represents the money it would contain. The **sack** represents the provisions someone would carry in it for a journey. The **sandals** represent, in this culture, more clothing and equipment than is strictly needed. Alternate translation: “Do not bring any money or provisions or extra clothes with you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	10	4	l561	figs-explicit	μὴ βαστάζετε βαλλάντιον, μὴ πήραν, μὴ ὑποδήματα	1	Do not carry a money bag, nor a sack, nor sandals	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say explicitly why Jesus does not want his disciples to bring these things with them. As he will explain in [10:7](../10/07.md), he wants the people who receive his message to provide for those who bring the message. Alternate translation: “Do not bring any money or provisions or extra clothes with you, because the people who receive my message will provide for you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	10	4	tj52	figs-hyperbole	μηδένα κατὰ τὴν ὁδὸν ἀσπάσησθε	1	greet no one on the road	Jesus is generalizing to indicate that these disciples should go quickly to the places where he is sending them to prepare the way for him. He is not telling them to be rude. Alternate translation: “make your journey as quickly as possible” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
LUK	10	5	l562	figs-quotesinquotes	λέγετε, εἰρήνη τῷ οἴκῳ τούτῳ	1	say, ‘Peace be to this house’	Luke is quoting Jesus, and Jesus is quoting what he wants his disciples to say. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “say that you want there to be peace in that house” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	10	5	zk69	figs-metonymy	εἰρήνη τῷ οἴκῳ τούτῳ	1	Peace be to this house	The term **house** refers figuratively to the people who live in the house. Alternate translation: “May the people in this household have peace” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	10	5	l563	figs-idiom	εἰρήνη τῷ οἴκῳ τούτῳ	1	Peace be to this house	This was an idiomatic expression, based on the Hebrew concept of “shalom,” that was both a greeting and a blessing. Alternate translation: “I greet all of you in this household and I wish for God to bless you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	10	6	x5e4	figs-idiom	υἱὸς εἰρήνης	1	a son of peace	The expression **son of** refers figuratively to a person who shares the qualities of something. Alternate translation: “a person who wants peace with God and with people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	10	6	pq5j	figs-metaphor	ἐπαναπαήσεται ἐπ’ αὐτὸν ἡ εἰρήνη ὑμῶν	1	your peace will rest upon him	The term **upon** creates a spatial metaphor here. It means that this person will experience the peace that God gives in a special and lasting way. Alternate translation: “he will deeply experience the peace that you wish him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	10	6	it4v	figs-ellipsis	εἰ…μή γε	1	if not	It may be helpful to restate the entire phrase. Alternate translation: “if there is no one there who wants peace with God and with people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
LUK	10	6	zpx9	figs-personification	ἐφ’ ὑμᾶς ἀνακάμψει	1	it will return to you	Jesus describes **peace** as a living thing that could choose to leave one person and go to another person. Alternate translation: “you will experience that peace yourself instead” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
LUK	10	7	ki3k		ἐν αὐτῇ δὲ τῇ οἰκίᾳ μένετε	1	remain in that house	Jesus was not saying that they should stay in the house all the time and never leave it, but that they should make it their base of operations for as long as they were in that place. Alternate translation: “stay at that house”
LUK	10	7	l564	figs-idiom	τὰ παρ’ αὐτῶν	1	what is from them	This is an idiom. Alternate translation: “the food and drink that they provide” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	10	7	u3vs	writing-proverbs	ἄξιος γὰρ ὁ ἐργάτης τοῦ μισθοῦ αὐτοῦ	1	for the laborer is worthy of his wages	Jesus is quoting or creating a proverb, a short saying about something that is generally true in life, to explain the reason for these arrangements. You could translate the proverb directly into your language, or you could explain its meaning. Alternate translation: “since you will be teaching and healing the people, they should provide you with a place to stay and food to eat” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-proverbs]])
LUK	10	7	kd8i		μὴ μεταβαίνετε ἐξ οἰκίας εἰς οἰκίαν	1	Do not move around from house to house	This expression describes staying in different houses rather than making one house the base of operations the whole time. Jesus is repeating his earlier instruction, **remain in that house**, for emphasis. Jesus is not saying that these disciples cannot go to meet with people in other homes. Alternate translation: “As I said, stay at that house”
LUK	10	8	k8yb	writing-pronouns	καὶ δέχωνται ὑμᾶς	1	and they receive you	The term **they** refers to the people living in this city. Alternate translation: “if the people there welcome you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
LUK	10	8	wd2x	figs-activepassive	ἐσθίετε τὰ παρατιθέμενα ὑμῖν	1	eat what is served to you	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who would do the action. Alternate translation: “eat whatever food the people of that city serve you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	10	9	ws6g	figs-nominaladj	τοὺς…ἀσθενεῖς	1	the sick	Jesus is using the adjective **sick** as a noun, to refer to a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “the people who are sick” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
LUK	10	9	l565	writing-pronouns	ἐν αὐτῇ	1	in it	Alternate translation: “who live in that city” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
LUK	10	9	l566	figs-quotesinquotes	λέγετε αὐτοῖς, ἤγγικεν ἐφ’ ὑμᾶς ἡ Βασιλεία τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	say to them, ‘The kingdom of God has come close to you’	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “tell them that the kingdom of God has come close to them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	10	9	e1he	figs-abstractnouns	ἤγγικεν ἐφ’ ὑμᾶς ἡ Βασιλεία τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	The kingdom of God has come close to you	The idea behind the abstract noun **kingdom** can be expressed with a verb such as “rule.” This could mean one of two things. (1) The kingdom of God is close in place, that is, its activities are happening nearby. Alternate translation: “God is ruling in this area” (2) The kingdom of God is close in time, that is, it will begin soon. Alternate translation: “God will soon begin to rule as king” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
LUK	10	10	nt9n	writing-pronouns	καὶ μὴ δέχωνται ὑμᾶς	1	and they do not receive you	This is a direct contrast to the similar expression in [10:8](../10/08.md). Once again the term **they** refers to the people living in this city. Alternate translation: “if the people there do not welcome you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
LUK	10	11	l567	figs-quotesinquotes	καὶ τὸν κονιορτὸν τὸν κολληθέντα ἡμῖν, ἐκ τῆς πόλεως ὑμῶν εἰς τοὺς πόδας ἀπομασσόμεθα ὑμῖν; πλὴν τοῦτο γινώσκετε, ὅτι ἤγγικεν ἡ Βασιλεία τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Even the dust that clings to us from your city on our feet we wipe off against you! But know this, that the kingdom of God has come near	Luke is quoting Jesus, and Jesus is quoting what he wants his disciples to say. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation (continuing from the end of the previous verse): “that you are going to wipe even the dust from their city off your feet as a warning to them, but that you still want them to know that the kingdom of God came close to them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	10	11	bc9h	translate-symaction	καὶ τὸν κονιορτὸν τὸν κολληθέντα ἡμῖν, ἐκ τῆς πόλεως ὑμῶν εἰς τοὺς πόδας ἀπομασσόμεθα ὑμῖν	1	Even the dust that clings to us from your city on our feet we wipe off against you	This is a symbolic action by which these disciples are to show that they do not want to have the slightest connection with the people of any city who reject Jesus. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain its significance. Alternate translation: “Because you have rejected Jesus, we want to have nothing to do with you. We do not even want to have the dust from your town on our feet” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
LUK	10	11	l634	figs-youdual	ἀπομασσόμεθα	1	we wipe off	Since Jesus was sending these people out in groups of two, two people would be saying this. So languages that have a dual form of “we” should use that form. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
LUK	10	11	s7ks	figs-idiom	πλὴν τοῦτο γινώσκετε	1	But know this	The phrase introduces a warning. Alternate translation: “But we must warn you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	10	11	fdk3	figs-abstractnouns	ἤγγικεν ἡ Βασιλεία τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	the kingdom of God has come near	See how you translated the similar sentence in [10:9](../10/09.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
LUK	10	12	hhl1		λέγω ὑμῖν, ὅτι	1	I say to you that	Jesus says this to emphasize that what he is about to tell these disciples is very important. Alternate translation: “Now listen to this carefully”
LUK	10	12	l568	figs-idiom	τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ	1	on that day	Jesus is using the term **day** to refer figuratively to a specific time. Alternate translation: “when God judges everyone for what they have done” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	10	12	m7ch	figs-explicit	τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ	1	on that day	Jesus expected his disciples to understand that he was referring to the time when God will bring final judgment. Alternate translation: “when God judges everyone for what they have done” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	10	12	qg62	figs-metonymy	Σοδόμοις…ἀνεκτότερον ἔσται, ἢ τῇ πόλει ἐκείνῃ	1	it will be more tolerable for Sodom than for that city	Jesus uses the name of the city, **Sodom**, to refer figuratively to the people who lived there. Alternate translation: “God will judge the people of that town more severely than he will judge the people of Sodom” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	10	12	l569	figs-explicit	Σοδόμοις…ἀνεκτότερον ἔσται, ἢ τῇ πόλει ἐκείνῃ	1	it will be more tolerable for Sodom than for that city	Jesus assumes that these disciples will know that God destroyed the city of Sodom because the people in it were so wicked. The implication is that it must therefore be an extremely serious offense to reject the messengers of the kingdom of God. Alternate translation: “God will judge the people of that town more severely than he will judge the people of Sodom, even though he destroyed their city because they were so wicked” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	10	13	sf42	figs-apostrophe	οὐαί σοι, Χοραζείν! οὐαί σοι, Βηθσαϊδά!	1	Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida!	Jesus is speaking figuratively to two cities that he knows cannot hear him. He is doing this to show the people who can hear him, the disciples whom he is sending out, how he feels about those cities in a very strong way. If your readers might not understand this kind of figurative speech, you could translate Jesus’ words as if he were speaking directly to his disciples. Alternate translation: “Chorazin and Bethsaida are two of the cities whose people God will judge severely for rejecting my message” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe]])
LUK	10	13	l570	figs-idiom	οὐαί σοι, Χοραζείν! οὐαί σοι, Βηθσαϊδά!	1	Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida!	See how you translated this phrase in [6:24](../06/24.md). Alternate translation: “how terrible it will be for you, Chorazin and Bethsaida!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	10	13	l571	figs-metonymy	οὐαί σοι, Χοραζείν! οὐαί σοι, Βηθσαϊδά!	1	Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida!	Jesus is using the names of these cities to refer figuratively to the people who live there. Alternate translation: “how terrible it will be for you people of Chorazin and Bethsaida!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	10	13	l572	figs-you	οὐαί σοι, Χοραζείν! οὐαί σοι, Βηθσαϊδά!	1	Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida!	Jesus is addressing an individual city in each of these phrases, so **you** is singular in both cases. However, if you decide to translate this as “you people of Chorazin and Bethsaida,” then **you** would be plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
LUK	10	13	l573	translate-names	Χοραζείν…Βηθσαϊδά!	1	Chorazin…Bethsaida	These are the names of two cities. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	10	13	mvq5	figs-hypo	ὅτι εἰ ἐν Τύρῳ καὶ Σιδῶνι ἐγενήθησαν αἱ δυνάμεις, αἱ γενόμεναι ἐν ὑμῖν, πάλαι ἂν…μετενόησαν	1	For if the mighty works that happened in you had happened in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago	Jesus is describing a situation that might have happened in the past but actually did not. He is doing this to express disappointment and regret about what is happening in the present. Be sure to translate this in such a way that your readers will know that this event actually did not happen but they will understand why Jesus is imagining it. Alternate translation: “I can well imagine that if the people of Tyre and Sidon had witnessed the miracles that I performed for you, they would have repented a long time ago” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
LUK	10	13	l574	figs-explicit	ὅτι εἰ ἐν Τύρῳ καὶ Σιδῶνι ἐγενήθησαν αἱ δυνάμεις, αἱ γενόμεναι ἐν ὑμῖν, πάλαι ἂν…μετενόησαν	1	For if the mighty works that happened in you had happened in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago	Jesus assumes that these disciples will know that God destroyed the cities of Tyre and Sidon because the people in them were so wicked. So the implication is similar to the one about the people of Sodom. Alternate translation: “God destroyed the cities of Tyre and Sidon because they were so wicked. But even the people who lived in those cities would have repented if they had seen the miracles I did in Chorazin and Bethsaida. So the people of Chorazin and Bethsaida certainly should have repented as well” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	10	13	l575	figs-metonymy	Τύρῳ καὶ Σιδῶνι	1	Tyre and Sidon	Jesus uses the names of these cities to refer figuratively to the people who lived there. Alternate translation: “the people of Tyre and Sidon” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	10	13	l576	translate-names	Τύρῳ καὶ Σιδῶνι	1	Tyre and Sidon	These are the names of two cities. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	10	13	l577	figs-youdual	αἱ δυνάμεις, αἱ γενόμεναι ἐν ὑμῖν	1	the mighty works that happened in you	Since Jesus is addressing two cities, **you** would be dual here if your language uses that form. Otherwise, it would be plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
LUK	10	13	it4x	translate-symaction	ἂν ἐν σάκκῳ καὶ σποδῷ καθήμενοι μετενόησαν	1	they would have repented…sitting in sackcloth and ashes	Jesus is saying that the people of Tyre and Sidon would have performed these actions, which are signs of humility and sorrow, to show that they were very sorry for committing their sins. Alternate translation: “they would have shown how sorry they were for their sins…by sitting on the ground wearing rough clothes and putting ashes on their heads” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
LUK	10	14	l578	figs-metonymy	Τύρῳ καὶ Σιδῶνι, ἀνεκτότερον ἔσται…ἢ ὑμῖν	1	it will be more tolerable for Tyre and for Sidon…than for you	Jesus uses the name of these cities, **Tyre** and **Sidon**, to refer figuratively to the people who lived there. Alternate translation: “God will judge you people of Chorazin and Bethsaida more severely than he will judge the people who lived in Tyre and Sidon” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	10	14	ikt3	figs-explicit	Τύρῳ καὶ Σιδῶνι, ἀνεκτότερον ἔσται…ἢ ὑμῖν	1	it will be more tolerable for Tyre and for Sidon…than for you	Jesus assumes that these disciples will know that God destroyed the cities of Tyre and Sidon because the people in them were so wicked. The implication, as in the case of Sodom, is that it must therefore be an extremely grave offense to reject the messengers of the kingdom of God. Alternate translation: “God will judge you people of Chorazin and Bethsaida more severely than he will judge the people who lived in Tyre and Sidon, even though he destroyed their cities because they were so wicked” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	10	14	l579	figs-explicit	Τύρῳ καὶ Σιδῶνι, ἀνεκτότερον ἔσται…ἢ ὑμῖν	1	it will be more tolerable for Tyre and for Sidon…than for you	It may be helpful to state clearly the reason why God will judge Chorazin and Bethsaida. Alternate translation: “Because you did not repent and believe in me even though you saw me do miracles, God will judge you people of Chorazin and Bethsaida more severely than he will judge the people who lived in Tyre and Sidon” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	10	14	txw5	figs-explicit	ἐν τῇ κρίσει	1	at the judgment	The disciples would have understood that Jesus was referring to the time when God will bring final judgment. Alternate translation: “at the time when God judges everyone for what they have done” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	10	14	l580	figs-youdual	ὑμῖν	1	you	Since Jesus is addressing two cities, **you** would be dual here if your language uses that form. Otherwise, it would be plural. Alternate translation: “you people of Chorazin and Bethsaida” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
LUK	10	15	h28u	figs-apostrophe	σύ, Καφαρναούμ, μὴ ἕως οὐρανοῦ ὑψωθήσῃ?	1	you, Capernaum, you will not be exalted to heaven, will you?	Jesus is speaking figuratively to another city that he knows cannot hear him. He is doing this once again to show the people who can hear him, the disciples whom he is sending out, how he feels about this city in a very strong way. If your readers might not understand this kind of figurative speech, you could translate Jesus’ words as if he were speaking directly to his disciples. Alternate translation: “The people of Capernaum are wrong to think that God is going to honor them greatly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe]])
LUK	10	15	l581	figs-doublenegatives	σύ, Καφαρναούμ, μὴ ἕως οὐρανοῦ ὑψωθήσῃ?	1	you, Capernaum, you will not be exalted to heaven, will you?	In Greek, the first word of the question that Jesus asks Capernaum is a negative word that can be used to turn a negative statement into a question that expects a negative answer. ULT shows this by adding, “will you?” Your language may have other ways of asking a question that expects a negative answer, for example, by changing the word order of a positive statement. Translate this in the way that would be clearest in your language. Alternate translation: “you people of Capernaum, do you really think that God is going to honor you greatly?” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
LUK	10	15	enp6	figs-rquestion	σύ, Καφαρναούμ, μὴ ἕως οὐρανοῦ ὑψωθήσῃ?	1	you, Capernaum, you will not be exalted to heaven, will you?	Jesus is using the question form to teach. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate his words as a statement. Alternate translation: “you people of Capernaum are wrong to think that God is going to honor you greatly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	10	15	gk9v	figs-metaphor	σύ, Καφαρναούμ, μὴ ἕως οὐρανοῦ ὑψωθήσῃ?	1	you, Capernaum, you will not be exalted to heaven, will you?	To be **exalted** or “lifted up” is a spatial metaphor that figuratively indicates receiving honor. To be lifted all the way up **to heaven** (or “to the sky,” another possible meaning) figuratively means to receive very great honor. Alternate translation: “you people of Capernaum are wrong to think that God is going to honor you greatly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	10	15	l582	figs-metonymy	σύ, Καφαρναούμ	1	you, Capernaum	Jesus uses the name of this city to refer figuratively to the people who live there. Alternate translation: “you people of Capernaum” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	10	15	l583	figs-you	σύ, Καφαρναούμ	1	you, Capernaum	Jesus is addressing an individual city, so **you** is singular here and in the rest of this verse. However, if you decide to translate this as “you people of Capernaum,” then **you** would be plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
LUK	10	15	l584	translate-names	Καφαρναούμ	1	Capernaum	This is the name of a city. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	10	15	l585	figs-activepassive	ἕως οὐρανοῦ ὑψωθήσῃ	1	you will…be exalted to heaven	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who would do the action. Alternate translation: “God is going to honor you greatly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	10	15	l586	figs-explicit	ἕως οὐρανοῦ ὑψωθήσῃ	1	you will…be exalted to heaven	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state the reason why the people of Capernaum think that God would want to honor them. Alternate translation: “God is going to honor you greatly because you are such good people and your city is so prosperous” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	10	15	l587	figs-metaphor	τοῦ ᾍδου καταβήσῃ	1	You will be brought down as far as Hades	To be **brought down** is another spatial metaphor. It figuratively indicates experiencing punishment and dishonor. To be brought down all the way to Hades, the underworld (that is, the abode of the dead), figuratively means to receive very great punishment or dishonor. Alternate translation: “God is going to punish you severely” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	10	15	bjh5	figs-activepassive	τοῦ ᾍδου καταβήσῃ	1	You will be brought down as far as Hades	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who would do the action. Alternate translation: “God is going to punish you severely” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	10	15	l588	figs-explicit	τοῦ ᾍδου καταβήσῃ	1	You will be brought down as far as Hades	It may be helpful to state clearly the reason why God will judge Capernaum. Alternate translation: “God is going to punish you severely because you did not repent and believe in me, even though you saw me do miracles” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	10	16	i786	figs-metaphor	ὁ ἀκούων ὑμῶν, ἐμοῦ ἀκούει	1	The one who listens to you listens to me	You could translate this metaphor as a simile. Alternate translation: “When someone listens to you, it is as if they were listening to me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	10	16	q56b	figs-metaphor	ὁ ἀθετῶν ὑμᾶς, ἐμὲ ἀθετεῖ	1	the one who rejects you rejects me	You could also translate this metaphor as a simile. Alternate translation: “when someone rejects you, it is as if they were rejecting me” See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	10	16	g3fx	figs-simile	ὁ…ἐμὲ ἀθετῶν, ἀθετεῖ τὸν ἀποστείλαντά με	1	the one who rejects me rejects the one who sent me	You could also translate this metaphor as a simile. Alternate translation: “when someone rejects me, it is as if they were rejecting the one who sent me” See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
LUK	10	16	eus8	figs-explicit	τὸν ἀποστείλαντά με	1	the one who sent me	This refers implictly to God, who appointed Jesus for this special task. Alternate translation: “God who sent me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	10	17	m7nh	figs-explicit	ὑπέστρεψαν δὲ οἱ ἑβδομήκοντα δύο	1	then the 72 returned	Some languages will need to say that the 72 actually went out first, as UST does. Alternate translation: “So the 72 disciples went out and did as Jesus had told them to do, and then they returned” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	10	17	prj8	translate-textvariants	ἑβδομήκοντα δύο	1	72	As in [10:1](../10/01.md), see the discussion of textual issues at the end of the General Notes to this chapter to decide whether to say **72** or “70” in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
LUK	10	17	l589	figs-activepassive	τὰ δαιμόνια ὑποτάσσεται ἡμῖν	1	the demons are subjected to us	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “the demons obey us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	10	17	cx7b	figs-metonymy	ἐν τῷ ὀνόματί σου	1	in your name	The term **name** refers figuratively to Jesus’ power and authority. Alternate translation: “when we command them using the authority that you gave us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	10	18	a37w	figs-simile	ἐθεώρουν τὸν Σατανᾶν ὡς ἀστραπὴν ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ πεσόντα	1	I was watching Satan fall from heaven like lightning	Jesus uses a simile to express that while his 72 disciples were out proclaiming the kingdom of God, he discerned that this was a quick and decisive defeat for Satan. If your readers would be familiar with lightning, you could use the same simile in your translation. Otherwise, you could use another comparison to something that happens rapidly and evidently. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
LUK	10	18	v8fl	figs-metaphor	ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ πεσόντα	1	fall from heaven	While Jesus actually did see this in his vision, if it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the meaning of this image, as UST does. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	10	18	l590	translate-names	Σατανᾶν	1	Satan	This is the name of the devil. It occurs a few more times in this book. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	10	19	l591	figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	Behold	Jesus uses this term to focus his disciples’ attention on what he is about to say. Alternate translation: “Listen carefully now” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	10	19	xl7q	figs-metaphor	τὴν ἐξουσίαν τοῦ πατεῖν ἐπάνω ὄφεων καὶ σκορπίων	1	authority to tread on snakes and scorpions	This could mean one of two things. (1) Jesus could be referring to actual **snakes and scorpions** and saying that God will protect his disciples from these dangers everywhere they travel to proclaim the kingdom. Alternate translation: “protection from snakes and scorpions, even if you step on them” (2) The phrase **snakes and scorpions** could be a figurative way of describing evil spirits. Alternate translation: “the power to defeat evil spirits” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	10	19	l592	translate-unknown	ὄφεων	1	snakes	In context, this clearly means poisonous **snakes**. If your readers would not be familiar with **snakes**, you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “poisonous biting animals” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	10	19	mla6	translate-unknown	σκορπίων	1	scorpions	The term **scorpions** describes small animals that are related to spiders. They have two claws and a poisonous stinger in their tail. If your readers would not be familiar with **scorpions**, you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “poisonous stinging animals” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	10	19	uvt4	figs-explicit	καὶ ἐπὶ πᾶσαν τὴν δύναμιν τοῦ ἐχθροῦ	1	and over all the power of the enemy	This phrase continues the meaning from earlier in the sentence. The **enemy** is Satan, as described in the previous verse. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “I have also given you authority to overcome the resistance of Satan” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	10	19	l593	figs-doublenegatives	οὐδὲν ὑμᾶς οὐ μὴ ἀδικήσῃ	1	nothing will harm you at all	Jesus uses a double negative for emphasis here, “nothing in no way will hurt you.” The second negative does not cancel the first to create a positive meaning, “something in some way might hurt you.” If your language uses double negatives for emphasis that do not cancel one another, it would be appropriate to use that construction here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
LUK	10	20	cs52	figs-hyperbole	ἐν τούτῳ μὴ χαίρετε, ὅτι τὰ πνεύματα ὑμῖν ὑποτάσσεται, χαίρετε δὲ ὅτι τὰ ὀνόματα ὑμῶν ἐνγέγραπται ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς	1	do not rejoice in this, that the spirits are subjected to you, but rejoice that your names are written in the heavens	Jesus is not actually telling the disciples not to rejoice over the way God has allowed them to deliver people who were oppressed by demons. Rather, he is exaggerating to emphasize that the disciples should rejoice even more that their names are written in heaven. Alternate translation: “rejoice that your names are written in heaven even more than you rejoice that the spirits submit to you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
LUK	10	20	l594	figs-activepassive	τὰ ὀνόματα ὑμῶν ἐνγέγραπται	1	the spirits are subjected to you	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “the demons must obey you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	10	20	s4cj	figs-activepassive	τὰ ὀνόματα ὑμῶν ἐνγέγραπται ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς	1	your names are written in the heavens	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who has done the action. Alternate translation: “God has written down your names in heaven” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	10	20	l595	figs-explicit	τὰ ὀνόματα ὑμῶν ἐνγέγραπται ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς	1	your names are written in the heavens	While it may be literally true that there is a written record of names in heaven, you may wish to express the meaning and significance of this in your translation. Alternate translation: “God in heaven knows that you belong to him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	10	21	l596	figs-idiom	ἐν αὐτῇ τῇ ὥρᾳ	1	At that hour	Luke uses the term **hour** figuratively here to refer a particular time. Alternate translation: “At that same time” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	10	21	l597	figs-youformal	Ἐξομολογοῦμαί σοι, πάτερ	1	I thank you, Father	Use your best judgment about whether the formal or informal form of **you** would be more natural in your language here. Jesus is speaking as an adult son would to a father with whom he had a close relationship. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youformal]])
LUK	10	21	mf9d	guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	Πάτερ	1	Father	This is an important title for God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
LUK	10	21	rs3w	figs-merism	Κύριε τοῦ οὐρανοῦ καὶ τῆς γῆς	1	Lord of heaven and earth	Jesus is using a figure of speech to describe something by naming its two components. Together, **heaven** and **earth** represent everything that exists. Alternate translation: “you who rule over everything that exists” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
LUK	10	21	n6xb	figs-extrainfo	ταῦτα	1	these things	Jesus is likely using this expression to refer to his identity as God’s Son, and God’s identity as his Father. He describes these things in the next verse and says that only people to whom he reveals these identities can understand them, just as he says here that they are revealed only to certain people. Since the expression is explained in the next verse, you do not need to explain its meaning further here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])
LUK	10	21	l598	figs-nominaladj	σοφῶν καὶ συνετῶν	1	the wise and intelligent	Jesus is using the adjectives **wise** and **intelligent** as nouns to refer to people who have those qualities. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this with an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “people who are wise and intelligent” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
LUK	10	21	i2zf	figs-irony	σοφῶν καὶ συνετῶν	1	the wise and intelligent	Because God had concealed the truth from these people, they actually were not wise and intelligent, even though they thought they were. Alternate translation: “people who think they are wise and intelligent” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])
LUK	10	21	l599	figs-doublet	σοφῶν καὶ συνετῶν	1	the wise and intelligent	The terms **wise** and **intelligent** mean similar things. Jesus uses the two terms together for emphasis. Alternate translation: “people who think they understand everything” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
LUK	10	21	a175	figs-metaphor	νηπίοις	1	infants	This term refers figuratively to people who may not have much education, but who are willing to accept Jesus’ teachings in the same way that little children willingly listen to those they trust. You could explain the meaning of this metaphor in your translation, or you could transalte it as a simile, as UST does. Alternate translation: “people who trust my teachings implicitly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	10	21	nm6t	figs-metaphor	ἔμπροσθέν σου	1	before you	Jesus says **before you** to mean “where you could see” or “in your sight.” Sight, in turn, figuratively means attention and judgment. Alternate translation: “in your judgment” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	10	22	e47e	figs-activepassive	πάντα μοι παρεδόθη ὑπὸ τοῦ Πατρός μου	1	All things have been handed over to me from my Father	This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: “My Father has handed everything over to me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	10	22	l600	grammar-connect-exceptions	οὐδεὶς γινώσκει τίς ἐστιν ὁ Υἱὸς, εἰ μὴ ὁ Πατήρ	1	no one knows who the Son is except the Father	If, in your language, it would appear that Jesus is making a statement here and then contradicting it, you could reword this to avoid using an exception clause. Alternate translation: “only the Father knows who the Son is” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-exceptions]])
LUK	10	22	six4		γινώσκει τίς ἐστιν ὁ Υἱὸς	1	knows who the Son is	The Greek word translated **knows** here means to know from personal experience. God the Father knows Jesus in this way. Alternate translation: “is acquainted with the Son” or “is acquainted with me”
LUK	10	22	xm3s	figs-123person	γινώσκει τίς ἐστιν ὁ Υἱὸς	1	knows who the Son is	Jesus is referring to himself in the third person. Alternate translation: “knows who I am” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
LUK	10	22	fp68	guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	ὁ Υἱὸς…ὁ Πατήρ	1	the Son…the Father	These are important titles that describe the relationship between God and Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
LUK	10	22	rkt2	grammar-connect-exceptions	οὐδεὶς γινώσκει…τίς ἐστιν ὁ Πατὴρ, εἰ μὴ ὁ Υἱὸς	1	no one knows…who the Father is except the Son	If, in your language, it would appear that Jesus is making a statement here and then contradicting it, you could reword this to avoid using an exception clause. Alternate translation: “only the Son knows who the Father is” or “only I know who the Father is” or “only I am acquainted with the Father” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-exceptions]])
LUK	10	22	zg14		γινώσκει…τίς ἐστιν ὁ Πατὴρ	1	knows…who the Father is	The Greek word translated **knows** here means to know from personal experience. Jesus knows God his Father in this way. Alternate translation: “is acquainted with the Father” or “am acquainted with the Father”
LUK	10	22	evw3		ᾧ ἐὰν βούληται ὁ Υἱὸς ἀποκαλύψαι	1	to whomever the Son desires to reveal him	Alternate translation: “whoever the Son wants to introduce the Father to” or (if you translated in the first person) “whoever I want to introduce the Father to”
LUK	10	23	yd5s	figs-explicit	καὶ στραφεὶς πρὸς τοὺς μαθητὰς κατ’ ἰδίαν εἶπεν	1	And having turned around to the disciples, he said privately	The implication is that a crowd was present when the 72 disciples returned to report to Jesus what they had done, and that this crowd heard what Jesus told them and what he prayed to God. But now Jesus is speaking only to the disciples in a way that the crowd will not be able to hear him. Alternate translation: “Then Jesus said, in the direction of his disciples so that only they could hear him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	10	23	l601	figs-synecdoche	μακάριοι οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ οἱ βλέποντες ἃ βλέπετε	1	Blessed are the eyes that see what you see	Jesus is using the term **eyes** to describe these disciples by reference to one part of them, the part they are using to witness the great works that reveal who he is. Alternate translation: “How good it is for you to see what you see” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
LUK	10	23	mq23	figs-explicit	μακάριοι οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ οἱ βλέποντες ἃ βλέπετε	1	Blessed are the eyes that see what you see	The phrase **what you see** probably refers to the great works of healing and miracles that Jesus is doing, which reveal who he is. Alternate translation: “How good it is for you to see the things that I am doing” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	10	24	f32w	figs-explicit	καὶ οὐκ εἶδαν	1	and did not see	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could give the reason why the prophets and kings did not see these things. Alternate translation: “but could not see them because they lived before this time” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	10	24	q61s	figs-explicit	ἃ ἀκούετε	1	what you hear	This probably refers to the teachings of Jesus. Alternate translation: “the things that you have heard me say” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	10	24	mb4b	figs-explicit	καὶ οὐκ ἤκουσαν	1	and did not hear	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could give the reason why the prophets and kings did not hear these things. Alternate translation: “but could not hear them because they lived before this time” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	10	25	l602	figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	behold	Luke uses the term **behold** to calls the reader’s attention to what he is about to say. Your language may have a similar expression that you can use here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	10	25	klh4	writing-participants	νομικός τις	1	a certain lawyer	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new character into the story. If your language has its own way of doing that, you can use it here in your translation. Alternate translation: “there was a lawyer who” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
LUK	10	25	l603	translate-unknown	νομικός	1	lawyer	See how you translated this in [7:30](../07/30.md). Alternate translation: “an expert in the Jewish law” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	10	25	l604	translate-symaction	stood up	1	ἀνέστη	By standing up, this lawyer was indicating that he had a question to ask Jesus. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain that this was the reason for his action. Alternate translation: “stood up to show that he wanted to ask a question” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
LUK	10	25	c6ac		ἐκπειράζων αὐτὸν	1	to test him	Alternate translation: “to see how well he would answer”
LUK	10	25	l605		Διδάσκαλε	1	Teacher	This was a respectful title. You can translate it with an equivalent term that your language and culture would use.
LUK	10	25	l606	figs-verbs	τί ποιήσας, ζωὴν αἰώνιον κληρονομήσω?	1	Doing what, will I inherit eternal life?	This lawyer may be asking about a single deed that would be worthy of eternal life, because he uses a verb form that does not indicate continuing action. Alternate translation: “What one thing do I need to do so that God will give me eternal life?” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-verbs]])
LUK	10	25	dh16		κληρονομήσω	1	will I inherit	The lawyer is using the term **inherit** in a figurative sense to mean “come to possess” or “have.” Alternate translation: “so that God will give me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	10	26	nj77	figs-rquestion	ἐν τῷ νόμῳ τί γέγραπται? πῶς ἀναγινώσκεις?	1	What is written in the law? How do you read it?	Jesus is using these questions to get this man to reflect on the Jewish law and apply it to his own question. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this as a statement that incorporates both of Jesus’ questions. Alternate translation: “Tell me what Moses wrote about that in the law and how you understand it.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	10	26	l607	figs-parallelism	ἐν τῷ νόμῳ τί γέγραπται? πῶς ἀναγινώσκεις?	1	What is written in the law? How do you read it?	These two phrases mean similar things. Jesus may be using repetition for emphasis and clarity. Both phrases have to do with what the law says. The first phrase views this objectively in terms of what is written there, and the second phrase views this subjectively from the perspective of a person reading it. You do not need to put both phrases in your translation if your readers might wonder why Jesus was saying basically the same thing twice. Alternate translation: “Tell me what answer a person would find to your question in the law of Moses.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
LUK	10	26	m2nl	figs-activepassive	ἐν τῷ νόμῳ τί γέγραπται?	1	What is written in the law?	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who did the action. Alternate translation: “What did Moses write in the law?” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	10	26	a8nt	figs-idiom	πῶς ἀναγινώσκεις?	1	How do you read it?	This is an idiom. Alternate translation: “What do you understand it to be saying?” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	10	27	l608	figs-hendiadys	ὁ δὲ ἀποκριθεὶς εἶπεν	1	And answering he said	Together the two words **answering** and **said** mean that the lawyer responded to the question that Jesus asked him. Alternate translation: “The lawyer responded” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
LUK	10	27	l609	figs-youcrowd	ἀγαπήσεις	1	you will love	It may not be clear here whether to use the singular or plural form of **you** because this is a short quotation from the Scriptures and the context is not given. The word is actually singular because, even though Moses said this to the Israelites as a group, each individual person was supposed to obey this command. So in your translation, use the singular forms of **you** **your**, and **yourself** in this verse, if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd]])
LUK	10	27	hxk1	figs-declarative	ἀγαπήσεις	1	you will love	The Scriptures are using a statement to give a command. Alternate translation: “you must love” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative]])
LUK	10	27	fzb6	figs-merism	ἐξ ὅλης καρδίας σου, ἐν ὅλῃ τῇ ψυχῇ σου, καὶ ἐν ὅλῃ τῇ ἰσχύϊ σου, καὶ ἐν ὅλῃ τῇ διανοίᾳ σου	1	with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your strength, and with all your mind	Moses is using a figure of speech that describes something by listing its parts. Alternate translation: “with your entire being” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
LUK	10	27	l610	figs-metaphor	ἐξ ὅλης καρδίας σου, ἐν ὅλῃ τῇ ψυχῇ σου	1	with all your heart, and with all your soul	The words **heart** and **soul** figuratively represent a person’s inner being. If you do not translate all four of the terms here with a single phrase, you can represent these two together. Alternate translation: “with all of your inner self” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	10	27	k1el	figs-ellipsis	καὶ τὸν πλησίον σου ὡς σεαυτόν	1	and your neighbor as yourself	The lawyer is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. These words can be supplied from earlier in the sentence. Alternate translation: “and you must also love your neighbor as much as you love yourself” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
LUK	10	28	l611	grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical	τοῦτο ποίει, καὶ ζήσῃ	1	Do this, and you will live	Jesus is describing a conditional situation. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express it that way. Alternate translation: “If you do this, then God will give you eternal life” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical]])
LUK	10	28	xd4n		ζήσῃ	1	you will live	Alternate translation: “God will give you eternal life”
LUK	10	29	xt23		ὁ δὲ θέλων δικαιῶσαι ἑαυτὸν, εἶπεν	1	But he, desiring to justify himself, said	Alternate translation: “But the lawyer wanted to prove that he had done what he needed to do”
LUK	10	29	lr4m		τίς ἐστίν μου πλησίον?	1	who is my neighbor?	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate the reason why the lawyer asked this specific question. Alternate translation: “whom should I consider to be my neighbor and someone I need to love as I love myself?” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	10	30	l612	figs-hendiadys	ὑπολαβὼν δὲ Ἰησοῦς εἶπεν	1	Then answering Jesus said	Together the two words **answering** and **said** mean that Jesus responded to the question that the lawyer asked him. Alternate translation: “Then Jesus responded” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
LUK	10	30	bh6g	figs-parables	ὑπολαβὼν δὲ Ἰησοῦς εἶπεν	1	Then answering Jesus said	Jesus answers the man’s question by telling a brief story that provides an illustration. Alternate translation: “As an answer to the man’s question, Jesus told him this story” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])
LUK	10	30	e1lv	writing-participants	ἄνθρωπός τις	1	A certain man	This introduces a new character in the parable. Alternate translation: “There was a man who” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
LUK	10	30	l614	figs-idiom	κατέβαινεν ἀπὸ Ἰερουσαλὴμ εἰς Ἰερειχὼ	1	was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho	Jesus says **going down** because this man would have had to travel from a mountain height down into a valley to go from Jerusalem to Jericho. Alternate translation: “was traveling from Jerusalem to Jericho” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	10	30	v2ms	figs-idiom	λῃσταῖς περιέπεσεν	1	fell among robbers	Be sure that it is clear in your translation that this does not mean that the man fell down accidentally. Rather, this is an idiom. Alternate translation: “some robbers attacked him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	10	30	heb5	figs-idiom	ἐκδύσαντες αὐτὸν	1	having stripped him	Alternate translation: “after they had taken everything he had” or “after they had stolen of all his things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	10	30	l615	figs-idiom	and having laid on blows	1	καὶ πληγὰς ἐπιθέντες	This expression means that the robbers also beat this man. Alternate translation: “and beaten him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	10	30	r3gd	figs-idiom	ἡμιθανῆ	1	half dead	This is an idiom. Alternate translation: “almost dead.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	10	31	i3sf		κατὰ συνκυρίαν	1	by coincidence	This expression means that this event was not anything that anyone had planned. Alternate translation: “it just so happened that”

LUK	10	31	l616	figs-explicit	ἱερεύς τις	1	a certain priest	Jesus assumes that his listeners will know that a priest is a religious leader. This detail is important to the story. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “there was a priest, a religious leader, who” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	10	31	gh79	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	ἰδὼν αὐτὸν	1	and when he saw him	Since a priest is a religious leader, the audience would assume that he would help the injured man. Since he did not, this phrase could be introduced with a contrasting word to call attention to this unexpected result. Alternate translation: “but when the priest saw the injured man” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
LUK	10	31	xiu7	figs-explicit	ἀντιπαρῆλθεν	1	he passed by on the other side	The implication is that the priest did not help the man. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “he did not help him, but instead walked past him on the other side of the road” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	10	32	z3ct	writing-participants	καὶ Λευείτης	1	a Levite also	This expression introduces a new character in the parable. Alternate translation: “there was also a Levite” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])

LUK	10	32	lf3l	figs-explicit	καὶ Λευείτης	1	a Levite also	Jesus assumes that his listeners will know that a **Levite** was someone who served in the temple. This detail is important to the story.

Alternate translation: “there was also a Levite, someone who served in the temple, who” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	10	32	l618	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	κατὰ τὸν τόπον, ἐλθὼν καὶ ἰδὼν ἀντιπαρῆλθεν	1	when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side	Since Levites served in the temple, the audience would assume that this Levite would help the injured man. Since he did not, this phrase could be introduced with a contrasting word to call attention to this unexpected result. Alternate translation: “but when the Levite came to where the injured man was and saw him, he walked past him on the other side of the road” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
LUK	10	32	l619	figs-explicit	ἀντιπαρῆλθεν	1	passed by on the other side	The implication is that the Levite did not help the man. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly.

LUK	10	33	cyp5	figs-explicit	Σαμαρείτης δέ τις	1	But a certain Samaritan	Jesus assumes that his listeners will know that Jews and Samaritans were bitter enemies. This detail is important to the story. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “But there was a Samaritan, whose people were enemies of the Jews, who” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	10	33	l620	figs-explicit	Σαμαρείτης δέ τις	1	But a certain Samaritan	Since Jews and Samaritans were enemies, the listeners would have assumed that this Samaritan would not help an injured Jewish man. Since he did help him, Jesus introduces this character with a contrasting word that calls attention to this unexpected result. You can do the same in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
LUK	10	33	w8qm		ἐσπλαγχνίσθη	1	he was moved with compassion	Alternate translation: “he felt sorry for him and wanted to help him”

LUK	10	34	um21	figs-explicit	ἐπιχέων ἔλαιον καὶ οἶνον	1	pouring on oil and wine	The **wine** was used to clean the **wounds**, and the **oil** was used to prevent infection.

LUK	10	34	ktz4	translate-unknown	τὸ ἴδιον κτῆνος	1	his own animal	The Greek term refers to an animal that carried heavy loads. In this culture, it was probably a donkey.

LUK	10	35	z9w5	translate-bmoney	δύο δηνάρια	1	two denarii	See how you translated the term **denarii** in [7:41](../07/41.md). Alternate translation: “two silver coins” or “an amount equivalent to two days’ wages” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney]])

LUK	10	36	v31w		πλησίον…γεγονέναι	1	became a neighbor	Alternate translation: “acted like a neighbor”
LUK	10	36	kv4z	figs-idiom	τοῦ ἐμπεσόντος εἰς τοὺς λῃστάς	1	the one who fell among the robbers	As in [10:30](../10/30.md), be sure it is clear in your translation that this does not mean that the man fell down accidentally. Rather, this is an idiom. Alternate translation: “the man whom the robbers attacked” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	10	37	ig9x	figs-explicit	πορεύου καὶ σὺ ποίει ὁμοίως	1	You go and do likewise	The implication is that the lawyer has given the correct answer. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly, and you could also indicate what **do likewise** means. Alternate translation: “You are right. In the same way, you should also be a neighbor to people who need your help” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	10	38	kv4q	writing-newevent	ἐν δὲ τῷ πορεύεσθαι αὐτοὺς	1	And as they were traveling along	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new event. Alternate translation: “The next thing that happened on their journey was that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
LUK	10	38	l621	figs-synecdoche	αὐτὸς εἰσῆλθεν…ὑπεδέξατο αὐτόν	1	he entered…welcomed him	Luke figuratively says **he** and **him**, meaning Jesus, to describe the entire group of Jesus and his disciples. Alternate translation: “they entered…welcomed them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
LUK	10	38	i17j	writing-participants	γυνὴ δέ τις ὀνόματι Μάρθα	1	and a certain woman named Martha	This introduces Martha as a new character. Your language may have its own way of introducing new people. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “There was a woman named Martha who lived there” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
LUK	10	38	l622	translate-names	Μάρθα	1	Martha	This is the name of a woman. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	10	39	l623	writing-participants	καὶ τῇδε ἦν ἀδελφὴ καλουμένη Μαριάμ	1	And she had a sister called Mary	This introduces Mary as a new character. Alternate translation: “Now Martha had a sister whose name was Mary” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
LUK	10	39	l624	figs-activepassive	καλουμένη Μαριάμ	1	called Mary	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “whose name was Mary” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	10	39	l625	translate-names	Μαριάμ	1	Mary	This is the name of a woman. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	10	39	fal8	figs-explicit	παρακαθεσθεῖσα πρὸς τοὺς πόδας τοῦ Ἰησοῦ	1	she was sitting at the feet of Jesus	This was the customary and respectful position for a learner at this time. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “she sat respectfully on the floor near Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	10	39	l626	translate-textvariants	τοῦ Ἰησοῦ	1	Jesus	See the discussion of textual issues at the end of the General Notes to this chapter to decide whether to use this reading in your translation, or another reading, “the Lord.” The note below discusses a translation issue in that reading, for those who decide to include it. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
LUK	10	39	l627		τοῦ Ἰησοῦ	1	Jesus	If you use the variant reading “the Lord” at this place in your translation, you may wish to indicate that this is referring to Jesus by a respectful title. Alternate translation: “the Lord Jesus”
LUK	10	39	i74b	figs-metonymy	ἤκουεν τὸν λόγον αὐτοῦ	1	listening to his word	Luke uses the term **word** figuratively to describe what Jesus said while he was at Martha’s house. Alternate translation: “and listened to what he said” or “and listened to him teaching” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	10	40	adr5	figs-activepassive	ἡ δὲ Μάρθα περιεσπᾶτο περὶ πολλὴν διακονίαν	1	But Martha was distracted with much service	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “But all Martha could think about was the big meal she was preparing” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	10	40	jd9a	figs-rquestion	οὐ μέλει σοι, ὅτι ἡ ἀδελφή μου μόνην με κατέλιπεν διακονεῖν?	1	are you not concerned that my sister has left me alone to serve?	Martha is complaining that Jesus is allowing Mary to sit listening to him when there is so much work to do. Martha respects the Lord, so she uses a rhetorical question to make her complaint more polite. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate her words as a statement. Alternate translation: “it seems as if you do not care that my sister has left me alone to serve.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	10	41	l628	figs-hendiadys	ἀποκριθεὶς δὲ εἶπεν αὐτῇ ὁ Κύριος	1	But answering the Lord said to her	Together the two words **answering** and **said** mean that Jesus responded to Martha’s request. Alternate translation: “But the Lord replied to her” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
LUK	10	41	l629		ὁ Κύριος	1	the Lord	Luke refers to Jesus here by a respectful title. Alternate translation: “Jesus” or “the Lord Jesus”
LUK	10	41	dsw3		Μάρθα, Μάρθα	1	Martha, Martha	Jesus repeats Martha’s name for emphasis. Alternate translation: “My dear Martha”
LUK	10	41	l630	figs-doublet	μεριμνᾷς καὶ θορυβάζῃ περὶ πολλά	1	you are anxious and troubled about many things	The terms **anxious** and **troubled** mean similar things. Jesus uses the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate them with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “you are worrying too much about things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
LUK	10	41	l631	figs-activepassive	θορυβάζῃ περὶ πολλά	1	you are…troubled about many things	If you do not combine the term for **troubled** with the word **anxious** into a single phrase, you could say **are…troubled** with an active form. Alternate translation: “you are…letting too many things bother you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	10	42	hqt4	figs-hyperbole	ἑνός δέ ἐστιν χρεία	1	but one thing is necessary	Jesus says **one thing** as an overstatement for emphasis. Other things actually are necessary for life, but this is the most important one. Alternate translation: “but one thing is more important than all the others” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
LUK	10	42	l632	figs-explicit	ἑνός δέ ἐστιν χρεία	1	but one thing is necessary	The implication is that this most important thing is what Jesus is teaching about God, and that Martha should have been concentrating that. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “but one thing, what I am teaching about God, is more important than all the others, and you should have been concentrating on that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	10	42	l633		Μαριὰμ…τὴν ἀγαθὴν μερίδα ἐξελέξατο	1	Mary has chosen the good part	While Jesus spoke just earlier about “one thing” as opposed to “many things,” here he seems to contrast only two things, “the good part” with another part, perhaps not “the bad part,” but at least the part that is not to be preferred. This likely refers to the two activities that Mary and Martha have chosen to pursue while Jesus is present in their home. Alternate translation: “Mary has chosen the better activity”
LUK	10	42	nzn8	figs-activepassive	ἥτις οὐκ ἀφαιρεθήσεται ἀπ’ αὐτῆς	1	which will not be taken away from her	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who would do the action. This could mean one of two things. Alternate translation: (1) “I will not take that opportunity away from her” or (2) “God will not let her lose what she has gained from listening to me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	11	intro	j6le			0		# Luke 11 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>1. Jesus teaches about prayer (11:1–13)<br>2. Jesus teaches about driving out demons and other subjects (11:14–36)<br>3. Jesus criticizes the Pharisees and experts in the law (11:37–54)<br><br>ULT sets the lines in 11:2-4 farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because they are a special prayer.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### The Lord’s Prayer<br><br>When Jesus’ followers asked him to teach them how to pray, he taught them this prayer. He did not expect them to use the same words every time they prayed, but he did want them to know what God wanted them to pray about.<br><br>### Jonah<br><br>Jonah was an Old Testament prophet whom God sent to the Gentile city of Nineveh to tell the people there to repent. When he went and preached to them, they did repent. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/repent]])<br><br>### Light and darkness<br><br>The Bible often speaks of unrighteous people, that is, people who do not do what pleases God, as if they were walking around in darkness. The Bible speaks of light as if it were what enables those sinful people to become righteous, that is, to understand what they are doing wrong and begin to obey God. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]])<br><br>### Washing<br><br>The Pharisees would wash themselves and the things they ate with. They would even wash things that were not dirty. The law of Moses did not tell them to wash those things, but they would wash them anyway. They did that because they thought that if they obeyed both the rules that God had made and some rules that their ancestors had added, God would think that they were better people. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/clean]])<br><br>## Important textual issues in this chapter<br><br>### Bread and stone, fish and snake<br><br>In 11:11, some ancient manuscripts have a longer reading, which also is found in Matthew 7:9. It says, “Which father among you, if your son asks for a loaf of bread, will give him a stone? Or a fish, will give him a snake?” ULT uses the shorter reading, which mentions just the fish and snake. This shorter reading is well attested in many other ancient manuscripts. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to follow its reading. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to follow the example of ULT. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
LUK	11	1	fl3j	writing-newevent	καὶ ἐγένετο	1	And it happened that	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
LUK	11	1	l635	figs-explicit	Ἰωάννης	1	John	This disciple is referring to John the Baptist. You could say that explicitly in your translation. Alternate translation: “John the Baptist” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	11	2	n3pz	guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	Πάτερ	1	Father	Jesus is commanding the disciples to honor the name of God the Father by addressing him as **Father** when praying to him. This is an important title for God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
LUK	11	2	l636	figs-explicit	ἁγιασθήτω τὸ ὄνομά σου	1	let your name be made holy	Jesus is not saying that God’s **name** is not already **holy** in itself. Rather, he is referring to how people consider God’s **name**. Alternate translation: “may people treat your name as holy” or “may people regard your name as holy” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	11	2	l637	figs-activepassive	ἁγιασθήτω τὸ ὄνομά σου	1	let your name be made holy	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who would do the action. Alternate translation: “may people treat your name as holy” or “may people regard your name as holy” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	11	2	b6sr	figs-metonymy	ἁγιασθήτω τὸ ὄνομά σου	1	let your name be made holy	The term **name** is a figurative way of referring to an entire person by reference to something associated with them. Alternate translation: “may all people honor you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	11	2	tm1a	figs-abstractnouns	ἐλθέτω ἡ βασιλεία σου	1	Let your kingdom come	See how you decided to translate the phrase **the kingdom of God** in [4:43](../04/43.md). If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **kingdom** with a verb such as “rule.” As the General Introduction to Luke explains, in one sense, the **kingdom** of God is already present on earth, while in another sense, it is still a future reality. Try to translate this in a way that acknowledges both aspects. Alternate translation: “Come and rule more and more throughout the earth” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
LUK	11	2	l638	figs-youformal	σου	1	your	The word **your** is singular here because Jesus is teaching his disciples how to pray to God. If your language has a formal form of “you” that it uses to address a superior respectfully, you may wish to use that form for **your** in its two instances here and for **you** in [11:4](../11/04.md). Alternatively, it might be more appropriate in your culture to address God using a familiar form, such as friends would use with one another. Use your best judgment about what form to use. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youformal]])
LUK	11	3	q89w	figs-imperative	δίδου ἡμῖν	1	Give us	This is an imperative, but it should be translated as a polite request, rather than as a command. It may be helpful to add an expression such as “please” to make this clear. Alternate translation: “Please give us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
LUK	11	3	l639	figs-exclusive	δίδου ἡμῖν	1	Give us	Jesus teaches his disciples to speak to God in the plural because he wants them to pray together in community about the matters he describes. Since the word **us** would refer to the people praying, but not to God, it would be exclusive, if your language marks that form. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
LUK	11	3	s6qp	figs-synecdoche	τὸν ἄρτον ἡμῶν τὸν ἐπιούσιον	1	our daily bread	Jesus refers figuratively to **bread**, one common food, to mean food in general. Alternate translation: “the food we need that day” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
LUK	11	4	iid7	figs-imperative	ἄφες ἡμῖν…μὴ εἰσενέγκῃς ἡμᾶς	1	forgive us…may you not lead us	These are imperatives, but they should be translated as polite requests, rather than as commands. It may be helpful to add an expression such as “please” in each case to make this clear. Alternate translation: “Please forgive us…please do not lead us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
LUK	11	4	wi99	figs-metaphor	παντὶ ὀφείλοντι ἡμῖν	1	everyone who owes us	Jesus uses the image of being in debt figuratively to describe having sinned against a person. Alternate translation: “everyone who has sinned against us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	11	4	db55		μὴ εἰσενέγκῃς ἡμᾶς εἰς πειρασμόν	1	may you not lead us into temptation	You could state this in a positive form. Alternate translation: “please lead us away from temptation”
LUK	11	5	l640	figs-hypo	τίς ἐξ ὑμῶν ἕξει φίλον, καὶ πορεύσεται πρὸς αὐτὸν μεσονυκτίου	1	Which of you will have a friend, and will go to him at midnight	Jesus is using a hypothetical situation to teach his disciples. Alternate translation: “Suppose one of you went to the house of a friend in the middle of the night” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
LUK	11	5	l641	figs-quotesinquotes	καὶ εἴπῃ αὐτῷ, φίλε, χρῆσόν μοι τρεῖς ἄρτους	1	and say to him, ‘Friend, lend three loaves to me	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “and asked his friend to let him borrow three loaves of bread” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	11	5	y1s9		χρῆσόν μοι τρεῖς ἄρτους	1	lend three loaves to me	Alternate translation: “let me borrow three loaves of bread” or “give me three loaves of bread, and I will pay you back later”
LUK	11	6	l642	figs-quotesinquotes	ἐπειδὴ φίλος μου παρεγένετο ἐξ ὁδοῦ πρός με, καὶ οὐκ ἔχω ὃ παραθήσω αὐτῷ	1	since my friend has come to me from the road, and I do not have anything to serve to him	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation (continuing the sentence from the previous verse): “explaining that another friend has just arrived on a journey and that he does not have enough food to feed him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	11	6	l643	grammar-connect-logic-result	ἐπειδὴ	1	since	The speaker uses this word to introduce the reason why he is making this request at this time. If you translate this as a direct quotation, it may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “Let me tell you why I am asking” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
LUK	11	6	zl5w	figs-metonymy	παρεγένετο ἐξ ὁδοῦ πρός με	1	my friend has come to me from the road	The speaker uses the term **road** figuratively to describe being on a journey. Alternate translation: “another friend of mine is on a journey and has just arrived at my house” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	11	6	zp7j	figs-hyperbole	ὃ παραθήσω αὐτῷ	1	anything to serve to him	It is unlikely that the speaker has no food at all in his house that he could serve his friend. Rather, this is an exaggeration for emphasis. Alternate translation: “enough food to feed him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
LUK	11	6	l731	figs-explicit	ὃ παραθήσω αὐτῷ	1	anything to serve to him	There are two other possibilities for why the speaker says this. (1) The issue could be, as UST implies, that while his family has the ingredients to make a meal, they do not want to make a weary traveler wait the time it would take for them to bake bread and prepare other food. Alternate translation: “any food prepared to feed him” (2) The implication may be that the speaker wants to extend hospitality by sharing a meal with his guest, and so he needs enough food for a family meal. Alternate translation: “enough food to share a meal with him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	11	7	l644	figs-hendiadys	ἀποκριθεὶς εἴπῃ	1	answering…he may say	The word **answering** indicates that what this friend **may say** would be a response. Alternate translation: “he may reply” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
LUK	11	7	l645	figs-quotesinquotes	εἴπῃ, μή μοι κόπους πάρεχε; ἤδη ἡ θύρα κέκλεισται, καὶ τὰ παιδία μου μετ’ ἐμοῦ εἰς τὴν κοίτην εἰσίν; οὐ δύναμαι ἀναστὰς δοῦναί σοι	1	he may say, ‘Do not cause me trouble. The door has already been shut, and my children are in the bed with me. I am not able to get up to give to you’	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “ he may tell you not to bother him, because he has already locked the door for the night and his children are in bed with him, so he cannot get up and give you anything” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	11	7	l646	figs-activepassive	ἤδη ἡ θύρα κέκλεισται	1	The door has already been shut	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who has done the action. Alternate translation: “We have already closed and locked the door” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	11	7	vhf7	figs-hyperbole	οὐ δύναμαι ἀναστὰς	1	I am not able to get up	The friend inside is not literally incapable of getting up. Rather, this is an exaggeration for emphasis. Alternate translation: “It would be very difficult for me to get up” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
LUK	11	8	zl2k	figs-you	λέγω ὑμῖν	1	I say to you	Even though Jesus began this hypothetical situation by asking “which of you,” that is, “which one of you,” here he is addressing all of the disciples together, not the hypothetical single disciple who might go to a friend’s house at midnight. So the word **you** here is plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
LUK	11	8	prx6	figs-abstractnouns	διά γε τὴν ἀναίδειαν αὐτοῦ	1	yet because of his persistence	If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **persistence** with a verb such as “continue.” Alternate translation: “because you continue to ask him urgently” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
LUK	11	8	l647		ἐγερθεὶς	1	he will rise up	Alternate translation: “he will get out of bed”
LUK	11	9	j4ef	figs-you	ὑμῖν λέγω…ὑμῖν…εὑρήσετε…ὑμῖν	1	I say to you…to you…you will find…to you	In the first instance in this verse, **you** is plural because Jesus is speaking to the disciples. In the next three instances, even though Jesus is describing what could be an individual situation of a person praying to God, **you** is also plural because Jesus is still speaking to the disciples as a group. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
LUK	11	9	l648	figs-explicit	αἰτεῖτε…ζητεῖτε	1	ask…seek	It might be customary in your language to say what a person would be asking for and seeking, and from whom. Alternate translation: “keep asking God for what you need…keep seeking what you need from God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	11	9	i7j9	figs-activepassive	δοθήσεται ὑμῖν	1	it will be given to you	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who will do the action. Alternate translation: “God will give it to you” or “you will receive it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	11	9	l1f6	translate-unknown	κρούετε	1	knock	To **knock** at a door means to hit it a few times to let a person inside the house know you are standing outside. You could translate this expression with the way people in your culture show that they have arrived at a house, such as “call out” or “cough” or “clap.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	11	9	l649	figs-metaphor	κρούετε	1	knock	Jesus is using the expression **knock** figuratively to mean getting someone’s attention. Alternate translation: “seek God’s attention in prayer” or “let God know you are depending on him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	11	9	kp3h	figs-activepassive	ἀνοιγήσεται ὑμῖν	1	it will be opened to you	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who will do the action. Alternate translation: “God will open the door for you” or “God will welcome you inside” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	11	9	l650	figs-metaphor	ἀνοιγήσεται ὑμῖν	1	it will be opened to you	This phrase continues the figure of knocking on a door that Jesus is using to represent prayer. Alternate translation: “God will give you what you need” or “God will enable you to do what you are praying about” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	11	10	l651	translate-unknown	τῷ κρούοντι	1	to the one who knocks	See how you translated the word “knock” in [11:9](../11/09.md). Alternate translation: “to the one who calls out” or “to the one who coughs” or “to the one who claps” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	11	10	l652	figs-activepassive	ἀνοιγήσεται	1	it will be opened	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who will do the action. Alternate translation: “God will open the door” or “God will welcome you inside” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	11	10	l653	figs-metaphor	ἀνοιγήσεται	1	it will be opened	This phrase continues the figure of knocking on a door that Jesus is using to represent prayer. Alternate translation: “God will give you what you need” or “God will enable you to do what you are praying about” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	11	11	l654	translate-textvariants	τίνα δὲ ἐξ ὑμῶν τὸν πατέρα αἰτήσει ὁ υἱὸς ἰχθύν, καὶ ἀντὶ ἰχθύος, ὄφιν αὐτῷ ἐπιδώσει?	1	And which father among you, his son will ask for a fish, and instead of a fish he will give him a snake?	See the discussion of textual issues at the end of the General Notes to this chapter to decide whether to use this reading or a longer one that is found in some ancient manuscripts. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])

It is not a source of light, but a channel of light. Alternate translation: “Your eye lets light into your body” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	11	34	l700	figs-youcrowd	σου	1	your	Even though Jesus is speaking to the crowd, he is addressing an individual situation, so **your** and **you** are singular in [11:34–36](../11/34.md).

LUK	11	34	l701		ἐπὰν δὲ πονηρὸς ᾖ	1	But when it is bad	In this context, Jesus is using the term **bad** to contrast with **healthy**, so it means “unhealthy.” Alternate translation: “But when your eye is unhealthy”

If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the meaning of the simile. Alternate translation: “light will come into your whole body. In the same way, if you are willing to obey God, you will be able to understand his message and live by it completely, just as a lamp shines a bright light that allows you to see yourself and everything around you clearly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

See how you decided to approach this usage in [7:40](../07/40.md). If it would not be natural to use the present tense in your language, you can use the past tense in your translation. Alternate translation: “a Pharisee asked him”
LUK	11	37	l703	writing-participants	Φαρισαῖος	1	a Pharisee	This introduces a new character into the story. Alternate translation: “a Pharisee who was there” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])

Alternate translation: “but your true character is that you are greedy and wicked people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
LUK	11	40	zq4l	figs-nominaladj	ἄφρονες	1	You foolish ones	Jesus is using an adjective as a noun. ULT adds the term **ones** to show this. Your language may use adjectives in the same way.

LUK	11	41	phz9	figs-explicit	πάντα καθαρὰ ὑμῖν ἐστιν	1	all things are clean to you	The implication is that if the Pharisees devote themselves to what is most important, helping people in need, then they will recognize that ceremonial cleansing is less important and less worthy of their attention. Alternate translation: “you will not have to be so concerned about ritually washing cups and bowls” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	11	42	ans4	figs-explicit	ἀποδεκατοῦτε τὸ ἡδύοσμον, καὶ τὸ πήγανον, καὶ πᾶν λάχανον	1	you tithe the mint and the rue and every garden herb	The implication is that the Pharisees are counting the leaves on their garden herbs and giving a tenth of those to God, and that by doing that, they are going to almost absurd extremes in pursing that devotional practice. Alternate translation: “you are so extreme that you give every tenth leaf from your mint and rue and other garden plants to God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	11	42	p71g	translate-unknown	τὸ ἡδύοσμον, καὶ τὸ πήγανον	1	the mint and the rue	These are the names of herbs. People put just a little bit of their leaves into their food to give it flavor.

LUK	11	42	l707		ταῦτα…κἀκεῖνα	1	these things, and…those things	By **these things**, Jesus means the justice and the love of God. By **those things**, he means devotional practices such as tithing. Your language may have its own way of expressing distinctions like this. Alternate translation: “the latter, and…the former”
LUK	11	42	myv2	figs-doublenegatives	κἀκεῖνα μὴ παρεῖναι	1	and not to neglect those things	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this double negative, which consists of a negative particle and a negative verb, as a positive statement.

Alternate translation: “you are like burial places that people should not go near, but people do not realize that because the places are unmarked” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
LUK	11	44	l708	figs-explicit	ἐστὲ ὡς τὰ μνημεῖα τὰ ἄδηλα	1	you are like the unseen graves	The implication is that these **graves** are **unseen**, that is, people do not know that they are there, because they do not have markers such as the stones or plaques that are customarily used to identify graves and to memorialize the people who are buried in them. Alternate translation: “you are like unmarked graves” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	11	44	mrw1	translate-unknown	μνημεῖα	1	graves	This term refers to holes dug in the ground where dead bodies are buried. If your readers would not be familiar with **graves**, you can use a general term. Alternate translation: “burial places” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

LUK	11	44	h9x7	figs-explicit	οὐκ οἴδασιν	1	do not know it	The implication is that if the Jews walked over a grave, they would become ceremonially unclean because they had come close to a dead body. Unmarked graves would cause them to do that accidentally. Alternate translation: “do not realize that and so become ceremonially unclean” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	11	44	l710	figs-metaphor	οὐκ οἴδασιν	1	do not know it	Jesus is using the implied ceremonial uncleanness figuratively to represent not doing what pleases God. He has just said in [11:42](../11/42.md) that this is really a matter of showing love and justice to others. Alternate translation: “without realizing it and so, because they follow your teaching, they do not do the things that God wants them to do most” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	11	45	l711		ἀποκριθεὶς δέ τις τῶν νομικῶν λέγει αὐτῷ	1	Then answering one of the lawyers says to him	To call attention to a development in the story, Luke uses the present tense in past narration. See how you decided to approach this usage in [7:40](../07/40.md). If it would not be natural to use the present tense in your language, you can use the past tense in your translation.

LUK	11	46	wx9j	figs-explicit	καὶ ὑμῖν τοῖς νομικοῖς οὐαί	1	Woe also to you lawyers	The implication is that Jesus did intend to condemn the actions of the experts in the law along with the actions of the Pharisees.

LUK	11	46	l715	translate-unknown	τοῖς νομικοῖς	1	lawyers	See how you translated this in [11:45](../11/45.md). Alternate translation: “experts in the Jewish law” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

Rather, their ancestors began the job by actually killing them, and now they are finishing the job by burying them. Alternate translation: “you show that you approve of and agree with what your ancestors did when you bury the prophets to finish the job of killing them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

Alternate translation: “you are building tombs for them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	11	49	by5w		διὰ τοῦτο	1	For this reason	This expression refers to the way that the current generation was effectively continuing the actions of its ancestors, who had killed the prophets. Alternate translation: “Because you are just as hostile to the prophets as your ancestors were”

God in his wisdom knew that they would oppose his messengers. But he sent them anyway, because their message was necessary and important. Alternate translation: “I am going to send prophets and apostles to them with my message, even though I know they will persecute and kill some of them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	11	49	w1fh	figs-hendiadys	ἀποκτενοῦσιν καὶ διώξουσιν	1	kill and persecute	Jesus may be expressing a single idea here by using two words connected with **and.** The word **persecute** may be telling why and how the people would **kill** the prophets. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the meaning with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “persecute by killing” or “persecute even to the point of killing” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
LUK	11	50	pi6u	figs-explicit	ἵνα ἐκζητηθῇ τὸ αἷμα πάντων τῶν προφητῶν, τὸ ἐκχυννόμενον ἀπὸ καταβολῆς κόσμου, ἀπὸ τῆς γενεᾶς ταύτης	1	that the blood of all the prophets that has been shed from the foundation of the world may be required from this generation	The implication seems to be that God will also send prophets to the people living at this time because the people’s violent persecution of the prophets will constitute a conscious, deliberate rejection of God’s message that will provide grounds for definitive judgment. That is because the people of this time should know better than to persecute the prophets, based on the prominent bad example of their own ancestors. Alternate translation: “so that the people living at this time, who should have known better, can be held accountable for the blood that people have shed of all the prophets since the beginning of the world” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

LUK	11	51	l725	translate-names	Ἂβελ	1	Abel	This is the name of a man. He was the son of Adam, the first man, and God commended him for doing what was right. His brother Cain murdered him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	11	51	jes7	translate-names	Ζαχαρίου	1	Zechariah	This is the name of a man. It is not the same man as father of John the Baptist, whose story Luke tells at the beginning of this book. Rather, Jesus means the priest whom King Joash ordered the officials of Judah to stone to death in the temple courtyard after he rebuked the people of Judah for worshipping idols. See 2 Chronicles [24:21](../2ch/24/21.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	11	51	l726	figs-metaphor	τοῦ οἴκου	1	the house	Jesus figuratively calls the temple the **house**, meaning the “house of God,” since God’s presence was in the temple. Alternate translation: “the temple” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

LUK	11	52	s4fc	figs-metaphor	ἤρατε τὴν κλεῖδα τῆς γνώσεως	1	you have taken away the key of knowledge	Jesus speaks figuratively about the **knowledge** of God’s truth as if it were in a building whose door was locked, and about proper teaching as if it were a **key** that could unlock that door. Alternate translation: “you prevent people from knowing God’s truth” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	11	52	xg48	translate-unknown	τὴν κλεῖδα	1	the key	A **key** is a small metal device that opens a lock that is used to keep things like a door, a box, or a drawer closed. If your readers would not know what a **key** is, you could use the name of a comparable device in your culture. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	11	52	fj7x	figs-metaphor	αὐτοὶ οὐκ εἰσήλθατε, καὶ τοὺς εἰσερχομένους ἐκωλύσατε	1	you have not entered yourselves, and you have hindered those who are entering	Jesus continues the metaphor by saying figuratively that these experts in the law have not gone into the building where they could learn God’s truth, and they have not given others the **key** that would allow them to unlock the door and go inside to learn. Alternate translation: “you do not know God’s truth yourselves, and you are preventing others from knowing it as well” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	11	53	mld3	writing-endofstory	κἀκεῖθεν ἐξελθόντος αὐτοῦ	1	After he went out from there	In this verse and the next verse, Luke comments on what happened as a result of the episode he has just related. Alternate translation: “After Jesus left the Pharisee’s house” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-endofstory]])
LUK	11	54	mr32	figs-metaphor	αὐτὸν θηρεῦσαί τι ἐκ τοῦ στόματος αὐτοῦ	1	lying in wait for him to trap something from his mouth	Luke speaks figuratively of the scribes and Pharisees trying to find grounds to accuse Jesus as if they were hunters hiding behind cover in order to catch an animal. Luke then speaks figuratively of what Jesus was saying as if it were the animal that these hunters were trying to catch. Alternate translation: “listening carefully to Jesus to see if they could use something he said to accuse him of teaching the wrong things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

LUK	12	intro	jun3			0		# Luke 12 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>1. Jesus teaches about trusting and honoring God (12:1–12)<br>2. Jesus tells a parable about a man who trusted in money (12:13–21)<br>3. Jesus teaches not to trust in money (12:22–34)<br>4. Jesus teaches about being ready for his return (12:35–59)<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### “Blasphemy against the Holy Spirit”<br><br>Jesus says in 12:10 that anyone who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven. This is a descriptive statement, not a prescriptive one. Jesus is not saying that if a person happens to speak certain words, then God will refuse to forgive them, no matter how sorry they are afterwards. Rather, it is the Holy Spirit who brings conviction of sin and of the need to repent. “Blasphemy against the Holy Spirit” means attributing the influence of the Holy Spirit to evil powers, as the Pharisees did when they said in 11:15 that Jesus drove out demons by the power of Beelzebul, the ruler of demons. By definition, then, if a person thinks that the influence of the Holy Spirit is an evil influence, they will not respond to it, and so they will not experience conviction of sin, repent, and be forgiven. That is why people who “blaspheme against the Holy Spirit” will not be forgiven. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/blasphemy]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/holyspirit]])<br><br>### Servants<br><br>God expects his people to remember that everything in the world belongs to God. God gives his people things so they can serve him. He wants them to please him by doing what he wants them to do with everything he has given them. One day Jesus will ask his servants what they have done with everything he gave them to use. He will give a reward to those who have done what he wanted them to do, and he will punish those who have not. Jesus teaches about this in 12:34-40.<br><br>### Division<br><br>Jesus knew that those who did not choose to follow him would hate those who did choose to follow him. He also knew that most people love their families more than they love anyone else. So he wanted his followers to understand that following and pleasing him had to be more important to them than having their family love them. Jesus teaches about this in 12:49-53.
LUK	12	1	en8g	writing-newevent	ἐν οἷς	1	In those times	Luke uses these words to mark the beginning of a new event. This phrase seems to refer back to [11:54](../11/54.md).

Alternate translation: “while tens of thousands of the common people were gathering” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background]])
LUK	12	1	l730	translate-unknown	μυριάδων	1	myriads	The word **myriads** is the plural of the Greek word “myriad,” which means ten thousand (10,000). You can express this number in the way that would be most natural in your language. Alternate translation: “tens of thousands” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	12	1	l734		τοῦ ὄχλου	1	of the crowd	In this context, the word **crowd** refers to ordinary people. Alternate translation: “of the common people”
LUK	12	1	l735	figs-activepassive	ἐπισυναχθεισῶν	1	were gathered together	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “were coming together” or “were crowding around” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

Alternate translation: “Jesus started speaking to his disciples, and the first thing he said was”

You could represent this metaphor as a simile in your translation. Alternate translation: “Be careful that you do not become hypocrites like the Pharisees, whose behavior is influencing everyone around them, just as yeast spreads through a whole batch of dough” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	12	1	l736	translate-unknown	ζύμης	1	yeast	This term describes a substance that causes fermentation and expansion within a batch of dough or batter. If your readers would not be familiar with yeast, you could use the name of a substance that they would be familiar with, or you could use a general term. Alternate translation: “leaven” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	12	2	m1ti	grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1	But	This word connects the statement it introduces to the previous statement about the hypocrisy of the Pharisees. In your translation, you can use the term that would show this connection in the way that is most natural in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])

Jesus uses them together to emphasize the truth of what he is saying. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine them, especially if it might be confusing for your readers if you put both phrases in. Alternate translation: “people will learn about everything that others try to hide” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
LUK	12	2	l737	figs-doublenegatives	οὐδὲν…συνκεκαλυμμένον ἐστὶν ὃ οὐκ ἀποκαλυφθήσεται	1	nothing is concealed that will not be revealed	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this double negative as a positive statement.

LUK	12	2	g46e	figs-activepassive	οὐδὲν…συνκεκαλυμμένον ἐστὶν ὃ οὐκ ἀποκαλυφθήσεται	1	nothing is concealed that will not be revealed	If it would be clearer in your language, you could use active verbal forms in place of the two passive forms here, and you could say who will do the action. Alternate translation: “God will reveal everything that people are now concealing” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	12	2	l738	figs-ellipsis	καὶ κρυπτὸν ὃ οὐ γνωσθήσεται	1	and hidden that will not be known	Jesus is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. These words can be supplied from earlier in the sentence. Alternate translation: “and nothing is hidden that will not be known” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
LUK	12	2	l739	figs-doublenegatives	καὶ κρυπτὸν ὃ οὐ γνωσθήσεται	1	and hidden that will not be known	Supplying **nothing** from earlier in the sentence shows that this is a double negative. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate it as a positive statement. Alternate translation: “and everything that is now hidden will be known” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
LUK	12	2	l740	figs-activepassive	καὶ κρυπτὸν ὃ οὐ γνωσθήσεται	1	and hidden that will not be known	If it would be clearer in your language, you could use active verbal forms in place of the two passive forms here, and you could say who will do the action.

Alternate translation: “from a high place from which everyone will be able to hear” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	12	4	m6t7		λέγω δὲ ὑμῖν, τοῖς φίλοις μου	1	But I say to you, my friends	Jesus readdresses his disciples to mark a shift in his speech to a new topic, about not being afraid. Alternate translation: “Let me tell you, friends”

LUK	12	5	us3x		μετὰ τὸ ἀποκτεῖναι	1	after having killed	Jesus is not suggesting that God actively kills each person. Alternate translation: “after a person dies”
LUK	12	5	l744	translate-names	Γέενναν	1	Gehenna	This is the Greek name for a place, the Valley of Hinnom just outside Jerusalem. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	12	5	ric8	figs-metaphor	Γέενναν	1	Gehenna	Jesus figuratively uses the name of this place, where refuse was thrown and fires burned continually, to mean hell. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

Alternate translation: “Do people not sell five sparrows for only two small copper coins” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	12	6	czr7	figs-rquestion	οὐχὶ πέντε στρουθία πωλοῦνται ἀσσαρίων δύο?	1	Are not five sparrows sold for two assaria?	Jesus is using this question to teach the disciples. He is not asking them to verify the market price for sparrows. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate his words as a statement. Alternate translation: “You know that five sparrows are sold for only two small copper coins.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	12	6	u697	translate-unknown	στρουθία	1	sparrows	These are small, seed-eating birds. If your readers would not know what **sparrows** are, you could use a general expression instead. Alternate translation: “small birds” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	12	6	l746	translate-bmoney	ἀσσαρίων δύο	1	two assaria	The word **assaria** is the plural of “assarion.” An assarion was a small copper coin equivalent to about half an hour’s wage. You could try to express this amount in terms of current monetary values, but that might cause your Bible translation to become outdated and inaccurate, since those values can change over time. So instead you might say something more general, or give the equivalent in wages. Alternate translation: “two small copper coins” or “half an hour’s wages” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney]])
LUK	12	6	mru1	figs-activepassive	ἓν ἐξ αὐτῶν οὐκ ἔστιν ἐπιλελησμένον ἐνώπιον τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	not one of them is forgotten before God	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “God never forgets a single one of them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	12	6	l747	figs-doublenegatives	ἓν ἐξ αὐτῶν οὐκ ἔστιν ἐπιλελησμένον ἐνώπιον τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	not one of them is forgotten before God	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this double negative, which consists of a negative particle and a negative verb, as a positive statement. Alternate translation: “God is always aware of every one of them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
LUK	12	6	l748	figs-metaphor	ἓν ἐξ αὐτῶν οὐκ ἔστιν ἐπιλελησμένον ἐνώπιον τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	not one of them is forgotten before God	The expression **before God** means “in front of God,” that is, “where God can see.” Sight, in turn, figuratively represents attention. Alternate translation: “God is always aware of every one of them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	12	7	m833	figs-activepassive	καὶ αἱ τρίχες τῆς κεφαλῆς ὑμῶν πᾶσαι ἠρίθμηνται	1	even the hairs of your head have all been numbered	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who has done the action.

Alternate translation: “God is aware of everything about you, right down to the smallest detail” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
LUK	12	7	l750	figs-you	τῆς κεφαλῆς ὑμῶν	1	your head	Although **head** is singular because Jesus is describing an individual situation, **your** is plural because he is speaking to his disciples as a group. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
LUK	12	7	l751		ἠρίθμηνται	1	numbered	This word can also mean “counted.” Jesus is not necessarily saying that God has assigned a number to each individual hair on a person’s head. Alternate translation: “counted”
LUK	12	7	shk3	figs-explicit	μὴ φοβεῖσθε, πολλῶν στρουθίων διαφέρετε	1	Do not fear, you are more valuable than many sparrows	The implication is that if God is aware of and concerned for sparrows, which are of less value, then God is certainly aware of and concerned for people, who are of greater value. And so followers of Jesus do not need to be afraid, since God is watching over them. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “You are more valuable than many sparrows, so God is certainly even more aware of you and concerned for you, and so you do not need to be afraid” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

LUK	12	11	f2j9	figs-explicit	ὅταν…εἰσφέρωσιν ὑμᾶς	1	when they bring you	The implication is that the opponents of Jesus would do this to his disciples. Alternate translation: “when my opponents bring you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

LUK	12	11	gm94	figs-doublet	τὰς ἀρχὰς, καὶ τὰς ἐξουσίας	1	the rulers, and the authorities	These two terms mean similar things. Jesus may be using them together for emphasis. He is referring to officials of the Roman Empire. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could combine the terms into a single phrase. Alternate translation: “the officials whom the Romans have appointed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

Alternate translation: “to divide the family property with me now that our father is dead” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	12	14	i8sm		ἄνθρωπε	1	Man	Jesus is using the impersonal term **Man** here to put some social distance between himself and the questioner, by contrast with the way he called his disciples **friends** in [12:4](../12/04.md). He is effectively rebuking the man for asking such a question. Your language might have a way of addressing people in a similar situation. Alternate translation: “Mister”
LUK	12	14	hmn6	figs-rquestion	τίς με κατέστησεν κριτὴν ἢ μεριστὴν ἐφ’ ὑμᾶς?	1	who appointed me a judge or a mediator over you?	Jesus is using the question form to rebuke the man.

LUK	12	14	l764	figs-hendiadys	κριτὴν ἢ μεριστὴν	1	a judge or a mediator	Jesus could also be using these two words to express a single idea.

LUK	12	14	l765	figs-youdual	ὑμᾶς	1	you	The term **you** refers to the man and his brother. It would be in the dual if your language uses that form. Otherwise, it would be plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])

LUK	12	16	gc9i	writing-pronouns	αὐτοὺς	1	to them	The word **them** refers to the whole crowd, to which Jesus is continuing to speak. Alternate translation: “to the whole crowd” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])

Alternate translation: “he asked himself what he should do, since he did not have anywhere large enough to store his crops” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	12	17	l768	figs-hyperbole	ποῦ	1	anywhere	This is a generalization for emphasis. As the man says in the next verse, he already does have some barns.

Alternate translation: “anywhere large enough” or “enough room in my barns” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
LUK	12	18	l769	figs-quotesinquotes	εἶπεν, τοῦτο ποιήσω: καθελῶ μου τὰς ἀποθήκας καὶ μείζονας οἰκοδομήσω, καὶ συνάξω ἐκεῖ πάντα τὸν σῖτον καὶ τὰ ἀγαθά μου	1	he said, ‘I will do this: I will take down my barns and build bigger ones, and there I will gather all of my grain and goods	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation.

LUK	12	19	mqm6	figs-synecdoche	τῇ ψυχῇ μου	1	my soul	The man figuratively addresses one part of himself, his **soul** or inner being, in order to speak to all of himself. Alternate translation: “myself” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

Alternate translation: “But God told him that he was very foolish, because he was going to die that night, and the things he had stored up would belong to someone else” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	12	20	l772	figs-nominaladj	ἄφρων	1	Foolish one	God is using the adjective **foolish** as a noun, to describe what kind of person this man is. ULT adds the term **one** to show this.

Alternate translation: “You foolish person” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
LUK	12	20	l773		ταύτῃ τῇ νυκτὶ, τὴν ψυχήν σου ἀπαιτοῦσιν ἀπὸ σοῦ	1	this night they are demanding your soul from you	This is an indefinite construction, such as many languages use, but God is the actual subject. Alternate translation: “I am demanding your soul from you this very night”
LUK	12	20	l774	figs-idiom	ταύτῃ τῇ νυκτὶ, τὴν ψυχήν σου ἀπαιτοῦσιν ἀπὸ σοῦ	1	this night they are demanding your soul from you	The term **soul** means the life of a person. God is using the same term as the man did, but with a different meaning, to show that he was foolish to have such confidence in his possessions.

LUK	12	20	vyn1	figs-rquestion	ἃ δὲ ἡτοίμασας, τίνι ἔσται?	1	what you have prepared, whose will it be?	God does not expect the man to tell him who will inherit his things. Rather, God is using the question as a teaching tool, to make the man realize that he could not count on possessing those things, and so he was wrong to put his confidence in them. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate these words as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “the things you have stored up will belong to someone else!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

LUK	12	22	ihk2	figs-explicit	εἶπεν…πρὸς τοὺς μαθητὰς αὐτοῦ	1	he said to his disciples	Since Peter asks in [12:41](../12/41.md) whether Jesus has been speaking only to the disciples, or also to the crowd as well, the implication is that Jesus did not say these things to his disciples privately, as in [12:1-12](../12/01.md), but rather to them publicly so that the crowd could also hear. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “he said to his disciples, as the crowd was listening” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	12	22	vim6	figs-explicit	διὰ τοῦτο	1	For this reason	The implication is that the **reason** is the lesson of the story, that it is foolish to be overly concerned about having a lot of food and possessions.

LUK	12	24	zx97	translate-unknown	τοὺς κόρακας	1	the ravens	This word refers to a large black bird and it can apply either to crows or to **ravens**.

LUK	12	24	l776	figs-doublet	οὐκ…ταμεῖον οὐδὲ ἀποθήκη	1	neither storeroom nor barn	These two words mean similar things. Jesus may be using them together to express a general meaning. Alternate translation: “no place to store food” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

LUK	12	24	i238	figs-exclamations	πόσῳ μᾶλλον ὑμεῖς διαφέρετε τῶν πετεινῶν!	1	How much more valuable you are than the birds!	This is an exclamation, not a question. Jesus uses the exclamation to emphasize the point he wants his listeners to realize. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this as a statement. Alternate translation: “You need to realize how much more valuable people are to God than birds.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations]])
LUK	12	25	lsx8	figs-rquestion	τίς…ἐξ ὑμῶν μεριμνῶν, δύναται ἐπὶ τὴν ἡλικίαν αὐτοῦ προσθεῖναι πῆχυν?	1	which of you by being anxious is able to add a cubit to his lifespan?	Jesus is using the question form to teach his disciples. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “no one can make his life any longer by being anxious!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	12	25	n286	figs-metaphor	ἐπὶ τὴν ἡλικίαν αὐτοῦ προσθεῖναι πῆχυν	1	add a cubit to his lifespan	Jesus is speaking figuratively of the **lifespan** as if it were measured in length rather than in time. Alternate translation: “make his life any longer” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	12	25	l777	translate-unknown	πῆχυν	1	a cubit	A **cubit** is a measure of length equal to about half a meter, or about a foot and a half. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express this length using the measure that is customary your culture. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	12	25	l778	figs-explicit	πῆχυν	1	a cubit	The implication may be that since a **cubit** is a relatively short distance, it figuratively represents only a short time. Alternate translation: “even a little bit” or “even a short time” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	12	26	hl4d	figs-rquestion	εἰ οὖν οὐδὲ ἐλάχιστον δύνασθε, τί περὶ τῶν λοιπῶν μεριμνᾶτε?	1	If then you are not able to do the least, why do you worry about the rest?	Jesus is using the question form to teach his disciples. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or exclamation. Alternate translation: “Since you cannot do even this small thing, you should not worry about the other things!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	12	26	l779	figs-nominaladj	ἐλάχιστον	1	the least	Jesus is using the adjective **least** as a noun. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this with a noun phrase. Alternate translation: “such a very little thing” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
LUK	12	26	l780	figs-explicit	τῶν λοιπῶν	1	the rest	The implication in context is that Jesus is referring to having food to eat and clothes to wear.

LUK	12	27	h293		κατανοήσατε τὰ κρίνα πῶς αὐξάνει	1	Consider the lilies—how they grow	Alternate translation: “Think about how the lilies grow”

LUK	12	27	u3mf	translate-unknown	οὐδὲ νήθει	1	neither do they spin	In this context, to **spin** means to make thread or yarn for cloth.

Alternate translation: “since God makes the wild plants so beautiful” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
LUK	12	28	l784	figs-explicit	τὸν χόρτον	1	the grass in the field	While Jesus uses a term that typically means **grass**, in this context he must implicitly mean wild plants in general, since he is referring back to the wild lilies he has just mentioned.

LUK	12	33	am8q	figs-metonymy	βαλλάντια μὴ παλαιούμενα	1	purses that will not wear out	Jesus is figuratively describing valuable things that will last by reference to **purses** or moneybags that will keep these things safe because they will never wear out.

LUK	12	45	l812	figs-hypo	ἐὰν δὲ εἴπῃ ὁ δοῦλος ἐκεῖνος ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ αὐτοῦ…καὶ ἄρξηται	1	But if that servant says in his heart…and begins	The illustration that Jesus is using involves a hypothetical situation. Alternate translation: “But suppose that servant thinks to himself…and suppose he begins” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
LUK	12	45	aku7	figs-metaphor	εἴπῃ…ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ αὐτοῦ	1	says in his heart	The **heart** here figuratively represents the thoughts. Alternate translation: “thinks to himself” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	12	45	l813		χρονίζει ὁ κύριός μου ἔρχεσθαι	1	My master delays to return	Alternate translation: “My master is going to come back later than he said”
LUK	12	45	juc5	figs-merism	τοὺς παῖδας καὶ τὰς παιδίσκας	1	the male servants and the female servants	Jesus is figuratively using the two types of servants to mean all of the master’s servants. Alternate translation: “all the other servants” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
LUK	12	46	l814	figs-hypo	ἥξει ὁ κύριος τοῦ δούλου ἐκείνου	1	the master of that servant will arrive	If you translated the previous verse as a hypothetical condition, you can translate this verse as the result of that condition. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “Then the master of that servant will arrive” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
LUK	12	46	j1m1	figs-parallelism	ἐν ἡμέρᾳ ᾗ οὐ προσδοκᾷ, καὶ ἐν ὥρᾳ ᾗ οὐ γινώσκει	1	in a day that he does not expect, and in an hour that he does not know	These two phrases mean the same thing. Jesus is likely using the repetition to emphasize that the return of the master will be completely unexpected by the servant. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine these phrases, especially if putting both of them in your translation might be confusing for your readers. Alternate translation: “at a time that is a complete surprise to the servant” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
LUK	12	46	l815	figs-idiom	ἐν ἡμέρᾳ ᾗ οὐ προσδοκᾷ	1	in a day that he does not expect	Jesus uses the term **day** figuratively here to refer a specific time. Alternate translation: “at a time when he is not expecting him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	12	46	l816	figs-idiom	ἐν ὥρᾳ ᾗ οὐ γινώσκει	1	in an hour that he does not know	Jesus uses the term **hour** figuratively here to refer a specific time. Alternate translation: “at a time when he does not think he will come” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	12	46	vg1d	figs-metaphor	διχοτομήσει αὐτὸν	1	will cut him in two	Jesus likely means this expression figuratively, since if the master did this literally to the servant, he could not then reassign him to less important responsibilities. Alternate translation: “will punish him severely” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	12	46	l817		τὸ μέρος αὐτοῦ μετὰ τῶν ἀπίστων θήσει	1	will…appoint his place with the unfaithful	The term **unfaithful** likely means “untrustworthy.” The meaning seems to be that the master will assign this servant to less important responsibilities, along with other servants who have shown that they cannot be trusted with important ones. Alternate translation: “will give him unimportant responsibilities, like other servants who have shown that they cannot be trusted”
LUK	12	46	l818	figs-nominaladj	τῶν ἀπίστων	1	the unfaithful	Jesus is using the adjective **unfaithful** as a noun to refer to a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this expression with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “servants who have shown that they cannot be trusted” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
LUK	12	47	p1l2	figs-hypo	ἐκεῖνος δὲ ὁ δοῦλος, ὁ γνοὺς τὸ θέλημα τοῦ κυρίου αὐτοῦ, καὶ μὴ ἑτοιμάσας ἢ ποιήσας πρὸς τὸ θέλημα αὐτοῦ, δαρήσεται πολλάς	1	Now that servant, the one who knew the will of his master, and did not get ready or do according to his will, will be beaten much	Jesus is describing a hypothetical situation. It may be helpful to use two sentences if you translate it that way. Alternate translation: “Suppose a servant knew what his master wanted him to do, and suppose he did not get ready or do what the master wanted. Then his master will punish him severely” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
LUK	12	47	aj41		τὸ θέλημα τοῦ κυρίου αὐτοῦ	1	the will of his master	Alternate translation: “what his master wanted him to do”
LUK	12	47	im3v	figs-activepassive	δαρήσεται πολλάς	1	will be beaten much	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who will do the action. Alternate translation: “his master will punish him severely” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	12	48	l819	figs-hypo	ὁ δὲ μὴ γνοὺς, ποιήσας δὲ ἄξια πληγῶν, δαρήσεται ὀλίγας	1	But the one who did not know, and did things worthy of blows will be beaten little	Jesus is describing a hypothetical situation. It may be helpful to use two sentences if you translate it that way. Alternate translation: “But suppose a servant did not know what his master wanted him to do, and suppose he did things that deserved punishment. Then his master will punish him lightly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
LUK	12	48	nn9c	figs-activepassive	δαρήσεται ὀλίγας	1	will be beaten little	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who will do the action. Alternate translation: “his master will punish him lightly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	12	48	qg96	figs-parallelism	παντὶ…ᾧ ἐδόθη πολύ, πολὺ ζητηθήσεται παρ’ αὐτοῦ; καὶ ᾧ παρέθεντο πολύ, περισσότερον αἰτήσουσιν αὐτόν	1	everyone to whom much has been given, much will be required from him, and to whom much has been provided, even more will be asked of him	These two clauses mean the same thing. Jesus is using repetition for emphasis. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine them, especially if putting both of them in your translation might be confusing for your readers. Alternate translation: “if someone entrusts many resources to a person, he will expect that person to produce much from those resources” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
LUK	12	48	ehu9	figs-activepassive	παντὶ…ᾧ ἐδόθη πολύ, πολὺ ζητηθήσεται παρ’ αὐτοῦ	1	everyone to whom much has been given, much will be required from him	If it would be clearer in your language, you could use active verbal forms to express the meaning of the two passive verbal forms here. Alternate translation: “the master will require more of everyone to whom he has given much” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	12	48	ir7m	figs-activepassive	ᾧ παρέθεντο πολύ, περισσότερον αἰτήσουσιν αὐτόν	1	to whom much has been provided, even more will be asked of him	If it would be clearer in your language, you could use active verbal forms to express the meaning of the two passive verbal forms here. Alternate translation: “the master will ask even more of the one he has given much property to care for” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	12	49	qy62	figs-metaphor	πῦρ ἦλθον βαλεῖν ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν	1	I came to throw fire upon the earth	Jesus is speaking figuratively of the effects of his ministry and teaching. In context, since he says contrastingly in [12:51](../12/51.md) that he did not come to bring peace to the earth, **fire** likely represents the passionate responses to him, both favorable and unfavorable, that would lead to the divisions he describes in [12:52–53](../12/52.md). Alternate translation: “My coming will lead to conflict among people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	12	49	l820	figs-metonymy	τὴν γῆν	1	the earth	Jesus says **the earth** figuratively to mean the people living on the earth. Alternate translation: “people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	12	49	ygv3	figs-exclamations	τί θέλω εἰ ἤδη ἀνήφθη	1	how I wish that it were already kindled	This exclamation emphasizes how much Jesus wants this to happen. Alternate translation: “I wish very much that this fire was already lit” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations]])
LUK	12	49	ygv3	figs-metaphor	τί θέλω εἰ ἤδη ἀνήφθη	1	how I wish that it were already kindled	This exclamation continues the metaphor of **fire** as conflict. Alternate translation: “how I wish that people were already taking sides” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	12	49	l821	figs-activepassive	ἤδη ἀνήφθη	1	it were already kindled	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “the fire was already burning” or “people were already taking sides” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	12	50	k4e8	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	δὲ	1	But	Jesus uses this word to indicate that he cannot do what the previous sentence describes until after he does what this sentence describes. Alternate translation: “But first” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
LUK	12	50	hn1j	figs-metaphor	βάπτισμα…ἔχω βαπτισθῆναι	1	I have a baptism to be baptized with	Jesus speaks figuratively of **baptism** to describe how he must suffer. Just as water covers a person during baptism, suffering will overwhelm Jesus. Alternate translation: “I must be overwhelmed by suffering” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	12	50	l822	figs-activepassive	βάπτισμα…ἔχω βαπτισθῆναι	1	I have a baptism to be baptized with	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “suffering must overwhelm me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	12	50	r2yj	figs-exclamations	πῶς συνέχομαι ἕως ὅτου τελεσθῇ	1	how I am distressed until it is completed	This exclamation emphasizes how distressed Jesus is. Alternate translation: “I am terribly distressed and will continue to be until my suffering is completed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations]])
LUK	12	50	l823	figs-activepassive	πῶς συνέχομαι	1	how I am distressed	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you can say what is doing the action. Alternate translation: “this suffering will continue to distress me terribly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	12	50	l824	figs-activepassive	ἕως ὅτου τελεσθῇ	1	until it is completed	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you can say who will do the action. Alternate translation: “until I have endured all of it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	12	51	s32r	figs-rquestion	δοκεῖτε ὅτι εἰρήνην παρεγενόμην δοῦναι ἐν τῇ γῇ?	1	Do you think that I came to give peace on the earth?	Jesus is not asking the people in the crowd to tell him what they think. He is using the question form as a teaching tool. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate these words as a statement. Alternate translation: “Do not think that I came to bring peace on the earth.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	12	51	l825	figs-metonymy	δοκεῖτε ὅτι εἰρήνην παρεγενόμην δοῦναι ἐν τῇ γῇ	1	Do you think that I came to give peace on the earth	Jesus says **the earth** figuratively to mean the people living on the earth. Alternate translation: “Do you think that I came to make peace between people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	12	51	l826	figs-abstractnouns	εἰρήνην…δοῦναι ἐν τῇ γῇ	1	to give peace on the earth	If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **peace** with an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “to make people get along with one another” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
LUK	12	51	l827	figs-ellipsis	οὐχί…ἀλλ’ ἢ διαμερισμόν	1	No…but rather division	Jesus is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. These words can be supplied from earlier in the sentence. Alternate translation: “No…I came to bring division instead” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
LUK	12	51	np4v	figs-abstractnouns	οὐχί…ἀλλ’ ἢ διαμερισμόν	1	No…but rather division	If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **division** with an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “No…my coming will cause people to oppose each other” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
LUK	12	51	l828		λέγω ὑμῖν	1	I say to you	Jesus uses this expression to emphasize what he is about to tell his disciples and the crowd. Alternate translation: “I want you to understand that”
LUK	12	52	vrt5	figs-metonymy	πέντε ἐν ἑνὶ οἴκῳ	1	five in one house	Jesus uses the term **house** to refer figuratively to people who live together in a house, that is, to a family. Alternate translation: “five members of the same family” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	12	52	l829	figs-activepassive	διαμεμερισμένοι	1	divided	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “who will take sides against one another” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	12	52	fln4	figs-ellipsis	τρεῖς ἐπὶ δυσὶν, καὶ δύο ἐπὶ τρισίν	1	three against two, and two against three	Jesus is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would ordinarily need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from what he says figuratively earlier in the sentence. Alternate translation: “three of the family members will be on one side, and the other two will be on the opposing side” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
LUK	12	52	l830	figs-parallelism	τρεῖς ἐπὶ δυσὶν, καὶ δύο ἐπὶ τρισίν	1	three against two, and two against three	These two phrases mean the same thing. Jesus is likely using repetition for emphasis. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine these phrases. Alternate translation: “three of the family members will be on one side, and the other two will be on the opposing side” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
LUK	12	53	qr7s	figs-activepassive	διαμερισθήσονται	1	They will be divided	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “Family members will oppose one another” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	12	53	l831	figs-parallelism	πατὴρ ἐπὶ υἱῷ, καὶ υἱὸς ἐπὶ πατρί	1	father against son, and son against father	These two phrases mean the same thing. Jesus is likely using repetition for emphasis. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine these phrases and make them a sentence of their own. Alternate translation: “Fathers and sons will oppose one another” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
LUK	12	53	l832	figs-parallelism	μήτηρ ἐπὶ τὴν θυγατέρα, καὶ θυγάτηρ ἐπὶ τὴν μητέρα	1	mother against her daughter, and daughter against her mother	These two phrases mean the same thing. Jesus is likely using repetition for emphasis. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine these phrases and make them a sentence of their own. Alternate translation: “mothers and daughters will oppose one another” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
LUK	12	53	l833	figs-parallelism	πενθερὰ ἐπὶ τὴν νύμφην αὐτῆς, καὶ νύμφη ἐπὶ τὴν πενθεράν	1	mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law, and daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law	These two phrases mean the same thing. Jesus is likely using repetition for emphasis. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine these phrases and make them a sentence of their own. Alternate translation: “mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law will oppose one another” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
LUK	12	54	i84z	figs-explicit	ὅταν ἴδητε νεφέλην ἀνατέλλουσαν	1	a cloud rising in the west	Clouds forming in this direction would indicate that rain was coming in Israel, because the sea was to the **west**. If rainstorms tend to come from a different direction in your region, you could use a general expression here. Alternate translation: “clouds forming in a certain direction” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	12	54	d3gk	figs-quotesinquotes	λέγετε ὅτι ὄμβρος ἔρχεται	1	you say, ‘A shower is coming’	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “you say that it is going to rain” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	12	54	l834		καὶ γίνεται οὕτως	1	and it happens thus	Alternate translation: “and it does rain”
LUK	12	55	gq22	figs-explicit	νότον πνέοντα	1	a south wind is blowing	Wind coming from this direction would indicate that hot weather was coming in Israel, because the desert was to the **south**. If hot winds blow from a different direction in your region, you could use a general expression here. Alternate translation: “the wind is blowing from a certain direction” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	12	55	l835	figs-quotesinquotes	λέγετε ὅτι καύσων ἔσται	1	you say, ‘There will be scorching heat’	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “you say that it is going to be very hot” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	12	55	l836		καὶ γίνεται	1	and it happens	Alternate translation: “and it does get hot”
LUK	12	56	l837	figs-explicit	ὑποκριταί!	1	Hypocrites!	The implication, which Jesus draws out in the rest of this verse, is that people who could understand the weather from signs such as wind and clouds also ought to be able to understand what God was doing through Jesus from the signs surrounding his ministry. So if they did not welcome him, it was not because they did not see or understand these signs. Rather, it was because they were pretending not to see or understand them. Alternate translation: “You are pretending not to understand!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	12	56	jdj7	figs-metaphor	τὸ πρόσωπον	1	the face	Jesus uses the term **face** figuratively to mean “appearance.” Alternate translation: “the appearance” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	12	56	y3yj	figs-rquestion	τὸν καιρὸν δὲ τοῦτον, πῶς οὐκ οἴδατε δοκιμάζειν?	1	but how do you not know how to interpret this time?	Jesus is using the question form to rebuke the crowd. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate his words as a statement. Alternate translation: “so you ought to be able to understand what is happening right now.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	12	57	w8rz	figs-rquestion	τί δὲ καὶ ἀφ’ ἑαυτῶν, οὐ κρίνετε τὸ δίκαιον?	1	And why do you not even judge for yourselves what is right?	Jesus is using the question form to rebuke the crowd. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate his words as a statement. Alternate translation: “You ought to discern on your own initiative what is right.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	12	58	y75j	figs-hypo	ὡς γὰρ ὑπάγεις μετὰ τοῦ ἀντιδίκου σου ἐπ’ ἄρχοντα	1	For as you are going with your adversary to the magistrate	Jesus is using a hypothetical situation to teach the crowd. Alternate translation: “Suppose you owed someone money, and suppose they were taking you to court to collect it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
LUK	12	58	l838	figs-parables	ὡς γὰρ ὑπάγεις μετὰ τοῦ ἀντιδίκου σου ἐπ’ ἄρχοντα	1	For as you are going with your adversary to the magistrate	This hypothetical situation is also an illustration designed to help the people understand that they should be welcoming Jesus. Just as the debtor is going to be judged imminently, God is going to judge them imminently based on their responses to Jesus, and so they should make a positive response now, before it is too late. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say explicitly that explicitly. Alternate translation: “Then Jesus gave the crowd this illustration to help them understand. ‘Suppose you owed someone money, and suppose they were taking you to court to collect it’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])
LUK	12	58	f1ea	figs-youcrowd	ὑπάγεις…σου…σε	1	you are going…your…you	Even though Jesus is speaking to the crowd, he is addressing an individual situation, so **you** and **your** are singular throughout this verse. But if the singular form would not be natural in your language for someone who was speaking to a group of people, you could use the plural forms of **you** and **your** in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd]])
LUK	12	58	t4v8	translate-unknown	τοῦ ἀντιδίκου σου	1	your adversary	In the context of this story, this term means specifically an opponent in a legal proceeding. You could translate it with the equivalent term in your language. Alternatively, since the next verse indicates that the **adversary** is trying to collect a debt, you could describe him in a way that indicates that. Alternate translation: “your opponent” or “your creditor” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	12	58	e7hz	translate-unknown	ἄρχοντα	1	the magistrate	This is a general term for a person in legal authority. You can translate it with the equivalent general term in your language. Alternate translation: “the official” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	12	58	b7sh	figs-activepassive	ἀπηλλάχθαι ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ	1	to be released from him	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “to settle the matter out of court” or “to have him forgive your debt” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	12	58	l839	translate-unknown	τὸν κριτήν	1	the judge	This refers to the same person as the **magistrate**, but the term here is more specific and threatening. In your translation you can use the specific term in your language that describes someone with the power to deliver a verdict and pass sentence on a defendant. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	12	58	l840	translate-unknown	τῷ πράκτορι	1	the officer	In the context of the story, this term refers to a court official who was empowered to collect debts that a judge had ruled were owed and to put the debtor in prison if he did not pay. Your language may have a similar term that you can use. Alternate translation: “the bailiff” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	12	59	wi7m	figs-hypo	λέγω σοι	1	I say to you	Jesus uses this expression to emphasize what he is about to tell his disciples and the crowd. If you translated the previous verse as a hypothetical condition, you could translate this expression as an introduction to the result of that condition. Alternate translation: “If that happens, then” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
LUK	12	59	l841	figs-youcrowd	λέγω σοι	1	I say to you	Even though Jesus is speaking directly to the crowd, he is still addressing an individual situation, so **you** is singular here and in the rest of this verse. But if the singular form would not be natural in your language for someone who was speaking to a group of people, you could use the plural form of **you** in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd]])
LUK	12	59	i124	translate-bmoney	καὶ τὸ ἔσχατον λεπτὸν	1	the very last lepton	An **lepton** was the smallest and least valuable coin in circulation in this place and time. It was equivalent to about a tenth of an hour’s wage. You could try to express this amount in terms of current monetary values, but that might cause your Bible translation to become outdated and inaccurate, since those values can change over time. So instead you might use the name of the least valuable coin in your culture, or a general expression. Alternate translation: “the very last penny” or “every bit of money that your creditor demands” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney]])
LUK	13	intro	xaa2			0		# Luke 13 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>1. Jesus teaches with parables and heals (13:1–30)<br>2. Jesus speaks about Herod and Jerusalem (13:31–35)<br><br>## Possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Unknown events<br><br>The people and Jesus speak about two events that they knew about, but about which no one today knows anything except what Luke has written. These events are Pilate executing some Galileans in the temple, 13:1–2, and 18 people being killed when a tower collapsed in Jerusalem, 13:4. In your translation, you should tell your readers no more than what Luke tells about what happened. Your translation should tell only what Luke tells.<br><br>### Paradox<br><br>A paradox is a statement that describes two things that seem as if they cannot both be true at the same time, but which actually are both true. Jesus speaks a paradox in this chapter: “Those who are least important will be first, and those who are most important will be last” (Luke 13:30)
LUK	13	1	t1fi	grammar-connect-time-background	δέ	1	And	Luke uses this word to introduce background information that will help readers understand what Jesus teaches next. Alternate translation: “Now” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background]])
LUK	13	1	l842	writing-participants	παρῆσαν…τινες ἐν αὐτῷ τῷ καιρῷ ἀπαγγέλλοντες αὐτῷ	1	some were present at that time who were reporting to him	Luke uses this phrase to introduce new characters into the story. Alternate translation: “There were some people present at that time who were telling him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])

If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “while he was still teaching the crowds” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	13	1	l843	figs-metaphor	ὧν τὸ αἷμα Πειλᾶτος ἔμιξεν μετὰ τῶν θυσιῶν αὐτῶν	1	whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices	Luke is speaking figuratively about this event to indicate that the **blood** of the Galileans was shed at the same time as the blood of their animal **sacrifices**. Alternate translation: “whom Pilate had killed while they were offering sacrifices at the temple” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	13	1	fj2c	figs-metonymy	ὧν τὸ αἷμα Πειλᾶτος ἔμιξεν μετὰ τῶν θυσιῶν αὐτῶν	1	whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices	Luke uses the term **blood** figuratively to refer to the death of these Galileans. Alternate translation: “whom Pilate had killed while they were offering sacrifices at the temple” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	13	1	l844	figs-metonymy	ὧν τὸ αἷμα Πειλᾶτος ἔμιξεν μετὰ τῶν θυσιῶν αὐτῶν	1	whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices	Pilate likely did not kill these Galileans personally. Rather, he ordered his soldiers to kill them. Alternate translation: “whom Pilate’s soldiers had killed as they were offering sacrifices at the temple” or “whom Pilate had ordered his soldiers to kill as they were offering sacrifices at the temple” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	13	1	l845	translate-names	Πειλᾶτος	1	Pilate	This is the name of a man, who was the Roman ruler of Judea in this time. See how you translated his name in [3:1](../03/01.md). His name occurs many times later in the book. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	13	2	l846	figs-hendiadys	ἀποκριθεὶς εἶπεν αὐτοῖς	1	answering he said to them	Together the two words **answering** and **said** mean that Jesus responded to what the people in the crowd told him. Alternate translation: “Jesus responded to them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
LUK	13	2	zfa8	figs-rquestion	δοκεῖτε ὅτι	1	Do you think that	Jesus is using the question form to teach these people and the whole crowd.

LUK	13	3	a3ez	figs-explicit	πάντες ὁμοίως ἀπολεῖσθε	1	you will all perish in the same way	This statement seems to be similar to the one that Jesus makes in [19:41–44](../19/41.md), in which he says that if the Jewish people reject him and instead follow violent false messiahs, this will bring them into conflict with the Romans and they will be destroyed. That seems to be the implicit meaning here as well, and you could say that in your translation. Alternate translation: “you too will be destroyed by the Romans” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	13	4	hj5w		ἢ ἐκεῖνοι	1	Or those	Jesus is giving a second example of people who suffered. Alternate translation: “Also consider those”

LUK	13	5	ckc2	figs-explicit	πάντες ὡσαύτως ἀπολεῖσθε	1	you will all likewise perish	See how you translated the similar statement in [13:3](../13/03.md). In this case, the people whom Jesus is using as an example were not destroyed by the Romans, so the comparison does not include that detail. Alternate translation: “you too will be destroyed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	13	6	sm1p	figs-parables	ἔλεγεν δὲ ταύτην τὴν παραβολήν	1	Then he spoke this parable	Jesus now gives a brief illustration to help the crowd understand what he has been saying.

LUK	13	6	x42j	figs-activepassive	συκῆν εἶχέν τις πεφυτευμένην	1	had a fig tree planted	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who did the action. Alternate translation: “had planted a fig tree” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	13	6	l851	translate-unknown	συκῆν	1	a fig tree	A **fig tree** is a type of fruit tree that is common in the land of Israel.

LUK	13	6	l853	figs-go	ἦλθεν ζητῶν καρπὸν ἐν αὐτῇ	1	he came seeking fruit on it	You language might use a form of “go” here rather than a form of “come.” Alternate translation: “he went to see if there were any figs on the tree” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])

Cut it down. Why is it even idling the ground?’	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “he told the gardener to pay attention, that he had been coming for three years to look for fruit on the fig tree, but he had not found any, and so the gardener should cut the tree down because it was keeping the ground from being productive” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])

LUK	13	7	l856	figs-metaphor	τὴν γῆν καταργεῖ	1	idling the ground	The man speaks figuratively of the tree as if it were keeping the ground from working, since the ground would be productive if a different tree that actually was bearing fruit were in its place. Alternate translation: “keeping the ground from being productive” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	13	8	pm3j		ὁ δὲ ἀποκριθεὶς λέγει αὐτῷ	1	But answering he says to him	To call attention to a development in the story, Jesus uses the present tense in past narration. See how you decided to approach this usage in [7:40](../07/40.md). If it would not be natural to use the present tense in your language, you can use the past tense in your translation. Alternate translation: “But he responded”
LUK	13	8	l857	figs-hendiadys	ὁ…ἀποκριθεὶς λέγει	1	answering he says	Together the terms **answering** and **says** mean that the gardener responded to what his master told him to do. Alternate translation: “he responded” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])

If your readers would not be familiar with this practice, you could explain it, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “mix animal dung into the soil to enrich it” or “fertilize it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	13	9	w5qh	figs-ellipsis	κἂν μὲν ποιήσῃ καρπὸν εἰς τὸ μέλλον	1	If indeed it bears fruit in the coming one	The gardener does not specify what he thinks the master should do with the tree if it does bear fruit, but you can supply that information from the context. Alternate translation: “If the tree has figs on it next year, then you can allow it to keep growing” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
LUK	13	9	l928	figs-nominaladj	εἰς τὸ μέλλον	1	in the coming one	The gardener is using the participle **coming**, which functions as an adjective, as a noun. ULT adds the term **one** to show this. In context, this means “in the coming year.” If your language does not use adjectives this way, you can use an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “next year” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
LUK	13	9	j4ul	figs-declarative	ἐκκόψεις αὐτήν	1	you will cut it down	The servant is using a statement to make a suggestion.

LUK	13	11	l858	figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	behold	Luke uses the term **behold** to calls the reader’s attention to what he is about to say. Your language may have a similar expression that you can use here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	13	11	wn7u	writing-participants	γυνὴ	1	a woman	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new character into the story.

LUK	13	11	l859	figs-nominaladj	εἰς τὸ παντελές	1	to the complete	Luke is using the adjective **complete** as a noun, to mean the woman’s full height. Alternate translation: “to her complete height” or “completely” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
LUK	13	12	l860	figs-idiom	γύναι	1	Woman	Unlike the term **Man** in [12:14](../12/14.md), in this context Jesus uses the term **Woman** gently and compassionately. Alternate translation: “My dear woman” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

LUK	13	19	l869	figs-gendernotations	ἄνθρωπος	1	a man	There are two possibilities here. (1) Jesus may be using the term **man** in a generic sense that includes all people. Alternate translation: “a person” (2) Since Jesus speaks in his next illustration of a **woman** doing something, he may be using a man and a woman in paired examples to offer a comprehensive teaching about the kingdom of God. In that case, it would be appropriate to say **a man** here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
LUK	13	19	wv4q	figs-explicit	ἔβαλεν εἰς κῆπον ἑαυτοῦ	1	took and threw into his garden	In this culture, people planted some kinds of seeds by throwing them so that they scattered in a garden.

LUK	13	26	l889	figs-exclusive	ἐν ταῖς πλατείαις ἡμῶν	1	in our streets	Within the extended metaphor, the people are addressing Jesus, who was not from their town, but who taught them as he traveled through.

LUK	13	27	l892	figs-you	ὑμῖν…πάντες	1	you…all you	Since the owner of the house is speaking to the people outside, **you** would be plural in these instances. The implied “you” in the command to **get away** would also be plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
LUK	13	27	l893	figs-explicit	οὐκ οἶδα πόθεν ἐστέ	1	I do not know where you are from	This is a shorter version of what the house owner says at first.

LUK	13	28	ep1b	figs-activepassive	ὑμᾶς δὲ ἐκβαλλομένους ἔξω	1	but you are thrown out	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who will have done the action.

The term **you** would also be a singular pronoun in any case where it is needed in your language as a pronoun for a verb, for example, **you were not willing**, and in the phrase “sent to you,” if you decide to use the second person. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
LUK	13	34	kb9t	figs-simile	ὃν τρόπον ὄρνις τὴν ἑαυτῆς νοσσιὰν ὑπὸ τὰς πτέρυγας	1	the way a hen gathers her brood under her wings	Jesus uses this comparison to describe how he wishes he could care for the people of Jerusalem. Alternate translation: “just as if I were a hen gathering her chicks under her wings” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
LUK	13	34	l917	translate-unknown	τὴν ἑαυτῆς νοσσιὰν	1	her brood	The term **brood** refers collectively to all of the young offspring of a bird. Alternate translation: “her chicks” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	13	34	l918	figs-explicit	ὑπὸ τὰς πτέρυγας	1	under her wings	The implication is that a hen would put her baby chicks there to protect them. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “under her wings to protect them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	13	35	l919	figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	Behold	Jesus uses the term **Behold** to call attention to what he is about to say. Alternate translation: “Listen carefully now” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	13	35	l920	figs-pastforfuture	ἀφίεται ὑμῖν ὁ οἶκος ὑμῶν	1	your house has been left to you	Jesus is figuratively using the past tense in order to refer to something that will happen in the future. He is doing this to show that the event will certainly happen. Alternate translation: “your house will be left to you alone” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture]])
LUK	13	35	w1v2	figs-metaphor	ἀφίεται ὑμῖν ὁ οἶκος ὑμῶν	1	your house has been left to you	Jesus speaks figuratively of the city of Jerusalem as if it were a **house** in which its people lived. Alternate translation: “your city will be left to you alone” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	13	35	l921	figs-activepassive	ἀφίεται ὑμῖν ὁ οἶκος ὑμῶν	1	your house has been left to you	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who will do the action. Alternate translation: “God is going to leave your city to you alone” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	13	35	l922	figs-explicit	ἀφίεται ὑμῖν ὁ οἶκος ὑμῶν	1	your house has been left to you	The implications of this statement are that God will no longer consider that Jerusalem belongs to him, as a holy city where he dwells in his temple, and that God will therefore not protect the people of Jerusalem from their enemies. Alternate translation: “God will not protect you from your enemies” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	13	35	l923	figs-you	ὑμῖν…ὑμῶν…ὑμῖν	1	your…you…you	Jesus is now speaking directly to the people who live in Jerusalem, so **your** and **you** would be plural. The term **you** would also be a plural pronoun in any case where it is needed in your language as a pronoun for a verb, for example, “you say.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
LUK	13	35	l924		λέγω δὲ ὑμῖν	1	I say to you	Jesus says this to emphasize what he is telling the people of Jerusalem. Alternate translation: “you can be certain that”
LUK	13	35	x4y6		οὐ μὴ με ἴδητέ ἕως ἥξει ὅτε εἴπητε	1	you will certainly not see me until it comes when you say	If it would be clearer in your language, you could make this a positive statement. Alternate translation: “the next time you see me, you will say”
LUK	13	35	l925		ἕως ἥξει ὅτε εἴπητε	1	until it comes when you say	The expression **it comes** means “the time comes.” You could say that in your translation, or, if your language does not speak of time as “coming,” you could use an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “until the time comes when you say” or “until the time when you say”
LUK	13	35	l926	figs-quotesinquotes	ὅτε εἴπητε, εὐλογημένος ὁ ἐρχόμενος ἐν ὀνόματι Κυρίου	1	when you say, ‘Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord’	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “when you say that the one who comes in the name of the Lord is blessed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	13	35	v6lj	figs-metonymy	ἐν ὀνόματι Κυρίου	1	in the name of the Lord	God’s **name** figuratively represents his power and authority. Alternate translation: “as God’s representative” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	14	intro	xk3w			0		# Luke 14 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>1. Jesus attends a banquet and tells a parable about a banquet (14:1–24)<br>2. Jesus teaches more about being his disciple (14:25–35)<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Parable<br><br>Jesus told the parable in Luke 14:15-24 to teach that the kingdom of God will be something that everyone can enjoy, but many people will refuse to be part of it. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/kingdomofgod]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Paradox<br><br>A paradox is a statement that describes two things that seem as if they cannot both be true at the same time, but which actually are both true. Jesus speaks a paradox in this chapter: “For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted” (14:11).
LUK	14	1	dj2d	writing-newevent	καὶ ἐγένετο	1	And it happened that	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
LUK	14	1	a3ya	grammar-connect-time-background	καὶ	1	And	Luke uses this word to introduce background information that will help readers understand what happens next. Alternate translation: “Now” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background]])

LUK	14	1	lh8g	figs-synecdoche	φαγεῖν ἄρτον	1	to eat bread	Luke refers figuratively to **bread**, one kind of food, to mean food in general. Alternate translation: “to have a meal” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
LUK	14	1	jst8	figs-explicit	καὶ αὐτοὶ ἦσαν παρατηρούμενοι αὐτόν	1	and they were watching him closely	The implication is that other Pharisees were also present, as [14:3](../14/03.md) indicates explicitly, and that they all wanted to find a way to accuse Jesus of saying or doing something wrong. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. It might be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “Many other Pharisees were present, and they were all watching Jesus closely to try to catch him saying or doing something wrong” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	14	2	l927	figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	behold	Luke uses the term **behold** to calls the reader’s attention to what he is about to say. Your language may have a similar expression that you can use here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	14	2	f5gh	writing-participants	ἄνθρωπός τις	1	a certain man	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new character into the story. If your language has its own way of doing that, you can use it here in your translation. Alternate translation: “there was a man there” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
LUK	14	2	l4a1	translate-unknown	ἦν ὑδρωπικὸς	1	who was edematous	This means that the man had edema. That is a condition that causes swelling when water builds up in parts of the body. Your language may have a specific name for this condition. If not, you can use a general expression. Alternate translation: “who was suffering because parts of his body were swollen with water” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	14	2	l929	writing-background	ἦν ὑδρωπικὸς	1	who was edematous	Luke provides this background information about the man to help readers understand what happens in this episode. Jesus was facing the issue of whether to heal this man on the Sabbath, which the Pharisees thought was wrong. Alternate translation: “who was suffering because parts of his body were swollen with water” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
LUK	14	2	l930	figs-metaphor	ἔμπροσθεν αὐτοῦ	1	before him	The word **before** here means “in front of” or “in the presence of” another person. Alternate translation: “in the presence of Jesus” or “where Jesus could see him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	14	3	l931	figs-explicit	ἀποκριθεὶς ὁ Ἰησοῦς εἶπεν	1	answering Jesus spoke	The term **answering** indicates that Jesus **spoke** in response to the situation that he observed. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “When he saw the man, Jesus spoke” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	14	3	l932	translate-unknown	τοὺς νομικοὺς	1	the lawyers	See how you translated this in [7:30](../07/30.md). In this context, the term **lawyers** refers to experts in the law of Moses and its application to various situations. Alternate translation: “the experts in the Jewish law” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	14	3	qak4	figs-rquestion	ἔξεστιν τῷ Σαββάτῳ θεραπεῦσαι ἢ οὔ?	1	Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath, or not?	Jesus is not asking this question for information or to get guidance about what he should do. Rather, he is using the question to challenge the Pharisees and lawyers to think about the meaning and purpose of the Sabbath. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this as an imperative. Alternate translation: “If you think the law does not permit healing on the Sabbath, explain why.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	14	4	pj9t		οἱ δὲ ἡσύχασαν	1	But they kept silent	Alternate translation: “But the religious leaders would not answer Jesus’ question”
LUK	14	4	l933	grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ	1	And	Luke uses this word to introduce the results of what the previous sentence described. Because the religious leaders made no objection to healing on the Sabbath, as a result, Jesus healed the man. Alternate translation: “So” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
LUK	14	4	x4lq	writing-pronouns	ἐπιλαβόμενος	1	taking hold of him	Alternate translation: “Jesus took hold of the man who was suffering from edema and” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
LUK	14	5	l934	grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ	1	And	Luke uses this word to introduce the results of what the previous sentence described. Alternate translation: “So” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
LUK	14	5	rr5z	figs-rquestion	τίνος ὑμῶν υἱὸς ἢ βοῦς εἰς φρέαρ πεσεῖται, καὶ οὐκ εὐθέως ἀνασπάσει αὐτὸν ἐν ἡμέρᾳ τοῦ Σαββάτου	1	Of which of you will a son or an ox fall into a well, and he will not immediately pull him out on the Sabbath day	Jesus does not expect these religious leaders to tell him whether they would do this. Rather, he is using the question form as a teaching tool. He wants these religious leaders to recognize that on the Sabbath day, they themselves would do something to address a situation of suffering and need. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate his words as a statement. It may be helpful to make this two sentences. Alternate translation: “If one of you had a son who fell into a well on the Sabbath, surely you would pull him out immediately. You would even do the same thing for your ox.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	14	6	cti5		οὐκ ἴσχυσαν ἀνταποκριθῆναι πρὸς ταῦτα	1	they were not able to give an answer to these things	Alternate translation: “There was nothing they could say in response”
LUK	14	7	l935	grammar-connect-logic-result	ἔλεγεν…παραβολήν…ἐπέχων πῶς τὰς πρωτοκλισίας ἐξελέγοντο	1	he was was speaking a parable…noticing how they were choosing the first places	If it would be clearer in your language, you could reverse the order of the phrases in this verse, since the second phrase gives the reason for the action that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “Jesus noticed that those whom the leader of the Pharisees had invited to the meal were trying to sit in the seats for honored guests, so he gave them an illustration” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
LUK	14	7	u86b	figs-parables	ἔλεγεν…παραβολήν	1	he was speaking a parable	In this instance, Luke is not using the term **parable** to mean a brief story that teaches something true in a way that is easy to understand and remember. Rather, Luke means that Jesus gave the guests at this meal an illustration, in the form of a hypothetical situation, to get them to consider how they should behave at feasts. Alternate translation: “he gave them an illustration” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])
LUK	14	7	em4u	figs-activepassive	τοὺς κεκλημένους	1	those who were invited	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who had done the action.

LUK	14	7	yd4g	figs-metaphor	τὰς πρωτοκλισίας	1	the first places	The term **first** figuratively represents being important and honored. If you culture has a way of placing people at meals to show honor, you can use that in your translation. Otherwise, you can use a general expression. Alternate translation: “the seats closest to the host” or “the seats for honored guests” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	14	8	l936	figs-hypo	ὅταν κληθῇς ὑπό τινος εἰς γάμους, μὴ κατακλιθῇς	1	When you are invited by someone to a wedding feast, do not recline to eat	Jesus is using a hypothetical situation to teach the guests at this meal. Alternate translation: “Suppose someone invites you to a wedding celebration. Then you should not take your place at the table” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
LUK	14	8	pd7w	figs-activepassive	ὅταν κληθῇς ὑπό τινος	1	When you are invited by someone	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “When someone invites you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	14	8	l937	translate-unknown	κατακλιθῇς	1	recline to eat	See how you translated this in [5:29](../05/29.md). Alternate translation: “take your place at the table” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	14	8	l938	figs-metaphor	τὴν πρωτοκλισίαν	1	the first place	See how you translated this in [14:7](../14/07.md). Alternate translation: “in a seat for an honored guest” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	14	8	l939	figs-nominaladj	μήποτε ἐντιμότερός	1	a more honorable	Jesus is using the comparative adjective **more honorable** as a noun.

LUK	14	8	m5b9	figs-youcrowd	σου	1	you	Even though Jesus is speaking to the crowd, he is addressing an individual situation, so **you** and **your** are singular in [14:8–10](../14/08.md). But if the singular forms of these pronouns would not be natural in your language for someone who was speaking to a group of people, you could use the plural forms in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd]])
LUK	14	8	t1r5	figs-activepassive	ᾖ κεκλημένος ὑπ’ αὐτοῦ	1	may have been invited by him	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “the host may also have invited” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	14	9	l940	translate-unknown	ἐλθὼν, ὁ σὲ καὶ αὐτὸν καλέσας	1	when the one who invited you and him arrives	In this culture, the host would come into the banquet hall after all the guests were seated. If the practice is different in your culture, you can use a general expression in your translation here. Alternate translation: “when the person who invited both of you sees the seating arrangements” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	14	9	ecp7	figs-idiom	ἄρξῃ μετὰ αἰσχύνης τὸν ἔσχατον τόπον κατέχειν	1	you will begin with shame to take the last place	Jesus uses the term **begin** idiomatically to suggest slowly unfolding, reluctant action.

LUK	14	9	gqa6	figs-metaphor	τὸν ἔσχατον τόπον	1	the last place	The term **last** figuratively represents being unimportant and not honored.

Alternate translation: “a seat far from the host” or “a seat for the least important person” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	14	9	l941	figs-explicit	τὸν ἔσχατον τόπον	1	the last place	The implication is that this guest must go to the least important section of seats because all the other places have been taken in the meantime.

Alternate translation: “a seat for the least important person, since all the other seats will be taken” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	14	10	x5qh	figs-activepassive	ὅταν κληθῇς	1	when you are invited	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who who does the action.

If the practice is different in your culture, you can use a general expression in your translation here. Alternate translation: “when the person who invited you sees where you are sitting” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	14	10	ck9k	figs-metaphor	προσανάβηθι ἀνώτερον	1	come up higher	The host speaks figuratively of the more important places at the feast being **higher** than the less important ones.

LUK	14	10	h5ee	figs-idiom	ἔσται σοι δόξα	1	there will be honor to you	This is an idiom. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say who would make this happen. Alternate translation: “your host will honor you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	14	10	l944	figs-metaphor	ἐνώπιον	1	before all those reclining to eat with you	The word **before** here means “in front of” or “in the presence of.” Alternate translation: “in the presence of all the other guests” or “as all the other guests are watching”
LUK	14	11	i5e7		ὁ ὑψῶν ἑαυτὸν	1	who exalts himself	Alternate translation: “who tries to look important” or “who takes an important position”
LUK	14	11	zrs1	figs-activepassive	ταπεινωθήσεται	1	will be humbled	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “will have to act humbly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

LUK	14	12	v4uk	figs-you	ὅταν ποιῇς	1	when you make	Even though this is general advice for everyone listening, the word **you** is singular here, and **you** and **your** are singular in all of [14:12–14](../14/12.md), because Jesus is speaking directly to the Pharisee who invited him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
LUK	14	12	gmh6	figs-hyperbole	μὴ φώνει	1	do not invite	Jesus is probably not telling his host never to invite such people. Rather, this is likely a generalization that means he should invite others as well. Alternate translation: “do not invite only” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
LUK	14	12	l945	figs-metaphor	τοὺς ἀδελφούς σου…τοὺς συγγενεῖς σου	1	your brothers…your relatives	The term **brothers** probably refers figuratively to close family members, while the term **relatives** likely indicates more distant members of an extended family. Alternate translation: “your close family members…other relatives” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	14	12	l946	figs-gendernotations	τοὺς ἀδελφούς σου	1	your brothers	If **brothers** is a figurative term, then Jesus is using it in a generic sense that includes both men and women. Alternate translation: “your close family members” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
LUK	14	12	l947		μήποτε καὶ αὐτοὶ ἀντικαλέσωσίν σε	1	lest they also invite you in return	Alternate translation: “because they might feel an obligation to invite you to a banquet of their own”
LUK	14	12	l948		γένηται ἀνταπόδομά σοι	1	and repayment happen to you	Your language may require you to say who would make this happen. Alternate translation: “and they would repay you”
LUK	14	13	uc5f		κάλει	1	invite	It may be helpful to add “also” in your translation, since, as in [14:12](../14/12.md), Jesus probably does not mean to invite only these people. Alternate translation: “also invite”
LUK	14	13	abcf	figs-nominaladj	πτωχούς, ἀναπείρους, χωλούς, τυφλούς	1	the poor, the crippled, the lame, and the blind	Jesus is using these adjectives as nouns, to refer to groups of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate these with equivalent phrases. Alternate translation: “people who are poor, people with disabilities, people who are handicapped, and people who are blind” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
LUK	14	14	vpt9	figs-activepassive	μακάριος ἔσῃ	1	you will be blessed	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who will do the action. Alternate translation: “God will bless you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	14	14	r6cp	figs-ellipsis	οὐκ ἔχουσιν ἀνταποδοῦναί σοι	1	they do not have to repay you	This expression does not mean that these people would not have a social obligation to return hospitality, the way others would. Rather, Jesus is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages in order to be complete. Alternate translation: “they do not have the means to repay you” or “they cannot invite you to a banquet in return” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
LUK	14	14	z4tv	figs-activepassive	ἀνταποδοθήσεται…σοι	1	it will be repaid to you	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who will do the action.

If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “In response, Jesus told this guest a story to help him understand. ‘There was a man who prepared a large banquet’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])
LUK	14	16	m7bc	writing-participants	ἄνθρωπός τις	1	A certain man	This introduces a character in the parable. Alternate translation: “There was a man who” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])

Alternate translation: “had his servants prepare a large banquet and go and invite many guests” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	14	17	us3d	figs-idiom	τῇ ὥρᾳ τοῦ δείπνου	1	at the hour of the supper	Jesus is using the term **hour** figuratively to refer a specific time. Alternate translation: “at the time for the dinner” or “when the dinner was about to begin” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	14	17	xkp8	figs-activepassive	τοῖς κεκλημένοις	1	the ones who were invited	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who did the action. Alternate translation: “those he had invited” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	14	17	l951	figs-quotesinquotes	ἔρχεσθε, ὅτι ἤδη ἕτοιμά ἐστιν	1	‘Come, because it is now ready’	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation.

LUK	14	18	eh3h	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	καὶ	1	And	This word introduces a contrast between what was expected, that all the invited guests would come to the dinner, and what happened, that they all declined to do that. Alternate translation: “But” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
LUK	14	18	l952	figs-ellipsis	ἀπὸ μιᾶς πάντες	1	all from one	Jesus is leaving out a word that this sentence would need in many languages in order to be complete. This could mean a number of things, depending on what word is supplied, but the general sense is the same in every case. (1) “All from one mind” or “all from one voice,” that is, unanimously. Alternate translation: “all alike” (2) “All from one manner.” Alternate translation: “all in the same way” (3) “All from one time” Alternate translation: “all, as soon as the servant came to them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

LUK	14	18	l3r6	figs-explicit	ὁ πρῶτος εἶπεν αὐτῷ	1	The first said to him	While **him** refers to the servant, the implication is that this first guest was giving the servant a message for his master, since it would be the master, not the servant, who would excuse him from attending the banquet. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “The first guest whom the servant approached told him to give this message to his master” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	14	18	l953	figs-nominaladj	ὁ πρῶτος	1	The first	Jesus is using the adjective **first** as a noun, to refer to a person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way.

Alternate translation: “that he had just gotten married and so he could not come” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	14	20	gy6v	figs-explicitinfo	γυναῖκα ἔγημα	1	I have married a wife	In your language, it might seem that this phrase expresses unnecessary extra information. If so, you could abbreviate it. Use the expression that is most natural in your language. Alternate translation: “I have just gotten married” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo]])
LUK	14	20	l961		οὐ δύναμαι ἐλθεῖν	1	I cannot come	This is not the same polite formula that the previous two people used. This man feels he has solid grounds to decline the invitation, and he says so directly. Reflect this difference in the way your language naturally would. Alternate translation: “I will not be coming”
LUK	14	21	v7v7	figs-explicit	ὀργισθεὶς	1	becoming angry	The implication is that the host became angry with the people who had turned down his invitation, not with his servant. Alternate translation: “becoming angry with the people he had invited” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate these with equivalent phrases. Alternate translation: “people who are poor, people with disabilities, people who are blind, and people who are handicapped” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
LUK	14	22	y4rb	figs-explicit	καὶ εἶπεν ὁ δοῦλος	1	And the servant said	The implication is that the servant did what the master commanded him and then came back with this report. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “After the servant went out and did that, he came back and reported” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	14	22	l963	figs-quotesinquotes	Κύριε, γέγονεν ὃ ἐπέταξας, καὶ ἔτι τόπος ἐστίν	1	‘Master, what you commanded has happened, and there is still room’	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation.

LUK	14	22	dgt3		γέγονεν ὃ ἐπέταξας	1	what you commanded has happened	Alternate translation: “I have done what you commanded”
LUK	14	23	l964	figs-quotesinquotes	εἶπεν ὁ κύριος πρὸς τὸν δοῦλον, ἔξελθε εἰς τὰς ὁδοὺς καὶ φραγμοὺς, καὶ ἀνάγκασον εἰσελθεῖν, ἵνα γεμισθῇ μου ὁ οἶκος	1	the master said to the servant, ‘Go out into the roads and hedges and compel them to come in, so that my house may be filled’	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “the master told the servant to go out into the roads and hedges and compel people to come in so that his house would be filled” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	14	23	n9x7	figs-metonymy	φραγμοὺς	1	hedges	The word **hedges** describes boundary fences that enclose and protect fields and buildings. They may be made of bushes and shrubs growing closely together, or they may be made of wood or stone or similar building materials. The term could mean one of two things here. (1) Jesus could be referring to actual hedges. In that case, you could use the equivalent term in your language, or a general expression. Alternate translation: “boundary fences” (2) Since the term is paired with **roads**, it could figuratively mean the footpaths that run along hedges at the borders of fields. Alternate translation: “paths” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

LUK	14	24	v5m6	figs-you	λέγω γὰρ ὑμῖν ὅτι οὐδεὶς τῶν ἀνδρῶν ἐκείνων τῶν κεκλημένων γεύσεταί μου τοῦ δείπνου	1	For I say to you that none of those men who were invited will taste of my supper	While the word **you** is singular in [14:21–23](../14/23.md), since the master and the servant are addressing one another individually, here the word **you** is plural. It is not clear why. (1) One possibility is that it may be assumed that other servants have been helping and that the master is now addressing all of the servants at once. In that case, you could translate all of this as a statement by the master, using the plural form of **you** if your language marks that distinction. (2) Another possibility is that Jesus is using the expression **I say to you** to get everyone who is listening to the parable to pay attention to the master’s final words. In that case, you could show that Jesus is interrupting the master’s statement to address his listeners. Alternate translation: “‘For’—now listen carefully—‘none of those men who were invited will taste my supper’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
LUK	14	24	l965	figs-quotesinquotes	λέγω γὰρ ὑμῖν ὅτι οὐδεὶς τῶν ἀνδρῶν ἐκείνων τῶν κεκλημένων γεύσεταί μου τοῦ δείπνου	1	For I say to you that none of those men who were invited will taste of my supper	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. You could accommodate either possibility discussed in the previous note. (1) Alternate translation: “The master told all of his servants that he did not want any of the men he had invited to taste his supper” (2) Alternate translation, continuing the sentence from the previous verse: “because—now listen carefully—he did not want any of the men he had invited to taste his supper” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	14	24	liz5	figs-gendernotations	τῶν ἀνδρῶν ἐκείνων	1	those men	The word for **men** here means “male adults,” not people in general. So it would be appropriate to use a specifically masculine term in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
LUK	14	24	n867	figs-activepassive	τῶν κεκλημένων	1	who were invited	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who did the action. Alternate translation: “whom I invited” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	14	24	hl7q	figs-metonymy	γεύσεταί μου τοῦ δείπνου	1	will taste of my supper	The master may be using the word **taste** figuratively to mean eating the meal. Alternate translation: “will enjoy the dinner that I have prepared” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	14	24	l984	figs-hyperbole	γεύσεταί μου τοῦ δείπνου	1	will taste of my supper	Alternatively, the master may be making an extreme statement for emphasis. Alternate translation: “will get even a taste of the dinner that I have prepared” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
LUK	14	24	l966		μου τοῦ δείπνου	1	my supper	By this expression, the master does not mean his own meal, but the dinner that he has prepared for others. Alternate translation: “the dinner that I have prepared”
LUK	14	25	l967	grammar-connect-time-background	δὲ	1	And	Luke uses this word to introduce background information that will help readers understand what happens next. Alternate translation: “Now” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background]])
LUK	14	25	gv94	writing-newevent	συνεπορεύοντο…αὐτῷ ὄχλοι πολλοί	1	large crowds were journeying with him	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new event in the story. Jesus is no longer at the dinner at the home of the Pharisee. He has resumed his journey to Jerusalem. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could introduce this new situation more fully. Alternate translation: “Jesus then continued on his way to Jerusalem, and large crowds were traveling with him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])

LUK	14	26	l985	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	καὶ	1	and	Jesus uses this word to introduce a contrast. Alternate translation: “but” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
LUK	14	26	rmt8	figs-hyperbole	οὐ μισεῖ	1	does not hate	Jesus is using the word **hate** figuratively as an exaggeration to say that his disciples are not to love other people and themselves more than they love Jesus. Alternate translation: “does not love me more than” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
LUK	14	27	pm44	figs-doublenegatives	ὅστις οὐ βαστάζει τὸν σταυρὸν αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔρχεται ὀπίσω μου, οὐ δύναται εἶναί μου μαθητής	1	Whoever does not carry his cross and come after me is not able to be my disciple	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this double negative as a positive statement. Alternate translation: “Whoever who wants to be my disciple must carry his cross and follow me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
LUK	14	27	l970	figs-explicit	βαστάζει τὸν σταυρὸν αὐτοῦ	1	carry his cross	Jesus assumes that the crowds will know that the Romans executed some criminals by nailing them to a wooden beam with crossbar that was set upright so that the criminals would slowly suffocate. Jesus assumes that the crowds will also know that the Romans made these criminals carry these wooden crosses through the streets to the place where they were going to be executed. Alternate translation: “carry the wooden cross on which he will be executed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	14	27	jn5u	figs-metaphor	βαστάζει τὸν σταυρὸν αὐτοῦ	1	carry his cross	Jesus refers to this practice of execution figuratively to say that his disciples must be people who have given up their lives to God and who are willing to suffer. Alternate translation: “surrender his life to God and be willing to suffer” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	14	27	l971	figs-idiom	ἔρχεται ὀπίσω μου	1	come after me	This is an idiom. Alternate translation: “follow my example” or “obey me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

LUK	14	28	eyx4	translate-unknown	πύργον	1	a tower	This may mean a watchtower. In one of his parables, recorded in Matthew [21:33](../mat/21/33.md), Jesus uses this same word to describe a watchtower that a man built for a vineyard he was planting. Alternate translation: “a high lookout platform” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	14	28	l973	figs-ellipsis	εἰ ἔχει εἰς ἀπαρτισμόν	1	whether he has for completion	Jesus is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete.

LUK	14	30	l975	figs-gendernotations	οὗτος ὁ ἄνθρωπος	1	this man	Since Jesus addresses his question in [14:28](../14/28.md) to the whole crowd, his illustration envisions all of them, so the term **man** here may be generic. Alternate translation: “this person” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
LUK	14	30	l976	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	καὶ	1	and	This word introduces a contrast between what the man planned to do and what he failed to do in the end. Alternate translation: “but” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])

Alternate translation: “Then Jesus gave the crowd this illustration to help them understand. ‘Salt is certainly useful’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])
LUK	14	34	l979	figs-activepassive	ἐὰν…τὸ ἅλας μωρανθῇ	1	if the salt…is made tasteless	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “if something causes salt to lose its flavor” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

LUK	14	34	cz52	figs-rquestion	ἐν τίνι ἀρτυθήσεται?	1	with what will it be seasoned?	Jesus is using this question as a teaching tool. He does not expect the crowd to tell him how the flavor of salt can be restored. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate his words as a statement. Alternate translation: “nothing can make it salty again.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	14	35	bp1b	translate-unknown	εἰς κοπρίαν	1	for the manure pile	See how you translated this term in [13:8](../13/08.md). Alternate translation: “to use as fertilizer” or “to add to the compost heap” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	14	35	n5a9	writing-pronouns	ἔξω βάλλουσιν αὐτό	1	They throw it outside	**They** does not refer to any individuals in particular. This is an indefinite usage. Alternate translation: “People throw it outside” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
LUK	14	35	u9h3	figs-metonymy	ὁ ἔχων ὦτα ἀκούειν, ἀκουέτω	1	The one who has ears to hear, let him hear	Jesus uses this phrase to emphasize that what he has just said is important and that it may take some effort to understand and put into practice. The phrase **ears to hear** figuratively represents the willingness to understand and obey, by association with the part of the body by which his listeners have been taking in his teaching. Alternate translation: “If anyone is willing to understand, let him understand and obey” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	14	35	c5fb	figs-123person	ὁ ἔχων ὦτα ἀκούειν, ἀκουέτω	1	The one who has ears to hear, let him hear	Since Jesus is speaking directly to his audience, you may prefer to use the second person here.

LUK	14	35	l981	figs-you	ὁ ἔχων ὦτα ἀκούειν, ἀκουέτω	1	The one who has ears to hear, let him hear	If you choose to translate this in the second person, **you** would be plural, since Jesus is speaking to the crowd. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
LUK	15	intro	p1ba			0		# Luke 15 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>1. Jesus tells parables about a lost sheep, a lost coin, and a lost son (15:1–32)<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### The parable of the prodigal son<br><br>The story that Jesus tells in Luke 15:11-32 is known as The Parable of the Prodigal Son, although he does not give the story that title himself. Most interpreters understand the father in the story to represent God (the Father), the sinful younger son to represent those who repent and come to faith in Jesus, and the self-righteous older son to represent the Pharisees. In the story, the older son becomes angry at the father for forgiving the younger son’s sins. He will not even go in to the party that the father is giving to welcome the younger son home. Jesus knew that the Pharisees wanted God to think that only they were good and not forgive other people’s sins. Jesus was teaching them that they would never become part of God’s kingdom if they continued to think that way. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/forgive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])<br><br>### Sinners<br><br>When the people of Jesus’ time spoke of “sinners,” they were talking about people who did not obey the law of Moses and instead committed sins such as stealing or sexual sins. But Jesus told three parables (15:4-7, 15:8-10, and 15:11-32) to teach that the people who acknowledge that they are sinners and who repent are the people who truly please God. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/repent]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])
LUK	15	1	yj6b	grammar-connect-time-background	δὲ	1	And	Luke uses this word to introduce background information that will help readers understand what happens next next. Alternate translation: “Now” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background]])
LUK	15	1	l982	writing-participants	ἦσαν…αὐτῷ ἐγγίζοντες πάντες οἱ τελῶναι καὶ οἱ ἁμαρτωλοὶ ἀκούειν αὐτοῦ	1	all the tax collectors and sinners were coming to him to listen to him	Luke uses this phrase to introduce new characters into the story. These people were part of the crowd that Luke described generally in [14:25](../14/25.md). Alternate translation: “many of the people who were coming to listen to Jesus were tax collectors and sinners” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
LUK	15	1	ss52	figs-hyperbole	ἦσαν…αὐτῷ ἐγγίζοντες πάντες οἱ τελῶναι καὶ οἱ ἁμαρτωλοὶ ἀκούειν αὐτοῦ	1	all the tax collectors and sinners were coming to him to listen to him	The word **all** is an overstatement for emphasis. Alternate translation: “many of the people who were coming to listen to Jesus were tax collectors and sinners” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
LUK	15	2	l986	grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ	1	And	Luke uses this word to indicate the results of what the previous sentence described. Alternate translation: “As a result” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
LUK	15	2	l987	writing-participants	διεγόγγυζον οἵ τε Φαρισαῖοι καὶ οἱ γραμματεῖς	1	both the Pharisees and the scribes were grumbling	Luke uses this phrase to reintroduce these characters into the story. While these may not be exactly the same individuals whom Jesus encountered in places such as [5:17–30](../05/30.md), the members of this group in general function as the same character throughout the story. Alternate translation: “some Pharisees and scribes were there, and they were grumbling” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
LUK	15	2	dd9b		οὗτος ἁμαρτωλοὺς προσδέχεται	1	This one receives sinners	Alternate translation: “This man lets sinners into his presence” or “This man associates with sinners”
LUK	15	2	ec2r	figs-explicit	οὗτος	1	This one	This expression implicitly means Jesus. Alternate translation: “This man” or “Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	15	3	l988	grammar-connect-logic-result	δὲ	1	And	Luke uses this word to indicate the results of what the previous sentence described. Alternate translation: “Then” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
LUK	15	3	ill7	figs-parables	εἶπεν…πρὸς αὐτοὺς τὴν παραβολὴν ταύτην	1	he spoke this parable to them	Alternate translation: “Jesus told this story to the Pharisees and scribes to help them understand” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])
LUK	15	4	pxm3	figs-rquestion	τίς ἄνθρωπος ἐξ ὑμῶν, ἔχων ἑκατὸν πρόβατα καὶ ἀπολέσας ἐξ αὐτῶν ἓν, οὐ καταλείπει τὰ ἐνενήκοντα ἐννέα ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ, καὶ πορεύεται ἐπὶ τὸ ἀπολωλὸς, ἕως εὕρῃ αὐτό?	1	Which man among you, having 100 sheep and having lost one of them, will not leave the 99 in the wilderness and go after the lost one until he finds it?	Jesus is using this question as a teaching tool. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate his words as a statement. Alternate translation: “If one of you had 100 sheep and lost one of them, he would certainly leave the other 99 sheep in the wilderness and go looking for the sheep that had wandered off until he found it.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	15	4	l989		τίς ἄνθρωπος ἐξ ὑμῶν, ἔχων ἑκατὸν πρόβατα καὶ ἀπολέσας ἐξ αὐτῶν ἓν, οὐ καταλείπει Which man among you, having 100 sheep and having lost one of them, will not leave figs-hypo	1	Jesus is offering the Pharisees and scribes an illustration that involves a hypothetical situation. Alternate translation: “Suppose one of you had 100 sheep and you lost one of them. Then you would certainly leave” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])	
LUK	15	4	m048	figs-123person	τίς ἄνθρωπος ἐξ ὑμῶν, ἔχων ἑκατὸν πρόβατα…ἕως εὕρῃ αὐτό	1	Which man among you, having 100 sheep…until he finds it	Since Jesus begins the parable by asking, “Which man among you,” some languages would continue the parable in the second person. Alternate translation: “Which one of you, if you had 100 sheep…until you found it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
LUK	15	4	l990	figs-gendernotations	τίς ἄνθρωπος ἐξ ὑμῶν	1	Which man among you	There are two possibilities here. (1) While all of the Pharisees and scribes who are grumbling are probably men, Jesus is describing what any person, man or woman, would likely do in this situation, and he is telling the parable for the whole crowd to hear. So the term **man** here may be generic. Alternate translation: “Which person among you” (2) Since Jesus speaks in his next parable of a woman doing something, he may be using a man and a woman in paired examples to offer a comprehensive teaching about the kingdom of God. In that case, the term **man** here would not be generic. Alternate translation: “Which of you men” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
LUK	15	4	l991	figs-nominaladj	τὸ ἀπολωλὸς	1	the lost one	Jesus is using the participle **lost**, which functions here as an adjective, as a noun. ULT adds the term **one** to show that. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate the term with an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “the sheep that had wandered off” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
LUK	15	5	l992	figs-123person	καὶ εὑρὼν, ἐπιτίθησιν ἐπὶ τοὺς ὤμους αὐτοῦ χαίρων	1	And having found it, he lays it on his shoulders, rejoicing	If you decided in the previous verse that your language would continue this parable in the second person, use the second person here as well. Alternate translation: “Once you found it, you would very happily lay it across your shoulders” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
LUK	15	5	xwa5	figs-explicit	ἐπιτίθησιν ἐπὶ τοὺς ὤμους αὐτοῦ	1	he lays it on his shoulders	This is the way a shepherd carries a sheep. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “he lays it across his shoulders to carry it home” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	15	6	g3f3	figs-123person	καὶ ἐλθὼν εἰς τὸν οἶκον, συνκαλεῖ τοὺς φίλους καὶ τοὺς γείτονας	1	And coming to the house, he calls together his friends and his neighbors	If you decided that your language would continue this parable in the second person, use the second person here as well. Alternate translation: “And when you got back to your house, you would call together your friends and neighbors” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
LUK	15	6	l993	figs-quotesinquotes	λέγων αὐτοῖς, συνχάρητέ μοι, ὅτι εὗρον τὸ πρόβατόν μου τὸ ἀπολωλός	1	saying to them, ‘Rejoice together with me, for I have found my lost sheep’	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “and tells them to rejoice with him because he has found his sheep that was lost” or, if you decided to use the second person, “and you would tell them to rejoice with you because you had found your sheep that was lost” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	15	7	l994		λέγω ὑμῖν ὅτι	1	I say to you that	Jesus says this to emphasize what he is about to tell these Pharisees and scribes. Alternate translation: “Now listen to this carefully”
LUK	15	7	k1l2	figs-explicit	οὕτως	1	in the same way	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express the implicit meaning here. Alternate translation: “just as the shepherd and his friends and neighbors would rejoice” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	15	7	k8k6	figs-metonymy	χαρὰ ἐν τῷ οὐρανῷ ἔσται	1	there will be joy in heaven	Jesus is using the word **heaven** figuratively to mean the inhabitants of heaven. Alternate translation: “everyone in heaven will rejoice” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	15	7	abcg	figs-nominaladj	δικαίοις	1	righteous	Jesus is using the adjective **righteous** as a noun, to refer to a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way.

LUK	15	8	ly5c	figs-rquestion	τίς γυνὴ δραχμὰς ἔχουσα δέκα, ἐὰν ἀπολέσῃ δραχμὴν μίαν, οὐχὶ ἅπτει λύχνον, καὶ σαροῖ τὴν οἰκίαν, καὶ ζητεῖ ἐπιμελῶς, ἕως οὗ εὕρῃ?	1	what woman, having ten drachmas, if she would lose one drachma, would not light a lamp, and sweep the house, and seek diligently until she has found it?	Jesus is using this question as a teaching tool. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate his words as a statement. Alternate translation: “if a woman had ten drachma coins and she lost one of them, she would certainly light a lamp, sweep the house, and seek diligently until she found it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	15	8	qr36	figs-hypo	τίς γυνὴ δραχμὰς ἔχουσα δέκα, ἐὰν ἀπολέσῃ δραχμὴν μίαν, οὐχὶ ἅπτει λύχνον	1	what woman, having ten drachmas, if she would lose one drachma, would not light a lamp	Jesus is offering an illustration that involves a hypothetical situation. Alternate translation: “Suppose a woman had ten drachma coins and she lost one of them. Then she would certainly light a lamp” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
LUK	15	8	l995	translate-bmoney	δραχμὰς	1	drachmas	A **drachma** was a silver coin equivalent to a day’s wage. You could try to express this amount in terms of current monetary values, but that might cause your Bible translation to become outdated and inaccurate, since those values can change over time. So instead you might say something more general, or give the equivalent in wages. Alternate translation: “valuable silver coins” or “coins each worth a day’s wages” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney]])
LUK	15	8	l996	figs-synecdoche	σαροῖ τὴν οἰκίαν	1	sweep the house	Jesus speaks of the whole **house** to refer figuratively to one part of it, the floor. Alternate translation: “sweep the floor” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

Alternate translation: “and tells them to rejoice with her because she has found the drachma that she lost” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	15	10	wrs9	figs-explicit	οὕτως	1	In the same way	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express the implicit meaning here. Alternate translation: “Just as the woman and her friends and neighbors would rejoice” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	15	10	l998		λέγω ὑμῖν	1	I say to you	Jesus says this to emphasize what he is about to tell these Pharisees and scribes. Alternate translation: “now listen carefully”
LUK	15	10	m8zl	figs-metaphor	ἐνώπιον τῶν ἀγγέλων τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	before the angels of God	The term **before** figuratively means “in the presence” of someone. Alternate translation: “in the presence of God’s angels” or “among the angels of God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	15	11	ib6s	figs-parables	εἶπεν δέ	1	Then he said	To help the Pharisees and scribes understand what he has been teaching, Jesus tells a brief story that provides a further illustration.

Alternate translation: “told his father that he wanted the share of the estate that he would inherit” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	15	12	y6uq	figs-imperative	δός μοι	1	give me	The son wanted his father to give him his inheritance immediately. If your language has a command form that indicates that the speaker wants something done immediately, it would be appropriate to use that form here.

LUK	15	20	m43r	grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ	1	And	Luke uses this word to introduce the results of what the previous sentences described. Alternate translation: “So” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])

LUK	15	20	z7p3	translate-symaction	ἐπέπεσεν ἐπὶ τὸν τράχηλον αὐτοῦ καὶ κατεφίλησεν αὐτόν	1	fell upon his neck, and kissed him	The father did these things to show his son that he loved him and that he was glad he was coming home. If men in your culture would not show affection to their sons in this way, you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “welcomed him affectionately” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
LUK	15	20	m012	figs-idiom	ἐπέπεσεν ἐπὶ τὸν τράχηλον αὐτοῦ	1	fell upon his neck	This is an idiom. Alternate translation: “gave him a hug” or “hugged him tightly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

LUK	15	21	xz93	figs-euphemism	τὸν οὐρανὸν	1	heaven	In order to honor the commandment not to misuse God’s name, Jewish people often avoided saying the word “God” and used the word **heaven** instead. Alternate translation: “God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
LUK	15	21	m014	figs-metaphor	ἐνώπιόν	1	before	The term **before** figuratively means “in the presence” of another person.

Alternate translation: “But the father told his servants quickly to bring the best robe they had and put it on his son, and to put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	15	22	m017	figs-you	ἐξενέγκατε…ἐνδύσατε…δότε	1	bring…clothe…put	Since the father is speaking to a number of servants, the implied **you** in these imperatives would be plural. Your language may need to show that distinction explicitly. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
LUK	15	22	nlx9	translate-symaction	στολὴν τὴν πρώτην…δακτύλιον…ὑποδήματα	1	the first robe…a ring…sandals	By having his servants put these things on his son, the father was showing that he was welcoming his son back as a member of the family in good standing. These were all signs of status, authority, and privilege. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that in some way in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
LUK	15	22	b3hv	figs-metaphor	στολὴν τὴν πρώτην	1	the first robe	As in [14:7](../14/07.md), here the word **first** figuratively means “best.” Alternate translation: “the best robe we have” or “the festive garment we save for special occasions” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	15	22	m018	figs-synecdoche	δότε δακτύλιον εἰς τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ	1	put a ring on his hand	The father figuratively says **hand** to mean one part of the hand, a finger. Alternate translation: “put a ring on his finger” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
LUK	15	22	xat6	figs-explicit	ὑποδήματα	1	sandals	At this time, people who could afford them wore **sandals**. Poorer people went barefoot. The modern equivalent in many cultures would be shoes. Alternate translation: “shoes” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

LUK	15	23	m020	figs-you	φέρετε…θύσατε	1	bring…slaughter	Since the father is speaking to a number of servants, the implied **you** in these imperatives would be plural. Your language may need to show that distinction explicitly. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
LUK	15	23	ll8j	translate-unknown	μόσχον τὸν σιτευτόν	1	the fattened calf	A **calf** is a young cow. People would give one of their calves special food so that it would grow well, and then, when they wanted to have a special feast, they would butcher and eat that calf. If your readers would not know what a **calf** or a cow is, or if a description of eating a cow would be offensive to them, you could use a general expression here. Alternate translation: “the young animal we have been making fat” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	15	23	t3cu	figs-explicit	θύσατε	1	kill	In this context, the term **kill** means to slaughter an animal and prepare its meat to be eaten. The implication is that the servants were also to cook the meat for the feast that the father wanted to have. Alternate translation: “butcher and cook” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	15	23	m021	figs-hendiadys	φαγόντες εὐφρανθῶμεν	1	let us eat and celebrate	The phrase **eat and celebrate** expresses a single idea by using two words connected with **and**. The word **eat** indicates how the father wants to **celebrate** his son’s homecoming. Alternate translation: “celebrate by having a feast” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
LUK	15	23	m022	figs-exclusive	φαγόντες εὐφρανθῶμεν	1	let us eat and celebrate	The word **us** includes the addresses, since the father means the whole household, including the servants he is speaking to. So use the inclusive form of **us** in your translation if your language marks that distinction. Other langauges might say “all of us.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

You could translate this as a simile or comparison if your readers might otherwise take the father’s statement to mean that the son actually had died.

LUK	15	24	izx2	figs-metaphor	ἦν ἀπολωλὼς καὶ εὑρέθη	1	he was lost, and has been found	The father says figuratively that when his **son** was in faraway country, it was as if he was **lost** and no one knew where to find him. You could translate this as a simile or comparison if your readers might otherwise take the father’s statement to mean that the son actually had been missing. Alternate translation: “it was as if my son was missing, but now I have found him again” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	15	24	m024	figs-activepassive	εὑρέθη	1	he…has been found	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who has done the action. Alternate translation: “I have found him again” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

LUK	15	25	m026	figs-explicit	ὡς ἐρχόμενος	1	as he came	Alternate translation: “as he came back home from the field” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	15	25	m027	figs-metonymy	ἤκουσεν συμφωνίας καὶ χορῶν	1	he heard music and dancing	The older son could not literally hear **dancing**, so Jesus is using the term **heard** figuratively in that case. Alternate translation: “he heard music and the sound of people dancing” or “he heard music and could tell that people were dancing” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	15	26	m028	grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ	1	And	Jesus uses this word to introduce the results of what the previous sentence described.

Alternate translation: “So” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
LUK	15	26	m029	figs-explicit	ἕνα τῶν παίδων	1	one of the servants	The word that is translated as **servant** here ordinarily means “boy.” Here it may indicate that the servant was young. Alternate translation: “a young servant” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

LUK	16	10	r8hz		ὁ ἐν ἐλαχίστῳ ἄδικος	1	the one who is unrighteous in very little	Be sure that this does not sound as if it is describing a person who is only infrequently unrighteous. Alternate translation: “someone who is not trustworthy even in very small matters”

LUK	16	19	fu76	figs-synecdoche	καὶ ἐνεδιδύσκετο πορφύραν καὶ βύσσον	1	and he was putting on purple and fine linen	Jesus is figuratively using two specific types of expensive clothing to mean expensive clothing in general. These were likely not the only types of clothes that the man owned and wore. Alternate translation: “who wore very expensive clothes” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
LUK	16	19	m079	figs-metonymy	πορφύραν	1	purple	Jesus uses the term **purple** figuratively to mean clothing colored with purple dye, which was very expensive. Alternate translation: “clothing colored with purple dye” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	16	19	sz7t		εὐφραινόμενος καθ’ ἡμέραν λαμπρῶς	1	feasting sumptuously every day	Alternate translation: “and who enjoyed eating expensive food every day”
LUK	16	20	mmw2	writing-participants	πτωχὸς δέ τις ὀνόματι Λάζαρος	1	But a certain poor man named Lazarus	This introduces another character in the parable. It is not clear whether this is a real person or simply a person in a story that Jesus is telling in order to make a point. Alternate translation: “There was also a poor man named Lazarus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
LUK	16	20	m080	translate-names	Λάζαρος	1	Lazarus	This is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	16	20	m081	figs-activepassive	ἐβέβλητο πρὸς τὸν πυλῶνα αὐτοῦ	1	was laid at his gate	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who did the action. Alternate translation: “whom people laid at his gate” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	16	20	ax4v	figs-explicit	πρὸς τὸν πυλῶνα αὐτοῦ	1	at his gate	The implication is that people brought Lazarus there so that he could beg for money and food from those who went in and out. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “at the gate to the rich man’s house so that he could beg there” or “at the entrance to the rich man’s property so that he could beg there” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	16	20	ex57		εἱλκωμένος	1	afflicted with sores	It might be helpful to make this a new sentence. Alternate translation: “He was covered with sores” or “He had sores all over his body”
LUK	16	21	i2fn	figs-activepassive	ἐπιθυμῶν χορτασθῆναι ἀπὸ τῶν πιπτόντων	1	longing to be fed from the things falling	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “wishing he could eat the scraps of food that fell” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	16	21	vnk5		ἀλλὰ καὶ οἱ κύνες ἐρχόμενοι	1	But even the dogs were coming	Jesus uses the word **even** to show that what follows is worse than what he has already told about Lazarus. Alternate translation: “Worse yet, the dogs came”
LUK	16	21	xby9	figs-explicit	οἱ κύνες	1	the dogs	The Jews considered dogs to be unclean animals. Lazarus was too sick and weak to stop them from licking his wounds, so in addition to being poor and sick, he was always ceremonially unclean. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this explicitly. Alternate translation: “the unclean dogs” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	16	22	y7pb	writing-newevent	ἐγένετο δὲ	1	And it happened that	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])

LUK	16	22	r2k1	figs-explicit	εἰς τὸν κόλπον Ἀβραάμ	1	to the bosom of Abraham	The implication is that Abraham and Lazarus were reclining next to each other at a feast. Within the story, this feast likely represents the joys of heaven, and Jesus may be depicting Abraham, the ancestor of the Jews, as the host. In that case, Lazarus would be in a place of honor next to him. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “to a place of honor next to Abraham at the heavenly feast” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	16	22	hn6v	figs-activepassive	ἐτάφη	1	was buried	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “people buried him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	16	23	m082	translate-names	ἐν τῷ ᾍδῃ	1	in Hades	**Hades** was the Greek name for the abode of the dead. You could use that name in your translation, or you could use an equivalent expression.

LUK	16	23	m083		ὁρᾷ	1	he sees	To call attention to a significant development in the story, Jesus uses the present tense in past narration. See how you decided to approach this usage in [7:40](../07/40.md). If it would not be natural to use the present tense in your language, you can use the past tense in your translation. Alternate translation: “and he saw”
LUK	16	23	qpd2	figs-explicit	ἐν τοῖς κόλποις αὐτοῦ	1	in his bosom	See how you translated this expression in [16:22](../16/22.md). Alternate translation: “in a place of honor next to him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	16	24	m084	figs-quotesinquotes	αὐτὸς φωνήσας εἶπεν, Πάτερ Ἀβραάμ, ἐλέησόν με καὶ πέμψον Λάζαρον, ἵνα βάψῃ τὸ ἄκρον τοῦ δακτύλου αὐτοῦ ὕδατος, καὶ καταψύξῃ τὴν γλῶσσάν μου; ὅτι ὀδυνῶμαι ἐν τῇ φλογὶ ταύτῃ	1	crying out he said, ‘Father Abraham, have mercy on me and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, for I am tormented in this flame	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “he shouted over to Abraham, addressing him respectfully as his ancestor, and asked him to have mercy on him and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool his tongue, because he was in a flame that was making him suffer greatly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	16	24	dpp9	figs-hendiadys	αὐτὸς φωνήσας εἶπεν	1	crying out he said	Together the terms **crying out** and **said** mean that the rich man spoke what follows as a loud cry. Alternate translation: “the rich man shouted out” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
LUK	16	24	m95a	figs-metaphor	Πάτερ Ἀβραάμ	1	Father Abraham	The rich man is using the term **Father**, which figuratively means “ancestor,” as a respectful title. Abraham was the ancestor of all the Jews. Alternate translation: “Abraham, my father” or “Abraham, my ancestor” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	16	24	b2rc	figs-imperative	ἐλέησόν με	1	have mercy on me	This is an imperative, but it should be translated as a polite request, rather than as a command. It may be helpful to add an expression such as “please” to make this clear. Alternate translation: “please have pity on me” or “please help me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
LUK	16	24	ly9k		καὶ πέμψον Λάζαρον	1	and send Lazarus	Alternate translation: “by sending Lazarus” or “and tell Lazarus to come to me”
LUK	16	24	rc6p	figs-hyperbole	βάψῃ τὸ ἄκρον τοῦ δακτύλου αὐτοῦ καὶ καταψύξῃ τὴν γλῶσσάν μου	1	that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue	The rich man is making an exaggeratedly small request in order to emphasize how hot and thirsty he is. In your translation, you could indicate that this is not the most he would want Lazarus to do. Alternate translation: “so that he can at least dip his finger in water and cool my tongue with a drop of it” or “so he can bring me water to drink that will cool my tongue” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
LUK	16	24	rc6p	figs-hyperbole	καὶ καταψύξῃ τὴν γλῶσσάν μου	1	and cool my tongue	The rich man is figuratively describing how thirsty he is by association with the way his **tongue** feels hot. Alternate translation: “so that I will not be so thirsty” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
LUK	16	24	qix8	figs-activepassive	ὀδυνῶμαι ἐν τῇ φλογὶ ταύτῃ	1	I am tormented in this flame	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “this flame is making me suffer greatly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	16	25	m085	figs-quotesinquotes	εἶπεν δὲ Ἀβραάμ, τέκνον, μνήσθητι ὅτι ἀπέλαβες τὰ ἀγαθά σου ἐν τῇ ζωῇ σου, καὶ Λάζαρος ὁμοίως τὰ κακά. νῦν δὲ ὧδε παρακαλεῖται, σὺ δὲ ὀδυνᾶσαι	1	But Abraham said, ‘Child, remember that in your lifetime you received your good things, and Lazarus in like manner bad things. But now he is comforted here, and you are suffering greatly	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “But Abraham, addressing the rich man as his descendant, told him to remember that he had received good things in his lifetime, while Lazarus had received bad things in his lifetime, and so Lazarus was receiving comforts with him, while the rich man was suffering greatly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	16	25	m086	figs-metaphor	τέκνον	1	Child	Abraham is using the term **child** figuratively to mean “descendant.” As a Jew, the rich man was a descendant of Abraham. Abraham is likely using the term in a compassionate way. Alternate translation: “My dear child” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	16	25	we9w	figs-nominaladj	τὰ ἀγαθά σου	1	the good of yours	Abraham is using the adjective **good** as a noun. It is plural. If your language does not use adjectives as nouns, you can translate this with an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “your good things” or “things that you enjoyed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
LUK	16	25	rv17		ὁμοίως	1	likewise	Abraham is referring to the fact that both men received something while they lived on earth. He is not saying that what they received was the same. Alternate translation: “while he was living received”

LUK	16	26	m087	figs-quotesinquotes	καὶ ἐν πᾶσι τούτοις, μεταξὺ ἡμῶν καὶ ὑμῶν χάσμα μέγα ἐστήρικται, ὅπως οἱ θέλοντες διαβῆναι ἔνθεν πρὸς ὑμᾶς μὴ δύνωνται, μηδὲ ἐκεῖθεν πρὸς ἡμᾶς διαπερῶσιν	1	And with all these things, between us and you a great chasm has been put in place, so that those who want to cross over from here to you are not able, and none may cross over from there to us	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “Abraham also told him that God had placed a huge pit between them, so that no one who wanted to cross over to where the rich man was, and no one who wanted to come over from there to where Abraham was, would be able to do that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	16	26	af4h	figs-idiom	καὶ ἐν πᾶσι τούτοις	1	And with all these things	This is an idiom. Alternate translation: “In addition to this reason” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	16	26	m088	figs-exclusive	ἡμῶν…ἡμᾶς	1	us…us	Abraham means himself and the people who are with him, but not the rich man, so **us** is exclusive in both instances in this verse, if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
LUK	16	26	m089	figs-you	ὑμῶν…ὑμᾶς	1	you…you	Even though Abraham is speaking to the rich man individually, he is referring to all of the people who are in Hades with him, so **you** is plural in both instances in this verse. Alternate translation: “all of you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
LUK	16	26	tu5w	figs-activepassive	χάσμα μέγα ἐστήρικται	1	a great chasm has been set in place	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who has done the action.

LUK	16	26	sg6d	figs-ellipsis	μηδὲ ἐκεῖθεν πρὸς ἡμᾶς διαπερῶσιν	1	and that they may not go across from there to us	Abraham is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. If it would be clearer in your language, you could supply these words from earlier in the sentence. Alternate translation: “and so that those who want to come across from where you are to here will not be able to do that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
LUK	16	27	abcj	figs-quotesinquotes	εἶπεν δέ, ἐρωτῶ οὖν σε Πάτερ, ἵνα πέμψῃς αὐτὸν εἰς τὸν οἶκον τοῦ πατρός μου	1	Then he said, ‘I beg you then, Father, that you would send him to the house of my father figs-quotesinquotes	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation.

It may be helpful to make this a separate sentence. Alternate translation: “The rich man explained that he had five brothers and that he wanted Lazarus to warn them so that they would not also come to where he was, in a place where they would suffer greatly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	16	28	x8xk	figs-explicit	ὅπως διαμαρτύρηται αὐτοῖς	1	in order that he might warn them	The implication is that the rich man wanted Lazarus to warn his brothers not to act as he had. He had been selfish, self-indulgent, and unconcerned about the needs of people around him who were poor and suffering. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “so that he can warn them not to be self-indulgent and callous, as I was” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	16	29	m092		λέγει δὲ Ἀβραάμ	1	But Abraham says	To call attention to a significant development in the story, Jesus uses the present tense in past narration here. See how you decided to approach this usage in [7:40](../07/40.md). If it would not be natural to use the present tense in your language, you can use the past tense in your translation. Alternate translation: “But Abraham said”
LUK	16	29	m093	figs-quotesinquotes	λέγει δὲ Ἀβραάμ, ἔχουσι Μωϋσέα καὶ τοὺς προφήτας; ἀκουσάτωσαν αὐτῶν	1	But Abraham says, ‘They have Moses and the prophets; let them listen to them’	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation.

LUK	16	29	v8eh	figs-explicit	ἔχουσι Μωϋσέα καὶ τοὺς προφήτας	1	They have Moses and the prophets	The implication is that Abraham is refusing to send Lazarus to the rich man’s brothers.

LUK	16	29	m095	figs-explicit	ἀκουσάτωσαν αὐτῶν	1	let them listen to them	The implication is that the rich man’s brothers do not need Lazarus to come and warn them because they already have all the warning they need in the Scriptures. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “your brothers should obey their teaching, because it provides all the warning they need” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	16	30	m096	figs-quotesinquotes	ὁ δὲ εἶπεν, οὐχί, Πάτερ Ἀβραάμ, ἀλλ’ ἐάν τις ἀπὸ νεκρῶν πορευθῇ πρὸς αὐτοὺς, μετανοήσουσιν	1	But he replied, ‘No, Father Abraham, but if someone would go to them from the dead, they will repent	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation.

LUK	16	30	m097	figs-explicit	οὐχί	1	No	The rich man uses this word to indicate that what Abraham has just said is not true.

If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, and if your readers might misunderstand and think that what Abraham is saying is not actually the case, then you can translate his words as an affirmative statement. Alternate translation: “Since they will not obey the teaching of Moses and the prophets, a dead person who came back to life would not be able to convince them either” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])

LUK	17	intro	c4am			0		# Luke 17 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>1. Jesus teaches about forgiveness, faith, and service (17:1–10)<br>2. Jesus heals ten lepers (17:11–19)<br>3. Jesus teaches about the kingdom of God coming (17:20–37)<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Old Testament Examples<br><br>Jesus uses Noah and Lot’s wife as examples to teach his followers. Noah was ready for the flood when it came, and followers of Jesus need to be ready for him to return, because he will not warn them when he is about to come. Lot’s wife loved the evil city she had been living in so much that God also punished her when he destroyed it. Followers of Jesus need to love him more than anything else. You may need to provide some background information that Jesus assumed his listeners would know so that people who read your translation today can understand what Jesus is teaching here.<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Rhetorical Questions<br><br>Jesus asks his disciples three questions in (17:7–9) to teach them that even those who serve him well are righteous only because of his grace. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/grace]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Paradox<br><br>AA paradox is a statement that describes two things that seem as if they cannot both be true at the same time, but which actually are both true. Jesus speaks a paradox in this chapter: “Whoever seeks to gain his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life will save it” (17:33).<br><br>## Important textual issues in this chapter<br><br>### “In his day”<br><br>At the end of 17:24, some ancient manuscripts of the Bible have the phrase “in his day,” but the manuscripts considered to be the most accurate do not. ULT does not have the phrase in its text, but it does have it in a footnote.<br><br>### “There will be two in the field”<br><br>Some ancient manuscripts of the Bible include the verse 17:36, but the manuscripts considered to be the most accurate do not. ULT does not have this verse in its text, but it does have it in a footnote.<br><br>In both of these cases, if a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to include the verse if it does, but leave it out if it does not include it. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to follow the example of ULT. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])

Alternate translation: “Traps will certainly come” or “Things that tempt people to sin will certainly happen” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
LUK	17	1	m102	translate-unknown	τὰ σκάνδαλα	1	traps	This particular term refers to a device that a person or animal would unknowingly activate and that would then confine them in a net, cage, or pit. Your language may have a term for a similar device, and you could use it here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	17	1	m103	figs-metaphor	τὰ σκάνδαλα	1	traps	Jesus is using the word **traps** figuratively. Alternate translation: “things that tempt people to sin” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	17	1	zck5	figs-ellipsis	οὐαὶ δι’ οὗ ἔρχεται!	1	woe through whom they come!	Jesus is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. Alternate translation: “how terrible it will be for anyone who causes these temptations to come” or “how terrible it will be for any person who tempts others to sin” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
LUK	17	2	dvz5	figs-explicit	λυσιτελεῖ αὐτῷ εἰ	1	It would be better for him if	Jesus is drawing a comparison to the punishment for causing people to sin. He means that this person’s punishment for causing people to sin will be worse than if he had drowned in the sea. No one would actually put a stone around his neck and throw him into the sea as an alternative to that punishment, and Jesus is not saying that anyone will do so. Alternate translation: “The punishment he will receive will be worse than if” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	17	2	uk6e	figs-explicit	λίθος μυλικὸς περίκειται περὶ τὸν τράχηλον αὐτοῦ	1	a millstone were lying around his neck	The implication is that someone would tie the stone around the person’s neck.

LUK	17	2	gr89	translate-unknown	λίθος μυλικὸς	1	a millstone	A **millstone** is a very large, heavy, circular stone that is used for grinding grain into flour.

LUK	17	3	m104	figs-explicit	προσέχετε ἑαυτοῖς	1	Pay attention to yourselves	Since Jesus is teaching about how important it is not to sin and not to encourage others to sin, the implication is that this statement means that he wants his disciples to help one another not to sin. Alternate translation: “Help one another not to sin” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	17	3	m105	figs-you	προσέχετε	1	Pay attention	The implied “you” in this imperative is plural, since Jesus is speaking to his disciples. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
LUK	17	3	m106	figs-youcrowd	σου…ἐπιτίμησον…ἄφες	1	your…rebuke…forgive	The word **your** and the implied “you” in the imperatives **rebuke** and **forgive** are singular, since Jesus is addressing an individual situation, even though he is speaking to a group. If these singular forms would not be natural in your language for someone who was speaking to a group of people, you could use plural forms in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd]])
LUK	17	3	hyn8	grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical	ἐὰν ἁμάρτῃ ὁ ἀδελφός σου, ἐπιτίμησον αὐτῷ	1	If your brother sins, rebuke him	Jesus is describing a hypothetical situation in order to tell his disciples what they should do if it takes place.

LUK	17	3	m108	grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical	καὶ ἐὰν μετανοήσῃ, ἄφες αὐτῷ	1	and if he repents, forgive him	Jesus is describing another hypothetical situation in order to tell his disciples what they should do if it takes place. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “And suppose that believer were to repent. Then you should forgive him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical]])
LUK	17	4	x8a3	grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical	ἐὰν ἑπτάκις τῆς ἡμέρας ἁμαρτήσῃ εἰς σὲ, καὶ ἑπτάκις ἐπιστρέψῃ πρὸς σὲ, λέγων μετανοῶ, ἀφήσεις αὐτῷ	1	And if he sins against you seven times in the day, and seven times returns to you, saying, ‘I repent,’ you will forgive him	Jesus is describing a hypothetical situation in order to tell his disciples what they should do if it takes place. Alternate translation: “Suppose a fellow believers were to sin against you seven times in the same day. And suppose each time he came to you and said, ‘I am sorry.’ Then you would have to forgive him each time” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical]])
LUK	17	4	k5va	figs-idiom	ἑπτάκις τῆς ἡμέρας…καὶ ἑπτάκις	1	seven times in the day, and seven times	The number **seven** in the Bible figuratively represents a large or sufficient quantity. Alternate translation: “many times in the same day, and each time” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	17	4	m109		τῆς ἡμέρας	1	in the day	Alternate translation: “in the same day”
LUK	17	4	m110	figs-youcrowd	σὲ…σὲ…ἀφήσεις	1	you…you…you will forgive	The word **you** is singular in this verse, since Jesus is addressing an individual situation, even though he is speaking to a group. If these singular forms would not be natural in your language for someone who was speaking to a group of people, you could use plural forms in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd]])
LUK	17	4	m111	figs-quotesinquotes	ἐπιστρέψῃ πρὸς σὲ, λέγων μετανοῶ, ἀφήσεις αὐτῷ	1	returns to you, saying, ‘I repent,’ you will forgive him	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “comes to you and says that he is sorry, you must forgive him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	17	4	m112	figs-declarative	ἀφήσεις αὐτῷ	1	you will forgive him	Jesus is using a future statement to give an instruction and command. Alternate translation: “you must forgive him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative]])
LUK	17	5	s4dy		οἱ ἀπόστολοι	1	the apostles	This means the 12 disciples whom Jesus appointed as his authoritative representatives in [6:13](../06/13.md). See how you translated the term there.
LUK	17	5	m114		τῷ Κυρίῳ	1	the Lord	Luke is referring to Jesus here by a respectful title. Alternate translation: “Jesus” or “the Lord Jesus”
LUK	17	5	pji3	figs-imperative	πρόσθες ἡμῖν πίστιν	1	Increase faith to us	This is an imperative, but it should be translated as a polite request, rather than as a command. It may be helpful to add an expression such as “please” to make this clear. Alternate translation: “Please give us more faith” or “Please help us to trust God better” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
LUK	17	6	m115		ὁ Κύριος	1	the Lord	Luke is referring to Jesus here by a respectful title. Alternate translation: “Jesus” or “the Lord Jesus”

He is asserting that if the condition is true, then the result will necessarily follow. Alternate translation: “I can assure you that if you had faith like a mustard seed, you could say to this mulberry tree” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical]])
LUK	17	6	m117	figs-you	ἔχετε…ἐλέγετε…ὑμῖν	1	you had…you would say…you	Even though Jesus is describing something that an individual might do, **you** is plural in this verse because he is speaking to his 12 apostles in response to their request. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
LUK	17	6	ep7z	figs-simile	εἰ ἔχετε πίστιν ὡς κόκκον σινάπεως	1	If you had faith like a mustard seed	A **mustard seed** is a very small seed.

LUK	17	6	m118	translate-unknown	κόκκον σινάπεως	1	a mustard seed	If your readers would not be familiar with a **mustard seed**, you could use the name of another small seed they would be familiar with, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “a very small seed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	17	6	i31l	translate-unknown	συκαμίνῳ	1	mulberry tree	Jesus likely uses a **mulberry tree** as an example because it has an extensive root system that makes it very difficult to uproot. If your readers would not be familiar with this tree, you could use the name of another type of tree with extensive roots that they would be familiar with, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “firmly rooted tree” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	17	6	m119	figs-quotesinquotes	ἐλέγετε ἂν τῇ συκαμίνῳ ταύτῃ, ἐκριζώθητι καὶ φυτεύθητι ἐν τῇ θαλάσσῃ	1	you would say to this mulberry tree, ‘Be uprooted, and be planted in the sea’	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “you could tell this mulberry tree to pull its roots out of the ground and put them down in the sea” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	17	6	ky7z	figs-activepassive	ἐκριζώθητι καὶ φυτεύθητι ἐν τῇ θαλάσσῃ	1	Be uprooted, and be planted in the sea	If it would be clearer in your language, you could use active forms for both of these verbs. Alternate translation: “Uproot yourself and plant yourself in the sea” or “Take your roots out of the ground and put them down into the sea” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	17	6	g53n	figs-idiom	ὑπήκουσεν ἂν ὑμῖν	1	it would listen to you	The term **listen to** here is an idiom that means “obey.” Alternate translation: “the tree would obey you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

Jesus is using the question form to teach his disciples. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “But none of you who had a servant who was out plowing or tending sheep would say to him when he came in from the field, ‘Come immediately and recline to eat’!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	17	7	m120	figs-hypo	τίς δὲ ἐξ ὑμῶν δοῦλον ἔχων, ἀροτριῶντα ἢ ποιμαίνοντα, ὃς εἰσελθόντι ἐκ τοῦ ἀγροῦ ἐρεῖ αὐτῷ, εὐθέως παρελθὼν ἀνάπεσε?	1	But which of you is it, having a servant plowing or tending sheep, who will say to him, having come in from the field, ‘Come immediately and recline to eat’?	Jesus is using an illustration that involves a hypothetical situation. Alternate translation: “Suppose one of you had a servant who was out plowing or tending sheep. You would not say to him when he came in from the field, ‘Come immediately and recline to eat.’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
LUK	17	7	m121	figs-quotesinquotes	εἰσελθόντι ἐκ τοῦ ἀγροῦ ἐρεῖ αὐτῷ, εὐθέως παρελθὼν ἀνάπεσε	1	will say to him, having come in from the field, ‘Come immediately and recline to eat’	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “would tell him as soon as he came in from the field to sit right down and have his own supper” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	17	7	va34	figs-explicit	δοῦλον…ἀροτριῶντα ἢ ποιμαίνοντα	1	a servant plowing or tending sheep	It may be helpful to say explicitly that the land and sheep hypothetically belong to the person who is being asked to consider what he would do in this situation. Alternate translation: “a servant who had been out plowing your land or taking care of your sheep” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	17	7	m122	translate-unknown	ἀνάπεσε	1	recline to eat	See how you translated this in [5:29](../05/29.md). Alternate translation: “sit down to eat” or “sit down and have your supper” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	17	8	iw9j	figs-rquestion	οὐχὶ ἐρεῖ αὐτῷ, ἑτοίμασον τί δειπνήσω, καὶ περιζωσάμενος διακόνει μοι, ἕως φάγω καὶ πίω; καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα φάγεσαι καὶ πίεσαι σύ?	1	will he not say to him, ‘Prepare something I may eat, and girding yourself, serve me while I eat and drink, and after these things you will eat and drink’?	Jesus uses a second question as a further teaching tool, to emphasize how a person actually would treat a servant. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate his words as a statement. Alternate translation: “he would certainly say to him, ‘Prepare something for me to eat, and then wrap your robe around your hips so you can serve me while I eat and drink, and after that you can eat and drink yourself’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	17	8	m123	figs-quotesinquotes	οὐχὶ ἐρεῖ αὐτῷ, ἑτοίμασον τί δειπνήσω, καὶ περιζωσάμενος διακόνει μοι, ἕως φάγω καὶ πίω; καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα φάγεσαι καὶ πίεσαι σύ?	1	will he not say to him, ‘Prepare something I may eat, and girding yourself, serve me while I eat and drink, and after these things you will eat and drink’?	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “he would certainly tell the servant to prepare something for him to eat, and then to wrap his robe around his hips so he could serve him while he ate and drank, and that only after doing that the servant could eat and drink himself” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])

LUK	17	8	m124	figs-declarative	φάγεσαι καὶ πίεσαι σύ	1	you will eat and drink	The master is using a future statement to give permission. Alternate translation: “you may eat and drink” or “you may have your own supper” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative]])
LUK	17	9	qs51	figs-doublenegatives	μὴ ἔχει χάριν τῷ δούλῳ, ὅτι ἐποίησεν τὰ διαταχθέντα?	1	He does not have gratitude to the servant because he did the things commanded, does he?	The first word of this sentence in Greek is a negative word that can be used to turn a statement into a question that expects a negative answer. ULT shows this by adding, “does he?” Your language may have other ways of asking a question that expects a negative answer, for example, by changing the word order of a positive statement. Alternate translation: “Would he thank the servant for doing what he had been commanded to do?” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
LUK	17	9	m125	figs-explicit	μὴ ἔχει χάριν τῷ δούλῳ, ὅτι ἐποίησεν τὰ διαταχθέντα?	1	He does not have gratitude to the servant because he did the things commanded, does he?	The implicit answer to the question is “no.” Masters expect their servants to do what they command them. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this explicitly. Alternate translation, add an additional sentence: “No, a master would not do that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	17	9	jn5s	figs-rquestion	μὴ ἔχει χάριν τῷ δούλῳ, ὅτι ἐποίησεν τὰ διαταχθέντα?	1	He does not have gratitude to the servant because he did the things commanded, does he?	Jesus is using the question form to teach. He wants his disciples to reflect on the nature of the master-servant relationship in order to understand better how they should relate to God. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or exclamation. Alternate translation: “A master would certainly not thank a servant for doing just what he had been commanded to do!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	17	9	m126		μὴ ἔχει χάριν τῷ δούλῳ	1	he does not have gratitude to the servant	Alternate translation: “he does not need to thank the servant”
LUK	17	9	m127	figs-nominaladj	τὰ διαταχθέντα	1	the things commanded	Jesus is using a participle, which functions here as an adjective, as a noun. It is plural, and ULT supplies the noun **things** to show that. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this with an equivalent noun phrase. Alternate translation: “the things he commanded him to do” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
LUK	17	9	a1fm	figs-activepassive	τὰ διαταχθέντα	1	the things commanded	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “the things he commanded him to do” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

LUK	17	10	ub27	figs-activepassive	τὰ διαταχθέντα ὑμῖν	1	the things commanded you	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who did the action.

LUK	17	10	m129	figs-quotesinquotes	έγετε, ὅτι δοῦλοι ἀχρεῖοί ἐσμεν, ὃ ὠφείλομεν ποιῆσαι πεποιήκαμεν	1	say, ‘We are worthless servants. We have done what we ought to do	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “say that you are unworthy servants and that you have only what you ought to do” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	17	10	m130	figs-exclusive	δοῦλοι ἀχρεῖοί ἐσμεν, ὃ ὠφείλομεν ποιῆσαι πεποιήκαμεν	1	We are worthless servants. We have done what we ought to do	People who would say this would be speaking about themselves but not about God, to whom they would be speaking, so if your language distinguishes between exclusive and inclusive **we**, use the exclusive form here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
LUK	17	10	dga7	figs-hyperbole	δοῦλοι ἀχρεῖοί ἐσμεν	1	We are worthless servants	This is an exaggeration that means the servants have not done anything worthy of praise or thanks or a special reward. Alternate translation: “We are unworthy servants” or “We have not done anything while serving you that deserves special thanks” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
LUK	17	10	m132		ὃ ὠφείλομεν ποιῆσαι πεποιήκαμεν	1	We have done what we ought to do	Alternate translation: “We have only done our duty”
LUK	17	11	g442	writing-newevent	καὶ ἐγένετο	1	And it happened	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
LUK	17	11	f5rk		ἐν τῷ πορεύεσθαι εἰς Ἰερουσαλὴμ	1	in the journeying to Jerusalem	Alternate translation: “as Jesus continued his journey to Jerusalem”
LUK	17	11	m133	writing-background	αὐτὸς διήρχετο διὰ μέσον Σαμαρείας καὶ Γαλιλαίας	1	he was passing through between Samaria and Galilee	Luke provides this background information about Jesus’ location to help readers understand what happens in this episode, in which Jesus engages a group of men that includes both Jews and at least one Samaritan. Alternate translation: “Jesus was traveling along the border between Samaria and Galilee” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
LUK	17	12	d9mg	writing-participants	ἀπήντησαν δέκα λεπροὶ ἄνδρες	1	ten men who were lepers met him	Luke uses this phrase to introduce these new characters into the story. Alternate translation: “ten men who were lepers came out to meet him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
LUK	17	12	i1sc	figs-explicit	οἳ ἔστησαν πόρρωθεν	1	who stood at a distance	The **lepers** were not reluctant to engage Jesus. Rather, this was a respectful gesture, since they were not allowed to approach other people. Luke assumes that his readers will know that, but if it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate it explicitly. It may be helpful to make this a separate sentence. Alternate translation: “They stood at a distance, as they were required to do” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	17	13	l1j4	figs-idiom	αὐτοὶ ἦραν φωνὴν	1	they lifted up their voice	This idiom means that they spoke loudly. Alternate translation: “they called out in loud voices” or “they shouted out” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	17	13	m134		φωνὴν	1	their voice	If it would be unusual in your language for someone to speak as if a group of people had only one **voice**, you can use the plural form here. Alternate translation: “they called out in loud voices”
LUK	17	13	fsn5	figs-imperative	ἐλέησον ἡμᾶς	1	have mercy on us	This is an imperative, but it should be translated as a polite request, rather than as a command. It may be helpful to add an expression such as “please” to make this clear. Alternate translation: “please have mercy on us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
LUK	17	13	m135	figs-explicit	ἐλέησον ἡμᾶς	1	have mercy on us	The ten lepers assume that Jesus will know that they are specifically asking to be healed. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “please have mercy on us and heal us” or “please be merciful to us by healing us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	17	14	mrx8	figs-explicit	πορευθέντες ἐπιδείξατε ἑαυτοὺς τοῖς ἱερεῦσιν	1	Go show yourselves to the priests	People who had been lepers but who had been healed were required under the law of Moses to have the priests verify that fact. So the implication of this command is that Jesus is healing the men. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “You are healed.

LUK	17	14	m138	figs-explicit	ἐκαθαρίσθησαν	1	they were cleansed	Luke uses the term **cleansed** for the healing of these lepers because when they were healed, they were no longer ceremonially unclean. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “God healed them and so they were no longer ceremonially unclean” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	17	15	tdt1	figs-activepassive	ἰδὼν ὅτι ἰάθη	1	seeing that he had been healed	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you can say who did the action.

LUK	17	17	m140	figs-hendiadys	ἀποκριθεὶς δὲ ὁ Ἰησοῦς εἶπεν	1	Then Jesus answering said	Together the two words **answering** and **said** mean that Jesus spoke in response to the Samaritan man coming back to thank him. Alternate translation: “Jesus responded” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
LUK	17	17	hfa2	figs-explicit	ἀποκριθεὶς δὲ ὁ Ἰησοῦς εἶπεν	1	Then Jesus answering said	Jesus responded to what the man did, but he did so by speaking about the man to the group of people around him, rather than to the man directly. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “Then Jesus said to the crowd” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	17	17	m141	figs-activepassive	οὐχὶ οἱ δέκα ἐκαθαρίσθησαν?	1	Were not the ten cleansed?

LUK	17	17	cvb2	figs-rquestion	οὐχὶ οἱ δέκα ἐκαθαρίσθησαν?	1	Were not the ten cleansed?	Jesus is using the question form for emphasis, to show the people around him how surprised and disappointed he is that only one of the ten men whom he healed came back to thank and praise God. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate his words as a statement. Alternate translation: “I know that I healed ten men of their leprosy.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	17	17	w8y3	figs-rquestion	οἱ δὲ ἐννέα ποῦ?	1	But where are the nine?	Jesus is not asking the crowd to tell him where the other nine men are. He is using the question form for emphasis.

Alternate translation: “Was this foreigner the only one who returned to give glory to God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-exceptions]])
LUK	17	18	rxh9	figs-rquestion	οὐχ εὑρέθησαν ὑποστρέψαντες δοῦναι δόξαν τῷ Θεῷ, εἰ μὴ ὁ ἀλλογενὴς οὗτος?	1	Were they not found returning to give glory to God except this foreigner?	Jesus is using the question form for emphasis. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or exclamation.

LUK	17	18	m143	writing-pronouns	οὐχ εὑρέθησαν ὑποστρέψαντες	1	Were they not found returning	The word **they** refers to the lepers who were healed. Alternate translation: “Did none of the lepers I healed return” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
LUK	17	18	m144		οὐχ εὑρέθησαν ὑποστρέψαντες	1	Were they not found returning	If it would be clearer in your language, you could make the subject negative and the verb positive here. Alternate translation: “Did none of the lepers I healed return”
LUK	17	18	m145	figs-idiom	οὐχ εὑρέθησαν ὑποστρέψαντες	1	Were they not found returning	The term **found** is an idiom that means “could be found” or “was there.” Alternate translation: “Was there no one else who returned” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	17	18	x64q	figs-explicit	ὁ ἀλλογενὴς οὗτος	1	this foreigner	Samaritans had non-Jewish ancestors, and they did not worship God in the same way that the Jews did. The implication is that some of the lepers in the group were Jews, and Jesus would have expected them to return to give thanks to God. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “this foreigner, when the Jewish men should certainly have returned to thank God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	17	19	n2ce	figs-abstractnouns	ἡ πίστις σου σέσωκέν σε	1	Your faith has saved you	If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **faith** with a verb such as “believe.” Alternate translation: “Because you believed, that has saved you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
LUK	17	19	m196	figs-explicit	ἡ πίστις σου σέσωκέν σε	1	Your faith has saved you	While the word **saved** can mean “healed,” as in [7:3](../07/03.md) and [8:48](../08/48.md), that does not seem to be the meaning here. Since all ten of the lepers were healed, but only this man demonstrated that he believed, Jesus seems to be saying that beyond being healed, he received salvation through faith. Alternate translation: “Because you believed, you have received salvation” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	17	19	m146	figs-personification	ἡ πίστις σου σέσωκέν σε	1	Your faith has saved you	Jesus speaks figuratively of the leper’s **faith** as if it had actively saved him.

LUK	17	20	m150	figs-hendiadys	ἀπεκρίθη αὐτοῖς καὶ εἶπεν	1	he answered them and said	Together the two words **answered** and **said** mean that Jesus said what follows in response to the question that the Pharisees asked him.

LUK	17	21	m153	figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ, ὧδε, ἤ, ἐκεῖ	1	‘Behold, here!’ or ‘There!’	These people would be using the term **behold** to get others to focus their attention on what they were saying.

LUK	17	21	m154	figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ γὰρ	1	For behold	Jesus is using the term **behold** to get the Pharisees to focus their attention on what he is about to say. Alternate translation: “Because—listen carefully now” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	17	21	xj7z	figs-you	ἡ Βασιλεία τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐντὸς ὑμῶν ἐστιν	1	the kingdom of God is within you	This could mean one of two things. (1) Jesus could be saying that the kingdom is not coming with observable signs because it is a matter of what people believe and decide within themselves. Alternate translation: “the kingdom of God is inside of you” (2) Since the word **you** is plural here, Jesus could be saying that the kingdom is not coming with observable signs because it is a matter of something that happens within communities of people.

LUK	17	29	gp77	figs-simile	ἔβρεξεν πῦρ καὶ θεῖον ἀπ’ οὐρανοῦ	1	it rained fire and sulfur from heaven	In some languages, **rained** can mean “fell in large quantities.” If the verb for water falling from the sky does not have that extended meaning in your language, you can translate this as a simile. Alternate translation: “fire and burning sulfur fell from the sky like rain” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
LUK	17	29	skp4	figs-hyperbole	πάντας	1	them all	This does not include Lot and his family. Alternate translation: “all those who stayed in the city” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
LUK	17	30	m176		κατὰ ταὐτὰ ἔσται	1	It will be according to these things	Alternate translation: “It will be just like that”
LUK	17	30	w3uh	figs-explicit	κατὰ ταὐτὰ ἔσται	1	It will be according to these things	The implication is that people will be occupied with ordinary activities and not expecting anything out of the ordinary to happen. Alternate translation: “In the same way, people will not be ready” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	17	30	m177	figs-idiom	ᾗ ἡμέρᾳ	1	in the day	Jesus is using the term **day** figuratively to refer a specific time. Alternate translation: “at the time when” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	17	30	v9ki	figs-activepassive	ὁ Υἱὸς τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου ἀποκαλύπτεται	1	the Son of Man is revealed	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “the Son of Man appears” or “the Son of man returns” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	17	30	pfe1	figs-123person	ὁ Υἱὸς τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου	1	the Son of Man	Jesus is speaking about himself in the third person. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this in the first person. Alternate translation: “I, the Son of Man” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
LUK	17	30	m178	figs-explicit	ὁ Υἱὸς τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου	1	the Son of Man	See how you translated the title **Son of Man** in [5:24](../05/24.md). Alternate translation: “I, the Messiah” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	17	31	m179	figs-idiom	ἐν ἐκείνῃ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ	1	In that day	Jesus is using the term **day** figuratively to refer a specific time. Alternate translation: “At that time” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	17	31	i9eq	figs-hypo	ὃς ἔσται ἐπὶ τοῦ δώματος, καὶ τὰ σκεύη αὐτοῦ ἐν τῇ οἰκίᾳ, μὴ καταβάτω ἆραι αὐτά	1	whoever is on the housetop and his goods are in the house, let him not go down to take them away	Jesus is speaking of a hypothetical situation that might occur at this time. Alternate translation: “Suppose someone is doing something on the roof of his house. Then he should not go inside to get his valuables” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
LUK	17	31	ep81	translate-unknown	ἐπὶ τοῦ δώματος	1	on the housetop	In this culture, housetops were flat and people could go up onto them without being in danger of sliding off. Housetops were used for a variety of purposes, such as storing and ripening grain and fruit, sleeping in hot weather, and gathering in a large open space. If housetops or roofs are different in your culture and your readers would not understand that Jesus is speaking of someone doing an ordinary activity, you could use a general expression in your translation. Alternate translation: “doing something outside the house” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	17	31	jj9c		τὰ σκεύη αὐτοῦ	1	his goods	Alternate translation: “his possessions” or “his valuables”
LUK	17	31	m180	figs-explicit	μὴ καταβάτω ἆραι αὐτά	1	let him not go down to take them away	The implication is that people should flee immediately without even taking the time to secure their valuables. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “he should flee immediately, without going inside to get his valuables” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	17	31	m181	figs-hypo	καὶ ὁ ἐν ἀγρῷ, ὁμοίως ἐπιστρεψάτω εἰς τὰ ὀπίσω	1	and the one in the field, likewise let him not turn to the things behind	Jesus is speaking of a hypothetical situation that might occur at this time. Alternate translation: “Suppose someone is out working in the field. Then he too should not go back into the house for anything” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
LUK	17	31	suh5	figs-explicit	ἐπιστρεψάτω εἰς τὰ ὀπίσω	1	let him not turn to the things behind	The implication once again is that people should flee immediately without even taking the time to secure their valuables. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “he should flee immediately, without going back to the house to get his valuables” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	17	32	fz8m	figs-explicit	μνημονεύετε τῆς γυναικὸς Λώτ	1	Remember the wife of Lot	Jesus assumes that his disciples will know that Lot’s **wife** looked back toward Sodom and that God punished her along with the people of Sodom. Alternate translation: “Remember what happened to Lot’s wife when she looked back toward Sodom” or “Do not do what Lot’s wife did and wish you were back among people whom God is punishing” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	17	32	m182	translate-names	Λώτ	1	Lot	This is the name of a man. See how you translated it in [17:28](../17/28.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	17	33	d9fl		ὃς ἐὰν ζητήσῃ τὴν ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ περιποιήσασθαι, ἀπολέσει αὐτήν	1	Whoever seeks to keep his life will lose it	Alternate translation: “Whoever tries to save his old way of living will lose his life”
LUK	17	33	kvw6		ὃς δ’ ἂν ἀπολέσει, ζῳογονήσει αὐτήν	1	but whoever will lose it will preserve it	Alternate translation: “but whoever gives up his old way of living will save his life”
LUK	17	34	p84l		λέγω ὑμῖν	1	I say to you	Jesus says this to emphasize what he is about to tell his disciples. Alternate translation: “Now listen carefully”
LUK	17	34	j3b6	figs-hypo	ταύτῃ τῇ νυκτὶ ἔσονται δύο ἐπὶ κλίνης μιᾶς	1	in that night there will be two in one bed	Jesus is speaking of a hypothetical situation that might occur at this time. It may be helpful to make this a separate sentence. Alternate translation: “Suppose this were to happen at night, and suppose there were two people sleeping in the same bed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
LUK	17	34	at99	translate-unknown	ἐπὶ κλίνης μιᾶς	1	in one bed	If your readers would not be familiar with what a **bed** is, you could use the name of the sleeping furniture that people in your own culture use, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “on one mat” or “side by side” or “in the same place” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	17	34	e9hj	figs-activepassive	ὁ εἷς παραλημφθήσεται, καὶ ὁ ἕτερος ἀφεθήσεται	1	The one will be taken and the other will be left	If it would be clearer in your language, you could use active forms for both of these verbs, and you can say who would do the actions. This could mean one of two things. (1) The person who is **taken** may be one whom God takes out of a situation in which they would be destroyed, as God brought Lot out of Sodom, and the person who is **left** may be one who remains in a situation where they will be destroyed, like the people who remained in Sodom. That is the interpretation of UST. Alternate translation: “God will spare one of them but destroy the other” (2) In the parallel to this passage in the gospel of Matthew, Jesus says that the people living in Noah’s time “knew nothing until the flood came and took them all away” (Matthew 24:39 ULT). So the person who is **taken** may actually be one whom God destroys, and the one who is **left** may be one whom God spares and allows to remain alive. Alternate translation: “God will destroy one of them but spare the other” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	17	34	m183	figs-hypo	ὁ εἷς παραλημφθήσεται	1	The one will be taken	If you translated the first sentence in this verse as the condition of a hypothetical situation, translate this sentence as the result of that condition. Alternate translation: “Then one of them will be taken” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
LUK	17	35	il9v	figs-hypo	ἔσονται δύο ἀλήθουσαι ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτό	1	There will be two grinding together	Jesus is speaking of a hypothetical situation that might occur at this time. It may be helpful to make this a separate sentence. Alternate translation: “Suppose that when this happens, two women are grinding grain together” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
LUK	17	35	m184		δύο	1	two	The verb is feminine, so this means “two women.” (In [17:34](../17/34.md) and [17:36](../17/36.md), grammatically masculine forms are used, but conventionally in Greek that means that the people are not known to be all women, they could be men or women, so a general term such as “people” would be appropriate in those verses.) Alternate translation: “two women”
LUK	17	35	t4zn	translate-unknown	ἀλήθουσαι	1	grinding	This refers to the process of breaking up grain into very small pieces so that it can be used for cooking. If your readers would not be familiar with grain, you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “grinding grain” or “preparing food” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	17	35	m185	figs-activepassive	ἡ μία παραλημφθήσεται, ἡ δὲ ἑτέρα ἀφεθήσεται	1	The one will be taken, but the other will be left	If it would be clearer in your language, you could use active forms for both of these verbs, and you can say who would do the actions. See how you decided to translate this in [17:34](../17/34.md). Alternate translation: “God will spare one of them but destroy the other” or “God will destroy one of them but spare the other” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	17	35	m186	figs-hypo	ἡ μία παραλημφθήσεται	1	The one will be taken	If you translated the first sentence in this verse as the condition of a hypothetical situation, translate this sentence as the result of that condition. Alternate translation: “Then one of them will be taken” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
LUK	17	36	m187	translate-textvariants	δύο ἐν ἀγρῷ εἰς παραληφθήσεται καὶ ὁ ἕτερος ἀφεθήσεται	1	There will be two in the field; one will be taken and the other will be left	See the discussion of textual issues at the end of the General Notes to this chapter to decide whether to include this verse in your translation. The notes below discuss translation issues in the verse, for those who decide to include it. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
LUK	17	36	m188	figs-hypo	δύο ἐν ἀγρῷ	1	There will be two in the field	Jesus is speaking of a hypothetical situation that might occur at this time. It may be helpful to make this a separate sentence. Alternate translation: “Suppose that when this happens, two people are out working in a field (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
LUK	17	36	m189	figs-activepassive	εἰς παραληφθήσεται καὶ ὁ ἕτερος ἀφεθήσεται	1	one will be taken and the other will be left	If it would be clearer in your language, you could use active forms for both of these verbs, and you can say who would do the actions. See how you decided to translate this in [17:34](../17/34.md). Alternate translation: “God will spare one of them but destroy the other” or “God will destroy one of them but spare the other” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	17	36	m190	figs-hypo	εἰς παραληφθήσεται	1	one will be taken	If you translated the beginning of this verse as the condition of a hypothetical situation, translate as the result of that condition, as a separate sentence. Alternate translation: “Then one of them will be taken” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
LUK	17	37	m191		ἀποκριθέντες λέγουσιν αὐτῷ	1	answering they say to him	To convey the vividness and immediacy of the disciples’ question, Luke uses the present tense in past narration here. See how you decided to approach this usage in [7:40](../07/40.md). If it would not be natural to use the present tense in your language, you can use the past tense in your translation. Alternate translation: “the disciples responded to him”
LUK	17	37	m192	figs-hendiadys	ἀποκριθέντες λέγουσιν αὐτῷ	1	answering they say to him	Together the two words **answering** and **say** mean that the disciples responded to what Jesus had been telling them by asking him a question about it. Alternate translation: “the disciples responded to him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
LUK	17	37	wmg6	figs-explicit	ποῦ, Κύριε	1	Where, Lord	The implication is that the disciples are asking where the things that Jesus has been describing will happen. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “Lord, where will these things happen” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	17	37	fen1	writing-proverbs	ὅπου τὸ σῶμα, ἐκεῖ καὶ οἱ ἀετοὶ ἐπισυναχθήσονται	1	Where the body is, there also the vultures will be gathered together	Jesus may be quoting a popular proverb of the time. Alternate translation: “The location will be obvious from the things that you see happening there” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-proverbs]])
LUK	17	37	m193	figs-metaphor	ὅπου τὸ σῶμα, ἐκεῖ καὶ οἱ ἀετοὶ ἐπισυναχθήσονται	1	Where the body is, there also the vultures will be gathered together	In this proverb, **the body** and **the vultures** are figurative. If you would like present the same image to your readers but your language does not use metaphors, you could express this as a simile. Alternate translation: “Just as vultures gather where there is a dead body, so the things I have described will indicate where this is about to happen” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	17	37	m6ca	translate-unknown	οἱ ἀετοὶ	1	the vultures	The word **vultures** describes large birds that travel in flocks and eat the flesh of dead animals that they find. If your readers would not be familiar with **vultures**, you could use the name of similar birds in your area, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “the scavenger birds” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	17	37	m194	figs-activepassive	ἐπισυναχθήσονται	1	will be gathered together	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “will flock together” or “will assemble” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	18	intro	v92v			0		# Luke 18 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>1. Jesus tells a parable about a widow and a judge (18:1–8)<br>2. Jesus tells a parable about a Pharisee and a tax collector (18:9–14)<br>3. Jesus blesses little children (18:15–17)<br>4. Jesus teaches about wealth and the kingdom of God (18:18–30)<br>5. Jesus warns about his impending death (18:31–34)<br>6. Jesus heals a blind man in Jericho (18:35–43)<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Judges<br><br>People expected judges always to do what God said was right and to make sure that other people did what was right. But some judges did not care about doing right or making sure others did right. Jesus called this kind of judge “unjust.” (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/justice]])<br><br>### Pharisees and tax collectors<br><br>The Pharisees thought that they themselves were the best examples of righteous good people, and they thought that tax collectors were the most unrighteous sinners. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])<br><br>## Important textual issues in this chapter<br><br>### “that he had become sad”<br><br>At the beginning of 18:24, in the story of the ruler who asked Jesus how he could have eternal life, some ancient manuscripts of the Bible say that Jesus saw “that he had become sad.” However, the ancient manuscripts considered to be the most accurate do not have that phrase. They say simply that Jesus looked at him. ULT does not have the phrase in its text, but it does have it in a footnote. UST represents the phrase in its text.<br><br>### “we have left everything”<br><br>In 18:28, in some ancient manuscripts of the Bible, Peter says that the disciples have left “everything” to follow Jesus. In other manuscripts, the expression is “our own possessions.” ULT says “everything” in its text, but it acknowledges the possibility “our own possessions” in a footnote. UST, expanding on the meaning of “everything,” accommodates both possibilities by saying “everything we had.”<br><br>In each of these cases, if a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to follow its reading. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to follow the example of ULT, or you may wish to offer a reading like the one in UST.

LUK	18	1	r26t	figs-parables	ἔλεγεν δὲ παραβολὴν αὐτοῖς, πρὸς τὸ	1	Then he spoke a parable to them to show that	Alternate translation: “Then Jesus told his disciples this story to help them understand that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])
LUK	18	2	l2qr		λέγων	1	saying	If it would be clearer in your language, you could begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “He said”
LUK	18	2	ph5w	writing-participants	κριτής τις ἦν ἔν τινι πόλει	1	In a certain city there was a certain judge	Jesus uses this phrase to introduce one of the main characters in this parable. Alternate translation: “There once was a judge who lived in a certain city” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
LUK	18	2	d77j	writing-background	τὸν Θεὸν μὴ φοβούμενος καὶ ἄνθρωπον μὴ ἐντρεπόμενος	1	not fearing God and not respecting men	Jesus provides this background information about the **judge** to help his disciples understand what happens in the story. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “He did not make his decisions based on what God wanted or on what other people thought” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
LUK	18	2	m195	figs-gendernotations	ἄνθρωπον	1	men	Jesus is using the term **men** here in a generic sense that includes all people. Alternate translation: “other people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
LUK	18	3	ie2v	writing-participants	χήρα δὲ ἦν ἐν τῇ πόλει ἐκείνῃ	1	And there was a widow in that city	Jesus uses this phrase to introduce the other main character into the story. Alternate translation: “There was also a woman who lived in that city whose husband had died” See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
LUK	18	3	jhk6	figs-explicit	χήρα	1	a widow	A widow is a woman whose husband has died and who has not remarried. Jesus assumes that his disciples will know that in this culture, she would have had no one to protect her from anyone who was trying to take advantage of her. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “a woman whose husband had died, and so she had no one to protect her” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	18	3	xfg3		ἤρχετο πρὸς αὐτὸν	1	she was coming to him	The Greek verb here indicates repeated or continual action. Alternate translation: “she kept coming to the judge”
LUK	18	3	m131	figs-quotesinquotes	λέγουσα, ἐκδίκησόν με ἀπὸ τοῦ ἀντιδίκου μου	1	saying, ‘Vindicate me against my opponent’	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “and asking him to make a fair ruling in her case against her opponent” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	18	3	kj2l	figs-imperative	ἐκδίκησόν με ἀπὸ τοῦ ἀντιδίκου μου	1	Vindicate me against my opponent	This is an imperative, but since the woman is not in a position to make a demand, it should be translated as a polite request, rather than as a command. It may be helpful to add an expression such as “please” to make this clear. Alternate translation: “Please give me a fair ruling in my case against my opponent” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
LUK	18	3	xc7k	translate-unknown	τοῦ ἀντιδίκου μου	1	my opponent	This term refers specifically to the opposing party in a lawsuit. It is not clear whether the widow is suing the man to protect her interests, or the man is suing the widow to try to take things from her unfairly. If your language has a specific term for a legal adversary, you can use it here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	18	4	m197		μετὰ ταῦτα	1	after these things	Alternate translation: “later on” or “eventually”
LUK	18	4	m198	figs-quotesinquotes	εἶπεν ἐν ἑαυτῷ, εἰ καὶ τὸν Θεὸν οὐ φοβοῦμαι οὐδὲ ἄνθρωπον ἐντρέπομαι	1	he said to himself, ‘Even if I do not fear God or respect man’	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “he decided that even though he did not make his decisions based on what God wanted or on what other people thought” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	18	4	m199	grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἰ καὶ τὸν Θεὸν οὐ φοβοῦμαι οὐδὲ ἄνθρωπον ἐντρέπομαι	1	Even if I do not fear God or respect man	The judge speaks as if this were a hypothetical possibility, but he means that it is actually true. If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, and if your readers might misunderstand and think that what the judge is saying is not actually the case, then you can translate his words as an affirmative statement. Alternate translation: “Even though I do not make my decisions based on what God wants or on what other people think” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
LUK	18	4	bh3q	figs-gendernotations	ἄνθρωπον	1	men	The judge is using the term **men** here in a generic sense that includes all people. Alternate translation: “other people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
LUK	18	5	m200	figs-quotesinquotes	διά γε τὸ παρέχειν μοι κόπον τὴν χήραν ταύτην, ἐκδικήσω αὐτήν, ἵνα μὴ εἰς τέλος ἐρχομένη ὑπωπιάζῃ με	1	yet because this widow causes me trouble, I will vindicate her, so that she will not beat me up by coming to the end	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation (continuing the sentence from the previous verse): “because this widow bothered him, he would give a fair ruling in her case, so that she would not wear him out by coming incessantly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	18	5	v9uu		παρέχειν μοι κόπον	1	causes me trouble	Alternate translation: “bothers me”
LUK	18	5	cf4e	figs-metaphor	ὑπωπιάζῃ με	1	beat me up	The judge speaks figuratively of the wearying effect of the widow’s constant pleas as if they were physically pummeling him. Alternate translation: “wear me out” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	18	5	ub29	figs-idiom	εἰς τέλος ἐρχομένη	1	by coming to the end	The expression **to the end** is an idiom that means “perpetually” or “forever.” Alternate translation: “by coming to me incessantly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	18	6	m201		ὁ Κύριος	1	the Lord	Luke refers to Jesus here by a respectful title. Alternate translation: “Jesus” or “the Lord Jesus”
LUK	18	6	t9mg	figs-idiom	ἀκούσατε τί ὁ κριτὴς τῆς ἀδικίας λέγει	1	Listen to what the unrighteous judge says	The term **listen to** is an idiom here that means “think about.” Jesus says this to get his disciples to reflect on what the judge said at the end of the parable. He is not introducing a further statement from the judge. Translate this in such a way that your readers will understand that Jesus has already related what the judge said. Alternate translation: “Think about what the unjust judge said” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	18	7	t1sk	figs-rquestion	ὁ δὲ Θεὸς οὐ μὴ ποιήσῃ τὴν ἐκδίκησιν τῶν ἐκλεκτῶν αὐτοῦ	1	And will not God do the vindication of his elect	Jesus is using the question form for emphasis as he teaches his disciples. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate his words as a statement. Alternate translation: “Now God will certainly answer the prayers of the people he has chosen” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	18	7	e2lv	figs-explicit	ὁ δὲ Θεὸς οὐ μὴ ποιήσῃ τὴν ἐκδίκησιν τῶν ἐκλεκτῶν αὐτοῦ	1	And will not God do the vindication of his elect	Jesus is drawing an implicit comparison between the unrighteous human judge and **God**, who is the perfectly righteous divine judge. The implication is that if even the human judge would ensure justice for someone who persevered in pleading for it, God would certainly do so. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “If an unrighteous human judge would ensure justice for someone who persevered in pleading for it, God will certainly answer the prayers of the people he has chosen” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	18	7	m202	figs-merism	τῶν βοώντων αὐτῷ ἡμέρας καὶ νυκτός	1	the ones crying out to him day and night	Jesus is using the phrase **day and night** figuratively to describe all of time, by referring to its two components. Alternate translation: “who pray to him all the time” or “who ask him for help continually” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
LUK	18	7	ljb4	figs-idiom	καὶ μακροθυμεῖ ἐπ’ αὐτοῖς	1	and he delays long over them	Jesus may be using the word **and** here in an idiomatic sense to mean “even if.” (UST offers another possible interpretation of this phrase.) Alternate translation: “even if he takes a long time to answer their prayers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	18	8	m203		λέγω ὑμῖν	1	I say to you	Jesus says this to emphasize what he is about to tell his disciples. Alternate translation: “I can assure you”
LUK	18	8	m204	figs-explicit	ποιήσει τὴν ἐκδίκησιν αὐτῶν ἐν τάχει	1	he will do the vindication of them quickly	The point of the parable and of this teaching is that people should continue to pray even if God does not answer right away. So this statement might seem contradictory, since it suggests that God will answer right away. The implication may be that God is concerned for his people and will begin to act immediately to help them, even if his actions do not become apparent for some time. If you think your readers would be puzzled or troubled by the apparent contradiction, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “he will start to answer their prayers right away” or “he will begin to send them help right away” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	18	8	zi1f	figs-rquestion	πλὴν ὁ Υἱὸς τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου ἐλθὼν, ἆρα εὑρήσει τὴν πίστιν ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς?	1	Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will he indeed find faith on the earth?	Jesus is using the question form as a teaching tool. This particular question uses a word that anticipates a negative answer. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this as a statement. Alternate translation: “Nevertheless, it is doubtful that the Son of Man will find faith on the earth when he returns.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	18	8	m205	figs-explicit	πλὴν	1	Nevertheless	The reference of this word is implied in the context. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could make it explicit. Alternate translation: “Even though God readily answers prayer” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	18	8	inw3	figs-123person	ὁ Υἱὸς τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου	1	the Son of Man	Jesus is speaking about himself in the third person. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this in the first person. Alternate translation: “I, the Son of Man” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
LUK	18	8	m206	figs-explicit	ὁ Υἱὸς τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου	1	the Son of Man	See how you translated the title **Son of Man** in [5:24](../05/24.md). Alternate translation: “I, the Messiah” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	18	8	m207	figs-explicit	τὴν πίστιν	1	faith	When Jesus asks whether he will find **faith** on the earth, he may be referring implicitly to the kind of persevering trust in God that would lead a person to continue praying even when the answer was delayed. (UST offers another possible interpretation of this word.) Alternate translation: “this kind of persevering faith” or “this kind of persevering trust in God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	18	9	n2b5	figs-parables	εἶπεν δὲ καὶ πρός τινας…τὴν παραβολὴν ταύτην	1	Then he also spoke this parable to some	Jesus now tells a brief story to correct some wrong attitudes that he realized certain people had. The story is designed teach something that is true in a way that is easy to understand and remember. Alternate translation: “Then Jesus told this story to correct certain people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])
LUK	18	9	pmp1	writing-participants	πρός τινας	1	to some	Luke uses this phrase to introduce some new characters, but he does not say specifically who these people were. (The story that Jesus tells suggests that they may have been Pharisees.) Alternate translation: “to some people who were there” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
LUK	18	9	b6zy		τοὺς πεποιθότας ἐφ’ ἑαυτοῖς ὅτι εἰσὶν δίκαιοι	1	who were persuaded in themselves that they were righteous	Alternate translation: “who had convinced themselves that they were righteous” or “who considered themselves to be righteous”

LUK	18	10	m208	writing-participants	ἄνθρωποι δύο	1	Two men	Jesus uses this phrase to introduce the characters in this parable. Alternate translation: “Once there were two men” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
LUK	18	10	m209	figs-idiom	ἀνέβησαν εἰς τὸ ἱερὸν προσεύξασθαι	1	went up to the temple to pray	When Jesus says that these men **went up**, he likely means that they traveled to Jerusalem. That was the customary way of speaking about going there, since the city was up on a mountain. Alternate translation: “who went to pray in the temple courtyard” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	18	10	qp39	figs-synecdoche	εἰς τὸ ἱερὸν	1	to the temple	Since only priests could enter the **temple** building, this means the **temple** courtyard. Jesus is using the word for the entire building to refer to one part of it. Alternate translation: “in the temple courtyard” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
LUK	18	10	m210	writing-background	ὁ εἷς Φαρισαῖος καὶ ὁ ἕτερος τελώνης	1	the one a Pharisee, and the other a tax collector	Jesus provides this background information to help his listeners understand what happens in the story. It may be helpful to make this a separate sentence. Alternate translation: “Now one of these men was a Pharisee, and the other man was a tax collector” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
LUK	18	11	mi9g	figs-quotesinquotes	ταῦτα πρὸς ἑαυτὸν προσηύχετο, ὁ Θεός, εὐχαριστῶ σοι ὅτι οὐκ εἰμὶ ὥσπερ οἱ λοιποὶ τῶν ἀνθρώπων, ἅρπαγες, ἄδικοι, μοιχοί, ἢ καὶ ὡς οὗτος ὁ τελώνης	1	was praying these things about himself, ‘God, I thank you that I am not like the rest of men—robbers, unrighteous, adulterers—or even like this tax collector	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “prayed about himself and thanked God that he was not like other people, who were robbers, unrighteous, and adulterers, or even like the tax collector who was there” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	18	11	m211	figs-youformal	εὐχαριστῶ σοι	1	I thank you	The word **you** is singular here because the Pharisee is addressing God. If your language has a formal form of **you** that it uses to address a superior respectfully, you may wish to use that form here. Alternatively, it might be effective to show this man addressing God using a familiar form, as if he could presume on God’s friendship and approval. Use your best judgment about what form to use. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youformal]])
LUK	18	11	m212	figs-gendernotations	οἱ λοιποὶ τῶν ἀνθρώπων	1	the rest of men	The Pharisee is using the term **men** here in a generic sense that includes all people. Alternate translation: “other people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
LUK	18	11	lud3	translate-unknown	ἅρπαγες	1	robbers	The word **robbers** describes people who steal from other people by forcing them to give things to them. Your language may have a specific term for this kind of person. Alternate translation: “bandits” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	18	11	m213	figs-nominaladj	ἄδικοι	1	unrighteous	The Pharisee is using the adjective **unrighteous** as a noun, to describe a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this with an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “evildoers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
LUK	18	11	z78w	figs-explicit	ἢ καὶ ὡς οὗτος ὁ τελώνης	1	or even like this tax collector	The Pharisees believed that any **tax collector** would be dishonest and cheat others, and so as a group they were as sinful as robbers, unrighteous people, and adulterers. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly, as UST does. Alternate translation: “and I am certainly not like this sinful tax collector who cheats people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	18	12	m214	figs-quotesinquotes	νηστεύω δὶς τοῦ σαββάτου; ἀποδεκατεύω πάντα, ὅσα κτῶμαι	1	I fast twice a week. I tithe all that I acquire	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “He boasted that he fasted twice a week and that he gave ten percent of all his income to God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	18	12	ru63	figs-idiom	ἀποδεκατεύω πάντα ὅσα κτῶμαι	1	I tithe all that I acquire	To **tithe** means to give ten percent of one’s income to God, as required in the law of Moses. Alternate translation: “I give you ten percent of all my income” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	18	13	c37t	translate-symaction	ὁ δὲ τελώνης μακρόθεν ἑστὼς	1	But the tax collector, standing at a distance	This was a sign of humility. The **tax collector** did not feel worthy to be near the Pharisee and the other people in the temple courtyard. It may be helpful to make each of the phrases in this verse a separate sentence. Alternate translation: “But the tax collector humbly stood by himself, away from the other people who were there” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
LUK	18	13	qtt7	figs-idiom	οὐκ ἤθελεν οὐδὲ τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς ἐπᾶραι εἰς τὸν οὐρανόν	1	not even willing to lift his eyes toward heaven	The phrase **lift his eyes** means to look at something. Alternate translation: “He did not even want to look up toward heaven” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	18	13	m215	figs-explicit	εἰς τὸν οὐρανόν	1	toward heaven	See how you translated the similar expression in [9:16](../09/16.md). Alternate translation: “beyond the sky towards God in heaven” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	18	13	c7x7	translate-symaction	ἀλλ’ ἔτυπτε τὸ στῆθος αὐτοῦ	1	but was beating his breast	This was a physical expression of great sorrow, and it showed this man’s repentance and humility. Alternate translation: “Instead, he hit his chest to demonstrate his shame and sorrow over his sins” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
LUK	18	13	m216	figs-quotesinquotes	λέγων, ὁ Θεός, ἱλάσθητί μοι, τῷ ἁμαρτωλῷ	1	saying, ‘God, have mercy on me, the sinner’	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “He admitted that he was a sinner and asked God to have mercy on him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	18	13	mx5p	figs-imperative	ὁ Θεός, ἱλάσθητί μοι, τῷ ἁμαρτωλῷ	1	God, have mercy on me, the sinner	This is an imperative, but it should be translated as a polite request, rather than as a command. It may be helpful to add an expression such as “please” to make this clear. Alternate translation: “God, please be merciful to me, I confess that I am a sinner” or “God, please forgive me, even though I have committed many sins” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
LUK	18	14	m217		λέγω ὑμῖν	1	I say to you	Jesus says this to emphasize what he is about to tell his disciples. Alternate translation: “Now listen carefully”

LUK	18	14	m219	figs-activepassive	κατέβη οὗτος δεδικαιωμένος εἰς τὸν οἶκον αὐτοῦ	1	this one went down to his house justified	If it would be clearer in your language, you could use an active verbal form in place of the passive form **justified**. Alternate translation: “the tax collector was right with God when he went home” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	18	14	s1yr	figs-explicit	κατέβη οὗτος δεδικαιωμένος εἰς τὸν οἶκον αὐτοῦ	1	this one went down to his house justified	The implication is that the tax collector was right with God because God forgave his sin when he prayed humbly and repentantly. Alternate translation: “the tax collector was right with God when he went home, because God forgave his sin” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	18	14	m220	figs-idiom	κατέβη…εἰς τὸν οἶκον αὐτοῦ	1	went down to his house	When Jesus says that this man **went down** to his house, he likely means that he returned home from Jerusalem, since the city was up on a mountain. Alternate translation: “returned to his home” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	18	14	qrg3	figs-explicit	παρ’ ἐκεῖνον	1	rather than that one	The implication is that the Pharisee was not right with God. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “but the Pharisee was not right with God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

LUK	18	14	uuc5	figs-activepassive	ὑψωθήσεται	1	will be exalted	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who will do the action. Alternate translation: “God will honor” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	18	14	m221	figs-metaphor	ὑψωθήσεται	1	will be exalted	Jesus is using a spatial metaphor to describe someone who is honored as if he were high up. Alternate translation: “God will honor” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	18	15	m260	grammar-connect-time-background	δὲ	1	And	Luke uses this word to begin relating a new event by introducing background information that will help readers understand what happens. Alternate translation: “Now” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background]])
LUK	18	15	abcm	writing-pronouns	προσέφερον…αὐτῷ καὶ τὰ βρέφη	1	they were bringing even the infants to him	The word **they** here refers to people in general.

LUK	18	15	m222	translate-symaction	ἵνα αὐτῶν ἅπτηται	1	so that he might touch them	If Jesus would **touch** the babies, this would express God’s love for them and convey God’s blessing to them.

Alternate translation: “Allow these children to come to me, and do not ever forbid children to come” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-verbs]])
LUK	18	16	u7sq	figs-simile	τῶν…τοιούτων ἐστὶν ἡ Βασιλεία τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	of such is the kingdom of God	It becomes clear in [18:17](../18/17.md) that this is simile. You could express it as one here. Alternate translation: “the kingdom of God consists of people who are like these little children” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
LUK	18	16	m223	figs-abstractnouns	τῶν…τοιούτων ἐστὶν ἡ Βασιλεία τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	of such is the kingdom of God	See how you decided to translate the phrase **the kingdom of God** in [4:43](../04/43.md). If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **kingdom** with a verb such as “rule.” Alternate translation: “people who are like children will let God rule their lives” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
LUK	18	17	p5lq		ἀμὴν, λέγω ὑμῖν	1	Truly I say to you	Jesus says this to emphasize what he is about to say. Alternate translation: “Now listen to this carefully”

LUK	18	18	a5qz	writing-participants	καὶ ἐπηρώτησέν τις αὐτὸν ἄρχων	1	And a certain ruler asked him	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new character into the story.

LUK	18	18	d6kf		τί ποιήσας	1	doing what	Alternate translation: “what do I need to do” or “what does God require of me”
LUK	18	18	xrs8	figs-metaphor	κληρονομήσω	1	will I inherit	The ruler is using the term **inherit** figuratively to mean coming into possession of something. Alternate translation: “will I receive” or “will I obtain” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	18	19	fxi2	figs-rquestion	τί με λέγεις ἀγαθόν? οὐδεὶς ἀγαθὸς, εἰ μὴ εἷς ὁ Θεός	1	Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone	Jesus is using the question form as a teaching tool. He is not asking the ruler to explain why he used this term. Jesus is also not denying that he is God. Rather, he is challenging the ruler to reflect on whether, in light of God’s holiness, he should consider any human being to be **good**. The ruler apparently considers Jesus to be a **good** human being, and he wants to know how he can be **good** enough himself to earn God’s approval. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate Jesus’ words as a statement, and it may be helpful to combine that statement with the next sentence in the verse. Alternate translation: “You should not consider any human being to be good, since no one is good except God alone” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	18	20	m226	figs-explicit	τὰς ἐντολὰς οἶδας	1	You know the commandments	The implication is that Jesus is saying this in response to the ruler’s question.

That is what UST does. However, if you do not wish to have a quotation within a quotation in your translation, you could represent these commandments as an indirect quotation. That is what ULT does. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
LUK	18	20	m261	figs-youcrowd	σου	1	your	Jesus is reciting these commandments from the Scriptures, and the word **your** is singular because that is the way Moses spoke the commandments, since even though he gave them to the Israelites as a group, each individual person was supposed to obey them. So in your translation, it would be appropriate to use the singular form of **your**. The implied **you** in the imperative verbs would also be singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd]])
LUK	18	21	m5qf	figs-abstractnouns	ταῦτα πάντα ἐφύλαξα ἐκ νεότητος μου	1	All these things I have kept from my youth	If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **youth** with an adjective such as “young.” Alternate translation: “I have obeyed all of these commandments ever since I was young” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
LUK	18	22	e8il		ἀκούσας δὲ ὁ Ἰησοῦς εἶπεν αὐτῷ	1	But Jesus, hearing, said to him	Alternate translation: “When Jesus heard the ruler say that, he responded”

LUK	18	22	d3ar		πάντα ὅσα ἔχεις, πώλησον	1	Sell all that you have	Alternate translation: “Sell all your possessions” or “Sell everything that you own”
LUK	18	22	c4s5	figs-nominaladj	πτωχοῖς	1	distribute to the poor	Jesus is using the adjective **poor** as a noun, to refer to a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “give away the money to people who are poor” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
LUK	18	22	hy6a	figs-metaphor	δεῦρο, ἀκολούθει μοι	1	come, follow me	As in [5:27](../05/27.md), to **follow** Jesus means to be one of his disciples. Alternate translation: “come with me as my disciple” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	18	23	m228		ὁ δὲ ἀκούσας ταῦτα	1	But he, hearing these things	Alternate translation: “But when the ruler heard what Jesus said”
LUK	18	24	m229	translate-textvariants	ἰδὼν δὲ αὐτὸν ὁ Ἰησοῦς	1	Then Jesus, looking at him	Many manuscripts have two additional Greek words here, so that this says, “Then Jesus, seeing him having become sad.” See the discussion of textual issues at the end of the General Notes to this chapter to decide whether to represent those words in your translation. Alternate translation (if you choose to represent them): “Then Jesus, noticing how sad the ruler had become” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
LUK	18	24	qcm7	figs-exclamations	πῶς δυσκόλως οἱ τὰ χρήματα ἔχοντες, εἰς τὴν Βασιλείαν τοῦ Θεοῦ εἰσπορεύονται	1	How difficultly those who have riches are entering into the kingdom of God	This is an exclamation, not a question. Alternate translation: “It is so very difficult for those who are rich to enter the kingdom of God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations]])
LUK	18	24	m230	figs-abstractnouns	πῶς δυσκόλως οἱ τὰ χρήματα ἔχοντες, εἰς τὴν Βασιλείαν τοῦ Θεοῦ εἰσπορεύονται	1	How difficultly those who have riches are entering into the kingdom of God	See how you decided to translate the phrase **the kingdom of God** in [4:43](../04/43.md). If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **kingdom** with a verb such as “rule.” Alternate translation: “It is so very difficult for those who are rich to allow God to rule their lives” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
LUK	18	25	hdz1	figs-hyperbole	εὐκοπώτερον γάρ ἐστιν κάμηλον διὰ τρήματος βελόνης εἰσελθεῖν ἢ	1	it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for	It is impossible for **a camel** to fit through **the eye of a needle** Jesus is using an exaggeration to express how difficult it is for a rich person to enter God’s kingdom. Alternate translation: “it is extremely difficult for” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
LUK	18	25	m231	translate-unknown	κάμηλον	1	camel	A **camel** is a large animal that was used in this culture to transport people and goods. If your readers would not know what a **camel** is, you could use the name of a similar animal that they would recognize, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “a huge beast of burden” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	18	25	j7x3	translate-unknown	τρήματος βελόνης	1	the eye of a needle	The **eye of a needle** is the hole in a sewing needle through which the thread is passed. If your language has an expression of its own that describes this hole, you can use it in your translation. Otherwise, you can use a general expression. Alternate translation: “the tiny hole for thread in a needle” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	18	25	m232	figs-abstractnouns	εἰς τὴν Βασιλείαν τοῦ Θεοῦ εἰσελθεῖν	1	to enter into the kingdom of God	See how you translated this phrase in [18:24](../18/24.md). Alternate translation: “to allow God to rule his life” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

LUK	18	26	vu3z	figs-rquestion	καὶ τίς δύναται σωθῆναι?	1	And who is able to be saved?	It is possible that these people were asking for an answer.

If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this as a statement or exclamation. Alternate translation: “Then no one can be saved!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	18	26	m233	figs-activepassive	καὶ τίς δύναται σωθῆναι?	1	And who is able to be saved?	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could specify the agent. Alternate translation: “Then God is not going to save anyone!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	18	27	ms9b	figs-nominaladj	τὰ ἀδύνατα παρὰ ἀνθρώποις δυνατὰ παρὰ τῷ Θεῷ ἐστιν	1	The impossible with men is possible with God	Jesus is using the adjectives **impossible** and **impossible** as nouns, to describe types of things. The terms are plural. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate these terms with equivalent expressions. Alternate translation: “The things that are impossible for people to do are possible for God to do” or “God is able to do the things that people are not able to do” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]]
LUK	18	28	m235	figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	Behold	Peter uses the term **Behold** to get Jesus to focus his attention on what he is about to say. Alternate translation: “Listen” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	18	28	znu6	figs-exclusive	ἡμεῖς ἀφήκαμεν…ἠκολουθήσαμέν	1	we have left…we have followed	Peter is referring to himself and his fellow disciples, but not to Jesus, so if your language distinguishes between exclusive and inclusive **we**, use the exclusive form in both of these cases. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
LUK	18	28	yk9b		πάντα	1	everything	This is not hyperbole. Peter and the others did leave behind everything they had in order to become Jesus’ disciples. Alternate translation: “all our possessions”
LUK	18	28	m236	translate-textvariants	πάντα	1	everything	Some manuscripts say “our own possessions” here instead of “everything.” See the discussion of textual issues at the end of the General Notes to this chapter to decide which reading to use in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
LUK	18	28	m262	figs-metaphor	καὶ ἠκολουθήσαμέν σοι	1	and we have followed you	As in [18:22](../18/22.md), to **follow** Jesus means to be one of his disciples. Alternate translation: “in order to become your disciples” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	18	29	vz2w		ἀμὴν, λέγω ὑμῖν	1	Truly I say to you	Jesus says this to emphasize the importance of what he is about to say. Alternate translation: “Now listen to this carefully”
LUK	18	29	sk6z	figs-doublenegatives	οὐδείς ἐστιν ὃς ἀφῆκεν	1	there is no one who has left	A double negative statement begins in this verse and concludes in the next verse. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate the entire double negative statement as a positive statement. Alternate translation, beginning here: “anyone who has left” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
LUK	18	29	m237	figs-abstractnouns	εἵνεκεν τῆς Βασιλείας τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	for the sake of the kingdom of God	See how you decided to translate the phrase **the kingdom of God** in [4:43](../04/43.md). If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **kingdom** with a verb such as “rule.” Alternate translation: “in order to allow God to rule over his life” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
LUK	18	30	s6rp	figs-doublenegatives	ὃς οὐχὶ μὴ ἀπολάβῃ	1	who will by no means not receive	This is the conclusion of the double negative statement that began in the previous verse with “there is no one who has left.” If you started to translate it there as a positive statement, you can finish that translation here. Alternate translation: “will certainly receive” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
LUK	18	30	m238	figs-metonymy	ἐν τῷ καιρῷ τούτῳ…ἐν τῷ αἰῶνι τῷ ἐρχομένῳ	1	in this time…in the age that is coming	Jesus is using the word **time** in the same figurative sense as the word **age** in [16:8](../16/08.md), to mean the long period of time defined by the duration of the created world, and by association the world itself. Jesus is using the word **age** here similarly to mean the new world that God will introduce after the end of this present world. Alternate translation: “in this present world…in the world to come” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	18	30	d3xa	figs-ellipsis	καὶ ἐν τῷ αἰῶνι τῷ ἐρχομένῳ ζωὴν αἰώνιον	1	and in the age that is coming, eternal life	Jesus is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from what he says earlier in the sentence. Alternate translation: “and they will also receive eternal life in the world to come” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
LUK	18	31	pwk9		παραλαβὼν…τοὺς δώδεκα	1	he took the Twelve aside	Alternate translation: “Jesus took the Twelve to a place away from other people where they would be alone”
LUK	18	31	m239	figs-nominaladj	τοὺς δώδεκα	1	the Twelve	See how you translated this in [8:1](../08/01.md). You may have decided to translate the nominal adjective **Twelve** with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “his 12 apostles” or “the 12 men he had appointed to be apostles” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
LUK	18	31	m240	translate-names	τοὺς δώδεκα	1	the Twelve	You may have decided instead in [8:1](../08/01.md) to translate this as a title, even if your language does not ordinarily use adjectives as nouns. If so, you can do the same thing here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	18	31	g4yx	figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	Behold	Jesus uses the term **behold** to get his disciples to focus their attention on what he is about to say. Alternate translation: “Now listen carefully” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
LUK	18	31	m241	figs-idiom	ἀναβαίνομεν εἰς Ἰερουσαλήμ	1	we are going up to Jerusalem	When Jesus says that they are **going up** to Jerusalem, he means that they are traveling there. That was the customary way of speaking about going to Jerusalem, since the city was up on a mountain. Alternate translation: “we are traveling to Jerusalem” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
LUK	18	31	pg4k	figs-activepassive	πάντα τὰ γεγραμμένα διὰ τῶν προφητῶν	1	all the things that have been written by the prophets	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form.

LUK	18	31	ss78	figs-explicit	τὰ γεγραμμένα διὰ τῶν προφητῶν	1	the things that have been written by the prophets	Jesus assumes that his disciples will know that he is referring to the Old Testament prophets. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “the things that the prophets have written in the Scriptures” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	18	31	zj2x	figs-123person	τῷ Υἱῷ τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου	1	the Son of Man	Jesus is speaking about himself in the third person. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this in the first person. Alternate translation: “me, the Son of Man” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
LUK	18	31	m242	figs-explicit	τῷ Υἱῷ τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου	1	the Son of Man	See how you translated the title **Son of Man** in [5:24](../05/24.md). Alternate translation: “me, the Messiah” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	18	31	i5ya	figs-activepassive	τελεσθήσεται	1	will be accomplished	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “will occur” or “will take place” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	18	32	h2a3	figs-activepassive	παραδοθήσεται	1	he will be delivered	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who will do the action. Alternate translation: “the Jewish leaders will hand him over” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	18	32	es98	figs-123person	παραδοθήσεται	1	he will be delivered	If you decided in [18:31](../18/31.md) to use the second person for what Jesus is telling his disciples, also use it here. Alternate translation: “the Jewish leaders will hand me over” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
LUK	18	32	m243	figs-metonymy	τοῖς ἔθνεσιν	1	to the Gentiles	Jesus is speaking figuratively of the Roman authorities by association with the fact that they are not Jews. Alternate translation: “to the Roman authorities” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	18	32	hc2k	figs-activepassive	ἐμπαιχθήσεται, καὶ ὑβρισθήσεται, καὶ ἐμπτυσθήσεται	1	he be mocked, and will be mistreated, and will be spit upon	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form.

LUK	18	32	m244	figs-123person	ἐμπαιχθήσεται, καὶ ὑβρισθήσεται, καὶ ἐμπτυσθήσεται	1	he be mocked, and will be mistreated, and will be spit upon	If you decided in [18:31](../18/31.md) to use the second person for what Jesus is telling his disciples, also use it here. Alternate translation: “they will mock me, mistreat me, and spit on me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
LUK	18	33	u86r	figs-123person	καὶ μαστιγώσαντες, ἀποκτενοῦσιν αὐτόν; καὶ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ τρίτῃ, ἀναστήσεται	1	And having whipped him, they will kill him. And on the third day he will rise up	If you decided in [18:31](../18/31.md) to use the second person for what Jesus is telling his disciples, use it here as well. Alternate translation: “And after they have whipped me, they will kill me. But two days later I will come back to life” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
LUK	18	33	fie4	figs-explicit	καὶ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ τρίτῃ ἀναστήσεται	1	And on the third day he will rise up	See how you translated this in [9:22](../09/22.md). In the idiom of this culture, today was the “first day,” tomorrow was the “second day,” and the day after tomorrow was the **third day**. To make sure that this is clear to your readers, you may wish to use a different expression than “the third day,” especially if, in your culture, this would mean one day longer than Jesus intends. Otherwise, your readers may be confused when they read later in the book that Jesus died on a Friday and came back to life on a Sunday, if that would be “the second day” according to the way your culture reckons time. Alternate translation: “and he will spend the next full day in the grave, but on the day after that, he will come back to life” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	18	33	m245	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	καὶ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ τρίτῃ	1	And on the third day	Jesus uses the word **And** to introduce a contrast between the belief of the authorities that they could kill him and the fact that he would come back to life. Alternate translation: “But on the third day” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
LUK	18	33	m246	translate-ordinal	τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ τρίτῃ	1	on the third day	If your language does not use ordinal numbers, you can use a cardinal number here. Alternate translation: “on day three” or, depending on how your culture reckons time, “on day two” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
LUK	18	33	m247	figs-metonymy	ἀναστήσεται	1	he will rise up	Jesus speaks figuratively of coming back to life as **rising up**, since it involves coming **up** out of the grave. Alternate translation: “he will come back to life” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
LUK	18	34	bm7h		αὐτοὶ οὐδὲν τούτων συνῆκαν	1	they understood none of these things	If it would be clearer in your language, you could make the verb negative and the object positive here. Alternate translation: “they did not understand any of these things”
LUK	18	34	b29z	figs-explicit	οὐδὲν τούτων	1	none of these things	Implicitly, **these things** refers to Jesus’ description of how he would suffer and die in Jerusalem and then rise from the dead. Alternate translation: “none of what Jesus had told them about what was going to happen” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	18	34	fn58	figs-activepassive	ἦν τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο κεκρυμμένον ἀπ’ αὐτῶν	1	this word was hidden from them	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who did the action. Alternate translation: “God prevented them from understanding the meaning of what Jesus was telling them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	18	34	m248		τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο	1	this word	Luke uses the term **word** in a specific sense here. Alternate translation: “this saying” or “what Jesus was telling them”
LUK	18	34	qx2n	figs-activepassive	τὰ λεγόμενα	1	the things that were spoken	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who did the action. Alternate translation: “the things that Jesus said” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
LUK	18	35	w3sw	writing-newevent	ἐγένετο δὲ	1	And it happened that	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
LUK	18	35	m249	translate-names	ἐν τῷ ἐγγίζειν αὐτὸν εἰς Ἰερειχὼ	1	as he came near to Jericho	**Jericho** is the name of a city. Alternate translation: “as Jesus approached the city of Jericho” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

LUK	18	37	ku9j	translate-names	Ἰησοῦς ὁ Ναζωραῖος	1	Jesus the Nazarene	The people call Jesus **the Nazarene** because he was from the town of Nazareth in Galilee. Alternate translation: “Jesus from the town of Nazareth” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	18	38	u9ct	grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ	1	And	Luke uses this word to introduce the results of what the previous sentence described. When the blind man learned that Jesus was walking by, he knew that Jesus would hear him if he called out, so as a result, he shouted to him. Alternate translation: “So” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
LUK	18	38	yaj2		ἐβόησεν	1	cried out	Alternate translation: “called out” or “shouted”

LUK	18	38	ehf6	figs-explicit	Υἱὲ Δαυείδ	1	Son of David	**David** was Israel’s most important king, and God had promised him that one of his descendants would be the Messiah. So the title **Son of David** implicitly meant “Messiah.” Alternate translation: “Messiah” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	18	38	m251	translate-names	Δαυείδ	1	David	This is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
LUK	18	38	u69g	figs-imperative	ἐλέησόν με	1	have mercy on me	This is an imperative, but it should be translated as a polite request, rather than as a command. It may be helpful to add an expression such as “please” to make this clear. Alternate translation: “please be merciful to me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
LUK	18	38	m252	figs-explicit	ἐλέησόν με	1	have mercy on me	The blind man assumes that Jesus will know that he is asking specifically to be healed. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “please have mercy on me and heal me” or “please be merciful to me by healing me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	18	39	m253		οἱ προάγοντες	1	the ones who were walking ahead	Alternate translation: “the people who were walking ahead of Jesus”
LUK	18	39	z7r6		πετίμων αὐτῷ, ἵνα σιγήσῃ	1	were rebuking him, so that he would be silent	Alternate translation: “kept telling him not to shout”
LUK	18	39	zug7		πολλῷ μᾶλλον ἔκραζεν	1	he kept crying out much more	This could mean one of two things. Alternate translation: (1) “he shouted even louder” or (2) “he called out even more persistently”

LUK	18	42	n67h	figs-imperative	ἀνάβλεψον	1	See again	This was not a command that the man was capable of obeying. Instead, this was a command that directly caused the man to be healed. Alternate translation: “I have restored your sight” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
LUK	18	42	m256	figs-abstractnouns	ἡ πίστις σου σέσωκέν σε	1	Your faith has saved you	If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **faith** with a verb such as “believe.” Alternate translation: “Because you believed, you have been healed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

LUK	18	42	m257		ἡ πίστις σου σέσωκέν σε	1	Your faith has saved you	Jesus seems to be using the word **saved** here in one of its particular senses, to mean “healed.” Alternate translation: “Because you believed, you have been healed”
LUK	18	43	m258		ἠκολούθει αὐτῷ	1	he followed him	The word **followed** here does not necessarily have the figurative meaning of “became a disciple.” Alternate translation: “he walked down the road with the rest of the crowd that was around Jesus”
LUK	18	43	d1kk		δοξάζων τὸν Θεόν	1	glorifying God	Alternate translation: “giving glory to God” or “praising God”
LUK	19	intro	zn2b			0		# Luke 19 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>1. Jesus helps a man named Zacchaeus repent of his sins (19:1–10)<br>2. Jesus tells a parable about a man who entrusted money to his servants (19:11–27)<br>3. Jesus rides into Jerusalem on a colt (19:28–48)<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### “Sinner”<br>The Pharisees refer to a group of people as “sinners.” The Jewish leaders thought these people were sinful, but in reality the leaders were also sinful. This can be taken as irony. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])<br><br>### Servants<br><br>God expects his people to remember that everything in the world belongs to God. God gives his people things so they can serve him. He wants them to please him by doing what he wants them to do with everything he has given them. One day Jesus will ask his servants what they have done with everything he gave them to use. He will give a reward to those who have done what he wanted them to do, and he will punish those who have not.<br><br>### The donkey and the colt<br><br>Jesus rode into Jerusalem on an animal. In this way he was like a king who came into a city after he had won an important battle. Also, the kings of Israel in the Old Testament rode on a donkeys. Other kings rode on horses. So Jesus was showing that he was the king of Israel and that he was not like other kings.<br><br>Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John all wrote about this event. Matthew and Mark wrote that the disciples brought Jesus a donkey. John wrote that Jesus found a donkey. Luke wrote that they brought him a colt. Only Matthew wrote that there were both a donkey had a colt. No one knows for sure whether Jesus rode the donkey or the colt. It is best to translate each of these accounts as it appears in ULT without trying to make them all say exactly the same thing. (See: Matthew 21:1-7 and Mark 11:1-7 and Luke 19:29-36 and John 12:14-15)<br><br>### Spreading garments and branches<br><br>When kings would enter the cities they ruled, people would cut branches from trees and take off the outer garments that they wore to stay warm in cold weather and spread them all on the road so the king would ride over them. They did this to honor the king and show that they loved him. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/honor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])<br><br>### The merchants in the temple<br><br>Jesus forced the people who were selling animals in the temple to leave. He did this to show everyone that he had authority over the temple and that only those who were righteous, who did what God said was good, could be in it. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]])

LUK	20	intro	h6in			0		# Luke 20 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 20:17, 42-43, which are words from the Old Testament.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Using questions to trap people<br><br>When Jesus asked the Pharisees who gave John the authority to baptize ([Luke 20:4](../../luk/20/04.md)), they could not answer because any answer they gave would give someone a reason to say that they were wrong ([Luke 20:5-6](./05.md)). They thought that they would be able to say that Jesus was wrong when they asked him if people should pay taxes to Caesar ([Luke 20:22](../../luk/20/22.md)), but Jesus gave them an answer that they had not thought of.<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Paradox<br><br>A paradox is a true statement that appears to describe something impossible. In this chapter, Jesus quotes a psalm that records David calling his son “lord,” that is, “master.” However, to the Jews, ancestors were greater than their descendants. In this passage, Jesus is trying to lead his hearers to the true understanding that the Messiah will himself be divine, and that he himself is the Messiah. ([Luke 20:41-44](./41.md)).

At this time, Jesus told them that what they were eating and drinking were his body and his blood. Nearly all Christian churches celebrate “the Lord’s Supper,” the “Eucharist”, or “Holy Communion” to remember this meal.<br><br>### The new covenant<br><br>Some people think that Jesus established the new covenant during the supper. Others think he established it after he went up to heaven. Others think it will not be established until Jesus comes again. Your translation should say no more about this than the ULT does. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/covenant]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### “Son of Man”<br><br>Jesus refers to himself as the “Son of Man” in this chapter ([Luke 22:22](../../luk/22/22.md)).

LUK	22	34	tu15		οὐ φωνήσει σήμερον ἀλέκτωρ, ἕως…ἀπαρνήσῃ	1	the rooster will not crow today, before you deny	This can be stated positively. Alternate translation: “the rooster will crow this day only after you deny” or “before the rooster crows today, you will deny”
LUK	22	34	pwj1	figs-metonymy	οὐ φωνήσει…ἀλέκτωρ	1	the rooster will not crow	Here, the crowing of the rooster refers to a certain time of day. Roosters often crow just before the sun appears in the morning. Therefore, this refers to dawn. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

Though this is a rhetorical question and Jesus is not asking for information, you should translate it as a question unless only a statement would cause the disciples to reply that they had lacked nothing. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
LUK	22	35	a5jt	figs-you	ὅτε ἀπέστειλα ὑμᾶς	1	When I sent you out	Jesus was talking to his apostles. So languages that have different forms of “you” should use the plural form. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
LUK	22	35	dny3	figs-metonymy	βαλλαντίου	1	purse	A purse is a bag for holding money. Here it is used to refer to “money.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

LUK	22	38	kbt8		ἱκανόν ἐστιν	1	It is enough	Possible meanings are (1) they have enough swords. “We now have enough swords.” or (2) Jesus wants them to stop talking about having swords. “No more of this talk about swords.” When Jesus said that they should buy swords, he was mainly telling them about the danger they would all face. He may not have really wanted them to buy swords and fight.

LUK	22	47	c2l7	translate-unknown	φιλῆσαι αὐτόν	1	to kiss him	“to greet him with a kiss” or “to greet him by kissing him.” When men greeted other men who were family or friends, they would kiss them on one cheek or both cheeks. If your readers would find it embarrassing to say that a man would kiss another man, you could translate it in a more general way: “to give him a friendly greeting.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
LUK	22	48	e2n9	figs-rquestion	φιλήματι τὸν Υἱὸν τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου παραδίδως?	1	are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?	Jesus uses a question to rebuke Judas for betraying him with a kiss.

LUK	22	49	gv81	figs-explicit	εἰ πατάξομεν ἐν μαχαίρῃ?	1	should we strike with the sword?	The question is about the type of fight they should engage in (a sword fight), not what weapon they should use (the swords that they brought, [Luke 22:38](../22/38.md)), but your translation may need to speak of the weapons they brought. Alternate translation: “fight against them with the swords we brought” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
LUK	22	50	b4ij		εἷς τις ἐξ αὐτῶν	1	a certain one of them	“one of the disciples”

LUK	22	57	vdm1		οὐκ οἶδα αὐτόν, γύναι	1	Woman, I do not know him	Peter did not know the woman’s name.

Tell us who hit you!” or “Hey prophet, who hit you?” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])

LUK	22	68	l7nz	figs-hypo	ἐὰν…ἐρωτήσω, οὐ μὴ ἀποκριθῆτε	1	if I ask you, you will certainly not answer	This is the second hypothetical statement. It was a way for Jesus to rebuke them without giving them a reason to convict him. These words, along with “If I tell you, you will not believe” (verse 67), show that Jesus did not believe that the council was really looking for the truth. Your language may have a way of indicating that the action has not actually happened. Jesus is saying that whether he speaks or asks them to speak, they will not respond correctly. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])

LUK	23	intro	p6wq			0		# Luke 23 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>The ULT sets the last line of this chapter apart because it is more connected with chapter 24 than with chapter 23.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Accuse<br><br>The chief priests and scribes accused Jesus of doing evil because they wanted Pilate to kill Jesus. But they were accusing him falsely, because Jesus had never done what they accused him of doing.<br><br>### “The curtain of the temple was split in two”<br><br>The curtain in the temple was an important symbol that showed that people needed to have someone speak to God for them. They could not speak to God directly because all people are sinful and God hates sin. God split the curtain to show that Jesus’ people can now speak to God directly because Jesus has paid for their sins.<br><br>### The tomb<br><br>The tomb in which Jesus was buried ([Luke 23:53](../../luk/23/53.md)) was the kind of tomb in which wealthy Jewish families buried their dead. It was an actual room cut into a rock. It had a flat place on one side where they could place the body after they had put oil and spices on it and wrapped it in cloth. Then they would roll a large rock in front of the tomb so no one could see inside or enter.<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### “I find no fault in this man”<br><br>Pilate was saying that he did not know of any reason why he should punish Jesus because Jesus had not broken any laws. Pilate was not saying that Jesus was perfect.

LUK	24	intro	r5qx			0		# Luke 24 General Notes<br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### The tomb<br><br>The tomb in which Jesus was buried ([Luke 24:1](../../luk/24/01.md)) was the kind of tomb in which wealthy Jewish families buried their dead. It was an actual room cut into a rock. It had a flat place on one side where they could place the body after they had put oil and spices on it and wrapped it in cloth. Then they would roll a large rock in front of the tomb so no one could see inside or enter.<br><br>### The faith of the women<br><br>Most of Luke’s original readers would have thought of women as less important than men, but Luke carefully shows that some women loved Jesus very much and had more faith than the twelve disciples had.<br><br>### Resurrection<br><br>Luke wants his readers to understand that Jesus came alive again in a physical body ([Luke 24:38-43](./38.md)).<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### “Son of Man”<br><br>Jesus refers to himself as the “Son of Man” in this chapter ([Luke 24:7](../../luk/24/07.md)). Your language may not allow people to speak of themselves as if they were speaking about someone else. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sonofman]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])<br><br>### “On the third day”<br><br>Jesus told his followers that he would become alive again “on the third day” ([Luke 18:33](../../luk/18/33.md)). He died on a Friday afternoon (before sunset) and became alive again on a Sunday, so he became alive again “on the third day” because the Jews said that the day began and ended at sunset, and they counted any part of the day as a day. Friday was the first day, Saturday was the second day, and Sunday was the third day.<br><br>### Two men in bright shining robes<br><br>Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John all wrote about angels in white clothing with the women at Jesus’ tomb. Two of the authors called them men, but that is only because the angels were in human form. Two of the authors wrote about two angels, but the other two authors wrote about only one of them. It is best to translate each of these passages as it appears in the ULT without trying to make the passages all say exactly the same thing. (See: [Matthew 28:1-2](../../mat/28/01.md) and [Mark 16:5](../../mrk/16/05.md) and [Luke 24:4](../../luk/24/04.md) and [John 20:12](../../jhn/20/12.md))

This is probably an exaggeration to show that they needed to speak with him for a long time before they could change his mind.

Alternate translation: “they were able to persuade him to stay” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
