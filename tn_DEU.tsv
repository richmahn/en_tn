front:intro	rm3n				0	# Introduction to Deuteronomy\n\n## Part 1: General Introduction\n\n### Outline of Deuteronomy\n\n- Moses’ first speech\n     - Moses reminds Israel of how Yahweh guided them through the wilderness (1:1–3:29)\n     - Moses appeals to Israel to obey the law of Yahweh (4:1–49)\n- Moses’ second speech\n     - The Ten Commandments (5:1–10:22)\n     - Rules and warnings from the Law (11:1–26:19)\n- Moses’ third speech\n     - Instructions for entering Canaan (27:1–26)\n     - Blessings for obeying and curses for disobeying (28:1–68)\n     - The covenant renewed (29:1–30:20)\n     - Last words of Moses, the Song of Moses, and his death (31:1–34:12)\n\n\n### What is the book of Deuteronomy about?\n\nIn the book of Deuteronomy, Moses repeats the laws of the covenant that God made with the people of Israel. The people of Israel were about to go into the Promised Land. Before they entered the land, Moses reminded them of what Yahweh did for them and what he expected from them. Moses warned the people about worshiping idols and no longer trusting Yahweh once they settled in the Promised Land. Yahweh promised to judge those who disobey him and to bless those who obey his law. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/covenant]])\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nThe name “Deuteronomy” means “Second Law” or “the retelling of the Law.” Translators may decide on a title such as “A Repeat of the Law” or “Moses Explains the Law Again.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])\n\n### Who wrote the book of Deuteronomy?\n\nThe writers of both the Old and New Testament present Moses as being very involved with writing the book of Deuteronomy. However, many scholars think that Joshua wrote chapter 34, which tells how Moses died.\n\n### What are the important features of the book of Deuteronomy?\n\nThe book contains a series of speeches that Moses gave to Israel before he died. He spoke these things just before the people entered the Promised Land. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/promisedland]])\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### Why did Yahweh command the Israelites to completely destroy the people who lived in the Promised Land?\n\nAs God prepared the Israelites to enter the Promised Land, he commanded them to completely destroy the Canaanite people who lived there. The Israelites would then not be tempted to join them and worship their false gods.\n\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\n\n### What is the role of God’s name in Deuteronomy?\n\nGod’s name is mentioned over 30 times in the book of Deuteronomy. The use of God’s name in this book usually represents God’s honor or fame. At other times in Deuteronomy, God’s name represents his presence. God said he would choose a place and make his name dwell there. This means God’s presence would be there. The people were to go to that place to worship him.\n\n### Can this book be translated before the rest of the Pentateuch?\n\nThe books of Genesis and Exodus help to explain what happens in Deuteronomy. For this reason, those books should be translated before the book of Deuteronomy.\n\n### Quotes in quotes\n\nSince this book consists of Moses’ speeches, many parts of this book are direct quotations. Within his speeches, Moses directly quotes what other people said. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate or format these passages so that there are not quotations within a quotation. (See [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])\n\n### Second person plural\n\nIn this book, the second person pronoun “you” is plural unless otherwise noted. Moses is speaking to all of the Israelites at Horeb, so use the plural form in your translation if your language marks that distinction. (See [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])\n\n### “Yahweh your God”\n\nThroughout this book, Moses refers to Yahweh as “your God” when he speaks to the Israelites. Moses is referring to the same God that he also worships. He is not distinguishing between the God of the Israelites and his own God. If it would be helpful in your language, you could clarify that this is the same God that Moses worships. (See [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])\n\n### Moses’ audience\n\nIn his speeches, Moses speaks to the Israelites who will enter into the land that Yahweh promised to give to them. Moses reminds them about events that happened to their ancestors and to them. If it would be helpful for your readers, you could state explicitly that Moses is talking about their ancestors, even when he directly addresses the living Israelites as “you.” (See [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
1:intro	ggp9				0	# Deuteronomy 1 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter forms a continuation with the last chapter of the book of Numbers. In this chapter is Moses’ first speech to the Israelites. \n\n- vv. 1-4: Introduction\n- vv. 5-49: Moses reminds the Israelites of what happened to their ancestors in the wilderness\n     - vv. 9-18: Moses chooses judges and military leaders\n     - vv. 19-46: The Israelites send out spies to survey the land \n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Yahweh’s victory\nThe chapter explains that Israel’s conquering of the Promised Land will be done by Yahweh. They are not to fear the people of Canaan but be obedient to Yahweh. Yahweh is bringing about his judgment upon the people of Canaan. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/promisedland]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/judge]])\n\n### Possessing the land\n\nWhile the Promised Land belongs to Israel, they do not possess the land. Possessing the land is an important theme. Possessing the land depended on Israel’s faithfulness. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/faithful]])\n\n### Yahweh's presence\n\nIn verse 42, Yahweh says, “I will not be among you.” As God, Yahweh is everywhere and cannot be limited to a single space. In verse 42, Yahweh means that because of their rebellion, he will no longer be with the Israelites in a special way.\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Quotes in quotes\n\nIn this chapter, Moses gives a speech and quotes what other people said. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate or format this passage so that there are not quotations within quotations. (See [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])\n\n### Pronouns\n\nIn this chapter, the second person pronoun “you” is plural unless otherwise noted. Moses is speaking to all of the Israelites at Horeb, so use the plural form in your translation if your language marks that distinction.\n\n### “Yahweh your God”\n\nThroughout this chapter, Moses refers to Yahweh as “your God” when he speaks to the Israelites. Moses is referring to the same God that he also worships. He is not distinguishing between the God of the Israelites and his own God. If it would be helpful in your language, you could clarify that this is the same God that Moses worships. (See [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])\n\n### Time Background\n\nIn his speech, Moses reminds the Israelites about what happened to their ancestors when they were camping at Mt. Sinai. Throughout his speech, Moses repeats the phrase “at that time” to refer to new topics that occur during that time period. If it would be helpful for your readers, you could state this information explicitly. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevents]])\n
1:1	vb79		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	ס֜וּף	1	The word **Suph** is the name of a place. It is uncertain where Suph is, but Suph could refer to the Red Sea. Alternate translation: “the Red Sea”
1:1	bg65		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	תֹּ֛פֶל וְ⁠לָבָ֥ן וַ⁠חֲצֵרֹ֖ת וְ⁠דִ֥י זָהָֽב	1	These are the names of places.
1:1	mdz9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	בֵּֽין & וּ⁠בֵֽין	1	Here, the text repeats **between** to describe the relative positions of cities. If it is unnatural in your language to repeat a preposition, you could use a form that identifies an area between cities. Alternate translation: “between … and”
1:2	xcp5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אַחַ֨ד עָשָׂ֥ר יוֹם֙	1	The implication is that the journey takes **11 days**. You could include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “It is a journey of 11 days”
1:3	xm9k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	וַ⁠יְהִי֙	1	Moses is using the word translated **And it happened** to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. Alternate translation: “Here is what happened:” 
1:3	pc9j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal	בְּ⁠אַרְבָּעִ֣ים שָׁנָ֔ה בְּ⁠עַשְׁתֵּֽי־עָשָׂ֥ר חֹ֖דֶשׁ	1	If your language does not use ordinal numbers, you could use cardinal numbers here or equivalent expressions. Alternate translation: “after 40 years, in month 11”
1:3	zfn5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-hebrewmonths	בְּ⁠עַשְׁתֵּֽי־עָשָׂ֥ר חֹ֖דֶשׁ	1	The **eleventh** month of the Hebrew calendar includes January on Western calendars. You could convert the Hebrew day and month into an approximate date on the calendar that your culture uses. However, the Jews used a lunar calendar, so if you use a solar calendar, the date will be different every year and the translation will not be entirely accurate. So you may wish instead to give just the number of the day and the name of the Hebrew month in the text of your translation and indicate in a footnote approximately what time of year that is on your calendar.
1:3	c54r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	בְּנֵ֣י	1	Although the term **sons** is masculine, the author is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women.

1:3	e9a7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	בְּנֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל	1	Here, **sons** means “descendants.” Moses is identifying the Israelites as descendants of their ancestor Jacob, who was also known as Israel. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the descendants of Israel” or “the people of Israel”
1:4	xfh0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הַכֹּת֗⁠וֹ	1	The implication is that Yahweh caused the Israelites to defeat Sihon and Og under Moses' leadership.

1:4	fivx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	הַכֹּת֗⁠וֹ	1	Here, the pronoun **he** refers back to Moses in verse 3. If this is not clear for your readers, you could use the person's name here. Alternate translation: “Moses defeated”
1:4	mpn7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	בְּ⁠עַשְׁתָּרֹ֖ת בְּ⁠אֶדְרֶֽעִי	1	The words **Ashtaroth** and **Edrei** are the names of cities.
1:4	e5t1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	בְּ⁠עַשְׁתָּרֹ֖ת בְּ⁠אֶדְרֶֽעִי	1	The implication is that King Og ruled over both **Ashtaroth** and **Edrei**. **Ashtaroth** and **Edrei** were cities that were close to each other. You could include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “in Ashtaroth and in Edrei”
1:5	juo3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	לֵ⁠אמֹֽר	1	Here, the word **saying** introduces direct speech. Consider natural ways of doing that in your own language.

Alternate translation: “Moses began explaining the law. This is what Yahweh God said to his people at Horeb,”
1:6	s8em		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	אֵלֵ֖י⁠נוּ	1	Moses is using the pronoun **us** to refer to himself and  every Israelite who was an adult when they were at Horeb, so use the exclusive form of that word if your language marks that distinction. Alternate translation: “to me and to your ancestors” 
1:7	l6np		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	פְּנ֣וּ ׀ וּ⁠סְע֣וּ לָ⁠כֶ֗ם	1	Here, the word **Turn** describes the beginning of action. Your language may have a comparable expression that you could use in your translation. Alternate translation: “Start your journey”
1:7	cwjt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	וּ⁠סְע֣וּ לָ⁠כֶ֗ם	1	The expression **and journey yourselves** contains extra information that would be unnatural to express in some languages. If this is true of your language, you could shorten the expression. Alternate translation: “and journey”

1:8	tgax		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לִ⁠פְנֵי⁠כֶ֖ם	1	Here, **faces** represent the presence of a person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your language or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “before you”
1:8	i61s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture	נָתַ֥תִּי לִ⁠פְנֵי⁠כֶ֖ם אֶת־הָ⁠אָ֑רֶץ	1	Here Yahweh could be using the past tense: (1) to refer to something that will certainly happen in the future. Alternate translation: “I will give the land before your faces” (2) to refer to something that he has already done. Alternate translation: “I have already given the land before your faces”
1:8	p2mn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	נִשְׁבַּ֣ע יְ֠הוָה	1	Yahweh is speaking about himself in the third person. If this would not be natural in your language, you could use the first person form. Alternate translation: “I swore”

He means that God has greatly increased the number of Israelites. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different way to express the emphasis. Alternate translation: “almost as numerous as the stars of heaven”
1:10	x7q2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	יְהוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֵי⁠כֶ֖ם	1	When Moses says **your God**, he is referring to the same God whom he also worships.

2:intro	ji46				0	# Deuteronomy 2 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter continues Moses’ first speech from the previous chapter.\n\n- vv. 1-11: Moses recounts the Israelites’ journey from the wilderness to the land of the Edomites, Moabites, and Ammonites\n- vv. 24-37: Moses recounts how Yahweh allowed the Israelites to defeat King Sihon\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### God knows everything, sees everything, and is everywhere\nAs God, Yahweh knows everything past, present, and future. And, as God, Yahweh is everywhere and cannot be limited to a single space. In verse 7, Moses explains that Yahweh was with the Israelites in a special way.\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Quotes in quotes\nIn this chapter, Moses gives a speech and quotes what other people said. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate or format this passage so that there are not quotations within a quotation. (See [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])\n\n### Pronouns\nIn this chapter, the second person pronoun “you” is plural unless otherwise noted. Moses is speaking to all of the Israelites at Horeb, so use the plural form in your translation if your language marks that distinction.\n\n### Moses represents the Israelites\nThe singular pronoun “you” occurs when Yahweh speaks directly to Moses. The Israelites requested that Moses speak to Yahweh on their behalf because the Israelites fear Yahweh and do not want to speak directly to him. Moses acts as a representative on behalf of all the Israelites. If it would be helpful for your readers, you could clarify that Yahweh wants Moses to tell the Israelites everything that Yahweh says.\n

3:intro	z1ea				0	# Deuteronomy 3 General Notes\n\n## Outline\n- vv. 1-11: Moses recounts how the Israelites defeated King Og\n- vv. 12-22: Allotting land east of the Jordan to Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh\n- vv. 23-29: Yahweh forbids Moses from entering the land\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Victories\n\nThe victories recorded in this chapter occurred on the east side of the Jordan River. This was not part of the Promised Land, which was on the west side of the Jordan River. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/promisedland]])\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties\n\n###“Yahweh your God”\nThroughout this chapter, Moses refers to Yahweh as “your God” when he speaks to the Israelites. Moses is referring to the same God that he also worships. He is not distinguishing between the God of the Israelites and his own God. If it would be helpful in your language, you could clarify that this is the same God that Moses worships. (See [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])\n\n### Quotes in quotes\n\nIn this chapter, Moses gives a speech and quotes what other people said. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate or format this passage so that there are not quotations within a quotation. (See [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])\n\n### Pronouns\n\nIn this chapter, the second person pronoun “you” is plural unless otherwise noted. Moses is speaking to all of the Israelites at Horeb, so use the plural form in your translation if your language marks that distinction.\n\n### Time Background\n\nIn his speech, Moses reminds the Israelites about what happened to their ancestors before they entered the land that Yahweh promised to give to them. Throughout his speech, Moses repeats the phrase “at that time” to refer to events that occur during that time period. If it would be helpful for your readers, you could state this information explicitly. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevents]])

4:intro	d8g8				0	# Deuteronomy 4 General Notes\n\n## Chapter Outline\n- vv. 1-40: Moses encourages the Israelites to obey Yahweh\n- vv. 41-43: Moses appoints cities of refuge\n- vv. 44-49: Summary of Moses’ first speech\n\n## Special Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Moses’ instructions\nMoses is not allowed to enter into the Promised Land. Since the Israelites are getting ready to possess the Promised Land, Moses gives them some last instructions before his death. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/promisedland]])\n\n### The universe\n\nThe ancient Hebrews believed that the earth was resting with water around it and below it. Translators should try to keep these original images in their work, even though readers in their project language might have a completely different idea of what the universe is like.\n\n### Yahweh’s presence\n\nAs God, Yahweh is everywhere and cannot be limited to a single space. When Yahweh is “near” or “with” the Israelites, that means that Yahweh was with the Israelites in a special way. Yahweh is so holy that a person would die if they saw him. So, when the Israelites “see” Yahweh, that means that they saw Yahweh’s miracles or other things that Yahweh uses to show who he is.\n\n### Yahweh’s inheritance\n\nMoses refers to the people of Israel as Yahweh’s inheritance. Yahweh chose the people of Israel out of all the peoples of the world in order to show his power and greatness. Yahweh wants the people of Israel to follow his rules because he has a special relationship with them. \n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Rhetorical questions\n\nMoses uses several rhetorical questions in this chapter. The purpose of these questions is to convince his readers to obey his instructions. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])\n\n### Words for the law\n- statutes\n- ordinances\n- judgments\nMoses uses several words to refer to the law that Yahweh commanded the Israelites. It is unclear what the differences are between these terms. If your language has different terms for the law, you could use them here to differentiate between the different Hebrew words. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])\n\n### Pronouns\n\nMoses is speaking to the Israelites who are alive, but he refers to events that happened to their ancestors. The pronoun **you** and **your** are plural here unless otherwise noted. If it would be helpful for your readers, you could explicitly state that these events happened to their ancestors. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
4:1	m1n5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	יִשְׂרָאֵ֗ל	1	Here, **Israel** represents the people of Israel. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your language or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “people of Israel”

4:3	p9ok		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הָלַךְ֙ אַחֲרֵ֣י	1	Here, **walked after** means “worshiped.” Moses is speaking of worshipping idols as if people were physically walking behind idols to follow them.

4:4	x6hf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הַ⁠דְּבֵקִ֔ים בַּ⁠יהוָ֖ה	1	Moses speaks as if obeying Yahweh was like physically holding on to a person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “who carefully obeyed Yahweh”
4:5	hs9r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	רְאֵ֣ה	1	Moses is using the word **Look** to focus the Israelites' attention on what he is about to say. Your language may have a comparable expression that you could use in your translation. Alternate translation: “Pay attention”

4:5	bis8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish	אֱלֹהָ֑⁠י	1	Here, Moses refers to Yahweh as **my God** in order to emphasize that he himself worships and obeys Yahweh.

5:intro	xsp1				0	# Deuteronomy 5 General Notes\n\n## Outline\n- vv.1-4: Moses reminds the Israelites that Yahweh made a covenant with them on Mount Sina\n- vv. 5-21: Moses repeats the Ten Commandments\n- vv. 22-33: Moses reminds the Israelites that he spoke to Yahweh on their behalf because they feared Yahweh\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nSome translations set each of the commandments in the list of Ten Commandments in 5:7–21 farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text. The ULT uses a separate paragraph for each commandment.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Ten Commandments\n\nThis chapter repeats the material of Exodus 20. It is known as the Ten Commandments.\n\n## Other Translation Issues\n\n### Metaphors and idioms\n\nMoses uses metaphors and idioms to instruct the people to follow the law of Moses. This is because it is very important to follow these laws. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]] and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])\n\n\n### Second person pronouns\n\nWhen Moses speaks to the Israelites, he uses the second person plural “you.” When Yahweh tells his law to Moses, he uses the second person singular “you,” because Yahweh is directly addressing Moses. The law is for all of the Israelites, so if it would be helpful for your readers, you could use the plural forms of the pronoun in the law.\n\n\n### You Shall\nIn the Ten Commandments, Yahweh uses the form “you shall” to give commands. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate these words using a command or instruction form. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative]])

The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could connect the phrases with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: “those of us here today, indeed, all who are living”

6:intro	q4y8				0	# Deuteronomy 6 General Notes\n\n## Outline\n- vv. 1-9: The great commandment\n- vv. 6-25: Warnings against disobedience\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Yahweh’s blessings\nYahweh’s continued blessing of the people of Israel is dependent upon the people’s obedience to the law of Moses. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/bless]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]])\n\n\n### The Shema\nVerses 6-9 are known as The Shema in Judaism. They are an important foundation of Judaism. Jesus identifies the Shema as the greatest commandment in [Mark 12:28-29](Mrk/12/28.md).\n\n## Other Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Metaphors\n\nThere are many metaphors in this chapter. These metaphors describe the greatness of the Promised Land the wholehearted worship that is completely dedicated to Yahweh. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/promisedland]])\n\n### Words for the Law\n- statutes\n- ordinances\n- judgments\nMoses uses different words to refer to the law that Yahweh commanded the Israelites. It is unclear what the differences are between these terms. If your language has different terms for the law, you could use them here to differentiate between the different Hebrew words. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])\n\n### Pronouns\n\nMoses is speaking to the Israelites who are alive. The pronoun **you** and **your** are singular here unless otherwise noted.  (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd]])

Yahweh used Israel to punish these nations. If they were not completely destroyed, they would lead Israel into sin. Therefore, they were to be completely destroyed and be shown no mercy. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/mercy]])\n\n### Abrahamic Covenant\n\nThis chapter references parts of the covenant Yahweh made with Abraham. It also emphasizes Yahweh’s faithfulness to this covenant. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/covenant]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/faithful]])\n\n\n## Other Potential Translation Difficulties in This Chapter\n\n\n### “You”\nEven though Moses is speaking to all the Israelites, **you** and **your** are singular in this chapter unless otherwise noted. If the singular forms of these pronouns would not be natural in your language, you could use the plural forms in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd]])

They were not allowed to collect chariots because they were a sign of earthly power and the king was to trust in Yahweh.

This chapter describes the establishment of special cities to protect those fleeing from revenge killings. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/justice]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/avenge]])\n\n### Witnesses\n\nIn the ancient Near East, it was common for a person to be punished by the testimony of a single person, especially if this was an important person. The rules in this chapter give protection to people, especially the poor by requiring multiple witnesses. This allowed justice to be done. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/testimony]])\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### Law of retaliation\n\nThe chapter describes a famous law, often called the “law of retaliation.” It is said, an “eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.” This does not mean a person who causes another person to lose their eye must have their own eye removed as punishment. This law is not about making all things equal. Instead, it is about limiting the punishment or the ability of a person to retaliate. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

20:intro	qq8m				0	# Deuteronomy 20 General Notes\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Yahweh’s protection\nIsrael was not to worry about the power and strength of other nations. Instead, they were to trust in the power of Yahweh. He is the source of their military strength and protection. This is why a priest leads them into battle, rather than a military commander. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/trust]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/priest]])\n\n### Holy war\n\nIsrael’s conquering of the Promised Land was unique in history. It was a type of holy war and had special rules. This war was really Yahweh’s punishment against the sin of the Canaanite people. If the people were not completely destroyed, they would cause Israel to sin. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/promisedland]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/holy]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### “What man is there”\nThis phrase is used several times to introduce a rhetorical question. The questions are intended to tell the readers that Yahweh only wants soldiers who are completely dedicated to fighting for him. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### Excused from fighting\n\nIn ancient Israel, men were excused from fighting in battle for several different reasons. Some of these reasons are mentioned in this chapter. Apparently, needing to establish a new house, the need to harvest a field and cowardice were possible excuses. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
