# General Information:

Paul tells the Thessalonian believers that his conduct was not based in flattery, greed, or self glory.

# we never used words of flattery

"we never spoke to you with false praise"

# nor as an excuse to cover up greed

The words "we use words" are understood from the previous phrase. Here "cover up" is a metaphor for keeping people from knowing something. AT: "nor did we use words to cover up greed" or "and we did not use words to hide an evil desire for your money" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# could have claimed privileges

"could have insisted you give us money"
