# In this way we had affection for you

"This is how we demonstrated our affection for you"

# we had affection for you

"we loved you"

# We were pleased to share with you not only the gospel of God but also our own lives

Paul speaks of the gospel message and his life and the lives of those with him as if they were a physical object that one could share with others. Alternate translation: "We were pleased not only to tell you the gospel of God but also to spend time with you and to help you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# you had become very dear to us

"we cared for you deeply"
