## as when a mother comforts her child ##

Just as a mother gently comforts her children, so Paul, Silvanus and Timothy spoke gently to the Thessalonian believers. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

## we had affection for you ##

"we loved you"

## you had become very dear to us ##

"we cared for you deeply"

## our labor and toil ##

The words "labor" and 'toil' mean basically the same thing. Paul uses them to emphasize how hard they worked. AT: "how hard we worked" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

## we worked night and day that we might not be a burden to any of you ##

"we worked hard to make our own living so you would not need to support us"
