# They forbid us to speak

"They try to make us stop speaking"

# they always fill up their own sins

Paul speaks as though someone can fill a container with their own sins as with liquid. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Wrath must come on them in the end

This refers to God finally judging and punishing people for their sins.
