# brothers

Here this means fellow Christians, including both men and women.

# our labor and toil

The words "labor" and "toil" mean basically the same thing. Paul uses them to emphasize how hard they worked. Alternate translation: "how hard we worked" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# Night and day we were working so that we might not weigh down any of you

"We worked hard to make our own living so you would not need to support us"
