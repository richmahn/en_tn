Paul defines the believers' service and reward.

# you yourselves

The words "you" and "yourselves" refer to the Thessalonian believers. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns]])

# brothers

Here this means fellow Christians, including both men and women.

# our coming

The word "our" refers to Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy but not the Thessalonian believers. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

This can be expressed in a positive manner. AT: "was very worthwhile" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])

# previously suffered and were shamefully treated

"were mistreated and insulted"

# in much struggling
