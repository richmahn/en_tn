# General Information:

Paul continues to use "we" to refer to himself and his traveling companions and "you" to the Thessalonian believers.

# we also thank God constantly

Paul often thanks God for their acceptance of the gospel message he shared with them.

# not as the word of man

"Word of man" here is a synecdoche for "a message that comes simply from a man." Alternate translation: "(it is) not a message that is made up by a man" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# you accepted it ... as it truly is, the word of God

"Word" here is a metonym for "message." Alternate translation: "you accepted it ... as it truly is, the message that comes from God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# which is also at work in you who believe

Paul speaks of God's gospel message as if it were a person who was doing work. "Word" is a metonym for "message." Alternate translation: "which those of you who believe are listening to and beginning to obey" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
