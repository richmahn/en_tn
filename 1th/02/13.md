# General Information:

Paul continues to use "we" to refer to himself and his traveling companions and "you" to the Thessalonian believers.

# we also thank God constantly

Paul often thanks God for their acceptance of the gospel message he shared with them.

# you received it as it truly is, the word of God

The Thessalonians believed Paul's message as coming from God, not from Paul's own authority.

# It is this word that is also at work among you who believe

Paul speaks of God's gospel message as if it were a person who was doing work. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
