# General Information:

Paul continues to use "we" to refer to himself and his traveling companions and "you" to the Thessalonian believers.

# we also thank God constantly

Paul often thanks God for their acceptance of the gospel message he shared with them.

# not as the word of man

"Word of man" here is a synecdoche for "a message that comes simply from a man." AT: "(it is) not a message that is made up by a man" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]]).

# you received it as it truly is, the word of God

The Thessalonians believed Paul's message as coming from God, not from Paul's own authority.

"Word" is a metonym for "message." AT: "you received it as it truth is, the message that comes from God." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# It is this word that is also at work among you who believe

Paul speaks of God's gospel message as if it were a person who was doing work. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

"Word" is a metonym for "message." AT: "It is this set of God's instructions that enables those of you who believe to work well together"(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
