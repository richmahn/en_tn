# 1 Thessalonians 02 General Notes #

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Christian witness #####
Paul values his "Christian witness" as evidence for the truth of the gospel. The godliness or holiness of a Christian is said to bear witness to the non-Christian. Paul defends himself against attacks against his character, so that his witness is not tainted. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/testimony]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/godly]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/holy]])

##### Christian living #####
Under the law of Moses, people were required to offer sacrifices of animals or grain in the temple. Since physical sacrifices are no longer required, Christians are required to live their lives as a type of sacrifice to God. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]])
