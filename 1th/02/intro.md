# 1 Thessalonians 02 General Notes

#### Special concepts in this chapter

##### Christian witness
Paul values his "Christian witness" as evidence that the gospel is true. Paul says that being godly or holy bears witness to the non-Christian. Paul defends his character, so that his witness is not affected. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/testimony]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/godly]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/holy]])
