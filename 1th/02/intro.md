# 1 Thessalonians 02 General Notes #

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Christian witness #####
Paul values his "Christian witness" as evidence that the gospel is true. Paul says that being godly or holy bears witness to the non-Christian. Paul defends his character, so that his witness is not affected. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/testimony]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/godly]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/holy]])

##### Christian living #####
Under the law of Moses, people were required to sacrifice animals or grain in the temple. God no longer requires physical sacrifices. Now God requires Christians to live sacrificially him. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]])
