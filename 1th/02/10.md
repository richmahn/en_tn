# holy, righteous, and blameless

Paul uses three words that describe their good behavior toward the Thessalonian believers.

# as a father deals with his own children

Paul compares how he encouraged the Thessalonians to a father gently teaching his children how to behave. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# We were begging you and encouraging and urging you

The words "begging," "encouraging," and "urging" are used together to express how passionately Paul's group encouraged the Thessalonians. AT: "We were strongly encouraging you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# into his own kingdom and glory

The word "glory" describes the word "kingdom." AT: "into his own glorious kingdom" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
