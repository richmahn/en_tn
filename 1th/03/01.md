# Connecting Statement:

Paul tells the believers he has sent Timothy to strengthen their faith.

# we could no longer bear it

"we could no longer endure worrying about you"

# good to be left behind at Athens alone

"good for Silvanus and me to stay behind in Athens"

# good

# Athens

This is a city in the Achaia province, which is now modern-day Greece. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# our brother and fellow worker

These two expressions both describe Timothy.

# no one would be shaken

To be "shaken" is an idiom for being afraid. AT: "no one would be frightened away from trusting in Christ" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# we have been appointed

Paul assumes that everyone knows that it was God who appointed them. This can be made explicit. AT: "God has appointed us" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
