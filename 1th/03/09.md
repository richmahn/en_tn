# For what thanks can we give to God for you, for all the joy that we have before our God over you?

This rhetorical question can be expressed as a statement. AT: "We cannot thank God enough for what he has done for you! We greatly rejoice over you when we pray to our God!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# before our God

Paul speaks as if he and his companions were physically in God's presence. He is probably referring to the activity of praying. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
