## translationNotes

* **we encourage and exhort you** - Here the word "we" refers to Paul, Timothy and Silvanus but not the Thessalonians. The words "encourage" and "exhort" mean basically the same thing. Paul uses them to emphasize how strongly they encourage them. AT: "we strongly encourage you" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
* **you received instructions from** - "you were taught by"
* **you must walk** - "Walk" is an expression for the way one is to live. Alternate Translation: "you ought to live." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
