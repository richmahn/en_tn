# 1 Thessalonians 04 General Notes #

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Sexual immorality #####
Different cultures have different standards of sexual morality. These different cultural standards may present difficulties in translation. Translators must also be aware of cultural taboos, topics that are considered improper to talk about. 

##### Dying before the return of Christ #####
In the early church, people wondered what would happen if a person died before the return of Christ. They may have worried whether those dying before the return of Christ would get to partake of the kingdom of God. 

##### "Caught up in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air" #####
Many scholars believe this passage refers to an event known as the "rapture." This is a time when Jesus calls to himself those who believe in him. For those who hold this viewpoint, the timing of this event is the matter of much speculation. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/believe]])
