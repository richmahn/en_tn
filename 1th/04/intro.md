# 1 Thessalonians 04 General Notes

#### Special concepts in this chapter

##### Sexual immorality
Different cultures have different standards of sexual morality. These different cultural standards may make translating this passage difficult. Translators must also be aware of cultural taboos. These are topics considered improper to discuss.

##### Dying before the return of Christ
In the early church, people apparently wondered what would happen if a believer died before Christ returned. They may have worried whether those dying before Christ returned would be part of the kingdom of God. Paul answers that concern.

##### "Caught up in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air"
This passage refers to a time when Jesus calls to himself those who have believed in him. Scholars differ on whether or not this refers to Christ's final glorious return. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/believe]])
