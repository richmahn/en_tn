# General Information:

In this letter the words "we" and "us" refer to Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, unless otherwise noted. Also, the word "you" is plural and refers to the believers at the church of Thessalonica. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# We always give thanks to God

Here "always" suggests that when Paul prays to God, he consistently presents the Thessalonians to God in his prayers.

# we mention you continually in our prayers

"we continually pray for you"
