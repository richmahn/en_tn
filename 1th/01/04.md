# Connecting Statement:

Paul continues to give thanks for the believers at Thessalonica and praises them for their faith in God.

# Brothers

Here this means fellow Christians, including both men and women.

# we know

The word "we" refers to Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy but not the Thessalonian believers. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
