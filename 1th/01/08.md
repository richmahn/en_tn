# the word of the Lord

"Word" here is a metonym for "message." Alternate translation: "the Lord's teachings" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# has rung out

Here Paul speaks of the Christian witness produced by the Thessalonian believers as if it were a bell that was rung or a musical instrument that was being played. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
