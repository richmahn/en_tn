## translationNotes

* **not like people who live in darkness** - "not like those who belong to this evil world which is like being in darkness"
* **for that day to overtake you like a thief** - For the day when the Lord comes will not surprise you like a thief surprises his victim.  TA: "to catch you unprepared" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
* **you are all sons of the light...not sons of the night** - "sons of the light" refers to followers of Christ and "sons of the night" refers to all others who follow the world.
* **let us not sleep as the rest do** - Paul equates sleeping to not being aware that Jesus will return to Judge the world. TA: "Let us not be like others who are not aware of Jesus coming back." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **let us ** - "us" refers to Paul and the Thessalonians. (See [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive]])
* **keep watch and be sober** - We are to be alert to Christ's return and be self-controlled.
* **For those who sleep do so at night** - Just as it is at night when people sleep and do not know what is happening, so it is with the world and they do not know that Christ will return. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **those who get drunk do so at night** - Paul is equating that it is at night when people become drunk, so when people are unaware of Christ's return they do not live a self-controlled life. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
