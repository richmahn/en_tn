# For those who sleep do so at night

Just as when people sleep and do not know what is happening, so the people of this world do not know that Christ will return. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# those who get drunk do so at night

Paul is stating that it is at night when people become drunk, so when people are unaware of Christ's return they do not live a self-controlled life. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
