# make you completely holy

This refers to God making a person sinless and perfect in his sight.

# May your whole spirit, soul, and body be preserved without blame

Here "spirit, soul, and body" represent the whole person. If your language does not have three words for these parts you can state it as "your whole life" or "you." This can be stated in active form. AT: "May God make your whole life without sin" or "May God keep you completely blameless" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
