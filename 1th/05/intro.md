# 1 Thessalonians 05 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

The end of this chapter forms a conclusion typical of a letter in the ancient Near East. 

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Day of the Lord #####
The exact time of the coming day of the Lord will be a surprise to the world. This is what the simile "like a thief in the night" means. Because of this, Christians are to be prepared for the coming of the Lord. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/dayofthelord]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

##### Quench the Spirit #####
This means to ignore the Holy Spirit's guidance and to ignore the work he is trying to do through a person.
