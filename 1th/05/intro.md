# 1 Thessalonians 05 General Notes

#### Structure and formatting

Paul concludes his letter in a way that was typical of letters in the ancient Near East.

#### Special concepts in this chapter

##### Day of the Lord
The exact time of the coming day of the Lord will be a surprise to the world. This is what the simile "like a thief in the night" means. Because of this, Christians are to live prepared for the coming of the Lord. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/dayofthelord]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

##### Quench the Spirit
This means to ignore or work against the Holy Spirit's guidance and work.
