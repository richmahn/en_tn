# Pharaoh's heart is hard

Here "heart" refers to Pharaoh. His stubborn attitude is spoken of as if his heart was hard. See how you translated this in [Exodus 7:13](./13.md). Alternate translation: "Pharaoh is stubborn" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
