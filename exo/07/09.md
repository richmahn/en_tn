# When Pharaoh says to you, 'Do a miracle,' then you will say to Aaron, 'Take your staff and throw it down before Pharaoh, so that it may become a snake.'

This could be stated as an indirect quote. AT: "When Pharaoh tells you to do a miracle, then you will tell Aaron to take his staff and throw it down before Pharaoh, so that it may become a snake" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
