# If a payment is required for his life

If the ox's owner can pay a fine to save his own life, then he must pay whatever the judges decide. The full meaning of this can be stated clearly. This can also be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "if the owner of the bull can pay a fine to save his own life, he must pay the full amount that the judges say that he must pay" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
