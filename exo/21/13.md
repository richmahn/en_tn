# did not do it with premeditation

"did not plan to do it" or "did not do it on purpose"

# I will fix a place to where he can flee

The purpose of choosing a place can be stately clearly here. Alternate translation: "I will choose a place that he can run away to be safe" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
