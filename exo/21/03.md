# If he came by himself, he must go free by himself

What "by himself" means can be stated clearly. Some languages require that the additional condition, that he marries while a slave, be stated clearly. Alternate translation: "If he became a slave while he had no wife, and if he marries while he is a slave, the master need only free the man" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# by himself

"alone" or "without a wife"

# if he is married

"if he was married when he became a slave" or "if he came as a married man"
