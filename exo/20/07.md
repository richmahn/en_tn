# take the name of Yahweh your God

"use the name of Yahweh your God"

# in vain

"carelessly" or "without proper respect"

# I will not hold guiltless

This double-negative can be stated as a positive. Alternate translation: "I will certainly consider guilty" or "I will certainly punish" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
