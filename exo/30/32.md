# General Information:

Yahweh continues telling Moses what Moses must tell the people.

# It must not be applied to people's skin

This can be stated in active form. AT: "You must not put the anointing oil that is dedicated to Yahweh on a person's skin" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# with the same formula

"with the same ingredients" or "with the same items"

# that person must be cut off from his people

The metaphor "cut off" has at least three possible meanings. They can be expressed in active form: 1) "I will no longer consider him to be one of the people of Israel" 2) "the people of Israel must send him away" or 3) "the people of Israel must kill him." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
