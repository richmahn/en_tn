# perfume

This is a pleasant smelling liquid a person puts on his or her body.

# must be cut off from his people

The metaphor "cut off" has at least three possible meanings. They can be expressed in active form: 1) "I will no longer consider him to be one of the people of Israel" 2) "the people of Israel must send him away" or 3) "the people of Israel must kill him." See how you translated this in [Exodus 30:33](../30/33.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
