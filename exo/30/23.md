# spices

dried plants that people grind into a powder and put in oil or food to give it a nice smell or flavor. See how you translated this in [Exodus 25:6](../25/06.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

# five hundred shekels ... 250 shekels

"500 shekels ... two hundred and fifty shekels." A shekel is about 11 grams. Translators may use units that people know and round numbers: "5.7 kilograms ... 11.4 kilograms" or "six kilograms ... three kilograms" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bweight]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-fraction]])

# cinnamon ... cane ... cassia

These are sweet spices. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
