# General Information:

Yahweh continues telling Moses what the people must do.

# spices

dried plants that people grind into a powder and put in oil or food to give it a nice smell or flavor. See how you translated this in [Exodus 25:6](../25/03.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

# five hundred shekels ... 250 shekels

"500 shekels ... two hundred and fifty shekels." A shekel is about 11 grams. Translators may use units that people know and round numbers: "5.7 kilograms ... 11.4 kilograms" or "six kilograms ... three kilograms" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bweight]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-fraction]])

# cinnamon ... cane ... cassia

These are sweet spices. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

# the weight of the shekel of the sanctuary

There were evidently shekels of more than one weight at the time. This specified which one was to be used. See how you translated this in [Exodus 30:13](./11.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bweight]])

# one hin

Translators may use units that people know and round numbers: "3.7 liters" or "four liters" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bvolume]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-fraction]])

# with these ingredients

"with these items"

# the work of a perfumer

Possible meanings are 1) Moses was to have a perfumer do the work or 2) Moses was to do the work himself the way a perfumer would do it.

# a perfumer

a person who is skilled in mixing spices and oils
