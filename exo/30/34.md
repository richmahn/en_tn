# General Information:

Yahweh continues to tell Moses what to do. Yahweh gives the commands only to Moses: all instances of "you" are singular. However, the words "blended by a perfumer" might mean that Moses could have the perfumer take the spices, blend them, grind them, and give them to Moses so Moses could put part of the mixture in front of the ark, as in UDB.

# stacte, onycha, and galbanum

These are spices. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

# Make it into the form of incense, blended by a perfumer

The phrase with "blended" can be translated in active form. AT: "Make it into the form of incense that a perfumer has blended" or "A perfumer must blend it into a kind of incense" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# blended by a perfumer

Possible meanings are 1) Moses was to have a perfumer do the work or 2) Moses was to do the work himself the way a perfumer would do it. See how you translated these words in [Exodus 30:25](./22.md).

# You will grind it

"You will crush it." Here "you" refers to Moses. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# You will regard

Here "you" is plural and refers to Moses and all the people. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
