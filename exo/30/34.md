# General Information:

Yahweh continues to tell Moses what to do. Yahweh gives the commands only to Moses: all instances of "you" are singular. However, the words "blended by a perfumer" might mean that Moses could have the perfumer take the spices, blend them, grind them, and give them to Moses so Moses could put part of the mixture in front of the ark, as in UDB.
