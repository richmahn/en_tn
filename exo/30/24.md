# the weight of the shekel of the sanctuary

There were evidently shekels of more than one weight at the time. This specified which one was to be used. See how you translated this in [Exodus 30:13](../30/13.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bweight]])

# one hin

Translators may use units that people know and round numbers: "3.7 liters" or "four liters" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bvolume]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-fraction]])
