# General Information:

Yahweh continues telling Moses what the people must do.

# throughout your generations

"through all the generations of your descendants." See how you translated this in [Exodus 12:14](../12/12.md).

# But you must offer

Though the word "you" is addressed to Moses, the instruction is given specifically to Aaron and his descendants as to when and what they are to offer on the altar of incense.
