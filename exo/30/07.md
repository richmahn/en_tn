Yahweh continues telling Moses what the people must do.

## throughout your people's generations ##

See how you translated this in [Exodus 12:12](../12/12.md).

## But you must offer ##

Though the word "you" is addressed to Moses, it's instruction is specifically to Aaron and his descendants as to when and what they are to offer on the altar of incense.
