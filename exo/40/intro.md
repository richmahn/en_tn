# Exodus 40 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

This chapter is repetitive and should read as a series of instructions. It is repeated as well to show that Moses was obedient to every detail of Yahweh's command. 

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### "Yahweh's glory filled the tabernacle" #####
This phrase indicates that Yahweh began to dwell within the tabernacle, among Israel, in a special way. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/glory]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/tabernacle]])
