# unplowed

uncultivated, untilled

# fallow

in its natural state, not used for to grow food

# so that the poor among your people may eat

The poor can eat any food that grows on its own in a field that is not cultivated. This can be stated clearly in the translation. AT: "so the poor among your people may harvest and eat any food that grows on its own in that field" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
