# he will bless your bread and water

This is a merism that means food and drink. Alternate translation: "he will bless your food and drink" or "he will bless you by giving you food and drink" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])

# he will bless ... I will remove

Yahweh switched between the first and third pronoun to refer to himself. Here both "he" and "I" refer to Yahweh. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
