Yahweh continues telling Moses his laws for the people of Israel.

## Be attentive to him ##

"Listen to him" or "Obey him"

## Do not provoke him, for he will not pardon ##

AT: "If you provoke him, he will not pardon"

## My name is on him ##

Here "name" refers to God's authority (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## If you indeed obey his voice ##

AT: "If you carefully obey what he says" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## an enemy to your enemies and an adversary to your adversaries ##

These two phrases mean the same thing and are combined for emphasis. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
