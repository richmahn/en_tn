# General Information:

Yahweh continues telling Moses his laws for the people of Israel.

# You must not ... do as they do

The Israelites must not live as the people who worship other gods. AT: "You must not ... live as the people who worship those gods" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# he will bless your bread and water

This is a merism that means food and drink. AT: "he will bless your food and drink" or "he will bless you by giving you food and drink" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])

# he will bless ... I will remove

Yahweh switched between the first and third pronoun to refer to himself. Here both "he" and "I" refer to Yahweh. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
