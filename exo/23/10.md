Yahweh continues telling Moses his laws for the people of Israel.

## produce ##

"food products from plants"

## unplowed ##

AT: "uncultivated" or "untilled" or "untouched"

## fallow ##

AT: "in its natural state" or "unused for production"

## so that the poor among your people may eat ##

The poor can eat any food that grows on its own in a field that is not cultivated that year.
