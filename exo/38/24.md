"29 talents ... 100 talents." A talent is about 33 kilograms. Alternate translation: "29 talents ... 100 talents" or "about 960 kilograms ... about 330 kilograms" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bweight]])

# 730 shekels ... 1,775 shekels

"Seven hundred and thirty shekels ... one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five shekels." A shekel is 11 grams. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bweight]])

# measured by the standard of the sanctuary shekel

There were evidently shekels of more than one weight at the time. This specified which one was to be used. See how you translated this in [Exodus 30:13](../30/13.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bweight]])
