# an oath to Yahweh must be taken by them both

Only the man who is accused of stealing the animal must swear the oath. The owner of the lost animal must accept the oath that has been sworn. This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "the man who was caring for the animal must swear an oath before Yahweh and the owner must accept that oath" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
