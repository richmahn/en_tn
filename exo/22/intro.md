##### Justice in society #####
The rules and laws of this chapter are not intended to be followed by every society. Israel was God's chosen nation and was required to live in a special way. These laws concerned creating a just society and a holy nation. In this chapter, the purpose of these laws often focuses on minimizing the people's desire for vengeance.
