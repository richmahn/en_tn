# General Information:

Yahweh continues telling Moses what the people must do.

# silver bases

These were silver blocks that had a slot in them to keep the board in place.

# pedestals

The silver bases kept the wooden board off the ground.

# There must be two bases

This can be stated in active form. AT: "Put two bases" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# and so on

This means that what was said about the first two boards should be done for the rest of the boards. This can be stated clearly in the translation. AT: "and two bases for each of the rest of the boards" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
