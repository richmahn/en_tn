Yahweh continues telling Moses what the people must do.

## silver bases ##

These were silver blocks that had a slot in them to keep the board in place.

## pedestals ##

The silver bases kept the wood off the ground.

## and so on ##

This means that what was said about the first two boards should be done for the rest of the boards.  AT: "and two bases for each of the rest of the boards"
