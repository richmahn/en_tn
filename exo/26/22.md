# General Information:

Yahweh continues to tell Moses what the people must do.

# These frames must be separate at the bottom, but joined at the top

This can be stated in active form. AT: "Separate these frames at the bottom, but join them at the top" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# silver bases

These were silver blocks that had a slot in them to keep the frame in place. See how you translated this in [Exodus 26:19](./19.md).

# in all

"total"

# and so on

This means that what was said about the first two frames should be done for the rest of the frames. See how you translated this in [Exodus 26:21](./19.md). AT: "and two bases for each of the rest of the frames" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
