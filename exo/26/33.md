# clasps

The clasps fit into the loops to hold the curtains together. See how you translated these in [Exodus 26:4-6](./04.md).

# you must bring in the ark of the testimony

The ark of the testimony is the chest that contains the commandments. This can be stated clearly in the translation. Alternate translation: "you must bring in the chest containing the commandments" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# The curtain is to separate the holy place

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "The curtain will separate the holy place" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
