# General Information:

Yahweh continues to tell Moses how the tabernacle is to be constructed.

# You must make

Yahweh is speaking to Moses, so the word "you" is singular. Yahweh probably expected Moses to tell someone else to do the actual work, but Moses would be the one responsible for seeing that the work was done correctly. "Tell a craftsman to make." See how you translated this in [Exodus 26:1](./01.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# clasps

The clasps fit into the loops to hold the curtains together. See how you translated these in [Exodus 26:4-6](./04.md).

# you must bring in the ark of the testimony

The ark of the testimony is the chest that contains the commandments. This can be stated clearly in the translation. AT: "you must bring in the chest containing the commandments" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# The curtain is to separate the holy place

This can be stated in active form. AT: "The curtain will separate the holy place" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
