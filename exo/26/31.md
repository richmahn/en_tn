# General Information:

Yahweh continues to tell Moses how the tabernacle is to be constructed.

# You must make

Yahweh is speaking to Moses, so the word "you" is singular. Yahweh probably expected Moses to tell someone else to do the actual work, but Moses would be the one responsible for seeing that the work was done correctly. "Tell a craftsman to make." See how you translated this in [Exodus 26:1](../26/01.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
