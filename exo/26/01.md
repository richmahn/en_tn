# General Information:

Yahweh continues telling Moses what the people must do. (See: [Exodus 25:1](../25/01.md))

# You must make

Yahweh is speaking to Moses, so the word "you" is singular. Yahweh probably expected Moses to tell someone else to do the actual work, but Moses would be the one responsible for seeing that the work was done correctly. "Tell a craftsman to make" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
