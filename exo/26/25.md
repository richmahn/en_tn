# silver bases

These were silver blocks that had a slot in them to keep the frame in place. See how you translated this in [Exodus 26:19](./19.md).

# in all

"total"

# and so on

This means that what was said about the first two frames should be done for the rest of the frames. See how you translated this in [Exodus 26:21](./21.md). Alternate translation: "and two bases for each of the rest of the frames" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
