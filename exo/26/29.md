# General Information:

Yahweh continues to tell Moses how the tabernacle must be constructed.

# for them to serve as holders for the crossbars

"which will hold the crossbars" or "because they will hold the crossbars"

# crossbars

These are horizontal support beams that give stability to the structure. See how you translated this in [Exodus 26:26](../26/26.md).
