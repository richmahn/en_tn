# You have seen

The word "you" here refers to the Israelites. Yahweh is telling Moses what to tell the Israelites. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# I carried you on eagles' wings

God speaks of caring for his people while they traveled as if he were an eagle and carried them on his wings. Alternate translation: "I helped you travel like an eagle that carries her babies on her wings" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
