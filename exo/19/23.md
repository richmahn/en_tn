"go down"

# break through the barrier

God spoke about walking past the boundary as if they might break down a barrier and walk through it. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Exodus 19:21](./19.md). AT: "go beyond the boundary" or "go through the barrier" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
