# not to break through

God spoke about walking past the boundary as if they might break down a barrier and walk through it. See how you translated "set bounds" in [Exodus 19:12](./12.md). AT: "not to go beyond the boundary" or "not to go through the barrier"(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
