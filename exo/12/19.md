# no yeast must be found in your houses

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "there must not be any yeast in your houses" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# must be cut off from the community of Israel

The metaphor "cut off" has at least three possible meanings. They can be expressed in active form: 1) "the people of Israel must send him away" or 2) "I will no longer consider him to be one of the people of Israel" or 3) "the people of Israel must kill him." See how you translated "must be cut off from Israel" in [Exodus 12:15](../12/15.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]]and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
