# at midnight

"in the middle of the night"

# all the firstborn in the land of Egypt ... all the firstborn of cattle

Here, "firstborn" always refers to the oldest male offspring. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Exodus 11:5](../11/05.md).

# who sat on his throne

This refers to Pharaoh.

# the firstborn of the person in prison

"to the firstborn of people in prison." This refers to prisoners, in general, and not to a specific person in prison.
