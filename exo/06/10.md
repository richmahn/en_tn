# If the Israelites have not listened to me, why will Pharaoh listen to me, since I am not good at speaking?

Moses asked this question hoping God would change His mind about using Moses. This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement. AT: "Since the Israelites did not listen to me, neither will Pharaoh, because I am not good at speaking!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
