Pharaoh's heart is often described as hard in this chapter. This means that his heart was not open or willing to understand Yahweh's instructions. When his heart was hardened, it became less and less receptive to Yahweh.

##### Pharaoh's chariots #####
These chariots were a fighting force. Pharaoh took an army to kill the Hebrew people. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

##### Rhetorical Questions #####
The Israelites asked a few rhetorical questions of Moses. These questions were not really directed at Moses, but at Yahweh. This showed their lack of faith in Yahweh. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]])
