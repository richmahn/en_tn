# Be aware

"Know"

# I will harden the Egyptians' hearts

Here "hearts" refers to the Egyptians themselves. Their stubborn attitude is spoken of as if their hearts were hard. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Exodus 9:12](../09/12.md). AT: "I will cause the Egyptians to became more defiant" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# so they will go after them

"so that the Egyptians will go into the sea after the Israelites"
