# Yahweh said to Moses, "Reach out with your hand ... and their horsemen."

This can be stated as an indirect quote. Alternate translation: "Yahweh told Moses to reach out with his hand over the sea so that the waters would come back onto the Egyptians, their chariots, and their horsemen."

# come back onto

"fall on"
