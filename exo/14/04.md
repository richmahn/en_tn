# General Information:

Yahweh continues to instruct Moses on where to go and what Yahweh will do.

# I will harden Pharaoh's heart

Here "heart" refers to the Pharaoh. His stubborn attitude is spoken of as if his heart was hard. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Exodus 9:12](../09/12.md). Alternate translation: "I will cause Pharaoh to became more defiant" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# he will pursue them

"Pharaoh will pursue the Israelites"

# I will get honor

"People will honor me"

# The Egyptians will know that I am Yahweh

"The Egyptians will understand that I am Yahweh, the one true God"

# So the Israelites camped as they were instructed

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "So the Israelites camped as Yahweh had instructed them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
