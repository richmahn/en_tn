# Why are you, Moses, continuing to call out to me?

Moses apparently had been praying to God for help so God uses this question to compel Moses to act. This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: "Do not call out to me any longer, Moses." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
