# Why are you, Moses, continuing to call out to me?

Moses apparently had been praying to God for help so God uses this question to compel Moses to act. This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement. AT: "Do not call out to me any longer, Moses." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# divide it in two

"divide the sea into two parts"

# Be aware

"Know"

# I will harden the Egyptians' hearts

Here "hearts" refers to the Egyptians themselves. Their stubborn attitude is spoken of as if their hearts were hard. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Exodus 9:12](../09/11.md). AT: "I will cause the Egyptians to became more defiant" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# so they will go after them

"so that the Egyptians will go into the sea after the Israelites"
