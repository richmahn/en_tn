# bread

Moses speaks of the food that God will send as if it were bread. The Israelites would eat this food every day, just as they had eaten bread every day before this. See how you translated it in [Exodus 16:4](./04.md). Alternate translation: "food" or "food like bread" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Who are Aaron and I?

Moses used this question to show the people that he and Aaron did not have the power to give them what they wanted. Alternate translation: "Aaron and I cannot give you what you want." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Your complaints are not against us; they are against Yahweh

The people were complaining against Moses and Aaron, who were Yahweh's servants. So by complaining against them, the people were really complaining against Yahweh. Alternate translation: Your complaints are not really against us; they are against Yahweh, because we are his servants" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
