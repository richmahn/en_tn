# like frost

The original readers knew what frost is like, so this phrase would help them understand what the flakes were like. Frost is frozen dew that forms on the ground. It is very fine. Alternate translation: "that looked like frost" or "that was fine like frost" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
