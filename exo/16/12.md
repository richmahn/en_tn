# bread

God speaks of the food that he will send as if it were bread. The Israelites would eat this food every day, just as they had eaten bread every day before this. See how you translated it in [Exodus 16:4](./04.md). AT: "food" or "food like bread" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
