# Yahweh would speak to Moses face to face

Speaking directly rather than through dreams and visions, is spoken of as if Moses and God saw each other's faces while they spoke. Alternate translation: "Yahweh would speak directly to Moses" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# young man

Joshua was old enough to be a soldier, but he was much younger than Moses
