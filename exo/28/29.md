# General Information:

Yahweh continues to tell Moses what the people must do.

# he must carry the names of the people of Israel over his heart in the breastpiece

This refers to the names of the tribes engraved on the twelve stones the breastplate as described in [Exodus 28:17-21](./17.md).

# over his heart

"over Aaron's heart" or "on his chest"

# the Urim and the Thummim ... the means for making decisions

The second phrase appears to refer to the Urim and Thummim and explain their purpose.

# the Urim and the Thummim

It not clear what these are. They were objects, possibly stones, that the priest used to determine somehow the will of God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
