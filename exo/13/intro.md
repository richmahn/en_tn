# Exodus 13 General Notes

#### Structure and formatting

This chapter records the instructions for the celebration of Passover. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/passover]])

#### Special concepts in this chapter

##### Law
The law mentioned here is not the law of Moses because it has not yet been revealed. Instead, it is a more generic "rule." (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/reveal]])

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter

##### Let my people go

This is a very important statement. Moses does not ask Pharaoh for permission to "let go" of the Hebrew people. Instead, he is demanding that Pharaoh free the Hebrew people. When this chapter states that Pharaoh let the people go, it indicates that he gave them permission to leave.
