# This will be a reminder for you on your hand, and a reminder on your forehead

These are two different types of physical reminders so people will not forget something important. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# a reminder for you on your hand

Moses speaks of celebrating the festival as if it were tying an object around their hands to remind them of what Yahweh had done. AT: "like something you tie around your hand as a reminder" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# a reminder on your forehead

Moses speaks of celebrating the festival as if it were tying an object around their foreheads to remind them of what Yahweh had done. AT: "like something you tie around your head as a reminder" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# so the law of Yahweh may be in your mouth

The words "in your mouth" here refers to the words that they speak. AT: "so you may always be speaking of the law of Yahweh" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# strong hand

The word "hand" here represents God's actions or works. See how you translated this in [Exodus 6:1](../06/01.md). AT: "the power I show in my works" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
