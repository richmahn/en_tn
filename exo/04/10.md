# have never been eloquent

"have never been an excellent speaker"

# I am slow of speech and slow of tongue

The phrases "slow of speech" and "slow of tongue" mean basically the same thing. Moses uses them to emphasize that he is not a good speaker. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# slow of tongue

Here "tongue" refers to Moses' ability to speak. AT: "unable to speak well" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
