## eloquent ##

"an excellent speaker"

## I am slow of speech and slow of tongue ##

The phrases "slow of speech" and "slow of tongue" mean basically the same thing. Moses uses them to emphasize that that he is not a good speaker. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

## Who is it who made manâ€™s mouth? Who makes a man mute or deaf or seeing or blind? Is it not I, Yahweh? ##

By these questions Yahweh presses his point that he is the Creator, and he is the one who makes a person able to do something or not able to do something. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## and I will be with your mouth ##

This means that God will give Moses the right words to speak at the right time. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
