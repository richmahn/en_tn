## eloquent ##

"an excellent speaker"

## I am slow of speech and slow of tongue ##

These two phrases mean about the same thing. Moses is saying that he cannot speak well or possibly clearly. He might be comparing his ability to the great speakers he had heard in the Egyptian court. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

## "Who has made manâ€™s mouth? Who makes a man mute or deaf or seeing or blind? Is it not I, Yahweh? ##

By these questions Yahweh presses his point that he is the Creator, and he is the one who makes a person able to do something or not able to do something. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## and I will be with your mouth ##

This means that God will give Moses the right words to speak at the right time. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
