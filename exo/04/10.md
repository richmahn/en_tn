## translationNotes

* **eloquent** - "an excellent speaker"
* **I am slow of speech and slow of tongue** - The phrases "slow of speech" and "slow of tongue" mean basically the same thing. Moses uses them to emphasize that that he is not a good speaker. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
* **Who is it who made manâ€™s mouth? Who makes a man mute or deaf or seeing or blind? Is it not I, Yahweh?** - By these questions Yahweh presses his point that he is the Creator, and he is the one who makes a person able to do something or not able to do something. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **and I will be with your mouth** - This means that God will give Moses the right words to speak at the right time. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
