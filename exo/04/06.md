# behold

This word is used to create an exclamation, showing surprise. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations]])

# as white as snow

The word "as" here is used to compare what Moses' hand looked like. Leprosy causes the skin to look white. You may not have a word for snow in your language. If so, consider an alternative that describes something white. AT: "as white as wool or as white as the sand on the beach" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
