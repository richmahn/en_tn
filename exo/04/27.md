# Yahweh said to Aaron

You may want to add a word that marks the beginning of a new part of the story, as the UDB does.

# at the mountain of God

This may have been the mountain at Sinai, but the text does not include that information.

# he had sent him to say

The word "he" refers to Yahweh, and "him" refers to Moses.
