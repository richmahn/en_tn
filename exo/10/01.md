# for I have hardened his heart and the hearts of his servants

Yahweh speaks of making Pharaoh and his servants stubborn as if he were making their hearts hard. See how you translated "Yahweh hardened Pharaoh's heart" in [Exodus 9:12](../09/12.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
