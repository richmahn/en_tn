# this time

"once again"

# take this death away from me

The word "death" here refers to the destruction by the locusts of all plants in Egypt, which would eventually lead to the deaths of people because there were no crops. The full meaning of this statement can be made explicit. AT: "stop this destruction that will lead to our deaths" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
