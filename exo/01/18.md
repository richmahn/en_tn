## midwives ##

See how you translated this in [Exodus 1:15](./15.md).

## "Why have you let the male babies live?" ##

Pharaoh was actually rebuking the midwives for allowing the male children live. (See [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]]).

## "The Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian womenâ€¦" ##

The midwives answered wisely to appease Pharaoh's anger.
