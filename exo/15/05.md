# they went down into the depths like a stone

Just as a stone does not float but sinks to the bottom of the sea, the enemy soldiers sank to the bottom of the sea. Alternate translation: "they went down into the deep water like a stone sinking to the bottom of the sea" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
