# But you blew with your wind

Moses spoke about God making the wind blow as if God blew the wind through his nose or mouth. Alternate translation: "But you made the wind blow" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# sank like lead in the mighty waters

Lead is a heavy metal that is commonly used to make things sink in water. The word "lead" here is used to show how fast God's enemies were destroyed. Alternate translation: "sank as fast as lead in the deep turbulent waters" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
