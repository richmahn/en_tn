# he has triumphed gloriously

It can be stated explicitly over whom Yahweh triumphed. See how you translated this in [Exodus 15:1](../15/01.md). Alternate translation: "he has achieved a glorious victory over the army of Egypt" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# The horse and his rider he has thrown into the sea

Miriam sang about God causing the sea to cover and drown the horse and rider as if God had thrown them into the sea. See how you translated this in [Exodus 15:1](../15/01.md). Alternate translation: "He has made the horse and rider drown in the sea" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
