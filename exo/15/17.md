# You will bring them

Where God would bring them can be stated clearly. Since Moses was not already in Canaan, some languages would use "take" rather than "bring." AT: "You will take your people to Canaan" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])

# plant them on the mountain

Moses speaks about God giving his people the land to live in as if they were a tree that God was planting. AT: "settle them on the mountain" or "let them live on the mountain" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the mountain of your inheritance

This refers to Mount Zion in the land of Canaan.

# of your inheritance

Moses speaks about God promising to give his people the mountain forever as if he were giving it to them as an inheritance. AT: "that you have given them as an inheritance" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# that your hands have built

The phrase "your hands" refers to God's power. AT: "that you have built by your power" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture]])
