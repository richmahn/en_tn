# Exodus 15 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 15:1-18, 21, which are songs. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry]])

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Yahweh's laws #####
In this chapter, Moses talks about Yahweh's laws. The law of Moses is about to be introduced. Although it has not yet been formally introduced, this is what is being referenced in this chapter in anticipation of the revelation of the law of Moses. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/reveal]])
