# Exodus 15 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations set each line of poetry further to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetic songs in 15:1-18 and 15:21. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry]])

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Yahweh's laws #####
In this chapter, Moses talks about Yahweh's laws. The law of Moses is about to be introduced. Although it has not yet been formally introduced, this is what is being referenced in this chapter in anticipation of the revelation of the law of Moses. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/reveal]])
