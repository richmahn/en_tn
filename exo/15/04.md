# He has thrown Pharaoh's chariots and army into the sea

Moses sings about God causing the sea to cover Pharaohs chariots and army as if God had thrown them into the sea. AT: "he has made the sea cover over Pharaoh's chariots and army" or "He has made Pharaoh's chariot riders and army drown in the sea" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# they went down into the depths like a stone

Just as a stone does not float but sinks to the bottom of the sea, the enemy soldiers sank to the bottom of the sea. AT: "they went down into the deep water like a stone sinking to the bottom of the sea" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
