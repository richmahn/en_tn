# To kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst?

The people use this question to accuse Moses of wanting to kill them. Alternate translation: "You only brought us out here to kill us and our children and cattle by not letting us have any water to drink!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
