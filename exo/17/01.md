# wilderness of Sin

The word "Sin" here is the Hebrew name of the wilderness. It is not the English word "sin." See how you translated this in [Exodus 16:1](../16/01.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# Rephidim

This means "the resting place," a place to rest on long journeys through the wilderness. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
