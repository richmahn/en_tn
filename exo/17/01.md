# wilderness of Sin

The word "Sin" here is the Hebrew name of the wilderness. It is not the English word "sin." See how you translated this in [Exodus 16:1](../16/01.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# Rephidim

This means "the resting place," a place to rest on long journeys through the wilderness. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# Why do you quarrel with me? Why do you test Yahweh?

Moses uses these questions to scold the people. AT: "You should not quarrel with me! You should not test Yahweh!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# To kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst?

The people use this question to accuse Moses of wanting to kill them. AT: "You only brought us out here to kill us and our children and cattle by not letting us have any water to drink!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
