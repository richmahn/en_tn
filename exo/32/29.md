# You have been placed into Yahweh's service

This probably means "You have been chosen to serve Yahweh" or "You have become Yahweh's servants."

# for each of you has taken action against his son and his brother

The fact that they did this in obedience to God can be stated clearly. Alternate translation: "for you have obeyed Yahweh and killed your sons and your brothers" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
