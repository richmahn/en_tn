# Now then

The word "now" is used here to mark a break in what Yahweh was telling Moses. Here Yahweh tells what he will do to the people.

# My anger will burn hot against them

Yahweh speaks of his anger as if it were a fire that could burn hot. Alternate translation: "My anger towards them will be terrible" or "I am extremely angry with them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# from you

The word "you" refers to Moses. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
