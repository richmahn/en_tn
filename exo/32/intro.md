# Exodus 32 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

The events of this chapter occur while Moses spoke with God and therefore happen at the same time as chapters 20-31.

Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 32:18, which is an important quotation.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Idolatry #####
The making of the golden calf was considered a form of idolatry. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
