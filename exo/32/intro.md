# Exodus 32 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

The events of this chapter occur while Moses spoke with God and therefore happen at the same time as the events in chapters 20-31.

Some translations set each line of poetry farher to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetry in 32:18.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Idolatry #####
The making of the golden calf was considered a form of idolatry. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
