# So I said to them, 'Whoever has any gold, let him take it off.'

This can be stated as an indirect quote. Alternate translation: "So I told them that whoever had any gold should take it off" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])

# I threw it into the fire, and out came this calf

Instead of taking ownership for making the calf, Aaron claims the calf came out of the fire supernaturally.
