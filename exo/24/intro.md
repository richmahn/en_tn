# Exodus 24 General Notes #

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Moses' covenant #####
The people of Israel promise to obey the covenant Yahweh made with Moses. Their continued blessings were contingent upon their obedience to this covenant. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/promise]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/covenant]])

##### God's holiness #####
Because Yahweh is perfectly holy, he can only be approached in a certain way. Because of this, only Moses was allowed near Yahweh. This is also why Yahweh is described as a "devouring fire." (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/holy]])
