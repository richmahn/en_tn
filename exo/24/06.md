# Moses took half of the blood and put it into basins

Moses collected half of the blood in basins in order to splash it on the people in [Exodus 24:8](./08.md). This would confirm the people's participation in the covenant between the people of Israel and God.

# he sprinkled the other half onto the altar

Here the altar represents God. This would confirm God's participation in the covenant between God and the people of Israel.
