# All the cattle of Egypt died

This is exaggerated to emphasize the seriousness of the event. There were still some animals alive that were afflicted by later plagues. However, it may be best to translate this with the word "All." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# cattle of Egypt

Here "Egypt" refers to the people of Egypt. AT: "the cattle belonging to the people of Egypt" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
