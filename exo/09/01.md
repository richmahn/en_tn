Yahweh continues talking with Moses about dealing with Pharaoh and bringing the Hebrew people out of Egypt.

## if you refuse to let them go, if you still keep them back ##

AT: "If you still refuse to let them go" (UDB); (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

## then Yahweh's hand will be on your cattle ##

Yahweh will show his power by sending a terrible disease upon the Egyptians' livestock. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
