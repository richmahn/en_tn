Bezalel's work crew continues to build the tabernacle and furniture.

# He made ... and a half cubits

For 37:4-6 see how you translated many of these words in [Exodus 25:13-14](../25/13.md) and [Exodus 25:17](../25/17.md).

# He made

Though "he" refers to Bezalel, "he" may include all of the workers who assisted him.
