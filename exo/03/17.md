# a land flowing with milk and honey

"a land where milk and honey flow." God spoke of the land being good for animals and plants as if the milk and honey from those animals and plants were flowing through the land. See how you translated this in [Exodus 3:8](./08.md). Alternate translation: "a land that is excellent for raising livestock and growing crops" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# honey

Since honey is produced from flowers, this represents food from crops. Alternate translation: "food from crops" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
