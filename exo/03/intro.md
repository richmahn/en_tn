# Exodus 03 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

This chapter records one of the most important events in the history of the Israelite people: the revelation of the name Yahweh at the burning bush. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/reveal]])

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### God's holiness #####
God is so holy that people could not look upon him without dying. This is why Moses covered his eyes. It is also why he took off his shoes. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/holy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### Yahweh #####
The name Yahweh is sacred in the Hebrew religion. It is the personal name of God, which he revealed to Moses. It is by this name, he is known. Yahweh means "I am." Some translations use all capitals to set this apart, "I AM." Great care must be taken in translating the phrase "I am that I am." (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/yahweh]])
