# God said to Moses, "I AM THAT I AM."

This is God's response to Moses' question about God's name. This can be made explicit. AT: "God said to Moses, 'Tell them that God says his name is, "I AM THAT I AM."'"

# I AM THAT I AM

Possible meanings are 1) this whole sentence is God's name or 2) God is not telling his name but something about himself. By saying this, God is teaching that he is eternal; he has always lived and always will live.

# I AM

Languages that do not have an equivalent to the verb "am" may need to render this as "I LIVE" or "I EXIST."
