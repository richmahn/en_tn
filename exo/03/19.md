# General Information:

# unless his hand is forced

This can be stated in active form. The word "hand" is a metonymy for the power of the owner of the hand. Possible meanings are 1) "only if he sees that he has no power to do anything else," where the "hand" belongs to Pharaoh; where the "hand" belongs to Yahweh, 2) "only if I force him to let you go" or 3) "not even if I force him to let you go." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# I will reach out with my hand and attack

Here "hand" refers to God's power. AT: "I will powerfully attack" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# will not go empty-handed

The word here "empty-handed" is used to emphasize the opposite meaning. AT: "will go with your hands full of good things" or "will go with many valuable things" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
