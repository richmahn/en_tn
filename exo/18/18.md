# You will surely wear yourselves out

"you will surely make yourselves very tired"

# This burden is too heavy for you

Jethro speaks of the hard work that Moses is doing as if it were a physical burden that Moses was carrying. AT: "This work is too much for you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
