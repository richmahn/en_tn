Yahweh continues telling Moses what the people must do.

## for them to give light from it ##

"so they shine light from it"

## and its accessories ##

The tongs, and the trays.

## you are being shown on the mountain ##

AT: "I am showing you on the mountain" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
