# Festival of Ingathering

This festival was also known as the Festival of Shelters or the Festival of Booths. The idea came from the practice of the farmers living in temporary booths, or huts, out in the fields to guard the crop as it ripened. The word "Ingathering" means when they harvest their crop.
