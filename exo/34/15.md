# Connecting Statement:

Yahweh continues to tell Moses how his people are to behave towards outsiders.

# for they prostitute themselves to their gods

God speaks of people worshiping other gods as if they were prostitutes going to other men. Alternate translation: "for they worship other gods" or "because they worship other gods like prostitutes who go to other men" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# you will eat some of his sacrifice

The consequence of eating food that is sacrificed to another god can be stated clearly. Alternate translation: "you will eat some of his sacrifice and become guilty of worshiping his gods" or "and you will prostitute yourself to his god by eating some of his sacrifice" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
