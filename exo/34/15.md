Yahweh continues to tell Moses what the people must do.

## commit adultery and go after their gods ##

This compares Yahweh to a husband and the people to his wife. If they worship other gods it is like a wife who is unfaithful to her husband. AT: "worship other gods" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## You must mold no idols ##

"You must not make idols"
