## found favor in your sight ##

See how you translated this in [Exodus 33:12](../33/12.md).

## my Lord ##

The Hebrew here actually is “my Lord,” and not “Yahweh.”

## please go among us ##

Here "us" refers to Moses and the people of Israel. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-inclusive]])

## our iniquity and our sin ##

The words "iniquity" and "sin" mean basically the same thing and are combined for emphasis. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
