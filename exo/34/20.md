# buy back

Firstborn sons and firstborn donkeys belonged to Yahweh, but Yahweh did not want them sacrificed to Him. Instead, the Israelites were to sacrifice a lamb in their place. This allowed the Israelites to buy the donkeys and sons back from Yahweh.

# No one may appear before me empty-handed

God speaks of the offering as if the person was to carry it in his hands. AT: "No one may come to me without an offering" or "Everyone who comes to me must bring me an offering" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
