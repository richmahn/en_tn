# General Information:

Yahweh continues speaking to Moses.

# Do not let anyone else be seen anywhere on the mountain

Being seen doing something represents doing that. AT: "Do not let anyone else be anywhere on the mountain" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# No flocks or herds are even to graze in front of the mountain

"Even flocks or herds are not allowed to come near the mountain to eat."
