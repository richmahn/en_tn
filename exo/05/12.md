## translationNotes

* **all the land of Egypt** - This is not to be understood literally. AT: "throughout a wide area" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
* **taskmasters** - “slave drivers” or “masters.” These were Egyptians whose job was to force the Israelites to do hard work.
* **stubble** - "the part of a plant that is left over after harvest"
* **Why have you not produced all the bricks required of you** - Using a question here shows that the taskmasters were angry and harsh. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
