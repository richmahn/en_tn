# Why have you not produced all the bricks required of you ... in the past?

The taskmasters used this question to show they were angry with the lack of bricks. Alternate translation: "You are not producing enough bricks, either yesterday or today, as you did in the past!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
