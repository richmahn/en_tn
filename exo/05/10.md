# taskmasters

Egyptians whose job was to force the Israelites to do hard work. See how you translated this in [Exodus 1:11](../01/11.md).

# I will no longer give you any straw ... get straw wherever you can find it

The word "you" in these verses is plural and refers to the Israelite people. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# You yourselves must go

Here "yourselves" emphasizes that the Egyptians will no longer help them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns]])

# your workload will not be reduced

This can be stated in positive form. AT: "you must continue to make the same number of bricks as before"
