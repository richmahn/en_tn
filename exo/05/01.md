It is unclear how long Moses and Aaron waited until they went to see Pharoah.

# festival for me

This is a celebration to worship Yahweh.

# Who is Yahweh?

Pharaoh uses this question to show that he does not recognize Yahweh as a legitimate god. AT: "I do not know Yahweh" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Why should I ... let Israel go?

Pharaoh uses this question to state that he has no interest in obeying Yahweh or in letting the Israelites go to worship him. AT: "He is nothing to me and I will not let Israel go!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# listen to his voice

The words "his voice" represent the words God spoke. AT: "listen to what he says" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
