# you can find ... your workload

The word "you" is plural and refers to the Israelite people. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# You yourselves must go

Here "yourselves" emphasizes that the Egyptians will no longer help them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns]])

# your workload will not be reduced

This can be stated in positive form. Alternate translation: "you must continue to make the same number of bricks as before"
