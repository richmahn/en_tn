## translationNotes

* **You must kill the ram** - For these consecration sacrifices for the priests, it was moses, not Aaron or his sons that were to kill the animals.
* **on the altar** - Unlike the bull offering that was burned outside of the tent, the ram was to be burned on the inner alter.
* **inner parts** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:exo:29:12]].
