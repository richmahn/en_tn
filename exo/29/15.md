# You must kill the ram

For these consecration sacrifices for the priests, it was Moses, not Aaron or his sons, who had to kill the animals.

# on the altar

Unlike the bull offering that was burned outside of the tent, the ram was to be burned on the inner altar.

# the inner parts

"the organs." See how you translated this in [Exodus 29:13](./12.md).
