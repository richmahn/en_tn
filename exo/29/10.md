Yahweh continues speaking to Moses.

## tent of meeting ##

See how you translated this in [Exodus 27:20](../27/20.md).

## You must kill the bull ##

The bull offering was to be killed by Moses, not the priests, at the doorway, not inside the tent of meeting.

## kill the bull ##

Since the following verses will tell what to do with the blood from the bull, use a term for "kill" that will imply a method similar to "slit its throat and catch the blood in a bowl" (UDB).
