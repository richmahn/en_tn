## translationNotes

* Yahweh continues speaking to Moses.
* **tent of meeting** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:exo:27:20]].
* **You must kill the bull** - The bull offering was to be killed by Moses, not the priests, at the doorway, not inside the tent of meeting.
* **kill the bull** - Since the following verses will tell what to do with the blood from the bull, use a term for "kill" that will imply a method similar to "slit its throat and catch the blood in a bowl" (UDB).
