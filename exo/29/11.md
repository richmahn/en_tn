# You must kill the bull

The bull offering was to be killed by Moses, not the priests, at the doorway, not inside the tent of meeting.

# kill the bull

Since the following verses will tell what to do with the blood from the bull, use a term for "kill" that will imply a method similar to "slitting its throat and catch the blood in a bowl." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
