# General Information:

Yahweh continues speaking to Moses.

# The holy garments of Aaron must also be reserved for his sons after him

These garments belong to the priesthood and are not just Aaron's personal clothing. AT: "Aaron must reserve the holy garments for his sons after him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# They are to be anointed in them and ordained to me in them

This can be stated in active form. AT: "They must wear the holy garments when you anoint his sons and ordain them to me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# tent of meeting

This is another name for the tabernacle. See how you translated this in [Exodus 27:21](../27/20.md).
