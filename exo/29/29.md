## translationNotes

* Yahweh continues speaking to Moses.
* **The holy garments of Aaron must also be reserved for his sons after him** - These garments belong to the priesthood, not just Aaron's personal clothing. AT: "Aaron must reserve the holy garments for his sons after him" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
* **They are to be anointed in them and consecrated to me in them** - AT: "They must wear the holy garments when you anoint his sons and consecrate them to me"
* **tent of meeting** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:exo:27:20]].
