Yahweh continues speaking to Moses.

## The holy garments of Aaron must also be reserved for his sons after him ##

These garments belong to the priesthood, not just Aaron's personal clothing. AT: "Aaron must reserve the holy garments for his sons after him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## They are to be anointed in them and consecrated to me in them ##

AT: "They must wear the holy garments when you anoint his sons and consecrate them to me"

See how you translated this in [Exodus 27:20](../27/20.md).
