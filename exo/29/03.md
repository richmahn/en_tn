# You must put them

"You must put the bread, cake, and wafer"

# present them with the bull and the two rams

Here "present" means to offer as a sacrifice. The full meaning of this can be translated clearly. AT: "offer them to me when you sacrifice the bull and the two rams" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# tent of meeting

This is another name for the tabernacle. See how you translated this in [Exodus 27:21](../27/20.md).
