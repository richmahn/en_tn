2TH	front	intro	krd6			0		# Introduction to 2 Thessalonians\n\n## Part 1: General Introduction\n\n### Outline of the Book of 2 Thessalonians\n\n1. Greetings and thanksgiving (1:1-2)\n1. Believers suffer from persecution (1:3-12)\n       * God uses persecution to increase faith, love, and endurance in believers (1:3-4)\n       * God is just: (1:5-12)\n          * God will make believers worthy of his kingdom \n          * God will give relief to believers \n          * God will punish those who persecute believers  \n1. Some believers misunderstand about the second coming of Christ (2:1-12)\n      * Christ’s return has not yet happened (2:1-2)\n      * Instruction about the events that will precede the return of Christ (2:3-12)\n1. Paul’s confidence that God will save the Thessalonian believers (2:13-17)\n      * Paul calls the Thessalonian believers to “stand firm” (2:13-15)\n      * Paul prays that God will comfort them (2:16-17)\n1. Paul requests that the Thessalonian believers pray for him (3:1-5)\n1. Paul give commands about idle believers (3:6-15)\n1. Closing (3:16-17)\n\n### Who wrote 2 Thessalonians?\n\nPaul wrote 2 Thessalonians. He was from the city of Tarsus. He had been known as Saul in his early life. Before becoming a Christian, Paul was a Pharisee. He persecuted believers. After he became a believer, he traveled several times throughout the Roman Empire telling people about Jesus.\n\nPaul is the author of this letter, but he includes Silvanus and Timothy as senders of the letter. Paul wrote this letter while he, Silvanus, and Timothy were staying in the city of Corinth.\n\n### What is the Book of 2 Thessalonians about?\n\nPaul wrote this letter to the believers in the city of Thessalonica. He encouraged the believers because they were being persecuted. He told them to continue living in a way that pleased God. He also wanted to teach them again about Christ’s return. He also warned them that they should not be idle but should work as they wait for Christ to return.\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nTranslators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “2 Thessalonians” or “Second Thessalonians.” Or they may choose a clearer title, such as “Paul’s Second Letter to the Church in Thessalonica,” or “The Second Letter to the Christians/believers in Thessalonica.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### What is the “second coming” of Jesus?\n\nPaul wrote much in this letter about Jesus’ eventual return to Earth. When Jesus returns, he will judge all mankind. He will also rule over creation. And he will cause there to be peace everywhere. Paul also explained that a “man of lawlessness” will come before Christ’s return. This person will obey Satan and cause many people to oppose God. But Jesus will destroy this person when he returns.\n\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\n\n### What did Paul mean by the expression “in Christ,” “in the Lord,” etc.?\n\nPaul meant to express the idea of a very close union between Christ and the believers. Please see the introduction to the Book of Romans for more details about this kind of expression.\n\n### How are pronouns used in this letter? \n\nIn this letter, the words “we” and “us” refer to Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, unless otherwise noted. If your language differentiates between inclusive and exclusive pronouns, use an exclusive pronoun for these. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]]) \n\n\nIn this letter, the words “you” and “your” are plural and refer to the Thessalonian believers. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])\n\n### What are the major issues in the text of the Book of 2 Thessalonians?\n\nFor the following verses, some ancient manuscripts have a different reading than others. The ULT follows the reading that scholars consider to be the most accurate and puts the other reading in a footnote. If a translation of the Bible exists in your area that your people are familiar with, consider using the reading that it follows. If not, translators are advised to follow the reading in the ULT.\n* “and the man of lawlessness is revealed” (2:3). The ULT, UST, and most modern versions read this way. Other versions follow the reading, “and the man of sin is revealed.”\n* “For God chose you as the firstfruits for salvation” (2:13) The ULT, UST, and some other versions read this way. The other reading is, “For God chose you from the first/beginning for salvation.”\n\n(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
2TH	1	intro	m987			0		# 2 Thessalonians 1 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nVerses 1-2 formally introduce this letter. Letters in the ancient Near East commonly had introductions of this type in which the sender identified himself, then the recipient, then gave a greeting. \n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### Paradox\n\nA paradox is a true statement that appears to describe something impossible. A paradox occurs in verses 4-5: “We talk about your patience and faith in all your persecutions. We talk about the afflictions that you endure. This is a sign of God’s righteous judgment.” People would not normally think that believing in God while being persecuted is a sign of God’s righteous judgment. But in verses 5-10, Paul explains how God will reward those who believe in him and how he will judge those who afflict them. ([2 Thessalonians 1:4-5](./04.md))
