Saul and Samuel (8:1–15:35)\n    * Samuel lets the people seek a king (8:1–22)\n    * Saul anointed king (9:1–10:27)\n    * Battle and victory over the Ammonites (11:1–15)\n    * Samuel’s farewell (12:1–25)\n    * Saul’s weakness and failures (13:1–15:35)\n1. David and his conflicts with Saul (16:1–31:13)\n    * God’s choice of David to be king (16:1–23)\n    * David fights Goliath (17:1–58)\n    * Saul’s jealousy of David; David and Jonathan (18:1–20:42)\n    * David in the wilderness; David in Philistia (21:1–30:31)\n    * Death of Saul (31:1–13)\n\n### What is the Book of 1 Samuel about?\n\nThe Book of 1 Samuel is about Samuel, Saul, and David. Samuel was the last of the judges over Israel. Saul was the first king of Israel. Much of the book is about how Saul became king, then how he later sinned against God and died. God chose David to be king after Saul. This book shows how God protected David when Saul tried to kill him.\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nTranslators can use the traditional title “1 Samuel” or “First Samuel.” Or, translators may consider a clearer title such as “The First Book About Samuel, Saul, and David.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])\n\n### What is the purpose of the Book of 1 Samuel?\n\nThe purpose of 1 Samuel is to give an account of the events leading up to David becoming king of Israel. In 1 Samuel, the twelve tribes of Israel unite under the first king of Israel, Saul. But Saul does not obey Yahweh’s commands. So God uses Samuel to choose David as a king who will trust and obey Yahweh.\n\n### Who wrote the Book of 1 Samuel?\n\nIt is uncertain who wrote 1 Samuel. It may have been someone alive soon after King Solomon died. When Solomon died, the kingdom of Israel split into two kingdoms. The author probably lived in the southern kingdom of Judah. A descendant of David continued to rule over the southern kingdom. The author may have written 1 Samuel to defend David’s right to be king. This would prove that David’s descendant was the rightful king of God’s people.\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### Who is “Yahweh’s anointed”?\n\nThe writer of 1 Samuel often speaks of “Yahweh’s anointed.” This refers to the one whom Yahweh chose to be the king of his people. Also, the phrase “Yahweh’s anointed” would make later readers think about the future descendant of David who would become king of God’s people. This person who Yahweh chose would be known as the Messiah. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/anoint]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/peopleofgod]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/christ]])\n\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\n\n### What are curses, as found in 1 Samuel and elsewhere?\n\nA curse is a strong statement a person makes to cause bad things to happen to the person or thing being cursed. A curse usually has this pattern: “May God do so to you, and even more, if you hide anything from me of all the words that he spoke to you” (1 Sam. 3:17). Other instances of curses in 1 and 2 Samuel are found in 1 Sam 14:44; 20:13; 25:22; 2 Sam 3:9, 35; and 19:13. The translator should represent a curse in the project language in as strong a way as possible.\n\n### How is the name “Israel” used in the Bible?\n\nThe name “Israel” is used in many different ways in the Bible. Jacob was the son of Isaac. God changed his name to Israel. The descendants of Jacob became a nation also called Israel. Eventually, the nation of Israel split into two kingdoms. The northern kingdom was named Israel. The southern kingdom was named Judah. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/israel]])\n\nThe Book of 1 Samuel has two references to Israel and Judah ([1 Samuel 17:52](../17/52.md), [1 Samuel 18:16](../18/16.md)). However, these references appear in the text long before the two kingdoms split apart. It seems clear that the references to Israel and Judah are in the text because the author wrote at a time after the kingdoms split. He wanted the readers to understand that all the twelve tribes had supported David.\n\n### What is the meaning of the phrase “to this day”?\n\nThis phrase was used by the narrator to refer to the time when he was writing. The translator should be aware that “to this day” refers to a time already passed. He must avoid giving the impression that the present day of the translation’s readers is meant. The translator might decide to say, “to this day, at the time when this is being written” or “to this day, at the time of writing.” This phrase occurs in 1 Samuel 5:5; 6:18: 27:6; 30:25.
1:intro	cj3l				0	# 1 Samuel 1 Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter is the beginning of the first section of the book of 1 Samuel, chapters 1–7, which describe Samuel as a religious leader of Israel. This chapter tells how Samuel was born and how his parents dedicated him to Yahweh.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Why does the author use the name Ramathaim Zophim for Ramah in 1:1?\n\nThe author says in 1:1 that Elkanah was from a town called Ramathaim Zophim. However, in all subsequent references in the book, the author uses the name Ramah for the town where Elkanah and later his son Samuel lived. The word Ramathaim is the dual of the word Ramah, which means “hill.” The city may have been built on two hills, and it may originally have had the name Ramathaim. This name may eventually have been shortened to Ramah, but the author may wish to use the original name for clarity and accuracy in his historical account. The author adds the term Zophim, meaning that this was where the descendants of a man named Zuph lived. He does this to distinguish this city from the three other cities in the land of Canaan that also had the name Ramah. In your translation, you could use the name Ramathaim Zophim and spell it the way it sounds in your language. However, if your readers might wonder why the author says in 1:19 that Elkanah and his family returned to “their house in Ramah,” in 1:1 you could use a description such as “the city called Ramah where the descendants of Zuph live.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate]])\n\n### Why does the author call the tent of meeting the “temple” in 1:9?\n\nThe author says in 1:9 that the priest Eli was sitting by the doorpost of “the temple of Yahweh.” However, Yahweh had no temple at this time. King Solomon built a temple for him in Jerusalem many years later. It could be that this account was written or edited after the temple was built and that the author knew that his readers would understand that he was using that term to mean generally the place where the Israelites worshiped Yahweh. Alternatively, the author could have been speaking of the tent of meeting in elevated language. The word that is often translated as “temple” can also mean “palace.” The author may have felt that the place where Yahweh was present among his people deserved to be described in grand language as a temple or palace. However, if it would not be clear to your readers that in 1:9 he means the tent of meeting, you could use the word that you have been using in your translation for that structure. The UST models one way to do that.\n\n### Why does Elkanah say “may Yahweh raise up his word” when Yahweh has not said anything?\n\nIn 1:23, Elkanah says “may Yahweh raise up his word,” that is, “may Yahweh do what he has said,” even though the author has not recorded Yahweh saying anything. It could be that Elkanah is referring to what Eli said to Hannah in 1:17, “may the God of Israel grant your request.” Elkanah would be considering that what Yahweh’s priest had spoken constituted a “word” from Yahweh himself. Hannah’s request involved not only her having a son but that son having a long life throughout which he was specially dedicated to God and effective in his service. Elkanah could be wishing that Yahweh would make all of these things happen. Another possibility is that the term translated as “word” could have the meaning of “thing” or “matter” in this context. In that case Elkanah would be saying “may Yahweh accomplish his purpose” for the child. He would not be referring to anything that Yahweh had explicitly said.\n\n### What “vow” did Elkanah make?\n\nIn 1:21, the author says that Elkanah went to Shiloh to sacrifice a “vow.” He is referring to a sacrifice that Elkanah had promised to make, and he assumes that readers will understand what he means by this. However, he has not described Elkanah making a vow. The most probable explanation is that the previous year, Hannah had told Elkanah that Eli had said to her, “may the God of Israel grant your request.” Elkanah would then have made a vow that if God would indeed grant this request, he would offer a special sacrifice. Some interpreters suggest that Elkanah made this vow when, as 1:19 says, the family worshiped Yahweh the morning after Eli spoke with Hannah. However, since the text does not state any of this explicitly, it would probably be best to express the meaning of the term “vow” without saying what Elkanah vowed or when. A note to 1:21 suggests one way to do that.\n

2:intro	fe7v				0	# 1 Samuel 2 Introduction\r\n\r\n## Structure and Formatting\r\n\r\nThis chapter continues the first section of the book, chapters 1–7, which describe Samuel as a religious leader of Israel. This chapter tells how Samuel’s mother Hannah celebrated his birth with a song. It also tells how the sons of the high priest Eli dishonored Yahweh by stealing from his offerings. This information leads into the action of the next chapter, in which Samuel has a central role.\r\n\r\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with Hannah’s poetic prayer in 2:1–10 .\r\n\r\n## Religious and Cultural Issues in This Chapter\r\n\r\n### Why did Hannah speak of a “king” when Israel had no king?\r\n\r\nHannah says at the end of her prayer that Yahweh will “give strength to his king and lift up the horn of his anointed one” (2:10). Israel had no king at this time. However, the people may have been expecting that Yahweh might soon appoint a king for them. The law of Moses said in [Deuteronomy 17:14–20](../deu/17/04.md) that Israel could have a king, and it described there what kind of person he had to be and how he needed to conduct himself. The enemies of the Israelites were trying to conquer their territory, and the Israelites were wishing for a king to defend them, as Samuel describes in [12:12](../12/12.md). It was the baby whose birth Hannah was celebrating in this prayer, Samuel, whom Yahweh told to anoint Saul as Israel’s first king and then to anoint David as a king who would obey him more faithfully. So it seems that Yahweh also gave Hannah prophetic insight into what he would soon do for Israel through her son. That is why she was able to speak confidently in this prayer about what Yahweh would do for Israel’s king.\r\n\r\n### What should have happened when people brought sacrifices?\r\n\r\nThe law of Moses said that when Israelites brought animals to Yahweh as sacrifices, they should slaughter the animal and cut it into pieces. They should lift up the breast and the fat to offer them to Yahweh and that a priest should burn the fat. The priest could then roast and eat the breast. The people would boil the rest of the meat from the animal. The law told them to give the right thigh to the priest. But the people could then eat the rest of the animal with their family and friends as a festive meal. The law of Moses also said that the people making the sacrifice should cut the fat off the meat and that the priests should burn this fat as a sacrifice to Yahweh. In this chapter, the author describes how Eli’s sons disobeyed these regulations and took more for themselves from the sacrifices than they were entitled to have. This was disrespectful and dishonoring to Yahweh, as a prophet tells Eli in this chapter and as Yahweh tells Samuel in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\r\n\r\n### Poetry in Hannah’s prayer\r\n\r\nIn several places in her prayer in verses 1–10, Hannah speaks consecutive phrases that mean basically the same thing. The second phrase emphasizes the meaning of the first one by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry made frequent use of this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. It may be clearer in your language to connect the phrases with a word that shows that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. For example, in verse 1 you might say, “My heart rejoices in Yahweh, indeed, my horn is high in Yahweh.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])\r\n\r\n### Hannah’s use of the third person\r\n\r\nIn her prayer, although she is addressing Yahweh, Hannah speaks about him respectfully in the third person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this consistently in the first person. For example, as the UST illustrates, you could say “you, Yahweh” rather than simply “Yahweh.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])\r\n\r\n### thunder\r\n\r\nA note to 2:10 explains that in her prayer, Hannah uses the term “thunder” to speak of God’s impending judgment against those who oppose him. That note suggests that you could express the idea behind the term with a phrase about impending judgement. However, the author uses this same term “thunder” in [1:6](../01/06.md) to mean that Peninnah was trying to make Hannah so upset that she would lose control of her emotions. Hannah is saying here, in effect, “Be careful of trying to cause thunder—you might make Yahweh thunder against you!” So that your readers can recognize this connection, you may wish to retain the thunder image in your translation and use the same term in 1:6 as in 2:10. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\r\n\r\n### Why does the author say “at the face of” instead of “to the face of” in verses 11, 17, and 18?\r\n\r\nIn three places in this chapter, the author slightly varies the usual phrase “to the face of” and says “at the face of.” In 2:11, the word “at” probably indicates that Samuel was “serving Yahweh” not just in the presence of Eli but together with him, under his guidance and direction. In 2:17, the word “at” may indicate that Eli’s sons were not just committing a great sin in the presence of Yahweh but against him personally, against his honor and holiness. In 2:18, conversely, the word “at” may indicate that Samuel was not merely serving Yahweh in his presence but with personal devotion. For each verse, a note suggests a way to express these possible meanings, and the UST models another way to do that. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])\r\n\r\n### The author’s reintroduction of participants\r\n\r\nIn this chapter, after Hannah’s prayer, the author alternates between describing the wickedness of Eli’s sons and the growth of Samuel into a godly young man. He does this to draw a contrast that shows why Yahweh ultimately chose to replace the descendants of Eli with a different line of priests and to have Samuel lead the nation. The author alternately reintroduces Eli or his sons and Samuel at 2:12, 2:18, 2:22, and 2:26, and he introduces the “man of God” as a new participant in 2:27. Your language may have its own way of introducing or reintroducing participants that you can use in your translation in these places. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])\r\n\r\n### A long quotation within a quotation in 2:27–36\r\n\r\nWhen the man of God speaks to Eli in 2:27–36, first he attributes what he says to Yahweh, then he communicates Yahweh’s message. As a result, there is a long second-level quotation (that is, a quotation within a quotation) in these verses. In 2:36, it becomes a third-level quotation. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there it is all a first-level quotation. For example, changing the text of the ULT only slightly, in 2:27 you might say, “Yahweh asks you whether revealing himself, he did not reveal himself to the house of your father in their being in Egypt, to the house of Pharaoh.” In 2:28 you might say, “Yahweh says that he chose him from all of the tribes of Israel for himself for a priest, to go up on his altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod to his face. He says that he gave to the house of your father all of the gifts of the sons of Israel.” The UST models further ways of translating this part of the chapter so that there are not quotations within quotations. ((See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])\r\n\r\n### A “faithful” priest or an “established” priest (2:35)?\r\n\r\nIn 2:35, the word that the ULT translates as “faithful” is actually the same word that it translates as “established” in the second part of that verse and in 3:20. Yahweh could be saying that Samuel will be an “established priest” in the sense that he and his descendants will serve “all of the days,” that is, perpetually, by contrast with the descendants of Eli. In that case, 3:20 would be a confirmation of what Yahweh says here. However, the immediate context suggests that Yahweh may be using the same term in two different senses, as was common in prophetic speech, which often had poetic characteristics. Yahweh says that this priest “will do just as is in my heart and in my soul,” meaning that he will be loyal and obedient. That is why ULT translates the term as “faithful.” But the term really could have either meaning. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of ULT.\r\n\n

4:intro	a7dh				0	# 1 Samuel 4 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n### The Ark of the Covenant in Philistine country\n\nThis chapter begins a new section on the Ark and the Philistines. It recounts two battles between Israel and the Philistines. In both battles, Israel was badly defeated and, in the second, the Ark was captured.\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### The Ark is captured\n\nThe Philistine army invaded Israel, and Israel’s army went to fight them but was defeated. Israel decided that if they took the Ark into the next battle, God would cause them to win. When Eli’s sons took the Ark into the next battle and the Philistines won the battle, they killed Eli’s two sons and captured the Ark. When Eli heard the Ark was captured, he fell over, broke his neck, and died. Hearing this news, his daughter-in-law named her baby “the glory has departed.”\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Rhetorical Question\n\nThe Philistines expressed their fear using a rhetorical question: “Who will protect us from the strength of this mighty God?” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
4:1	ahq8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ebenezer … Aphek	0	These are the names of places.
4:2	in3q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	Israel was defeated by the Philistines, who killed	0	This can be translated in active form. Alternate translation: “the Philistines defeated the Israelites and killed”
4:2	c78l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers	about four thousand men	0	Here the number four thousand is a round number. There may have been a few more than that or a few less than that. The word “about” shows that it is not an exact number. Alternate translation: “about 4,000 men”
4:3	v2ec			the people	0	the soldiers who had been fighting the battle
4:3	d9z9			Why has Yahweh defeated us today before the Philistines? Let us bring … enemies	0	The elders truly did not know why Yahweh had defeated them, but they wrongly thought they knew how to make sure it did not happen again, by bringing the ark to be with them.
4:4	s4ks		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	who sits above the cherubim	0	You may need to make explicit that the cherubim are those on the lid of the ark of the covenant. The biblical writers often spoke of the ark of the covenant as if it were Yahweh’s footstool upon which he rested his feet as he sat on his throne in heaven above. Alternate translation: “who sits on his throne above the cherubim on the ark of the covenant”
4:4	vz4l			Phinehas	0	This Phinehas is not the same as the grandson of Aaron in Exodus and Numbers.
4:4	w7gp			were there	0	were in Shiloh
4:5	ym2q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	When the ark of the covenant of Yahweh came into the camp	0	“When the people carried the ark of the covenant of Yahweh into the camp” Some languages may need to add understood information to make the meaning clear.

4:6	hsc8			the ark of Yahweh had come into the camp	0	Alternate translation: “the people had carried the ark of Yahweh into the camp”
4:7	hw97			they said … They said	0	“they said to themselves … They said to each other” or “they said to each other … They said to each other.” The second clause clearly refers to what the Philistines said to each other. The first clause probably refers to what they thought, though it could also refer to what they said to each other. If possible, avoid stating who was spoken to.
4:7	n37y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pronouns	A god has come	0	The Philistines worshiped many gods, so they probably believed that one of those gods, or one whom they did not worship, had come into the camp. Another possible meaning is that they were speaking the proper name of the God of Israel: “Yahweh has come.” Because 4:8 speaks of “gods,” some translations read, “Gods have come,” that is, “It is gods who have come.”
4:8	xaq3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	Who will protect us from the strength of these mighty gods?	0	This rhetorical question is an expression of deep fear. It can be written as a statement. Alternate translation: “There is no one who can protect us from these mighty gods.”
4:8	rx6y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pronouns	these mighty gods … the gods who attacked	0	Because the word “god” (or “God”) in 4:7 is singular, many translations read “this mighty god … the god who attacked,” referring to any one of many possible gods, or “this mighty God … the God who attacked,” using the proper name of the God of Israel.
4:9	b9tg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	be men	0	This is an idiom. Alternate translation: “be strong and fight”
4:10	bt9k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	Israel was defeated	0	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

4:11	s6sx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	The ark of God was taken	0	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “The Philistines also took the ark of God”
4:12	x321			clothes torn and earth on his head	0	This is a way to express deep mourning in Israelite culture.
4:13	tx5e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	his heart trembled with concern	0	This is an idiom which means he was very fearful or terribly concerned about something.
4:13	l3my		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	the whole city	0	This is a metonym for “all the people in the city.”

4:16	c94p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	my son	0	Eli was not the other man’s true father. Eli speaks as if he were the man’s father to show the man that he is not angry but that the man needs to answer him.
4:17	q67g			Israel fled from the Philistines	0	This is a general statement about what happened. The rest of the man’s words give details.
4:17	knm8			Also, there has been … people. Also, your two sons	0	Alternate translation: “I will now tell you something worse … I will now tell you something worse” or “Not only has there been … people, but your two sons”
4:17	b1fy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	the ark of God has been taken	0	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “the Philistines have taken the ark of God”
4:18	li8q			When he mentioned	0	Alternate translation: “When the man of Benjamin mentioned”
4:18	duf3			mentioned	0	Alternate translation: “spoke of”
4:18	gqt1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	His neck was broken	0	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “His neck broke because he fell” or “He broke his neck when he fell”
4:19	cm81			his daughter-in-law	0	Eli’s daughter-in-law
4:19	px5m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	the ark of God was captured	0	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “the Philistines had captured the ark of God”

4:21	eja5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ichabod	0	The name is actually a phrase that means “no glory.” The name of a person sometimes reveals information about the person, place, or thing it refers to.
4:21	b2am		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	for the ark of God had been captured	0	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

Alternate translation: “because the Philistines have captured the ark of God”

Saul would then begin prophesying and God would give him the Holy Spirit to help him to know what to do. Samuel told everyone to come to Mizpah where he announced that God had chosen Saul to be their king. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/holyspirit]])\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Rhetorical questions\n\nThis chapter uses rhetorical questions to express different ideas: to state a fact (“Has not Yahweh anointed you to be a ruler over his inheritance?”), to express surprise (“And who is their father?”), to say he is someone very special (“Do you see the man that Yahweh has chosen?”), and to express contempt (“How can this man save us?”). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])\n\n### Idioms\n\nSamuel frequently uses idioms when prophesying: “going to God” means “going to worship God”; “take it from their hands” means “accept their gift”; “rush upon you” means “control you”; “hand finds to do” means “what you think you should do”; “God is with you” means “God is directing you”; “another heart” means “a different way of thinking”; “came to pass” means “happened”; “before Yahweh” means “to do work for Yahweh”; and “hearts God had touched” means “God had made them want to help Saul.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

17:intro	abch				0	# 1 Samuel 17 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter introduced David as a soldier, a skill that will be important for the rest of his life.\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### David kills Goliath\n\nTrust in God is more powerful than physical might or military training and equipment. David, trusting in the Lord and armed only with a sling, defeats Goliath who is well-armed and physically strong but who did not believe in Yahweh. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/trust]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/believe]])\n\n### Uncircumcised\n\nThe people of Israel often used the term “uncircumcised” to refer to Gentiles. Here it is used to describe the Philistines. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/circumcise]])\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Rhetorical questions\n\nDavid uses rhetorical questions to state his desire to fight the giant: “What will be done for the man who kills this Philistine and takes away the disgrace from Israel? Who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should defy the armies of the living God?” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])\n\nHis brother uses rhetorical questions to show his disdain for his younger brother, whom he thinks is pretending to be bigger than he really is: “Why did you come down here? With whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness?” David defends himself with some questions: “What have I done now? Was it not just a question?”\n\nGoliath also uses a rhetorical question to show his contempt for young David: “Am I a dog, that you come to me with sticks?”

18:intro	abci				0	# 1 Samuel 18 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis is the first chapter of a section explaining why Saul wants to kill David.\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetic song in 18:7.\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Saul is jealous of David’s popularity\nSaul’s son, Jonathan, loves David. David is successful in battling the Philistines, and Saul is happy until the women give David more attention than they give him. He fears that David will replace him as king. This is potentially confusing because the author has already established that David will be the next king. It is probably that Saul feared David would kill him in order to be the next king sooner, or that he did not really believe David would be the next king. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/love]])\n\n### Jonathan’s love of David\nSome scholars believe Jonathan loved David as a man loves his wife. There is no reason to translate this as if Jonathan were a homosexual. Instead, treat this as a brotherly type of love.
18:1	w8c4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	the soul of Jonathan was bound to the soul of David	0	Very close friendship is spoken of as if it were binding together the souls of two people.

The ULT does this with the poetic song in 29:5.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\nIt is unclear whether David wanted to go into battle with the Philistines. He would have been fighting against Saul, but he also would have been fighting against Israel’s soldiers.
