# Beloved

"You people whom I love" or "Dear friends." See how you translated this in [1 John 2:7](../02/07.md).

# if God so loved us

"since God loved us in this way"

# we also should love one another

"believers are to love other believers"

# God remains in us ... we remain in him and he in us

To remain in someone means to continue to have fellowship with him. See how you translated "remains in God" in [1 John 2:5-6](../02/04.md). AT: "God continues to have fellowship with us ... we continue to have fellowship with God and he continues to have fellowship with us" or "God stays joined to us ... we stay joined to God and he stays joined to us" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# and he in us

The word "remains" is understood from the previous phrase. AT: "and he remains in us" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# his love is perfected in us

"God's love is complete in us"

# By this we know ... us, because he has given

Your translation may be clearer if you omit either "by this" or "because." AT: "We know ... us because he gave" or "By this we know ... us: he gave"

# because he has given us some of his Spirit

"because he gave us his Spirit" or "because he has put his Holy Spirit in us." This phrase, however, does not imply that God has less of his Spirit after he has given us some.

# Also, we have seen and have borne witness that the Father has sent the Son to be the Savior of the world

"And we apostles have seen the Son of God and tell everyone that God the Father has sent his Son to save people on this earth"

# Father ... Son

These are important titles that describe the relationship between God and Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
