# 1 John 04 General Notes #

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Spirit #####
This word "spirit" is used in different ways in this chapter. Sometimes the word "spirit" refers to spiritual beings. Sometimes it refers to the character of something. For example "the spirit of the antichrist," "the spirit of truth," and  "the spirit of error" refer to what is typical of the antichrist, truth, and error. "The Spirit" (written with a capital "S") and "the Spirit of God" refer to God. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/antichrist]])

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### Loving God #####
If people love God, they should show it in the way they live and the way they treat other people. Doing this may assure us that God has saved us and that we belong to him, but loving others does not save us. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/save]])
