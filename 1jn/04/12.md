# God remains in us ... we remain in him and he in us

To remain in someone means to continue to have fellowship with him. See how you translated "remains in God" in [1 John 2:5-6](../02/04.md). Alternate translation: "God continues to have fellowship with us ... we continue to have fellowship with God and he continues to have fellowship with us" or "God stays joined to us ... we stay joined to God and he stays joined to us" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# his love is perfected in us

"God's love is complete in us"
