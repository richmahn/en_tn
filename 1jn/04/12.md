# God remains in us

To remain in someone means to continue to have fellowship with him. See how you translated "remains in God" in [1 John 2:6](../02/06.md). Alternate translation: "God continues to have fellowship with us" or "God stays joined to us" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# his love is perfected in us

"God's love is complete in us"
