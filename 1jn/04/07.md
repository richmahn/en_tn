# General Information:

John continues to teach about the new nature. He teaches his readers about God's love and loving one another.

# Beloved, let us love

"You people whom I love, let us love" or "Dear friends, let us love." See how you translated "Beloved" in [1 John 2:7](../02/07.md).

# let us love one another

"believers are to love other believers"

# and everyone who loves is born from God and knows God

"and because those who love their fellow believers have become God's children and know him"

# for love is from God

"because God causes us to love each other"

# born from God

This is a metaphor which means someone has a relationship to God like a child to his father. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
