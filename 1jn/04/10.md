# In this is love

"God showed us what real love is"

# he sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins

Here "propitiation" refers to Jesus' death on the cross appeasing God's wrath against sin. The word can be translated with a verbal phrase. AT: "he sent his Son to be the sacrifice that appeased his wrath against our sins" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
