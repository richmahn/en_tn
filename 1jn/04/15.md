## Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God ##

"Those who say the truth about Jesus, that he is the Son of God."  (UDB)

## God remains in him, and he in God ##

See how this was translated in [1 John 2:4](../02/04.md).

## God is love ##

<b>God is love<b>- This is a metaphor which means "The character of God is love." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

##  and he who remains in love remains in God, and God remains in him ##

This can be translated “those who continue to love others have a close relationship with God, and God has a close relationship with them.”)
