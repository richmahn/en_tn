# hates his brother

"hates a fellow believer"

# the one who does not love his brother, whom he has seen, cannot love God, whom he has not seen

If two negative statements in a row are confusing, this can be translated differently. Alternate translation: "the one who hates his brother, whom he has seen, cannot love God, whom he has not seen" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
