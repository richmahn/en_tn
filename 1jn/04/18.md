# Instead, perfect love throws out fear

Here "love" is described as a person with the power to remove fear. God's love is perfect. AT: "But when our love is complete, we are no longer afraid" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# because fear has to do with punishment

"because we would be afraid only if we thought that he would punish us"

# But the one who fears has not been made perfect in love

This can be stated in active form. AT: "But when a person is afraid that God will punish him, his love is not complete" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
