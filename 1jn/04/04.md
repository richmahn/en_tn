(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# therefore what they say is from the world

"The world" is a metonym ultimately for "the one who is in the world," Satan, though it is also a metonym for sinful people who gladly listen to them and so also give them authority. AT: "therefore they teach what they have learned from sinful people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# and the world listens to them
