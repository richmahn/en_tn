# Yet I am writing a new commandment to you

"But in one way the commandment I write to you is a new commandment"

# which is true in Christ and in you

"which is true, as shown in Christ's deeds and your deeds"

# the darkness is passing away, and the true light is already shining

Here "darkness" is a metaphor for "evil" and "light" is a metaphor for "good." Alternate translation: "because you are ceasing to do evil and you are doing more and more good" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
