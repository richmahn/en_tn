# Who is the liar but the one who denies that Jesus is the Christ?

"Who is the liar? Anyone who denies that Jesus is the Christ." John used a question to emphasize who liars are. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# denies that Jesus is the Christ

"refuses to say that Jesus is the Christ" or "says that Jesus is not the Messiah"

# denies the Father and the Son

"refuses to say the truth about the Father and the Son" or "rejects the Father and the Son."

# Father ... Son

These are important titles that describe the relationship between God and Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])

# has the Father

"belongs to the Father"

# acknowledges the Son

"speaks the truth about the Son"

# has the Father

"belongs to the Father"
