## translationNotes

* **Who is the liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ?** - John used a rhetorical question to emphasize who the liars are.

* **denies that Jesus is the Christ** - "refuses to say that Jesus is the Christ" or "says that Jesus is not the Christ"
* **denies the Father and the Son** - This can be translated as "refuses to say the truth about the Father and the Son" or "rejects the Father and the Son."
* **does not have the Father** - "does not belong to the Father"
* **confesses the Son** - "speaks the truth about the Son"
