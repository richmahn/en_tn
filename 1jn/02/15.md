# Do not love the world nor

In 2:15-17 the word "world" refers to all the things people want to do that do not honor God. AT: "Do not behave like the people in the world who do not honor God, and do not love" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# the things that are in the world

"the things that those who dishonor God want"

# If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him

A person cannot love this world and all that dishonors God and love the Father at the same time. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the love of the Father is not in him

"he does not love the Father"
