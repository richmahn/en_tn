# 1 John 02 General Notes #

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Antichrist #####

In this chapter John writes about both a specific antichrist and many antichrists. The word "antichrist" means "opposed to Christ." The antichrist is a person who will come in the last days and imitate Jesus' work, but he will do it for evil. Before this person comes, there will be many  people who work against Christ; they too are called "antichrists." (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/antichrist]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lastday]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/evil]])
