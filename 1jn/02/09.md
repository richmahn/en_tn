# he is in the light

This is a picture of living right. When people do what is right, they can do it in the light and not hide in the dark. AT: "he does what is right" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# is in the darkness

# there is no occasion for stumbling in him

"nothing will cause him to stumble." The word "stumbling" is a metaphor that means to fail spiritually or morally. AT: "nothing will cause him to sin" or "he will not fail to do what is pleasing to God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# is in the darkness and walks in the darkness

This same idea is said twice to bring attention to how evil it is to hate a fellow believer. AT: "is living in darkness" or "is living in the darkness of sin" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# he does not know where he is going

This is a picture of the believer who is not living as a Christian should be living. AT: "he does not know what he should do" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
