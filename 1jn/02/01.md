# General Information:

Here the words "we" and "us" refer to John and all believers. The words "him" and "his" could refer to God the Father or to Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-inclusive]])

# Connecting Statement:

John continues to write about fellowship and shows that it is possible because Jesus goes between believers and the Father.

# Children

John was an elderly man and their leader. He used this expression to show his love for them. Alternate translation: "My dear children in Christ" or "You who are as dear to me as my own children" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# I am writing these things

"I am writing this letter"

# But if anyone sins

"But when anyone sins." This is something that is likely to happen.

# we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ, the one who is righteous

The word "advocate" here refers to Jesus. Alternate translation: "we have Jesus Christ, the one who is righteous, who speaks to the Father and asks him to forgive us" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
