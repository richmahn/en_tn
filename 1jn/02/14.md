# you are strong

Here "strong" refers not to believers' physical strength, but to their faithfulness to Christ. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the word of God remains in you

"Word of God" here is a metonym for the message from God. The writer refers to the believers' increased faithfulness to Christ and knowledge of him as if he were speaking of God's word existing in them. AT: "God's message continues to teach you" or "you know the word of God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
