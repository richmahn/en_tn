"This is what he promised to give us—eternal life" or "He has promised to cause us to live forever"

# life

The word "life" throughout this letter refers to more than physical life. It stands here for Jesus, the eternal life. See how you translated this in [1 John 1:1-2](../01/01.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
