# General Information:

Here the words "he," "him," and "his" refer to God. (See: [1 John 1:5](./05.md))

# have no sin

"never sin"

# are deceiving

"are tricking" or "lying to"

# the truth is not in us

The truth is spoken of as if it were an object that could be inside believers. AT: "we do not believe what God says is true" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness

These two phrases mean basically the same thing. John uses them to emphasize that God will surely forgive our sins. AT: "and will completely forgive us of what we have done wrong" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# we make him out to be a liar

It is implied that a person who claims to be without sin would be calling God a liar since he said that everyone is a sinner. AT: "it is the same as calling him a liar, because he said we have all sinned" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# his word is not in us

Obeying and honoring God's word is spoken of as if his word were inside the believers. AT: "we do not understand God's word nor obey what he says" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
