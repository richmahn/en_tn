# 1 John 01 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

This letter does not begin in the way letters in the ancient Near East traditionally began. Instead, it begins in a similar way to the Gospel of John. Both do not really have an introduction of any kind. John appears to almost begin in the middle of an idea.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Christians and sin #####
This chapter teaches that all Christians remain sinners after they come to faith in Jesus. Despite this, God still forgives a Christian's sins. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/forgive]])

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter ####

##### Metaphors #####
There are many metaphors in this chapter, all of which are commonly used in Scripture. Light is always used in a positive way to describe righteousness. Darkness is always used in a negative way to describe unrighteousness. The Christian life is also described as a walk.
