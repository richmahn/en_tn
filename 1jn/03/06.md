# remains in him

"has a relationship with God." See how this was translated in [1 John 2:5-6](../02/04.md).

# No one ... has seen him or known him

John uses the words "seen" and "known" to say that the person who sins has never met Christ in a spiritual sense. A person behaving according to his sinful nature cannot know Christ. Alternate translation: "No one ... has ever truly believed in him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
