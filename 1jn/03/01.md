# Connecting Statement:

In this part John tells the believers about their new nature, which cannot sin.

# See what kind of love the Father has given to us

"Think about how our Father loves us so much"

# we should be called children of God

"the Father called us his children"

# children of God

Here this means people who belong to God through faith in Jesus.

# For this reason, the world does not know us, because it did not know him

Possible meanings are 1) "Because we are the children of God and because the world did not know God, it does not know us" or 2) "Because the world did not know God, it does not know us."

# the world does not know us, because it did not know him

Here "the world" refers to people who do not honor God. What the world did not know can be made explicit: Alternate translation: "those who do not honor God do not know that we belong to God, because they did not know God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
