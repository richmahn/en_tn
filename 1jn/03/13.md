## translationNotes

* **Marvel not** - "Do not be surprised."
* **brothers** - "fellow believers"
* **if the world hates you** - Here the word "world" refers to the people who do not honor God. This can be translated as "if those who do not honor God hate you who do honor God (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
* **we have passed out of death into life** - "we are no longer spiritually dead but are spiritually alive"
* **remains in death** - "is still spiritually dead"
* **Whoever hates his brother is a murderer** - This compares a person who hates another believer with a murderer. Since hatred is the cause of murder, God considers anyone who hates to be as guilty as someone who kills a person. This can be translated as "Whoever hates another believer is as guilty as someone who kills a person." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **has eternal life living in him** - "Eternal life" is something God gives believers after we die, but it is also a power God gives believers in this life to help them to stop sinning and to do what please him. This could also be translated as "has the power of spiritual life working inside of him."
