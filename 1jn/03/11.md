## And why did he kill him? Because ##

John uses a question to teach his audience. This could be translated as a statement: "He killed him because" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## his works were evil, and his younger brotherâ€™s righteous ##

This could be translated "because he was always doing evil things and his younger brother was doing good things."
