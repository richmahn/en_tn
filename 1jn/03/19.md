# Connecting Statement:

Here John probably means that believers' ability to love God and each other sincerely (See: [1 John 3:18](../03/18.md)) is a sign that their new life has indeed originated from the truth about Christ.

# we are from the truth

"we belong to the truth" or Alternate translation: "we are living according the way Jesus taught us"

# we assure our hearts

The word "heart" here refers to feelings. Alternate translation: "we do not feel guilty" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
