# My dear children

John was an elderly man and their leader. He used this expression to show his love for them. See how you translated this in [1 John 2:1](../02/01.md). Alternate translation: "My dear children in Christ" or "You who are as dear to me as my own children" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# let us not love in word nor in tongue, but in actions and truth

The phrases "in word" and "in tongue" both refer to what a person says. The word "love" is understood in the second part of the sentence. Alternate translation: "do not just say that you love people, but show that you truly love people by helping them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
