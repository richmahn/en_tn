# Connecting Statement:

For now John ends this section on the new birth and the new nature which cannot sin.

# Whoever has been born from God

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "Whoever God has made his child" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# God's seed

This speaks of the Holy Spirit, whom God gives to believers and who makes them able to resist sin and do what pleases God as if he were a physical seed that is planted in the earth and grows. This is sometimes referred to as the new nature. Alternate translation: "the Holy Spirit" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# he has been born of God

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "God has given him new spiritual life" or "he is a child of God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
