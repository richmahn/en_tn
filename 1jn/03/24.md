# remains in him, and God remains in him

To remain in someone means to continue to have fellowship with him. See how you translated "remains in God" in [1 John 2:6](../02/06.md). Alternate translation: "continues to have fellowship with him, and God continues to have fellowship with him" or "stays joined with him, and God stays joined with him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
