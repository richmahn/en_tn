# the world's goods

material possessions like money, food, or clothing

# sees his brother in need

"realizes a fellow believer needs help"

# shuts up his heart of compassion from him

Here "heart" is a metonym for "thoughts" or "emotions." Here "shuts up his heart of compassion" is a metaphor for no longer showing someone compassion. Alternate translation: "does not show him compassion" or "does not willingly help him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# how does the love of God remain in him?

John uses a question to teach his audience. Alternate translation: "God's love is not in him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
