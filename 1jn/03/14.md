# we have passed out of death into life

The conditions of living and of being dead are spoken of as if they were physical locations from which a person could leave and go to. The abstract nouns "life" and "death" can be translated with verbal phrases. Alternate translation: "we are no longer spiritually dead but are spiritually alive" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# life

The word "life" throughout this letter refers to more than physical life. It stands here for Jesus, the eternal life. See how you translated this in [1 John 1:1](../01/01.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# remains in death

"is still spiritually dead"
