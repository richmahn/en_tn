# Connecting Statement:

John teaches about Jesus Christ and what God said about him.

# This is the one who came by water and blood: Jesus Christ

"Jesus Christ is the one who came by water and blood." Here "water" is probably a metonym for the baptism of Jesus, and "blood" stands for Jesus' death on the cross. AT: "God showed that Jesus Christ is his son at Jesus' baptism and his death on the cross" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# He came not only by water, but also by water and blood

Here "water" is probably a metonym for the baptism of Jesus, and "blood" stands for Jesus' death on the cross. AT: "God did not show us Jesus was his son just through his baptism, but through his baptism and his death on the cross" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
