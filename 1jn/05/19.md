# the whole world lies in the power of the evil one

Lying in someone's power represents being controlled or ruled by him. Alternate translation: "the whole world is controlled by the evil one" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the whole world

Here "world" is a way in which some biblical writers refer to the people living in the world who are in rebellion against God and to the world system that is affected in every way by the corrupting power of sin. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
