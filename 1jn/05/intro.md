# 1 John 05 General Notes #

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Christian living #####
There is a close connection in this chapter between Christians' confession of faith in Jesus and the way they live their lives. Believing in Jesus requires one to live a godly life. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/believe]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/godly]])

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### Death #####
John's usage of death in this chapter always references physical death. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/death]])

##### "We know that we are from God, and we know that the whole world lies in the evil one." #####
Satan, the evil one, is the  ruler of this world, but ultimately God is in control over everything. Scripture describes Satan as the "prince" of this world and God as the "king" of all of creation. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/satan]])
