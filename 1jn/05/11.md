# And the witness is this

"This is what God says"

# life

Here "life" stands for the right to live forever by God's grace and love. See how you translated this in [1 John 1:1-2](../01/01.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# this life is in his Son

"this life is through his Son" or "we will live forever if we are joined with his Son" or "we will live forever if we are united with his Son"

# Son

This is an important title for Jesus, the Son of God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])

# The one who has the Son has life. The one who does not have the Son of God does not have life

Being in a close relationship to the Son is spoken of as having the Son. AT: "He who believes in the Son of God has eternal life. He who does not believe in the Son of God does not have eternal life" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
