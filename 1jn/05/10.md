# Anyone who believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself

"Whoever believes in Jesus knows for sure Jesus is the Son of God"

# has made him out to be a liar

"has called God a liar"

# because he has not believed the witness that God has given concerning his Son

"because he has not believed that God has told the truth about his Son"
