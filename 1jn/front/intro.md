#### What is the Book of 1 John about? ####

John wrote this letter to Christians at a time when a certain group of people was troubling them. This group of people denied some of the things that the apostles taught were true about God and Jesus. John wrote this letter because he wanted to prevent believers from sinning. He wanted to protect believers from false teachings. And he wanted to assure believers that they are saved.

#### How should the title of this book be translated? ####

Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, "1 John" or "First John." Or they may choose a clearer title, such as "The First Letter From John" or "The First Letter John Wrote." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

#### Who wrote the Book of 1 John? ####

This book does not give the reader the name of the author. However, since early Christian times, most Christians have thought that John was the author. John was one of Jesus' disciples. He was also the author of the Gospel of John.

## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts ##

#### Who were the people that John spoke against? ####

It is possible that the people John spoke against were those who would eventually become known as "Gnostics." These people believed that Jesus was God. But they did not believe that he was really a human with a physical body on earth. The reason for their belief was that they thought the physical world was evil. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/evil]])

## Part 3: Important Translation Issues ##

#### What do the words "remain," "reside," and "abide" mean in 1 John? ####

John often used the words "remain," "reside", and "abide" as metaphors. John spoke of a believer becoming more faithful to Jesus and knowing Jesus better as if Jesus' word "remained" in the believer. And, John spoke of someone being spiritually joined to someone else as if the person "remained" in the other person. Christians are said to "remain" in Christ and in God. The Father is said to "remain" in the Son, and the Son is said to "remain" in the Father. The Son is said to "remain" in believers. The Holy Spirit is also said to "remain" in the believers. 

Many translators will find it impossible to represent these ideas in their languages in exactly the same way. For example, John intended to express the idea of the Christian being spiritually together with God when he said, "He who says he remains in God" (1 John 2:6). The UDB says, "If we say that we are in union with God," but translators will often have to find other expressions that communicate well. 

In the passage, "the word of God remains in you" (1 John 2:13), the UDB expresses this idea as, "you continue to obey what God commands." Many translators will find it possible to use this translation as a model.

#### What are the major issues in the text of the Book of 1 John? ####

In certain parts of 1 John, the text in modern English Bibles is different than the text in older English Bibles. This is because ancient copies of the Bible were discovered after the older English Bibles were translated. Most scholars think these ancient copies of the Bible are better than the copies used for the older English Bibles. They think these ancient copies are more like what the authors of the Bible originally wrote. The following are the issues that affect the translation the most.

* "And we are writing these things so that our joy may be complete." (1:4) The ULB, UDB, and most modern versions have this reading. Some older versions have, "And we are writing these things to you so that your joy may be complete."
* "And you all know the truth." (2:20) The ULB, UDB, and most modern versions have either this reading or the following reading: "And you all have knowledge." Some older versions have, "and you know all things."
* "and this is what we are!" (3:1). The ULB, UDB, and most modern versions have this reading. Some older manuscripts omit this phrase.
* "and every spirit that does not acknowledge Jesus is not of God." (4:3) The ULB, UDB, and most modern versions have this reading. Some older manuscripts read, "and every spirit that does not acknowledge that Jesus has come in the flesh is not of God."
* "For there are three that bear witness in heaven: the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit; and these three are one. And there are three that bear witness on earth: the Spirit, the water, and the blood; and these three are as one." (5:7-8). The ULB, UDB, and most other versions do not have this reading. Translators are advised not to translate this passage. However, if in the translators' region, there are older versions of the Bible that include this passage, the translators can include it. If it is translated, it should be put inside square brackets ([]) to indicate that it was probably not original to 1 John. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
