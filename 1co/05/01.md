# Connecting Statement:

Paul now specifically states about what sin of theirs he has heard, and how the Corinthian believers are proud of their acceptance of that man and his sin.

# that is not even permitted among the Gentiles

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "that not even the Gentiles permit" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# A man has his father's wife

"A man among you is commiting adultery with his father's wife"

# father's wife

the wife of his father, but probably not his own mother
