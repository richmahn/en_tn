# Your boasting is not good

"Your boasting is bad"

# Do you not know that a little yeast leavens the whole loaf?

Just as a little yeast spreads throughout a whole loaf of bread, so can a little sin impact the entire fellowship of believers. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed

As the Passover lamb covered the sins of Israel by faith each year, so did Christ's death cover the sins of all who trust in Christ by faith for eternity. This can be stated in active form. AT: "the Lord has sacrificed Christ, our Passover lamb" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
