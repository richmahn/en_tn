# 1 Corinthians 05 General Notes

#### Structure and formatting

Some translations set quotations from the Old Testament farther to the right on the page to make them easier to read. The ULT does this with the quoted words of verse 13.

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter

##### Euphemisms

Paul uses euphemisms to describe sensitive topics. This chapter deals with sexual immorality of one church member. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/fornication]])

##### Metaphor
Paul uses an extended comparison using many metaphors. Yeast represents evil. The loaf probably represents the whole congregation. The unleavened bread represents living purely. So the whole passage means: Don't you know that a little evil will affect the whole congregation? So get rid of the evil so you can live purely. Christ has been sacrificed for us. So let us be sincere and truthful and not wicked and behaving badly. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/evil]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/unleavenedbread]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/purify]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/passover]])

##### Rhetorical questions
Paul uses rhetorical questions in this chapter. He uses them to emphasize important points as he teaches the Corinthians. (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion)
