# I do not wish to see you now

Paul is stating that he wants to visit for a long time later, not just for a short time soon.

# Pentecost

Paul would stay in Ephesus until this festival, which came in May or June, 50 days after Passover. He would then travel through Macedonia, and later try to arrive in Corinth before winter started in November.

# a wide door has opened

Paul speaks of the opportunity God has given him to win people to the gospel as if it were a door that God had opened so he could walk through it. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
