## translationNotes

* **I do not wish to see you now** - Paul is stating that he does not want to come for just a short visit now but for a longer period of time later.
* **Pentecost** - Paul would stay in Ephesus until this festival (May or June), later travel through Macedonia, and later try to arrive in Corinth before winter started in November.
* **a wide door has opened** - This means that the Lord had given him a good opportunity to win people to the gospel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
