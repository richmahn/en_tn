# I, Paul, write this with my own hand

Paul was making it clear that the instructions in this letter are from him, even though one of his co-laborers wrote what Paul was saying in the rest of the letter. Paul wrote this last part with his own hand.

# may he be accursed

"may God curse him." See how "accursed" was translated in [1 Corinthians 12:3](../12/01.md).
