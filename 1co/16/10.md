## see that he is with you unafraid ##

AT: "see that he has no cause to fear being with you"

## Let no one despise him. ##

Timothy being much younger than Paul may not be welcomed with the respect due him as a minister of the Gospel like that of Paul and Apollos.

## our brother Apollos ##

Paul treats Apollos with the respect of a fellow believer and minister in Christ and by supporting his return to Corinth to minister to them.
