# Connecting Statement:

In his closing notes, Paul reminds the Corinthian believers to collect money for the needy believers in Jerusalem. He reminds them that Timothy will come to them before he goes to Paul.

# for the believers

Paul was collecting money from his churches for the poor Jewish Christians in Jerusalem and Judea.

# as I directed

"as I gave specific instructions"

# store it up

Possible meanings are: 1) "keep it at home" or 2) "leave it with the church"

# so that there will be no collections when I come

"so that you will not have to collect more money while I am with you"
