# Death, where is your victory? Death, where is your sting?

Paul speaks as if death were a person, and he uses this question to mock the power of death, which Christ has defeated. AT: "Death has no victory. Death has no sting." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# your ... your

These are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
