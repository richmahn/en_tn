# Connecting Statement:

Paul reminds them that it is the gospel that saves them and he tells them again what the gospel is. Then he gives them a short history lesson, which ends with what will yet happen.

# remind you

"help you remember"

# on which you stand

Paul is speaking of the Corinthians as if they were a house and the gospel as if it were the foundation on which the house was standing. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
