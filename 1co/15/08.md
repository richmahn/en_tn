This is an idiom referring to a person who desired to experience specific events that others had experienced at another time. Paul hadn't spent time with Jesus during his ministry on earth, as the other apostles had. AT: "someone who missed the experiences of the others." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
