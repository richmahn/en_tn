# Last of all

"Finally, after he had appeared to the others"

# a child born at the wrong time

This is an idiom by which Paul may mean that he became a Christian much later than the other apostles. Or perhaps he means that, unlike the other apostles, he did not witness Jesus' three-year-long ministry. AT: "someone who missed the experiences of the others" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
