# Connecting Statement:

Paul wants them assured that Christ rose from the dead.

# we are found to be false witnesses about God

Paul is arguing that if Christ did not rise from the dead, then they are bearing false witness or lying about Christ's coming alive again.

# we are found to be

This can be stated in active form. AT: "everyone will realize that we are" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# your faith is in vain and you are still in your sins

Their faith is based on Christ having risen from the dead, so if that did not happen, their faith will do them no good.
