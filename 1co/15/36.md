# You are so ignorant! What you sow

Paul is speaking to the Corinthians as if they were one person, so both instances of "you" here are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# You are so ignorant

"You do not know about this at all"

# What you sow will not start to grow unless it dies

A seed will not grow unless it is first buried underground. In the same way, a person has to die before God can resurrect him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
