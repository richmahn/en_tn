# Connecting Statement:

Paul wants them to realize that some believers will not die physically but will still get a resurrected body through Christ's victory.

# flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God. Neither does what is perishable inherit what is imperishable

Possible meanings are 1) the two sentences mean the same thing. AT: "human beings who will surely die cannot inherit the permanent kingdom of God" or 2) the second sentence finishes the thought begun by the first. AT: "weak human beings cannot inherit the kingdom of God. Neither do those who will certainly die inherit a kingdom that will last forever" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# flesh and blood

Those who inhabit a body that is doomed to die. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# inherit

Receiving what God has promised believers is spoken of as if it were inheriting property and wealth from a family member. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# is perishable ... is imperishable

"can rot ... cannot rot." See how these words are translated in [1 Corinthians 15:42](./42.md).
