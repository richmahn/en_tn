## that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God ##

Paul is referring to those who have not been reborn or those who are not a new creation.

## neither does perishable inherit imperishable ##

Paul is stating our old bodies will perish but we will be changed into imperishable bodies.

## we will all be changed ##
