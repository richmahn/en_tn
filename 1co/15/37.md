## what you sow is not the body that will be ##

The metaphor of the seed is again used, meaning that the dead body of the believer will be resurrected, and will not appear as it was. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## God will give it body as he chooses ##

AT: "God will decide what kind of body"
