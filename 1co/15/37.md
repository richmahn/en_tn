# What you sow is not the body that will be

Paul uses the metaphor of the seed again to say that God will resurrect the dead body of the believer, but that body will not appear as it was. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# What you sow

Paul is speaking to the Corinthians as if they were one person, so the word "you" here is singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
