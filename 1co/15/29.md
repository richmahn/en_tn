## Or else what will those do who are baptized for the dead? ##

AT: "Otherwise it would be useless for Christians to receive baptism for the dead" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## be baptized for the dead ##

"receive baptism on behalf of dead people"

## And why are we in danger every hour? ##

If Jesus did not rise from the dead, then there is no justification for Paul & other christians to be in danger regarding their beliefs and teachings.
