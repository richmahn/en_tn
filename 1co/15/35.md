# Connecting Statement:

Paul gives some specifics about how the resurrection of the believers' bodies will take place. He gives a picture of natural and spiritual bodies and compares the first man Adam with the last Adam, Christ.

# But someone will say, "How are the dead raised, and with what kind of body will they come?"

Possible meanings are 1) The person is asking sincerely or 2) the person is using the question to mock the idea of a resurrection. Alternate translation: "But some will say that they cannot imagine how God will raise the dead, and what kind of body God would give them in the resurrection." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# someone will say

"someone will ask"

# with what kind of body will they come

That is, will it be a physical body or a spiritual body? What shape will the body have? What will the body be made of? Translate using the most general question that someone who wants to know the answers to these questions would ask.
