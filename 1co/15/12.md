# how can some of you say there is no resurrection of the dead?

Paul is using this question to begin a new topic. AT: "you should not be saying that there is no resurrection of the dead!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# if there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised

To say that there is no resurrection of the dead is to say that Christ did not rise from the dead.
