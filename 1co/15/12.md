## translationNotes

* **how can some of you say there is no resurrection of the dead?** - Paul's preaching on Christ rising from the dead contrary to there being no resurrection of the dead. AT: "You can not say there is no resurrection of the dead!" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **if there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised** - To say that there is no resurrection of the dead is to say that Christ did not rise from the dead.
