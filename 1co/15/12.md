## how can some of you say there is no resurrection of the dead? ##

Paul's preaching on Christ rising from the dead contrary to there being no resurrection of the dead. AT: "You can not say there is no resurrection of the dead!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## if there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised ##

To say that there is no resurrection of the dead is to say that Christ did not rise from the dead.
