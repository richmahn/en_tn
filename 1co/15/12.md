# how can some of you say there is no resurrection of the dead?

Paul is using this question to begin a new topic. AT: "you should not be saying that there is no resurrection of the dead!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# if there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised

Paul is using a hypothetical case to argue that there is a resurrection of the dead. He knows that Christ has been raised and so infers that there is a resurrection. To say that there is no resurrection is to say that Christ has not been raised, but this is false because Paul has seen the resurrected Christ ([1 Corinthians 15:8](../08.md)). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])

# not even Christ has been raised

This can be translated in active form. AT: "God has not even raised Christ" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# raised
