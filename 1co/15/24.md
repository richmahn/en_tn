# until he has put all his enemies under his feet

Kings who won wars would put their feet on the necks of those whom they had defeated. AT: "until God has completely destroyed all of Christ's enemies" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

Paul speaks of death here as if it were a person whom God will kill. AT: "The final enemy that God will destroy is death itself" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
