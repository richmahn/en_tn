#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations indent quotations from the Old Testament. The ULB does this with the quoted material in 2:10.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Wisdom #####
Paul continues the discussion from the first chapter contrasting human and God's wisdom. For Paul, wisdom can be simple. He said the wisdom from the Holy Spirit is the only true wisdom. Human ideas are foolish. Paul uses the phrase "hidden wisdom" in referring to truths that were not previously known. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/wise]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/foolish]])
