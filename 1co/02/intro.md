# 1 Corinthians 02 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the words of verses 9 and 16, which are from the Old Testament.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Wisdom #####
Paul continues the discussion from the first chapter that contrasts human wisdom and God's wisdom. For Paul, wisdom can be simple and human ideas foolish. He said the wisdom from the Holy Spirit is the only true wisdom. Paul uses the phrase "hidden wisdom" when he refers to previously unknown truths.
