# 1 Corinthians 02 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations set apart quotations of the Old Testament by indenting them. The ULB and other English translations indent the words in 2:9, 16 that are quoted from the Old Testament.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Wisdom #####
Paul continues the discussion from the first chapter contrasting human and God's wisdom. For Paul, wisdom can be simple. He said the wisdom from the Holy Spirit is the only true wisdom. Human ideas are foolish. Paul uses the phrase "hidden wisdom" in referring to truths that were not previously known. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/wise]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/foolish]])
