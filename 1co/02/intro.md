Some translations set each line of poetry farher to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetry that is quoted from the Old Testament in 2:9 and 2:16

Some translations set quotations from the Old Testament farher to the right on the page than the rest of the text. The ULB does this with the quoted material in 2:16.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Wisdom #####
Paul continues the discussion from the first chapter contrasting human and God's wisdom. For Paul, wisdom can be simple. He said the wisdom from the Holy Spirit is the only true wisdom. Human ideas are foolish. Paul uses the phrase "hidden wisdom" in referring to truths that were not previously known. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/wise]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/foolish]])
