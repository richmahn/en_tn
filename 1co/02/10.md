## translationNotes

* **These are the things** - the truths about Jesus and the cross.
* **For who knows a person's thoughts except the spirit of the person in him?** - Paul used this question to emphasize that no other man knows what a person is thinking except the person himself. AT: "No one knows what a person is thinking except that person's spirit" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **spirit of the person** - Note this "spirit" refers to the unclean or evil spirit in man that is distinct from the Spirit of God.
