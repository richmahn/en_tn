## These are the things ##

the truths about Jesus and the cross.

## For who knows a person's thoughts except the spirit of the person in him? ##

Paul used this question to emphasize that no other man knows what a person is thinking except the person himself. AT: "No one knows what a person is thinking except that person's spirit" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## spirit of the person ##

Note this "spirit" refers to the unclean or evil spirit in man that is distinct from the Spirit of God.
