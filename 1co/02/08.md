# the Lord of glory

"Jesus, the glorious Lord"

# Things that no eye ... imagined, the things ... who love him

This is an incomplete sentence. Some translations make it a complete sentence: "Things that no eye ... imagined; these are the things ... who love him." Others leave it incomplete but show that it is incomplete by using non-final punctuation here and beginning the next verse as a continuation of this verse: "'Things that no eye ... imagined, the things ... who love him'â€”"

# Things that no eye has seen, no ear has heard, no mind has imagined

This is a triplet referring to all parts of a person to emphasize that no man has ever been aware of the things that God has prepared. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# the things that God has prepared for those who love him

The Lord has created in heaven wonderful surprises for those who love him.
