# General Information:

Here the word "we" includes both Paul and his audience. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-inclusive]])

# unspiritual person

the non-Christian person, who has not received the Holy Spirit

# because they are spiritually discerned

"because understanding these things requires the aid of the Spirit"

# The one who is spiritual

"The believer who has received the Spirit"

# For who can know the mind of the Lord, that he can instruct him?

Paul uses this question to emphasize that no one knows the mind of the Lord. No one is as wise as the Lord. AT: "No one can know the mind of the Lord, so no one can teach him anything he does not already know" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
