# Connecting Statement:

Paul contrasts human wisdom and God's wisdom. He emphasizes that spiritual wisdom comes from God.

# brothers

Here this means fellow Christians, including both men and women.

# I decided to know nothing ... except Jesus Christ

When Paul said that he "decided to know nothing" he exaggerated to emphasize that he decided focus on and teach about nothing other than Jesus Christ. AT: "I decided to teach nothing ... except Jesus Christ" or "I decided not to teach anything ... except Jesus Christ" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
