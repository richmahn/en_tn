# 1 Corinthians 14 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations indent each line of poetry to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetry that is quoted from the Old Testament in 14:21.

Paul returns to his discussion on the  gifts of the Holy Spirit.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Tongues #####

The gift of tongues is described as an inferior gift because it primarily serves an individual or a few people within the church; it does not serve the church as a whole. It is also very important that this gift be used in the proper way. The use of tongues is also described as a sign for unbelievers. The exact meaning of this phrase is debated among scholars. 

##### Prophecy #####

Prophecy is described as a superior gift because it can be used in service of the entire church, unlike the gifts that are primarily helpful to an individual. Prophecy is described as a gift for believers, but the exact meaning of this phrase is debated among scholars. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]])
