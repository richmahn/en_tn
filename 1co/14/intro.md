# 1 Corinthians 14 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

In this chapter, Paul returns to discussing spiritual gifts.

Some translations set what is quoted from the Old Testament farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text. The ULT does this with the words of verse 21.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Tongues #####

Scholars disagree on the exact meaning of the gift of tongues. Paul describes the gift of tongues as a sign for unbelievers. It does not serve the whole church, unless someone interprets what is spoken. It is very important that the church uses this gift properly. 

##### Prophecy #####

Scholars disagree on the exact meaning of prophecy as a spiritual gift. Paul says prophets can build up the entire church. He describes prophecy as a gift for believers. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]])
