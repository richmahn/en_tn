Paul wants them to know that though teaching is more important because it instructs people, it must be done with love.

# Pursue love

Paul speaks of love as if it were a person. "Follow after love" or "Work hard to love people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# especially that you may prophesy
