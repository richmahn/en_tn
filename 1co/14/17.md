# you certainly give

Paul is speaking to the Corinthians as if they were one person, so the word "you" here is singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# the other person is not built up

Building people up represents helping them become mature and strong in their faith. This can be stated in active form. See how you translated "builds up" in [1 Corinthians 8:1](../08/01.md). AT: "the other person is not strengthened" or "what you say does not strengthen any outsider who might hear you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# than ten thousand words in a tongue

Paul was not counting words, but used exaggeration to emphasize that a few understandable words are far more valuable than even a great number of words in a language that people cannot understand. AT: "10,000 words" or "a great many words" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
