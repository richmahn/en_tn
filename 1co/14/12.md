# the manifestations of the Spirit

"being able to do things that show that the Spirit controls you"

# try to excel in the gifts that build up the church

Paul speaks of the church as if it were a house that one could build and of the work of building the church as if it were something one could harvest. Alternate translation: "to succeed greatly in making God's people more able to serve God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
