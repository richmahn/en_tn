# the manifestations of the Spirit

"being able to do things that show that the Spirit controls you"

# try to excel in the gifts that build up the church

Paul speaks of the church as if it were a house that one could build and of the work of building the church as if it were something one could harvest. AT: "to succeed greatly in making God's people more able to serve God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# interpret

This means to tell what someone has said in a language to others who do not understand that language. See how this is translated in [1 Corinthians 2:13](../02/12.md).

# my mind is unfruitful

The mind not understanding what is being prayed and, therefore, receiving no benefit from the prayer is spoken of as if the "mind is unfruitful." AT: "I do not understand it in my mind" or "my mind does not benefit from the prayer, because I do not understand the words I am saying" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
