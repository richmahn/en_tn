# What am I to do?

Paul is introducing his conclusion. AT: "This is what I will do." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# pray with my spirit ... pray with my mind ... sing with my spirit ... sing with my mind

Prayers and songs must be in a language that the people present can understand.

# with my mind

"with words that I understand"
