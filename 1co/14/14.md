# my mind is unfruitful

The mind not understanding what is being prayed and, therefore, receiving no benefit from the prayer is spoken of as if the "mind is unfruitful." AT: "I do not understand it in my mind" or "my mind does not benefit from the prayer, because I do not understand the words I am saying" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
