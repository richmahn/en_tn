# Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered?

Paul expects the Corinthians to agree with him. This can be stated in active form. "To honor God, a woman should pray to God with a covering on her head." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
