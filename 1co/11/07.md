## should not have his head covered ##

AT: “must not place a veil over his head.”

## glory of the man ##

Just as man reflects God's greatness, the woman reflects the man's character.

## For man was not made from the woman, but the woman from the man ##

At creation, God removed a bone from the side of the man to create the woman.
