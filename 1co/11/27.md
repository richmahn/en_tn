# eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord

"eats the bread of the Lord or drinks the cup of the Lord"

# examine

Paul speaks of a person looking at his relationship to God and how he has been living his life as if that person is looking over something he wants to buy. See how "test the quality" is translated in [1 Corinthians 3:13](../03/12.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# without discerning the body

Possible meanings are 1) "and does not recognize that the church is the body of the Lord" or 2) "and does not consider that he is handling the Lord's body."

# weak and ill

These words mean almost the same thing and can be combined, as in UDB.

# and some of you have fallen asleep

"Sleep" here is a common euphemism for death. AT: "and some of you have died" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]]]]).
