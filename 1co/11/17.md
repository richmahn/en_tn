# Connecting Statement:

As Paul talks about communion, the Lord's supper, he reminds them to have right attitudes as well as unity. He reminds them that if they fail in those things when taking communion, they will become sick and die, as has already happened to some of them.

# in the following instructions, I do not praise you. For when

Another possible meaning is "as I give you these instructions, there is something for which I cannot praise you: when"

# the following instructions

"the instructions I am about to talk about"

# come together

"gather together" or "meet"

# it is not for the better but for the worse

"you do not help each other; instead, you harm each other"
