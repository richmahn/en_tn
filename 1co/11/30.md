# and some of you have fallen asleep

"Sleep" here is a euphemism for death. AT: "and some of you have died" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]]).

If this would sound like Paul is talking to those who have died, you may need to make explicit that he is not. AT: "some of the members of your group" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
