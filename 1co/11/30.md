# weak and ill

These words mean almost the same thing and can be combined, as in UDB.

# and some of you have fallen asleep

"Sleep" here is a euphemism for death. Alternate translation: "and some of you have died" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]]).

# some of you

If this would sound like Paul is talking to those who have died, you may need to make explicit that he is not. Alternate translation: "some of the members of your group" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
