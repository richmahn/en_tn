# examine

Paul speaks of a person looking at his relationship to God and how he has been living his life as if that person is looking over something he wants to buy. See how this is translated in [1 Corinthians 11:28](./27.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# we will not be judged

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "God will not judge us" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
