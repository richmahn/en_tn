# For why ... conscience? If I partake ... gave thanks?

Possible meanings are 1) the word "for" refers back to [1 Corinthians 10:27](../10/27.md), "I am not to ask questions of conscience, so why ... conscience? If I partake ... gave thanks?" or 2) Paul is quoting what some Corinthians were thinking, "As some of you might be thinking, 'For why ... conscience? If I ... thanks?'"

# If I partake of the meal with gratitude, why am I being insulted for that for which I gave thanks?

The speaker wants the hearer to answer the question in his mind. Alternate translation: "I partake of the meal with gratitude, so no one should insult me for that for which I gave thanks." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# If I partake

If Paul is not quoting what some Corinthians might be thinking, the "I" represents those who eat meat with thankfulness. "If a person partakes" or "When a person eats"

# with gratitude

"and thank God for it" or "and thank the person who gave it to me for it"
