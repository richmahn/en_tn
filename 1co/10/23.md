# Connecting Statement:

Paul again reminds them of the law of liberty and doing everything for the benefit of others.

# Everything is lawful

Possible meanings are 1) Paul is answering what some Corinthians might be thinking, "Some say, 'I can do anything'" or 2) Paul is actually saying what he thinks is true, "God allows me to do anything." This should be translated as in [1 Corinthians 6:12](../06/12.md).

# not everything is beneficial

"some things are not beneficial"

# not everything builds people up

Building people up represents helping them become mature and strong in their faith. See how you translated "builds up" in [1 Corinthians 8:1](../08/01.md). AT: "not everything strengthens people" or "some things do not strengthen people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
