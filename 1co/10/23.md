## "Everything is lawful" ##

Paul is quoting a slogan of some Corinthians.  AT: 'I can do anything I desire'."

## No one should seek his own good. Instead each one should seek the good of his neighbor ##

Do what is good for others rather than doing what is good for yourself.

## good ##

AT: "benefit"
