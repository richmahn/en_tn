# 1 Corinthians 10 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Chapters 8-10 together answer the question: "Is it acceptable to eat meat that has been sacrificed to an idol?"

In this chapter, Paul uses the exodus to warn people not to sin. Then, he returns to discussing meat offered to idols. He uses the Lord's Supper as an example. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Exodus #####
Paul uses the experiences of Israel leaving Egypt and roaming the desert as a warning to the believers. Although the Israelites all followed Moses, they all died on the way. None of them reached the Promised Land. Some worshiped an idol, some tested God, and some grumbled. Paul warns Christians not to sin. We can resist temptation because God provides a way of escape. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/promisedland]])
 
##### Eating meat sacrificed to idol #####
Paul discusses meat offered to idols. Christians are allowed to eat, but it may hurt others. So when buying meat or eating with a friend, do not ask if it has been offered to idols. But if someone tells you it has been offered to idols, don't eat it for the sake of that person. Do not offend anyone. Seek to save them instead. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/save]])

##### Rhetorical questions #####
Paul uses many rhetorical questions in this chapter. He uses them to emphasize important points as he teaches the Corinthians. (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion)
