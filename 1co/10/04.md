# drank the same spiritual drink ... spiritual rock

"drank the same water that God supernaturally brought out of the rock ... supernatural rock"

# that rock was Christ

The "rock" was a literal, physical rock, so it would be best to translate this literally. If your language cannot say that a rock "was" a person's name, treat the word "rock" as a metonym for the power of Christ that worked through the rock. Alternate translation: "it was Christ who worked through that rock" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
