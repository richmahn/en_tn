# But if someone says to you ... do not eat ... who informed you

Some translations put this verse, continuing to "and not yours" in the next verse, in parentheses because 1) the forms of "you" and "eat" here are singular, but Paul uses the plural form immediately before and after this sentence, and 2) the words "For why should my freedom be judged by another's conscience?" in the next verse seem to build on "eat whatever is set before you without asking questions of conscience" ([1 Corinthians 10:27](../10/27.md)) rather than "the conscience of the other man." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# says to you ... do not eat ... informed you

Paul is speaking to the Corinthians as if they were one person, so the word "you" and the command "do not eat" here are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
