# the conscience of the other man, I mean, and not yours

Some translations put these words, along with the words in the verse before this one, in parentheses because 1) the form of "yours" here is singular, but Paul uses the plural form immediately before and after this sentence, and 2) the words "For why should my freedom be judged by another's conscience?" in this verse seem to build on "eat whatever is set before you without asking questions of conscience" ([1 Corinthians 10:27](../10/27.md)) rather than "the conscience of the other man." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# and not yours

Paul is speaking to the Corinthians as if they were one person, so the word "yours" here is singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# For why ... conscience?

Possible meanings for this question, along with the question in the next verse, are 1) the word "for" refers back to [1 Corinthians 10:27](../10/27.md). Alternate translation: "I am not to ask questions of conscience, so why ... conscience?" or 2) Paul is quoting what some Corinthians were thinking. Alternate translation: "As some of you might be thinking, 'For why ... conscience?'"

# why should my freedom be judged by another's conscience?

The speaker wants the hearer to answer the question in his mind. Alternate translation: "You should know without me telling you that no one should be able to say I am doing wrong just because that person has ideas about right and wrong that are different from mine." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
