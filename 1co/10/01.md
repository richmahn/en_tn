# Connecting Statement:

Paul reminds them of the example of their ancient Jewish fathers' experiences with immorality and idolatry.

# our fathers

Paul is referring to the time of Moses in the book of Exodus when Israel fled through the Red Sea as the Egyptian army pursued them. The word "our" refers to himself and the Corinthians and is inclusive. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-inclusive]])

# passed through the sea

This sea is known by two names, the Red Sea and the Sea of Reeds.

# passed through

"walked through" or "traveled through"

# All were baptized into Moses

"All followed and were committed to Moses"

# in the cloud

by the cloud that represented the presence of God and led the Israelites during the day

# drank the same spiritual drink ... spiritual rock

"drank the same water that God supernaturally brought out of the rock ... supernatural rock"

# that rock was Christ

The "rock" was a literal, physical rock, so it would be best to translate this literally. If your language cannot say that a rock "was" a person's name, treat the word "rock" as a metonym for the power of Christ that worked through the rock. AT: "it was Christ who worked through that rock" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
