## translationNotes

* **in the market** - a meeting place for people to buy and sell things like food.
* **The earth is the Lord's, and the fullness of it** - The Lord made the earth and everything in it.
* **without asking questions of conscience** - It is better not know where the food came from for conscience sake, acknowledging that all food comes from the Lord regardless if it was offered to idols or not.
