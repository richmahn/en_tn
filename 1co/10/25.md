## in the market ##

a meeting place for people to buy and sell things like food.

## The earth is the Lord's, and the fullness of it ##

The Lord made the earth and everything in it.

## without asking questions of conscience ##

It is better not know where the food came from for conscience sake, acknowledging that all food comes from the Lord regardless if it was offered to idols or not.
