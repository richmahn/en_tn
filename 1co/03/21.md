## No more boasting about people! ##

Paul is giving a command to the Corinthian believers. AT: "Stop boasting about how one leader is better than another".

## boasting ##

"expressing too much pride in."  The Corinthian believers were exalting Paul or Apollos or Cephas, when they should be worshiping Jesus Christ.

## you are Christ’s, and Christ is God’s ##

"you belong to Christ, and Christ belongs to God"
