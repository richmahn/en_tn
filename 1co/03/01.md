# Connecting Statement:

Paul now reminds the Corinthian believers of how they are actually living instead of behaving as their position before God is. He then reminds them that the person who teaches them is not as important as God who gives their growth.

# brothers

Here this means fellow Christians, including both men and women.

# spiritual people

people who obey the Spirit

# fleshly people

people who follow their own desires

# as to little children in Christ

The Corinthians are compared to children very young in age and understanding. Alternate translation: "as to very young believers in Christ" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
