# Let no one deceive himself

Nobody should believe the lie that he himself is wise in this world.

# in this age

according to the way people who do not believe decide what is wise

# let him become a "fool"

"that person should be willing to have people who do not believe call him a fool" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])
