# still fleshly

still behaving according to sinful or worldly desires

# are you not living according to the flesh, and are you not walking by human standards?

Paul is rebuking the Corinthians for their sinful behavior. "Walking" here is a metaphor for "judging your behavior," deciding what is good and bad. Alternate translation: "you should be ashamed because you are behaving according to your sinful desires and you are using human standards to decide whether your behavior is good or bad!"
