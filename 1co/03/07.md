# neither he who plants ... is anything. But it is God who gives the growth

Paul stresses that neither he nor Apollos is responsible for the believers' spiritual growth, but it is God's doing.

# it is God who gives the growth

Here to give growth means to cause growth. The abstract noun "growth" can be translated with a verbal phrase. Alternate translation: "it is God who causes you to grow" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
