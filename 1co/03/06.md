## translationNotes

* **planted** - The knowledge of God is compared to a seed which must be planted in order to grow. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **watered** - As seeds need water, faith needs further teaching in order for it to grow. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **growth** - As plants grow and develop, so also do faith and knowledge in God also grow and become deeper and stronger. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **neither he who plants...is anything, But it is God who gives the growth.** - Paul stresses that neither he or Apollos is responsible for the believer's spiritual growth but it is God's doing.
