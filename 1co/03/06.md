## planted ##

The knowledge of God is compared to a seed which must be planted in order to grow. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## watered ##

As seeds need water, faith needs further teaching in order for it to grow. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## growth ##

As plants grow and develop, so also do faith and knowledge in God also grow and become deeper and stronger. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## neither he who plants...is anything, But it is God who gives the growth. ##

Paul stresses that neither he or Apollos is responsible for the believer's spiritual growth but it is God's doing.
