# I planted

The knowledge of God is compared to a seed which must be planted in order to grow. AT: "When I preached God's word to you, I was like one who plants seeds in a garden" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Apollos watered

As seeds need water, faith needs further teaching in order for it to grow. AT: "and when Apollos continued to teach you God's word, he was like one who waters a garden" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# but God gave the growth

As plants grow and develop, so faith and knowledge in God also grow and become deeper and stronger. AT: "but God caused you to grow" or "but just as God causes plants to grow, he causes you to grow spiritually" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# neither he who plants ... is anything. But it is God who gives the growth

Paul stresses that neither he nor Apollos is responsible for the believers' spiritual growth, but it is God's doing.

# it is God who gives the growth

Here to give growth means to cause growth. The abstract noun "growth" can be translated with a verbal phrase. AT: "it is God who causes you to grow" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
