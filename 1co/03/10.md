"According to the task that God freely gave me to do."  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## I laid a foundation ##

Paul equates his teaching of faith and salvation in Jesus Christ to laying a foundation for a building. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## another builds on it ##

Another worker continues to "build" the work in the church by helping these believers spiritually. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## let each man ##

This refers to God's workers in general. AT: "let each person who serves God."

## other than the one which has been laid ##

After a building has been built on its foundation, the foundation cannot be changed. In this case, the spiritual foundation of the Corinthian church is Jesus Christ, built by Paul. AT: "other than the foundation that I, Paul, laid" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
