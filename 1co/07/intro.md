#### Special concepts in this chapter

##### Divorce
Paul says married Christians should not divorce. A Christian married to an unbeliever should not leave their husband or wife. If the unbelieving husband or wife leaves, this is not a sin. Paul advises that, because of the difficult times and being near to time that Jesus will return, it is acceptable to remain unmarried.
