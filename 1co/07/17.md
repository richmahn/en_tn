# each one

"each believer"

# This is my rule in all the churches

Paul was teaching believers in all the churches to act in this manner.

# Was anyone circumcised when he was called to believe

Paul was addressing the circumcised ones (the Jews). AT: "To the circumcised ones, when God called you to believe, you had already been circumcised" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Was anyone uncircumcised when he was called to faith

Paul was now addressing the uncircumcised ones. AT: "To the uncircumcised ones, when God called you to believe, you were not circumcised" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
