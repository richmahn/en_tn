## translationNotes

* **do not deprive one another sexually** - AT: "do not refuse to sexually satisfy your spouse"
* **so that you may devote yourselves to prayer** - They decide together to pass some days without sex in order to have a period of especially deep prayer; in Judaism that might be a period of 1-2 weeks.
* **devote yourselves** - "commit yourselves"
* **come together again** - return to sexual activity
* **because of your lack of self-control** - AT: "because after some days, your sexual desires will be harder to keep under control"
* **I say these things to you more as concession and not as command** - Paul tells the Corinthians that they can take a short period of time to abstain from sex for the purpose of prayer, but that this is a special case, not an continuing requirement.
* **were as I am** - were unmarried (formerly-married or never-married), as Paul is.
* **But each one has his own gift from God, one of this kind and another of that kind** - AT: "God gives one person a ability, and to another person some other ability."
