# Do not deprive each other

The word "deprive" means to keep from someone something that the other person has the right to receive. "Do not refuse to have marital relations with your spouse" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# so that you may devote yourselves to prayer

in order to have a period of especially deep prayer

# devote yourselves

"commit yourselves"

# come together again

"sleep together again"

# because of your lack of self-control

"because after some days, your sexual desires will be harder to keep under control"

# I say these things to you as a concession and not as a command

Possible meanings are Paul is telling the Corinthians that he is allowing them, but not commanding them, 1) to marry and sleep together or 2) to stop sleeping together for a time.

# were as I am

Either Paul had never married or his wife had died. It is unlikely that he had been through a divorce.

# But each one has his own gift from God. One has this kind of gift, and another that kind

"God enables people to do different things. He enables one person to do one thing and another person to do something different"
