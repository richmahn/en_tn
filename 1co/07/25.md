## translationNotes

* **Now concerning those who never married, I have no commandment from the Lord ** - Paul knows no teaching of Jesus that speaks about this situation. AT: "I don't have a commandment from the Lord about people who have never married."
* **my opinion** - Paul is emphasizing that these thoughts about marriage are his  - not a direct commandment from the Lord.
* **Therefore** - AT: "So" or "Because of this"
* **impending crisis** - AT: "disaster that is coming"
