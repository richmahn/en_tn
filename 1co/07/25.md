## Now concerning those who never married, I have no commandment from the Lord  ##

<b>Now concerning those who never married, I have no commandment from the Lord <b>- Paul knows no teaching of Jesus that speaks about this situation. AT: "I don't have a commandment from the Lord about people who have never married."

## my opinion ##

Paul is emphasizing that these thoughts about marriage are his  - not a direct commandment from the Lord.

## Therefore ##

AT: "So" or "Because of this"

## impending crisis ##

AT: "disaster that is coming"
