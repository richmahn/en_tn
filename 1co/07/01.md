## Now ##

Paul is introducing a new topic in his teaching.

## the things about which you wrote me ##

The Corinthians had written a letter to Paul to ask for answers to certain questions.

## for a man ##

in this usage, male spouse or husband

## it is good ##

AT: "it is right and acceptable"

## there are times when it is good for a man not to sleep with his wife ##

AM: "it is good for a man to have no sexual relations at all".

## But because of temptations for many immoral acts ##

AT: "But because people experience temptation to commit sexual sin."

## each man should have his own wife, and each woman should have her own husband ##

To clarify this for polygamous cultures, "each man should have one wife, and each woman should have one husband."
