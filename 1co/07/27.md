# General Information:

Paul is speaking to the Corinthians as if he were speaking to each person, so all these instances of "you" and the command "do not seek" here are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# Are you married to a wife? Do not ...

Paul uses this question to introduce a possible condition. The question can be translated as a phrase with "if." AT: "If you are married, do not" (See: [[https://git.door43.org/Door43/en_ta/src/master/translate/figs-rquestion/01.md]])

# Do not seek a divorce

"Do not try to divorce her" or "Do try to separate from her" 

# do not seek a wife

"do not try to get married"
