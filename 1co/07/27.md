# General Information: 

Paul is speaking to the Corinthians as if he were speaking to each person, so all these instances of "you" and the command "do not seek" here are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# Are you married to a wife? Do not ... 
Paul uses this question to introduce a possible condition. The question can be translated as a phrase with "if." AT: "If you are married, do not" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Do not seek a divorce

"Do not try to divorce her" or "Do try to separate from her" 

# Do not seek a wife

"Do not try to get married"

# I want to spare you from this

The word "this" refers to the kinds of worldly trouble that married people might have. AT:  "I want to help you not to have worldly trouble" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
