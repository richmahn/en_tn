# Are you bound ... Do not seek ... Are you free ... Do not seek ... you do ... you have

Paul is speaking to the Corinthians as if they were one person, so all these instances of "you" and the command "do not seek" here are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# Are you bound to a woman? Do not seek

Paul addresses men who are married. AT: "If you are married, do not seek" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Are you free of a wife? Do not seek

Paul addresses men who are not married. AT: "If you are not now married, do not seek" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
