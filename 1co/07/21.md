# Were you ... called you? Do not be ... you can become

Paul is speaking to the Corinthians as if they were one person, so all instances of "you" and the command "be" here are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# Were you a slave when God called you? Do not be concerned

This can be stated as a statement. Alternate translation: "To those who were slaves when God called you to believe, I say this: do not be concerned" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
