# sexual rights

Both husbands and wives are obligated to regularly sleep with their spouses. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])

# likewise the wife to her husband

The words "should give" and "sexual rights" are understood from the previous phrase. Alternate translation: "likewise the wife should give to her husband his sexual rights" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
