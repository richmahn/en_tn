# What then is my reward?

Paul is preparing them for the new information he is going to give them. AT: "This is my reward." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# That when I preach, I may offer the gospel without charge

"My reward for preaching is that I can preach without receiving payment"

# offer the gospel

"preach the gospel"

# so not take full use of my right in the gospel

"so not ask people to support me as I travel and preach"
