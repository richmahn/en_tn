# Connecting Statement:

Paul explains that he uses the liberty he has in Christ to discipline himself.

# Do you not know that in a race all the runners run the race, but that only one receives the prize?

Paul is reminding the Corinthians of what they know so he can add new information. Alternate translation: "Let me remind you that although all runners run the race, only one runner receives the prize." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# run the race

Paul compares living the Christian life and working for God to running a race and being an athlete. As in a race, the Christian life and work require strict discipline on the part of the runner, and, as in a race, the Christian has a specific goal. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# run to win the prize

Paul is speaking of the reward God will give his faithful people as if it were a prize given for an athletic contest. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
