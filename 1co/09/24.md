## translationNotes

* **Do you not know that in a race all the runners run the race, but only one receives the prize? ** - The expected (although unstated) response is an understanding of the facts of the question: "Yes, I know that 'Although all runners run the race, only one runner receives the prize.'" (See:  [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **run the race** - Paul compares living the Christian life and working for God to running a race and being an athlete. As in a race the Christian life and work require strict discipline on the part of the runner, and as in a race the Christian has a specific goal. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **run to win the prize** - running with commitment to success in the endeavor is compared to commitment to doing the things that God wants you to do.  (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **wreath** - A wreath is a marker of success or completion, given by an authority over that event; the metaphor refers to the life lived honoring God, with God providing the permanent marker of salvation.  (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **I myself might not be disqualified** - The Passive form is rephrased to the Active form of the sentence. AT: "the judge might not disqualify me." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
