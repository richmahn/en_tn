# is it too much for us to reap material things from you?

Paul asks a question so that the Corinthians will think of what he is saying without him having to say it. Alternate translation: "you should know without me telling you that it is not too much for us to receive material support from you." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
