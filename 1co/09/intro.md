# 1 Corinthians 09 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Paul defends himself in this chapter. Some people claimed that he was trying to gain financially from the church. 

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Earning money from the church #####
People accused Paul of just wanting money from the church. Paul answered that he rightfully could get money from the church. The Old Testament taught that those who worked should get their living from their work. He and Barnabas purposefully never used this right and earned their own living. 

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter ####

##### Metaphor #####
Paul uses many metaphors in this chapter. These metaphors teach complex truths. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### Contextualization #####
This passage is important because Paul "contextualizes" ministering the gospel to different audiences. This means that Paul makes himself and the gospel understandable without his actions hindering the gospel being received. The translator should take extra care to preserve aspects of this "contextualization" if possible. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/goodnews]])

##### Rhetorical questions #####
Paul uses many rhetorical questions in this chapter. He uses them to emphasize various points as he teaches the Corinthians. (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion)
