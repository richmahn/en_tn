# Do we not have the right to eat and drink?

Paul uses a question to emphasize that he knows the Corinthians agree with what he is saying. Alternate translation: "We have the absolute right to receive food and drink from the churches." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# we

Here "we" refers to Paul and Barnabas. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
