# Do not put

Moses was speaking to the Israelites as if they were one person, so this command is singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# Is it really the oxen that God cares about?

Paul asks a question so that the Corinthians will think of what he is saying without him having to say it. AT: "You should know without me telling you that it is not the oxen that God cares most about." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
