# I do not run without purpose or box by beating the air

Here "running" and "boxing" are both metaphors for living the Christian life and serving God. This can be stated in positive form. Alternate translation: "I know very well why I am running, and I know what I am doing when I box" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
