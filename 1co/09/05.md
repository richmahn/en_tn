# Do we not have the right to take along with us a wife who is a believer, as do the rest of the apostles, and the brothers of the Lord, and Cephas?

Paul uses a question to emphasize that he knows the Corinthians agree with what he is saying. Alternate translation: "If we have believing wives, we have a right to take them with us just as the other apostles take them, and the brothers of the Lord, and Cephas."
