# 1 Corinthians 04 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations of the Old Testament. The ULB and many other English translations indent the Old Testament quotation in 4:6.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Pride #####
Paul contrasts the Corinthians' pride with the humbleness of the apostles. The Corinthian believers have no reason to be proud because all that they have, and all they are, is a gift from God. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/apostle]])

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter ####

##### Metaphors #####
There are many metaphors in this chapter. The apostles are described as servants. Paul speaks of a victory parade where the apostles are the prisoners who will be killed. He uses a rod to stand for punishment. He calls himself their father because he is their "spiritual father." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/spirit]])

##### Irony #####
Paul uses irony to shame the pride of the Corinthians. The Corinthian believers are reigning but the apostles are suffering. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])
