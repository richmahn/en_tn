# between you ... do you have that you did not ... you have freely ... do you boast ... you had not

Paul is speaking to the Corinthians as if they were one person, so all instances of "you" here are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# For who sees any difference between you and others?

Paul is rebuking the Corinthians who think they are better than those who heard the gospel from someone else. Alternate translation: "For there is no difference between you and others." or "For you are not superior to other people." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# What do you have that you did not freely receive?

Paul uses this question to emphasize that they did not earn the things they have. Alternate translation: "Everything that you have is what you have freely received." or "God gave to you everything that you have for free!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# why do you boast as if you had not done so?

Paul was rebuking them for boasting in what they had. Alternate translation: "you should not boast as if you had not done so." or "you have no right to boast!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# as if you had not done so

The phrase "done so" refers to freeling receiving what they had. Alternate translation: "as you you had not freely received it" or "as if you had earned it"
