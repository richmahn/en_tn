# We are fools ... in dishonor

Paul uses irony to shame the Corinthians so they will think about what he is saying. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])

# You are held in honor

"People treat you Corinthians as though you are important people"

# we are held in dishonor

"people shame us apostles"
