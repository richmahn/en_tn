# We are fools ... in dishonor

Paul uses irony to shame the Corinthians so they will think about what he is saying. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])

# You are held in honor

"People treat you Corinthians as though you are important people"

# we are held in dishonor

"people shame us apostles"

# Up to this present hour

"Until now" or "Up to now"

# we are brutally beaten

This refers to hitting with the hand, not with whips or clubs. This can be stated in active form. AT: "people beat us" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# we are homeless

Paul means that they had places to stay, but they had to move around from place to place. They had no fixed home.
