## translationNotes

* ** it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you** - Paul is comparing the difference between human judgement and God's judgement. Man's judgment is trivial compared to God's true judgement upon man.
* ** I am not aware of any charge being made** - AT: "I have not heard of any accusation."
* **that does not mean I am innocent. It is the Lord who judges me.** - "that lack of accusation does not prove I am innocent; the Lord knows if I am innocent or guilty."
