# it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you

Paul is comparing the difference between human judgment and God's judgment. Man's judgment is not important compared to God's true judgment upon man.

# I am not aware of any charge being made against me

"I have not heard anyone accuse me of doing wrong"

# that does not mean I am innocent. It is the Lord who judges me

"that lack of accusation does not prove I am innocent. The Lord knows if I am innocent or guilty"
