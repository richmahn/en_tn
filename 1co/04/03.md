##  it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you ##

Paul is comparing the difference between human judgement and God's judgement. Man's judgment is trivial compared to God's true judgement upon man.

##  I am not aware of any charge being made ##

AT: "I have not heard of any accusation."

## that does not mean I am innocent. It is the Lord who judges me. ##

"that lack of accusation does not prove I am innocent; the Lord knows if I am innocent or guilty."
