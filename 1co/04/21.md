# What do you want?

Paul was making a last appeal to the Corinthians, as he has been rebuking them for the errors they had made. Alternate translation: "Tell me what you want to happen now" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Shall I come to you with a rod or with love and in a spirit of gentleness

Paul is offering the Corinthians two opposing attitudes he could use when approaching them. Alternate translation: "If you want, I can come to punish you, or I can come to show you how much I love you by being gentle with you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# of gentleness

"of kindness" or "of tenderness"
