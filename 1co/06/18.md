# Run away from

Paul speaks of a person rejecting sexual sin as if that person were running away from danger. Alternate translation: "Get away from" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# immorality! Every other sin that a person commits is outside the body, but

Possible meanings are 1) Paul is showing that sexual sin is especially bad because it is not only against others but against the sinner's own body or 2) Paul is quoting what some Corinthians were thinking. Alternate translation: "immorality! Some of you are saying, 'Every sin that a person commits is outside the body,' but I say that" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# sin that a person commits

"evil deed that a person does"
