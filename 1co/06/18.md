## translationNotes

* **Run away from** - The physical image of a person running from danger is compared to the spiritual image of a person rejecting sin. AT: "Get away from". (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **commits** - AT: "does" or "performs"
* **"Every other sin that a person commits is outside the body"â€”but the sexually immoral person sins against his own body** - Sexual sin can result in one's own body becoming sick with disease, but other sins do not harm the physical body the same way.
