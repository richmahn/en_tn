Caused Jesus to be alive again.

## Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? ##

Just as our arms and legs are members of our own bodies, so our bodies are members of Christ's body the church. AT: "Your bodies are part of Christ" (See [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## Shall I then take away the members of Christ and join them to a prostitute? ##

AT: "You are part of Christ, I will not join you with a prostitute."

## May it not be! ##

AT: "That should never happen!"
