# Do you not know that the believers will judge the world?

Paul is shaming the Corinthians for acting like they do not know. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# If then, you will judge the world, are you not able to settle matters of little importance?

Because they will be given greater responsibility later, they should be responsible for lesser things now. Alternate translation: "you will judge the world in the future, so you should be able to settle this matter now." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
