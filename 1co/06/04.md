# If then you have to make judgments that pertain to daily life, why do you lay such cases as these before those who have no standing in the church?

Possible meanings are 1) this is a rhetorical question or 2) this is a statement, "When in the past you have settled matters that are important in this life, you have not handed off disputes between Christians to be settled by unbelievers" or 3) this is a command, "When you settle matters that are important in this life, it is even to those who have no standing in the church that you should hand off disputes to be settled!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# If then you have to make judgments that pertain to daily life

"If you are called upon to make decisions about daily life" or "If you must settle matters that are important in this life"

# why do you lay such cases as these before those who have no standing in the church?

Paul is rebuking the Corinthians for how they are handling these cases. Possible meanings are that 1) "you should stop giving such cases to people who are outside the church." or 2) "you could give such cases even to members of the church who are not well regarded by other believers." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# to your shame

"to your dishonor" or "to show how you have failed in this matter"

# Is there no one among you wise enough to settle a dispute between brothers?

Paul is shaming the Corinthians. AT: "You should be ashamed that you cannot find a wise believer to settle arguments between believers" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# brothers

Here this means fellow Christians, including both men and women.

# dispute

"argument" or "disagreement"

# But as it stands

"But the way it is now" or "But instead"

# one believer goes to court against another believer, and that case is placed before a judge who is an unbeliever

"believers who have disputes with each other ask unbelieving judges to make decisions for them"

# that case is placed

This can be stated in active form. AT: "a believer submits that case" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
