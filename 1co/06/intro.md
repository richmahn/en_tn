#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Lawsuits #####

Paul teaches that a Christian should not take another Christian to court before a non-Christian judge. It is better to be cheated. Christians will judge the angels. So they should be able to solve problems among themselves. It is especially bad to use a court to cheat another believer. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/judge]])
