# 1 Corinthians 06 General Notes #

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Lawsuits #####

Christians should not take another Christian to court before a non-Christian judge. It is better to be cheated. Since Christians will judge the angels, they should be able to solve problems among themselves. It is especially bad to use a court to cheat another believer. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/judge]])

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter ####
