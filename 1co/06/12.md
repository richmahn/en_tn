# Connecting Statement:

Paul reminds the Corinthian believers that God wants them pure because Christ has bought them with his death. Their bodies are now God's temple. He does so by saying what the Corinthians might say and then correcting them.

# Everything is lawful for me

Possible meanings are 1) Paul is answering what some Corinthians might be thinking, "Some say, 'I can do anything'" or 2) Paul is actually saying what he thinks is true, "God allows me to do anything."

# but not everything is beneficial

Paul is answering whoever says, "Everything is lawful for me." Alternate translation: "but not everything is good for me"

# I will not be mastered by any of them

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "I will not allow these things to rule over me like a master" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
