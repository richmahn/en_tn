# but not everything is beneficial

Paul is answering whoever says, "Everything is lawful for me." AT: "but not everything is good for me"

# I will not be mastered by any of them

This can be stated in active form. AT: "I will not allow these things to rule over me like a master" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# "Food is for the stomach, and the stomach is for food," but God will do away with both of them
