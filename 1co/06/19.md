# Do you not know ... God? ... that you are not your own?

Paul is continuing to teach the Corinthians by emphasizing what they already know. AT: "I want to remind you ... God and that you are not your own." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# your body

the body of each individual Christian is a temple of the Holy Spirit

# temple of the Holy Spirit

A temple is dedicated to divine beings, and it is also where they dwell. In the same way, each Corinthian believer's body is like a temple because the Holy Spirit is present within them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
