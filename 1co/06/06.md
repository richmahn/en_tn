# But as it stands

"But the way it is now" or "But instead"

# one believer goes to court against another believer, and that case is placed before a judge who is an unbeliever

"believers who have disputes with each other ask unbelieving judges to make decisions for them"

# that case is placed

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "a believer submits that case" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
