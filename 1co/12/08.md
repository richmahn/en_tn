# to one is given by the Spirit the word

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "by means of the Spirit God gives to one person the word" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# the word

"the message"

# by the Spirit

God gives the gifts through the work of the Spirit.

# wisdom ... knowledge

The difference between these two words is not as important here as the fact that God gives them both by the same Spirit.

# the word of wisdom

Paul is communicating one idea through two words. Alternate translation: "wise words" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])

# the word of knowledge

Paul is communicating one idea through two words. Alternate translation: "words that show knowldge" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
