# Are all of them apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all do powerful deeds?

Paul is reminding his readers of what they already know. Alternate translation: "Only some of them are apostles. Only some of them are prophets. Only some of them are teachers. Only some of them do powerful deeds." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
