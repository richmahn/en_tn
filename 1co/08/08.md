# food will not present us to God

Paul speaks of food as though it were a person who could make God welcome us. AT: "food does not give us favor with God" or "the food we eat does not make God pleased with us" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# We are not worse if we do not eat, nor better if we do eat it

This can be stated in positive form. AT: "Some people might think that if we do not eat some things, God will love us less. But they are wrong. Those who think that God will love us more if we do eat those things are also wrong" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])

# someone who is weak

believers not strong in their faith

# sees you, who have

Paul is speaking to the Corinthians as if they were one person, so these words are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# his ... conscience

what he understands to be right and wrong

# emboldened to eat

"encouraged to eat"
