# General Information:

"We" and "us" here refers to all believers. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-inclusive]])

# We know that an idol in this world is nothing and that there is no God but one

Paul is probably quoting phrases that some Corinthians used. Being "nothing" represents having no power. AT: "We all know, as you yourselves like to say, that an idol in this world has no power and that there is no God but one" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# so-called gods

"things that people call gods"

# many "gods" and many "lords."

Paul does not believe that many gods and many lords exist, but he recognizes that the pagans believe they do.

# Yet for us there is only one God

"Yet we know that there is only one God"
