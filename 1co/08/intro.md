# 1 Corinthians 08 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

In Chapters 8-10, Paul answers the question: "Is it acceptable to eat meat that has been sacrificed to an idol?"

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Meat sacrificed to idols #####
Paul answers this question by saying that idols are gods that do not really exist. Therefore nothing is wrong with the meat. Christians are free to eat it. However, someone who does not understand this may see a Christian eating it. They may then be encouraged to eat the meat as an act of worship to the idol.
