# Connecting Statement:

Paul describes the believer's position and fellowship in Christ as they wait for his coming.

# because of the grace of God that Christ Jesus gave to you

Paul speaks of grace as though it were a physical object that Jesus gives Christians as a gift. Alternate translation: "because Christ Jesus has made it possible for God to be kind to you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
