# Each one of you says

Paul is expressing a general attitude of division.

# Is Christ divided?

Paul wishes to emphasize the truth that Christ is not divided but one. "It is not possible to divide Christ in the way you are doing!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# Was Paul crucified for you?

Paul wishes to emphasize that it was Christ, not Paul or Apollos, who was crucified. This can also be translated in active form. AT: "It certainly was not Paul whom they put to death on the cross for your salvation!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# Were you baptized in the name of Paul?

Paul wishes to emphasize that we all are baptized in the name of Christ. This can also be translated in active form. AT: "It was not in the name of Paul that people baptized you!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
