# God chose ... wise. God chose ... strong

Paul repeats many of the same words in two sentences that mean almost the same thing to emphasize the difference between God's way of doing things and how people think God should do them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise

"God chose to use those whom the world thinks are foolish to shame those whom the world thinks are wise"

# God chose what is weak in the world to shame what is strong

"God chose to use those whom the world thinks are weak to shame those whom the world thinks are strong"
