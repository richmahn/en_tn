# 1 Corinthians 01 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

The first paragraph of 1 Corinthians was a common way of opening a letter in the ancient Near East. 

Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the words of verse 19, which are from the Old Testament.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Disunity #####
In this chapter, Paul scolds the church for being divided and for following different apostles. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/apostle]]) 

##### Spiritual gifts #####
Spiritual gifts are specific supernatural abilities that the Holy Spirit gives to Christians after they come to faith in Jesus. Paul lists spiritual gifts in Chapter 12. Some scholars believe the Holy Spirit gave some of these gifts only in the early church to help establish the developing church. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]])
