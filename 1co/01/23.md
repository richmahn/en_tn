# Christ crucified

"about Christ, who died on a cross" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# a stumbling block

Just as a person can stumble over a block on a road, so the message of salvation through the crucifixion of the Christ keeps Jews from believing in Jesus. Alternate translation: "not acceptable" or "very offensive" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
