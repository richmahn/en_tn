# Connecting Statement:

Paul reminds the Corinthian believers that they are to live in unity with each other and that the message of the cross of Christ, not baptism by people, is what saves.

# brothers

Here this means fellow Christians, including both men and women.

# through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ

"Name" here is a metonym for the person of Jesus Christ. AT: "by means of our Lord Jesus Christ" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# that you all agree

"that you live in harmony with one another"

# that there be no divisions among you

"that you do not divide into separate groups among yourselves"

# be joined together with the same mind and by the same purpose

"live in unity"
