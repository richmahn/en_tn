# Where is the wise person? Where is the scholar? Where is the debater of this world?

Paul emphasizes that truly wise people are nowhere to be found. Alternate translation: "Compared with the wisdom of the gospel, there are no wise people, no scholars, no debaters!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# the scholar

a person who is recognized as someone who has studied a great deal

# the debater

a person who argues about what he knows or who is skilled in such arguments

# Has not God turned the wisdom of the world into foolishness?

Paul uses this question to emphasize what God has done to the wisdom of this world. Alternate translation: "God has shown that everything they call wisdom is really foolishness" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
