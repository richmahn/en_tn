## translationNotes

* **to those whom God has called** - "to the people God calls"
* **we preach Christ** - AT: "we teach about Christ" or "we tell all people about Christ."
* **Christ as the power of God and the wisdom of God** - Christ is the one through whom God shows his power and wisdom.
* **the foolishness of God...the weakness of God** - This is a contradiction between God's nature and man's nature. Even if there was any foolishness or weakness in God, He weakness is still far superior to man's best nature.
