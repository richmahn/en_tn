# Christ did not send me to baptize

This means that baptism was not the primary goal of Paul's ministry.

# words of human wisdom ... the cross of Christ should not be emptied of its power

Paul speaks of "words of human wisdom" as if they were people, the cross as a container, and of power as a physical thing that Jesus can put in that container. This can be stated in active form. AT: "words of human wisdom ... those words of human wisdom should not empty the cross of Christ of its power" or "words of human wisdom ... people should not stop believing the message about Jesus and start thinking I am more important than Jesus" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
