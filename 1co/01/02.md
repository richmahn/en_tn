# Paul ... to the church of God at Corinth

Your language may have a particular way of introducing the author of a letter and the intended audience. AT: "I, Paul, wrote this letter to you in Corinth who believe in God"

# those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus

Here "sanctified" refers to people whom God has reserved to honor him. AT: "to those whom Christ Jesus has set apart for God" or "to those whom God has set apart for himself because they belong to Christ Jesus"

# who are called to be holy people

This can be stated in active form. AT: "whom God has called to be holy people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# who call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ

"Name" here is a metonym for person of Jesus Christ. AT: "who call on the Lord Jesus Christ" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# their Lord and ours

The word "ours" includes Paul's audience. Jesus is the Lord of Paul and the Corinthians and all the churches. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-inclusive]])
