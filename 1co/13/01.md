# Connecting Statement:

Having just talked about the gifts that God gave to believers, Paul emphasizes what is more important.

# the tongues of ... angels

Possible meanings are 1) Paul is exaggerating for the sake of effect and does not believe that people speak the language that angels use or 2) Paul thinks that some who speak in tongues actually speak the language that angels use. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# I have become a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal

# a clanging cymbal
