# because it was for the sake of the name that they went out

Here "the name" refers to Jesus. AT: "for they have gone out to tell people about Jesus" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# taking nothing

receiving no gifts or help

# the Gentiles

Here "Gentiles" does not just mean people who are not Jewish. It implies people who do not trust in Jesus.
