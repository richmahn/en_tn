# Connecting Statement:

John's purpose in writing this letter is to compliment Gaius in the way he took care of traveling Bible teachers; then he talks about two people, one evil and one good.

# General Information:

Here the word "we" refers to John and those with him, and possibly includes all believers. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-inclusive]])

# Beloved

Here this is used as a term of endearment for fellow believers.

# you practice faithfulness

"you are doing what is faithful to God" or "you are being loyal to God"

# work for the brothers and for strangers

"help fellow believers and those you do not know"

# strangers who have borne witness of your love in the presence of the church

"strangers who have told the believers in the church about how you have loved them"

# You do well to send them

John is thanking Gaius for his normal practice of helping these believers.

# because it was for the sake of the name that they went out

Here "the name" refers to Jesus. AT: "for they have gone out to tell people about Jesus" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# taking nothing

receiving no gifts or help

# the Gentiles

Here "Gentiles" does not just mean people who are not Jewish. It implies people who do not trust in Jesus.

# so that we will be fellow workers for the truth

"so that we will cooperate with them in announcing God's truth to people"
