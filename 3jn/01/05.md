# General Information:

Here the word "we" refers to John and those with him, and possibly includes all believers. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-inclusive]])

# Connecting Statement:

John's purpose in writing this letter is to compliment Gaius in the way he took care of traveling Bible teachers; then he talks about two people, one evil and one good.

# work for the brothers and for strangers
