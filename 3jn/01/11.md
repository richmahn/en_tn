# General Information:

Here "we" refers to John and those with him and does not include Gaius. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

# Beloved

Here this is used as a term of endearment for fellow believers. See how you translated this in [3 John 1:5](./05.md).

# do not imitate what is evil

"do not copy the evil things that people do"

# but what is good

There are words left out but they are understood. AT: "but imitate the good things that people do" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# is of God

"belongs to God"

# has not seen God

"does not belong to God" or "does not believe in God"

# Demetrius is borne witness to by all

This can be stated in active form. AT: "All who know Demetrius bear witness of him" or "Every believer who knows Demetrius speaks well of him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# Demetrius

This is probably a man whom John wants Gaius and the congregation to welcome when he comes to visit. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# by the truth itself

"the truth itself speaks well of him." Here "truth" is described as a person speaking. AT: "everyone who knows the truth knows he is a good person" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns]])

# We also bear witness

What John is confirming is implied and can be made specific here. AT: "We also speak well of Demetrius" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
