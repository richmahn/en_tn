# Demetrius is borne witness to by all

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "All who know Demetrius bear witness of him" or "Every believer who knows Demetrius speaks well of him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# Demetrius

This is probably a man whom John wants Gaius and the congregation to welcome when he comes to visit. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# by the truth itself

"the truth itself speaks well of him." Here "truth" is described as a person speaking. Alternate translation: "everyone who knows the truth knows he is a good person" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns]])

# We also bear witness

What John is confirming is implied and can be made specific here. Alternate translation: "We also speak well of Demetrius" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
