# Who knows whether or not Yahweh will be gracious to me, that the child may live?

David asked this rhetorical question to empathize that no one knew if Yahweh would let the child live. This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: "No one knows whether or not Yahweh will be gracious to me so that the child may live." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
