##### David's punishment #####
God sent a prophet to confront David. He said that because David had Uriah killed, there would always be killing in his family and that the baby conceived with Bathsheba would die. David prayed that the baby be allowed to live, but the infant died. Bathsheba then had another son, who was named Solomon. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]])
