# Joab fought ... he captured

Here the author says "Joab" but he is referring to Joab and his soldiers who fought with him. AT: "Joab and his soldiers fought ... they captured" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# Rabbah

Fighting against this city literally means to fight against the people of Rabbah. Translate the name the same as you did in [2 Samuel 11:1](../11/01.md). AT: "the people of Rabbah" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
