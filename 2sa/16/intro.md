# 2 Samuel 16 General Notes

#### Special concepts in this chapter

##### Absalom seeks advice from David's advisers
David's best adviser, Ahithophel, told Absalom to publicly seduce the concubines that David had left to take care of the palace. Because the concubines were the king's property, having sexual relations with a king's concubines implied that Absalom was now the king. This would show the people that the break with David was complete. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter
