# in the sight of all Israel

# as if a man heard from the mouth of God himself

Here God's mouth represents himself and emphasizes his speech. AT: "as if God had said it with his own mouth" or "as if a man heard it spoken by God himself" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns]])
