# they spread

"they set up"

# in the sight of all Israel

This means that people were able to see the tent and Absalom walking in and out of the tent with the women. The phrase "all of Israel" is a generalization, for only people near the palace could see it. AT: "where the Israelites could see him go into the tent" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
