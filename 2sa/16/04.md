# Mephibosheth

See how you translated this man's name in [2 Samuel 4:4](../04/04.md).

# I bow in humility to you

Ziba is not literally bowing before the king when he is speaking here. This means that he will serve the king with the same amount of humility he would be showing if he were literally bowing before him. Alternate translation: "I will humbly serve you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Let me find favor in your eyes

The phrase "find favor" means to be approved of by someone. Also, "eyes" is a metonym for sight, and sight represents judgment or evaluation. Alternate translation: "I want you to be pleased with me" or "I desire you for to be pleased with me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
