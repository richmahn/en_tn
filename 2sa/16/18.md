# the one whom Yahweh

Hushai is referring to Absalom.

# the one whom ... that is the man ... with him

Here Hushai is referring to Absalom in the third person to take emphasize off of him and place it on Yahweh and the people who chose him. This can be written in second person. Alternate translation: "you are the one whom ... you are the man ... with you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
