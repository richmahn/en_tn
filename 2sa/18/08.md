# more men were consumed by the forest than by the sword

Here "the forest" is described as if it were alive and could act. "The sword" refers to David's soldiers who fought with swords. AT: "dangerous things in the forest killed more men than David's soldiers killed with their swords" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
