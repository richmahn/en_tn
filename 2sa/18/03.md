# half of us

The word "half" refers to one out of two equal parts. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])

# you are worth ten thousand of us

This means that the enemy army considering killing David of greater worth than killing 10,000 of the other men. The number 10,000 here is an exaggeration used to emphasize a very great number of people. Alternate translation: "they would rather kill you than to kill 10,000 of us" or "killing you is worth more to them than killing a great number of us" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# ten thousand

"10,000" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])

# that you be ready to help us from the city

David could help them from the city by advising them and sending men to help them. This can be stated clearly. Alternate translation: "that you stay here in the city and send help to us" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
