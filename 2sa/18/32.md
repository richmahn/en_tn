# The enemies of my master the king, ... should be as that young man is

The Cushite uses a comparison as a polite way to tell the king that Absalom is dead. This can be stated more directly. Alternate translation: "I would like all your enemies ... to die the way that young man died" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
