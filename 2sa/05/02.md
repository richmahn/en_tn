# In the recent past

This is historical information. Saul had been their king before David. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])

# You will shepherd my people Israel, and you will become ruler over Israel

These two clauses mean basically the same thing and emphasize that Yahweh had chosen David to be king. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# You will shepherd my people Israel

Here ruling over the people is spoken of as shepherding them. Alternate translation: "You will care for my people Israel" or "You will rule over my people Israel" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
