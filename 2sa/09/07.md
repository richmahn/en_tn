# for Jonathan your father's sake

"because I loved your father, Jonathan"

# you will always eat at my table

Here "my table" represents being together with David or in his presence. Eating with the king at his table was a great honor. AT: "you will always eat with me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
