## you will always eat at my table ##

Here the "my table" refers to being together with or in David's presence. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## What is your servant, that you should look with favor on such a dead dog as I am? ##

This question is asked to show Mephibosheth understands his place. AT: "I am of no importance at all." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## such a dead dog ##

Here the Mephibosheth represents the line of Saul, and compares himself to a "dead dog." Dogs were all feral and while alive were of little importance and were not directly cared for. So, a dead dog would have even less importance. AT: "I am like a dead dog"  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
