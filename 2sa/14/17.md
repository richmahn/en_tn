# the word of my master the king

"the message of my master the king"

# for as an angel of God, so is my master ... from evil

Here David, the king, is compared to an "angel of God." AT: "for the king is like an angel of God because they both know how to tell good from evil" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
