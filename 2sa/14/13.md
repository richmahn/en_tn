# Why then have you devised such a thing against the people of God?

The woman asks this rhetorical question to rebuke David for how he has treated Absalom. This question can be written as a statement. Alternate translation: "What you have just said proved that you did wrong." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# the king is like someone who is guilty

The woman compares the king to someone who is guilty to suggest that he is guilty without saying it directly. Alternate translation: "the king has declared himself guilty"

# his banished son

"his son whom he banished"

# God ... finds a way for those who were driven away to be restored

The woman is implying that David should bring his son back to himself. This can be stated clearly. Alternate translation: "God brings back someone whom he has driven away and you should do the same for your son" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
