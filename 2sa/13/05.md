# Jonadab

See how you translated this man's name in [2 Samuel 13:3](../13/03.md).

# eat it from her hand

This is probably a request for her to serve food to him personally. He probably did not want her to put the food in his mouth. Alternate translation: "have her serve it to me herself" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
