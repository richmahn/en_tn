# Jonadab

See how you translated this man's name in [2 Samuel 13:03](./03.md).

# eat it from her hand ... I may eat from her hand

This is a request for her to serve food to him personally. Alternate translation: "have her serve it to me herself ... she may serve it to me to eat" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
