# Jonadab

See how you translated this man's name in [2 Samuel 13:03](./03.md).

# eat it from her hand ... I may eat from her hand

This is a request for her to serve food to him personally. AT: "have her serve it to me herself ... she may serve it to me to eat" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# pretended to be sick

This means he gave a false appearance of being ill.

# for my sickness in front of me

The food is not for his sickness, but rather it is for him, because he is sick. The phrase "in front of me" is a request for Tamar to prepare the food in his presence. AT: "in front of me because I am sick" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
