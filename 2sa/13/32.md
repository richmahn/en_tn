# Jonadab ... Shimeah

See how you translated these men's names in [2 Samuel 13:03](../13/03.md).

# Let not my master believe

"My master, do not believe"

# my master

Jonadab calls David "my master" to show respect.

# Amnon violated his sister

This is a polite way of saying that Amnon raped his sister. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
