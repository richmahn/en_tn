# Jonadab ... Shimeah

See how you translated these men's names in [2 Samuel 13:03](./03.md).

# Let not my master believe

"My master, do not believe"

# my master

Jonadab calls David "my master" to show respect.

# Amnon violated his sister

This is a polite way of saying that Amnon raped his sister. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])

# let not my master the king

"my master the king, do not"

# take this report to heart

The phrase "take something to heart" means "to worry about it." AT: "worry about this report" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
