# I may eat from her hand

This is probably a request for her to serve food to him personally. He probably did not expect her to put the food in his mouth. Alternate translation: "she may serve it to me to eat" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# pretended to be sick

This means he gave a false appearance of being ill.

# for my sickness in front of me

The food is not for his sickness, but rather it is for him, because he is sick. The phrase "in front of me" is a request for Tamar to prepare the food in his presence. Alternate translation: "in front of me because I am sick" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
