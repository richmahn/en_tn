# Absalom pressed David

Here the author speaks of Absalom urging David to let Amnon come as if he were putting physical pressure on him. Alternate translation: "Absalom begged David for Amnon to come" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# all the king's sons

This does not include Absalom and Amnon who is dead. It includes the rest of the sons that the king allowed to go to the celebration. Alternate translation: "the rest of the king's sons" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
