This question is used to show that the men had committed an especially serious crime. It can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: "You are even more guilty! It is my duty to require his blood from your hand and to remove you from the earth." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# require his blood from your hand

The phrase "his blood" represents the life of Ishbosheth. Here "from your hand" represents Rechab and Baanah, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, introduced in [2 Samuel 4:5](./05.md). Alternate translation: "hold you responsible for the death of Ishbosheth" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
