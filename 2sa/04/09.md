# As Yahweh lives

This is one of the strongest oaths David could swear, as Yahweh is the witness. AT: "I swear on the life of Yahweh" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# who delivered my life

Here "life" refers to David himself. This means that Yahweh has kept David alive. AT: "who rescued me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
