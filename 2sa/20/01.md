# to be at the same place

This refers to the town of Gilgal.

# Sheba ... Bikri

These are names of men. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# We have no part in David, neither have we any inheritance in the son of Jesse

Both of these statements mean the same thing. Sheba is emphasizing that he and the tribes of Israel have no relationship with David. AT: "The inheritance of David and his father's family does not belong to us" or "We are not a part of David and his father's family" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
