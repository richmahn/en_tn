# Abishai

This is another commander of David's army. See how you translated his name in [2 Samuel 2:18](../02/18.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# do us more harm

"hurt us more"

# your master's servants, my soldiers

The phrase "my soldiers" clarifies which "servants." David refers to himself as "your master" as a formal way of speaking to someone with less authority.

# pursue after

"chase after"

# he will find fortified cities

This means that Sheba and his men will enter these cities to hide from David's army. The word "he" represents Sheba but refers to both him and his men. Alternate translation: "he and his men will hide in fortified cities" or "he and his men will take refuge in fortified cities" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# out of our sight

Here David refers to his army by their sight to emphasize that Sheba and his men would be hidden and David's army would be unable to capture them. Alternate translation: "from us" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
