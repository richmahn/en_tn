## Abishai ##

This is another commander of David's army. See how you translated his name in [2 Samuel 2:18](../02/18.md).

## do us harm ##

"hurt us"

## your masterâ€™s servants, my soldiers ##

Both of these phrases mean the same thing. David refers to himself as "your master." This is a formal way of speaking to someone with less authority. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

## pursue after ##

"seek after" or "chase after"

## he will find fortified cities and escape out of our sight ##

"he will get away from us and find protection in a strong city"

## Cherethites, Pelethites ##

These are the names of people-groups who helped to protect King David. See how you translated these in  [2 Samuel 8:15](../08/15.md).
