# 2 Samuel 21 General Notes

#### Structure and formatting

#### Special concepts in this chapter

##### Famine caused by a broken oath
When Israel first conquered the land, they promised not to kill the people of Gibeon. When Saul tried to kill them all, God caused a famine in Israel. David made amends with the people of Gideon and the famine ended. David also kept his vow to Jonathan's sons. This helps to show the wisdom of king David. Although these people were not Israelites, they believed in Yahweh. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/promise]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/vow]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/wise]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/believe]])

##### Wisdom, grace and justice
David is seen to have many great qualities in this chapter. These were qualities important for a king of Israel: wisdom, grace and justice. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/wise]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/grace]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/justice]])
