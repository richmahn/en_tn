## Mephibosheth ##

Translate this as you did in [2 Samuel 4:4](../04/04.md).

## He had not dressed his feet, or trimmed his beard, or washed his clothes from the day the king left until the day he came home in peace. ##

These acts together represent that Mephibosheth was in mourning for David until he had returned safely. AT: "He did not care for himself; he mourned for David until David had safely returned home safely."
