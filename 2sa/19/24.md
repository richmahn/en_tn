## translationNotes

* **Mephibosheth** - Translate this as you did in [[:en:bible:notes:2sa:04:04]].
* **He had not dressed his feet, or trimmed his beard, or washed his clothes from the day the king left until the day he came home in peace.** - These acts together represent that Mephibosheth was in mourning for David until he had returned safely. AT: "He did not care for himself; he mourned for David until David had safely returned home safely."
