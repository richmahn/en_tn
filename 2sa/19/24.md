# Mephibosheth

See how you translated this man's name in [2 Samuel 4:4](../04/04.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# He had not dressed his feet

"He had not cared for his feet." Mephibosheth's feet were crippled. This phrase means that he had not taken proper care of his feet.
