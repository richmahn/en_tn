# all my father's house were dead men before my master the king

Mephibosheth speaks of how his relatives had deserved to be executed as if they had already been executed and were dead. Alternate translation: "all my father's house deserved for my master the king to order them to be executed" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# my father's house

This refers to his father's relatives. Alternate translation: "my father's relatives" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# What right therefore have I that I should still cry any more to the king?

Mephibosheth uses this rhetorical question to emphasize that he has no right to request anything from the king. This can be written as a statement. Alternate translation: "Therefore, I have no right to ask the king to do anything else for me." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
