## translationNotes

* **I swear by Yahweh** - Joab is making a very strong oath.
* **all the people ** - Here "the people" refers to the nation of Israel. It is unlikely that every person in the nation of Israel is present here, so this is likely an intentional exaggeration for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
