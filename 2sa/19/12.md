# You are my brothers, my flesh and bone

The king uses these to phrases to emphasize that they are closely related. Being or having the same flesh is a metaphor for belonging to the same family or tribe. Alternate translation: "You are my brothers, and we have the same flesh and bone" or "You are my brothers, my close relatives" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Why then are you the last to bring back the king?

This is the second rhetorical question here and it is also a rebuke for the elders of Judah. This can be written as a statement. Alternate translation: "You should have been the first, not the last, to bring back the king." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
