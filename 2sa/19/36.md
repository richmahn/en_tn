# Why should the king repay me with such a reward?

Barzillai uses this rhetorical question to emphasize that he does not know why the king would reward him this way. This can be written as a statement. Alternate translation: "I do not know why the king would repay me with such a great reward" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
