# Gera ... Ziba

These are the names of men. Translate the name "Ziba" the same as you did in [2 Samuel 9:2](../09/01.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# one thousand men ... fifteen sons ... twenty servants

"1,000 men ... 15 sons ... 20 servants" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])

# in the presence of the king

This means that the king was there and was aware of what was happening. Alternate translation: "at the place where the king was" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
