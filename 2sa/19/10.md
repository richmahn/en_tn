# why do you say nothing about bringing the king back?

This means they should consider bringing David back now that Absalom was dead. The question may be written as a statement. Alternate translation: "we should be talking about bringing the king back." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# the king

This refers to David.
