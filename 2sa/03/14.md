# one hundred Philistine foreskins

This represents the number of men David killed so that Saul would allow him to marry Michal. These men are represented here by their "foreskins." The "foreskin" is the fold of skin that covers the male reproductive organ. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
