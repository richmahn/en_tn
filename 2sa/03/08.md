# Am I a dog's head that belongs to Judah?

This question is used by Abner as an angry denial of Ishbosheth's accusation. It can be translated as a statement. AT: "I am not a traitor working for David!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Am I a dog's head that belongs to Judah?

Abner speaks of himself as the head of a dog, which the Israelites considered to be loyal to anyone who fed them. Here "belongs to Judah" implies that Abner's loyalty is to Judah, to which David belonged, and not to Saul's house. AT: "Am I a traitor for Judah?" or "I am not a traitor working for David!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# into the hand of David

Here "hand" represents the power to defeat. AT: "to be defeated by David" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# But now you accuse me of an offense concerning this woman?

Abner asks this question to rebuke Ishbosheth. It is unclear if Abner actually slept with Rizpah, or if he was falsely accused. Possible meanings are 1) Abner was guilty. AT: "You should not be upset that I slept with this woman!" or 2) Abner was not guilty. AT: "You should not think that I have slept with this woman!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
