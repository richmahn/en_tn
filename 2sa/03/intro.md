# 2 Samuel 03 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

This chapter records the first attempt to end the civil war.

Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetic song in 3:33-34.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

David never wanted to hurt Saul's family. Isbosheth criticized Abner and Abner became angry. He decided to help David become king of all of Israel. Abner came and made a treaty with David. As he left, Joab arrived and told him he wanted to talk to him and he murdered Abner. David was very unhappy that Abner had been killed.
