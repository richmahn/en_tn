This continues David's song to Yahweh. He uses parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## They came against me on the day of my distress ##

"My enemies fought against me when I was in great trouble"

## But Yahweh was my support ##

"But Yahweh supported me" or "But Yahweh helped me"

## a wide open place ##

This refers to a place where there was no danger and his enemies could not trap him.

## to the measure of the cleanness of my hands ##

Here "cleanness of my hands" means the same as "righteousness." AT: "because I obey his commands" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
