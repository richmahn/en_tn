# General Information:

This continues David's song to Yahweh. He uses parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# They came against me on the day of my distress

"My enemies fought against me when I was in great trouble"

# the day of my distress

"the time of my distress"

# but Yahweh was my support

"but Yahweh supported me" or "but Yahweh helped me"

# a wide open place

This refers to a place where there was no danger and his enemies could not trap him.

# to the measure of the cleanness of my hands

Here "cleanness of my hands" means the same as "righteousness." AT: "because I obey his commands" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
