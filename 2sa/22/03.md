David's song to Yahweh continues. He uses parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## God is my rock...He is my shield, the horn of my salvation, my stronghold ##

All of these are symbols of God's strength and power. They emphasize God's ability to protect and save his people. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## who is worthy to be praised ##

AT: "who is worthy to receive praise" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## I will be saved from my enemies ##

AT: "He will save me from my enemies"
