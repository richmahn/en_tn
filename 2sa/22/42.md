David continues his song to Yahweh.

## They cried ##

"My enemies cried"

## They cried out to Yahweh, but he did not answer them ##

The time for Yahweh's judgment had come upon them.

## like dust on the ground...like mud in the streets ##

David completely destroyed his enemies. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
