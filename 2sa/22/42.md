# General Information:

David continues his song to Yahweh.

# They cried

"My enemies cried"

# they cried out to Yahweh, but he did not answer them

The time for Yahweh's judgment had come upon them.

# like dust on the ground ... like mud in the streets

This means that David completely destroyed his enemies. These two phrases "like dust on the ground" and "like mud on the streets" have a similar meaning and are used for emphasis. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
