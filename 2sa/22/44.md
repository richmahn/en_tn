David continues his song to Yahweh.

## from the disputes of my own people ##

This refers to those among the Israelites who rebelled against King David.

## You have kept me as the head of nations ##

"You placed me as ruler over the nations." Here "nations" refer to other nations besides Israel.

## A people that I have not known ##

"A foreign people"

## Foreigners were forced to bow to me ##

AT: "Foreigners bowed down to me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
