# General Information:

This continues David's song to Yahweh. He uses parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# Then the channels of the sea were seen ... breath of his nostrils

When Yahweh shouted in his attack against David's enemies, it is compared to his power to create upheaval in the deepest parts of the ocean and the earth. This shows his great power and fierce anger. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# the channels of the sea were seen

This means that the sea water moved and the ocean floor was visible. This can be translated in active form. Alternate translation: "People could see the channels of the sea" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# the channels of the sea

the deepest part of the sea, from which the Hebrews believed was where the water in the sea came

# the foundations of the world were laid bare at the rebuke of Yahweh, at the blast of the breath of his nostrils

David compares Yahweh's anger to turbulent movements of the ground. "This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "Yahweh's rebuke, the breath of his nostrils, laid bare the foundations of the world" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
