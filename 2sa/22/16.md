# General Information:

This continues David's song to Yahweh. He uses parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# Then the channels of the sea were seen ... breath of his nostrils

When Yahweh shouted in his attack against David's enemies, it is compared to his power to create upheaval in the deepest parts of the ocean and the earth. This shows his great power and fierce anger. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# the channels of the sea were seen



# the foundations ... were laid bare

David compares Yahweh's anger to turbulent movements of the ground. "This can be stated in active form. AT: "Yahweh's battle cry exposed the foundations of the world" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
