This continues David's song to Yahweh. He uses parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## Then the water channels appeared...breath of his nostrils ##

Again, David emphasizes Yahweh's power and anger. When Yahweh shouted in his attack against David's enemies, its power uncovered the deepest parts of the ocean and the earth. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## The foundations...were exposed ##

This was part of the result of Yahweh shouting.
