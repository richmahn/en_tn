# General Information:

David continues his song to Yahweh.

# You put strength on me like a belt for battle

Here the strength that Yahweh gives is compared to a belt for battle that allowed David to do mighty things. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# you put under me those who rise up against me

"you helped me defeat those who fought against me"
