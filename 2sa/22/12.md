# He opened the heavens ... rain clouds in the skies

David describes Yahweh's way of saving David from his enemies as a storm cloud gathering over a place. This emphasizes God's power and his anger. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# He made darkness a tent around him

Here the darkness Yahweh creates is compared to a tent which hides him completely. AT: "He hid himself in the darkness" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
