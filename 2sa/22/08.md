# General Information:

David's song to Yahweh continues. He uses parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# Then the earth shook ... were ignited by it

This is Yahweh's response to David's cry for help from his enemies. David uses the imagery of the earth shaking and fire coming from Yahweh to emphasize Yahweh's terrible anger. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# earth shook ... heavens trembled

David speaks of the two extremes to include everything in creation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])

# and were shaken, because God was angry

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "because God's anger shook them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
