David continues his song to Yahweh.

## He makes my feet swift like a deer And places me on the mountains ##

Yahweh gives David the strength to move quickly and provides secure places for protection and rest. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

## my hands...and my arms ##

Both of these refer to David. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

## to bend a bow of bronze ##

Only a very strong man could use a bow made from metal.
