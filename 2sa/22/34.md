# General Information:

David continues his song to Yahweh.

# He makes my feet swift like a deer and places me on the high hills

Here David's feet are compared to those of a deer using exaggeration. Yahweh gives David the strength to move quickly and provides secure places for protection and rest. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# my hands ... and my arms

Both of these refer to David. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# to bend a bow of bronze

Only a very strong man could use a bow made from metal.
