David's song to Yahweh continues. He uses parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## For the waves of death surrounded me. The rushing waters of worthlessness overwhelmed me ##

David compares the wicked men who wanted to kill him to flood waters that are about to drown him. David felt helpless against the power of his enemies. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## The rushing waters of worthlessness  ##

This is a picture of fast flowing flood waters that destroy everything in it's path.

## The cords of sheol surrounded me; the snares of death trapped me ##

David speaks about death and Sheol as if they are people who are trying to trap him as a hunter traps an animal. David thought he was certainly going to die. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
