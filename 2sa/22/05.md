# General Information:

David's song to Yahweh continues. He uses parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# For the waves of death surrounded me, the rushing waters of destruction overwhelmed me

David compares the wicked men who wanted to kill him to flood waters that are about to drown him. These sentences have similar meanings and are used for emphasis. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# the rushing waters of destruction

This is a picture of fast-flowing flood waters that destroy everything in their path.

# The cords of Sheol surrounded me; the snares of death trapped me

David speaks about death and Sheol as if they are people who are trying to trap him as a hunter traps an animal. These phrases have similar meanings and are used for emphasis. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
