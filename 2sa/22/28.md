David continues his song to Yahweh.

## your eyes are against the proud ##

This means Yahweh is watches the proud person. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## and you bring them down ##

"and you destroy their pride"

## you are my lamp. Yahweh lights up my darkness ##

This means Yahweh gives David life and helps him when things seem hopeless. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
