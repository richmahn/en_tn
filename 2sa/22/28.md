# General Information:

David continues his song to Yahweh.

# your eyes are against the proud

Here the metonym "your eyes" refers to what Yahweh sees. This means Yahweh watches the proud person. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# you bring them down

"you destroy their pride"

# you are my lamp, Yahweh. Yahweh lights up my darkness

This metaphor compares Yahweh to a lamp, which means he gives David light and helps him to see when things seem hopeless. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
