David continues his song to Yahweh.

## I can run over a barricade ##

Here "barricade" may refer to a group of soldiers or to a stone wall. Either way it means God enables David to defeat his enemies.

## The word of Yahweh is pure ##

"Everything Yahweh says is true"

## He is a shield ##

This emphasizes God's power to protect his people. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
