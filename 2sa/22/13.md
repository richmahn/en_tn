Possible meanings are 1) "Out of his bright light he sent burning coals" or 2) "From his brightness he sent lightning"

# From the lightning before him

David continues describing Yahweh, whom he compares to a storm, coming to save him from his enemies. This emphasizes God's power and anger towards David's enemies. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
