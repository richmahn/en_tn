# Then the earth shook ... were ignited by it

This is Yahweh's response to David's cry for help from his enemies. David uses the imagery of the earth shaking and fire coming from Yahweh to emphasize Yahweh's terrible anger. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# his nostrils ... his mouth

David speaks of Yahweh as if he had these humans parts. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# Coals were ignited by it

Here Yahweh's anger is compared to fire, which causes coals to ignite and burn. Alternate translation: "The flame from his mouth set coals on fire" or "He also sent burning coals from his mouth" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
