David continues his song to Yahweh.

## the shield of your salvation ##

David compares Yahweh's power to save him to a shield that protects a soldier from his enemy. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## your favor ##

God answered David's prayers and granted David blessings and success over his enemies.

## You have made a wide place for my feet beneath me ##

Yahweh has put David in a safe place where his enemies cannot trap him.
