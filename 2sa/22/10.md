# General Information:

David's song to Yahweh continues. He uses parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# He opened the heavens ... rain clouds in the skies

David describes Yahweh's way of saving David from his enemies as a storm cloud gathering over a place. This emphasizes God's power and his anger. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# under his feet

David speaks of God as having feet like humans. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# He was seen on the wings of the wind

This can be translated in active form. AT: "He appeared on the wings of the wind" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# the wings of the wind

This expression speaks of the wind as if it were a bird. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# He made darkness a tent around him

Here the darkness Yahweh creates is compared to a tent which hides him completely. AT: "He hid himself in the darkness" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
