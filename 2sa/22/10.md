David's song to Yahweh continues. He uses parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## He opened the heavens...rain clouds in the skies ##

David describes Yahweh's approach to save David from his enemies as a storm cloud gathering over a place. This emphasizes God's power and his anger. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## He was seen flying on the wings of the wind ##

AT: "He appeared and he soared through the wind" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-inclusive]])

## And he made darkness a tent around him ##

AT: "And he hid himself in the darkness"
