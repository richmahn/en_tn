# General Information:

David's song to Yahweh starts. He uses parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul

This is a progression from enemies in general to one specific enemy of David, King Saul.

# out of the hand of

This metonym means "out of the power of." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# Yahweh is my rock, my fortress

This metaphor shows a progression from a part, "rock," to the whole, "fortress." A fortress is built of many large rocks. This means Yahweh has the strength to protect his people from harm. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
