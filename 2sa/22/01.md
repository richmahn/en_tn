David's song to Yahweh starts. He uses parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul ##

This is a progression from enemies in general to one specific enemy of David, King Saul.

## out of the hand ##

AT: "out of the power" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## Yahweh is my rock, my fortress ##

This is a part-whole progression. A Fortress is built of many large rocks. This means Yahweh has the strength to protect his people from harm. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
