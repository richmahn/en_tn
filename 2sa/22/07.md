David's song to Yahweh continues. He uses parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## In my distress ##

"In my great trouble"

## he heard my voice from his temple ##

David is referring to the heavenly temple where Yahweh dwells. The earthly temple has not yet been built.

## my call for help went into his ears ##

AT: "he heard my prayer for help" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
