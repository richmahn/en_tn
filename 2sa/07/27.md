# to your servant that you will build him a house

David refers to himself as "your servant." AT: "to me that you will build me a house" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# that you will build him a house

Here the metonym "house" refers to David's ancestors continuing on as the rulers of Israel. In [2 Samuel 7:4](./03.md) Yahweh asked David if he would be the one to build a house for Yahweh. There "house" represented a temple. If your language has a word that can express both ideas, use it here and in 7:4. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# house

Here "house" represents David's family. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
