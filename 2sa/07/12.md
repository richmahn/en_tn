Yahweh continues describing his promises to King David through the prophet, Nathan.

## When your days are fulfilled and you lie down with your fathers ##

These two clauses have similar meaning and are combined for emphasis. They are both a polite way to refer to death and dying. (See:[[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])

## a house for my name ##

Here "name" refers to Yahweh. AT: "a permanent dwelling for Yahweh" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

## I will be a father to him, and he will be my son ##

God will be like a father to David's prophesied son. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
