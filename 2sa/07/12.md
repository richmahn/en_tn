Yahweh continues describing his promises to King David through the prophet Nathan.

# When your days are fulfilled and you lie down with your fathers

These two phrases have similar meanings and are combined for emphasis. They both are polite ways to refer to death and dying. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])

# I will raise up a descendant after you

Yahweh appointing David's descendant is spoken of as if Yahweh would raise or lift him up. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# one who will come out from your body

This is an idiom that means the person will be David's descendant. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# I will establish his kingdom

Here "his kingdom" represents his power to rule. Alternate translation: "I will make him to be a very powerful king" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
