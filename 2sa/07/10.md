Yahweh continues describing his promises to King David through the prophet, Nathan.

## appoint a place for my people Israel and will plant them there ##

These two clauses have similar meanings and are combined for emphasis. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## I will make you a house ##

Here the word "house" refers to David's ancestors continuing on as the rulers of Israel. AT: "I will make you and your descendants the rulers of the nation of Israel." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
