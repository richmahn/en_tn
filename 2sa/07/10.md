## translationNotes

* Yahweh continues describing his promises to King David through the prophet, Nathan.
* **appoint a place for my people Israel and will plant them there** - These two clauses have similar meanings and are combined for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
* **I will make you a house** - Here the word "house" refers to David's ancestors continuing on as the rulers of Israel. AT: "I will make you and your descendants the rulers of the nation of Israel." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
