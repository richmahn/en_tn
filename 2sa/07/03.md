## do what is in your heart ##

The word "heart" here refers to David's desire. AT: "do what you think you should." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

## Will you build me a house in which to live? ##

Yahweh is almighty and obviously does not need a house to live in, he is scolding David here. AT: "I don't need your to build me a house." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
