# Who am I, Yahweh God, and what is my family that you have brought me to this point?

David asks this question to express the deep emotion he felt from hearing Yahweh's proclamation. This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: "My family and I are not worthy of this honor, Yahweh God." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
