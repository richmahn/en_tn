# "Go and tell David my servant, 'This is what Yahweh says: Will you build ...?

This is the beginning of a quotation that contains quotations within it.

# Will you build me a house in which to live?

Yahweh uses a question to emphasize that David is not the one to build a house for Yahweh. This question can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: "You will not build a house for me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# build me a house

Here "house" means a temple. In 7:11 Yahweh will say that he will build a house for David. There "house" means a family. If your language has a word that can express both ideas, use it here and in 7:11.
