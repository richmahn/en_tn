# the word of Yahweh came to Nathan, saying, "Go

The idiom "the word of Yahweh came to" is used to introduce a special message from God. AT: "Yahweh gave a message to Nathan. He said, 'Go" or "Yahweh spoke this message to Nathan: 'Go" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# saying, "Go and tell David my servant, 'This is what Yahweh says: Will you build me a house in which to live?

This has quotations within quotations. It may be necessary to translate them as indirect quotation. AT: "saying, 'Go and ask David if he thinks that he will be the one to build a house in which I will live." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])

# Will you build me a house in which to live?

Yahweh uses a question to emphasize that David is not the one to build a house for Yahweh. This question can be translated as a statement. AT: "You will not build a house for me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# build me a house

Here "house" means a temple. In 7:11 Yahweh will say that he will build a house for David. There "house" means a family. If your language has a word that can express both ideas, use it here and in 7:11.
