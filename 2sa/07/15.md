Yahweh finishes describing his promises to King David through the prophet, Nathan.

## But my covenant faithfulness will not leave him ##

Here "will not leave" uses to two negative statements to make a positive statement. AT: "my covenant faithfulness will remain with him."(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])

## Your house and kingdom will be confirmed forever before you. Your throne will be established forever. ##

These two phrases have similar meanings and are combined for emphasis. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
