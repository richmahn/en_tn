# General Information:

Yahweh finishes describing his promises to King David through the prophet Nathan.

# But my covenant faithfulness will not leave him, as I took it from Saul

The word "faithfulness" is an abstract noun that can be stated as "faithfully loving." AT: "I will never stop faithfully loving him as I stopped loving Saul" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# from before you. Your house ... before you. Your throne

If in [2 Samuel 7:8-9](./08.md) you translated the direct quotations as indirect quotation, then here you may need to translate "you" as "David" or "him" or "his" as in the UDB. AT: "from before David. David's house ... before him. His throne" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])

# Your house and kingdom will be confirmed forever before you. Your throne will be established forever.

These two sentences have similar meanings and emphasize that David's dynasty will last forever. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# Your house and kingdom will be confirmed forever before you

Here the word "house" represents David's descendants, who will rule as kings. Here "kingdom" means about the same thing as "house." This can also be stated in active form. AT: "You will live to see me establish your family and their rule over the people of Israel forever" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# Your throne will be established forever

Here "throne" represents the power to rule as king. AT: "I will cause your descendants to rule over Israel forever" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# all these words

"all these things." This refers to what Yahweh had said.

# he told him about the entire vision

"he told him about everything Yahweh revealed to him"
