# how Joab was, how the army was doing, and how the war was going

David was asking if Joab and the army were well and about the progress of the war. Alternate translation: "if Joab was well, if other soldiers were well, and how the war was progressing" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
