# he ate and drank before him

"Uriah ate and drank with David"

# down to his house

Possible meanings of the word "down" are 1) Uriah's house was located at a lower elevation than the king's palace or 2) Uriah's house was of lesser importance than the king's palace. See how you translated the similar phrase "down to your house" in [2 Samuel 11:8](./06.md). Alternate translation: "to his house" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
