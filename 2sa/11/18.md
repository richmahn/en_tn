## translationNotes

* **Why did you go so near to the city to fight?** - This question is asked because the army should not have done so. (See:[[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **Did you not know that they would shoot from the wall?** - this question is scolding the army, who should have known this and been more careful.
