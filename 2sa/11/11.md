# Israel and Judah

This refers to their armies. AT: "the armies of Israel and Judah" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# How then can I go into my house ... with my wife?

This rhetorical question is used to emphasize Uriah's refusal to visit his wife and can be translated as a statement. AT: "It would be wrong for me to go into my house ... with my wife while the other soldiers in my army are in danger." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# As sure as you are alive, I will not do this

Uriah swears a strong promise that he will not go home to his wife as long as the rest of the soldiers are at war. He makes this promise by comparing the truth of his promise to the certainty that the king was alive. AT: "I solemnly promise that I will not do this" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
