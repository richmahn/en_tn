## Have you not come from a journey? ##

David is seeking to convince Uriah to go home (to his wife). Both David and Uriah knew that Uriah had just come from a journey. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## How then can I go into my house to eat and to drink and to sleep with my wife? ##

Uriah asks this question because he felt it would not be right or respectful for him as a soldier to go home when the army is in danger.

## As sure as you are alive, I will not do this. ##

Uriah swears a strong promise that he will not enjoy his wife when many other men in Israel are at war to defend Israel and cannot enjoy their wives.
