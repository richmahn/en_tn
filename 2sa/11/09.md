## translationNotes

* **Have you not come from a journey?** - David is seeking to convince Uriah to go home (to his wife). Both David and Uriah knew that Uriah had just come from a journey. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **How then can I go into my house to eat and to drink and to sleep with my wife?** - Uriah asks this question because he felt it would not be right or respectful for him as a soldier to go home when the army is in danger.
* **As sure as you are alive, I will not do this.** - Uriah swears a strong promise that he will not enjoy his wife when many other men in Israel are at war to defend Israel and cannot enjoy their wives.
