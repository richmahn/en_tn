# Why did you go so near ... from the wall?

Joab says that David may rebuke him by asking these rhetorical questions. These questions may be written as statements. Alternate translation: "You should not have gone so near to the city to fight. You should have known that they would shoot from the wall." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
