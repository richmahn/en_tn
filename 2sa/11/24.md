## translationNotes

* **king's servants** - Here and in many Old Testament verses "servants" refers to soldiers, not slaves, since soldiers were servants of the king.
* **the sword devours one** - This phrase has the "sword" eating like a person. AT: "the sword kills one person" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
