This continues David's last words.

## Indeed, is my family not like this before God? ##

David uses a question to emphasize that his family does fear God and God is pleased with them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## Has he not made...fulfill my every desire ##

David uses these questions to emphasize that God has certainly done all these things.

## Ordered and sure ##

This means God's covenant will not change and David's family can trust it.

## Does he not increase my salvation and fulfill ##

"Does he not keep me safe and fulfill." AT: "He certainly keeps me safe and fulfills"
