# 2 Samuel 23 General Notes

#### Structure and formatting

Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 23:2-7.

2 Samuel 23:8-39 is a list of the famous people in David's army along with some of the special deeds some of them did. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/works]])

#### Special concepts in this chapter
