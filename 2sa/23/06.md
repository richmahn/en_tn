This concludes David's last words.

## but the worthless will all be like thorns to be thrown away ##

AT: "but the wicked person is worthless and dangerous like thorns that someone tries to throw away" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## Because they cannot be gathered by one's hands ##

AT: "Because no one can pick them up with his hands without the thorns hurting him"

## They must be burned up where they lie ##

AT: "The person must burn the thorns where they lie." This refers to God destroying wicked people.
