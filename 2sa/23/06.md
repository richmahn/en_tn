# General Information:

This concludes David's last words.

# But the worthless will all be like thorns to be thrown away

Here the wicked person is compared to useless thorns. This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "But the wicked person is worthless and dangerous like thorns we throw away" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# because they cannot be gathered by one's hands

"because no one can pick them up with his hands without the thorns hurting him"
