# General Information:

This continues David's last words.

# The God of Israel spoke, the Rock of Israel ... me

Here the "God of Israel" is the same as the "Rock of Israel." The two phrases say essentially the same thing. David compares God to a rock to emphasize his power to protect his people. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# The one who rules righteously over men, who rules in the fear of God

These two sentences both say that the king will respect God and do what God wants him to do. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# in the fear of God

"respecting God"

# He will be like the morning light ... sunshine after rain

Here God is comparing the king to the morning light and sunshine after the rain. These are all ways of saying this king would be a delight to God and a blessing for the people. These two phrases have a similar meaning and are used for emphasis. AT: "He will be a delight to all" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
