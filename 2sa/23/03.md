# General Information:

This continues David's last words.

# The God of Israel spoke, the Rock of Israel ... me

Here the "God of Israel" is the same as the "Rock of Israel." The two phrases say essentially the same thing. David compares God to a rock to emphasize his power to protect his people. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# The one who rules righteously over men, who rules in the fear of God

These two sentences both say that the king will respect God and do what God wants him to do. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# in the fear of God

"respecting God"
