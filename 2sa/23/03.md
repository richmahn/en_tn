This continues David's last words.

## Rock of Israel ##

This means the same as the first part of the sentence. David compares God to a rock to emphasize his power to protect his people. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## The one who rules righteously over men, Who rules in the fear of God ##

These two sentences say that the king will respect God and do what God wants him to do. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## in the fear of God ##

"respecting God"

## He will be like the morning star...sunshine after rain ##

These are all ways of saying this king would be a delight to God and a blessing for the people. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

## A morning without clouds, When the tender grass springs up from the earth Through bright sunshine after rain ##

Again "he will be a delight to all" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
