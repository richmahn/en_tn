## translationNotes

* This continues David's last words.
* **Rock of Israel** - This means the same as the first part of the sentence. David compares God to a rock to emphasize his power to protect his people. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **The one who rules righteously over men, Who rules in the fear of God** - These two sentences say that the king will respect God and do what God wants him to do. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
* **in the fear of God** - "respecting God"
* **He will be like the morning star...sunshine after rain** - These are all ways of saying this king would be a delight to God and a blessing for the people. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
* **A morning without clouds, When the tender grass springs up from the earth Through bright sunshine after rain** - Again "he will be a delight to all" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
