# then all Israel

This refers to Israel's soldiers, not to all of Israel. AT: "then all of our soldiers" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# will bring ropes to that city and we will drag it into the river

This means that the soldiers would tear down the city walls and drag the pieces to river. AT: "will destroy the city and drag the stones to the river with ropes" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# until there is no longer even a small stone found there

This is an exaggeration to describe how completely they will destroy the city. The would not literally sweep away every small stone from the city. AT: "until the city is completely destroyed" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
