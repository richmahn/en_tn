# Now ... in her heart

The word "Now" marks a break in the story line. Here the narrator gives information about Michal.

# Michal

Michal was the daughter of King Saul and also David's first wife. See how you translated this name in [2 Samuel 3:13](../03/12.md).

# she despised him in her heart

Here "heart" represents thoughts or emotions. AT: "she looked at him with disdain" or "she sneered at him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# before Yahweh

"to Yahweh"
