#### What is the Book of 2 Samuel about? ####

This book is about David's rule as king over Israel. At first he ruled over the tribe of Judah for seven years. Then the other eleven tribes agreed to have him become their king as well. He ruled over all Israel for thirty-three years. 

Throughout this time, David led his army to fight foreign enemies who attacked Israel. His most difficult struggle, however, was against someone in his own family. Absalom, his son, rebelled and fought against him (See: [2 Samuel 13-19](../13/01.md)).

The Book of 2 Samuel also tells about when David committed adultery. He slept with Bathsheba, the wife of Uriah the Hittite. When she became pregnant, David arranged for her husband to be killed in battle. David's moral failure led to great suffering for himself and all Israel. 

However, the writer also presents the divine grace and love that David repeatedly experienced when he turned to God in repentance.

#### How should the title of this book be translated? ####

Translators can use the traditional title "2 Samuel," or "Second Samuel." But, translators may consider a clearer title such as "The Second Book about Samuel, Saul, and David." (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names)

#### What was the purpose of the Book of 2 Samuel? ####

The Book of 2 Samuel is a continuation of 1 Samuel. The writer continues to show how the tribes of Israel became unified under the first kings of Israel.

It is uncertain who wrote 2 Samuel. It may have been someone alive soon after king Solomon died. When Solomon died, the kingdom of Israel split into two kingdoms. The author probably lived in the southern kingdom of Judah. A descendant of David continued to rule over the southern kingdom. The author may have written 2 Samuel to defend David's right to be king. This would prove that David's descendant was the rightful king of God's people and the northern kingdom had no right to rebel against him.

## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts ##

#### What covenant has its beginning in the Book of 2 Samuel? ####

In 2 Samuel 7 Yahweh made a covenant with David. God promised to make descendants of David rule forever over Israel. Christians believe that Jesus Christ fulfilled this covenant. Jesus was a descendant of David. Jesus is the true "anointed one," the person God chose to be king forever. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/covenant]])

## Part 3: Important Translation Issues ##

#### Why does the book refer to someone being addressed indirectly? ####

David frequently refers to himself as "your servant" when he speaks to King Saul. He also calls Saul "my master." This type of indirect reference can be difficult to translate. It is intended to show that the speaker submits to the one being addressed. English sometimes uses the address "sir" or "ma'am" in this way.

#### Can I translate this book before 1 Samuel? #### 

1 Samuel should be translated before 2 Samuel, since it is a continuation of that book.

#### How is the name "Israel" used in the Bible? ####

The name "Israel" is used in many different ways in the Bible. There was a man named Jacob. God changed his name to Israel. The descendants of Jacob became a nation also called Israel. Eventually, the nation of Israel split into two kingdoms. The northern kingdom was named Israel. The southern kingdom was named Judah. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/israel]])

2 Samuel speaks of both the northern kingdom of Israel and the whole nation of Israel as "Israel." However, these references appear in the narrative long before the split between the two kingdoms occurred. It seems clear that the references to Israel and Judah indicate that the author wrote at a time after the kingdoms split. (See: [2 Samuel 2:10](../02/10.md); [2 Samuel 3:10](../03/09.md); [2 Samuel 5:5](../05/03.md); [2 Samuel 11:11](../11/09.md); [2 Samuel 12:8](../12/07.md); [2 Samuel 19:42-43](../19/42.md); [2 Samuel 21:2](../21/02.md); [2 Samuel 24:1](../24/01.md)).
