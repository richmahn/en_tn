# David's heart afflicted him

The "heart" here is a metonym for David's emotions and conscience. AT: "David felt guilty" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# Now, Yahweh, take away your servant's guilt

David refers to himself as "your servant." This is a polite way to speak to someone with greater authority.
