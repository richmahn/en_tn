# Mountains of Gilboa

David speaks directly to the "Mountains of Gilboa" as if they were listening to his song. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe]])

# let there not be dew or rain on you

David curses the ground where King Saul died in the battle. This was out of reverence for Saul, who was God's anointed king.

# the shield of the mighty was defiled

The "mighty" here refers to Saul. The shield was defiled because it fell on the ground, and because the king's blood was shed on it. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# The shield of Saul is no longer anointed with oil

Saul's shield was made of leather. To care for the shield, it was rubbed with oil. Alternate translation: "No one will care for Saul's shield anymore"
