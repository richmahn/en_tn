# my brother Jonathan

Here "brother" is used in the sense of a very close friend.

# Your love to me was wonderful, exceeding the love of women

Here "love" is used in the sense of friendship and loyalty. Jonathan's loyalty to David was even greater than the loyalty a woman has for her husband and children.
