# 2 Samuel 01 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations set each line of poetry further to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetic song in 1:19-27.

This chapter continues the material from 1 Samuel. 

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### David's funeral song #####
David praised Saul and Jonathan as great warriors and Jonathan as his dearest friend. 

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter ####

##### Synecdoche #####
David used two figures of speech to express that Jonathan and Saul were great warriors: "the bow of Jonathan did not turn back, and the sword of Saul did not return empty." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
