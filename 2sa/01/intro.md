# 2 Samuel 01 General Notes

#### Structure and formatting

Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetic song in 1:19-27.

This chapter continues the material from 1 Samuel.

#### Special concepts in this chapter

##### David's funeral song
David praised Saul and Jonathan as great warriors and Jonathan as his dearest friend.
