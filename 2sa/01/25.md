This phrase is repeated in verse 27 to emphasize that Israel's best warriors are dead. AT: "The mighty men have died in battle"

# the mighty

Here "mighty" is plural and may refer to only Saul and Jonathan, or to all of the soldiers of Israel. AT: "the mighty warriors" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])

# have fallen

This is a polite way to say "have died." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])

# Jonathan is killed

This can be stated in active form. AT: "Jonathan has died in battle" or "The enemy has killed Jonathan" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# on your high places

David continues to address this part of the song to the mountains of Gilboa as he started in [2 Samuel 1:21](./21.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe]])

# my brother Jonathan

Here "brother" is used in the sense of a very close friend.

# Your love to me was wonderful, exceeding the love of women

Here "love" is used in the sense of friendship and loyalty. Jonathan's loyalty to David was even greater than the loyalty a woman has for her husband and children.
