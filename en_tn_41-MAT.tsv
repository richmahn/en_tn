MAT	front	intro	sa9c			0		# Introduction to the Gospel of Matthew<br><br>## Part 1: General Introduction<br><br>### Outline of the book of Matthew<br><br>1. The birth of Jesus Christ and the beginning of his ministry (1:1-4:25)<br>1. Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount (5:1-7:28)<br>1. Jesus illustrates the kingdom of God through acts of healing (8:1-9:34)<br>1. Jesus teaches about mission and the kingdom (9:35-10:42)<br>1. Jesus teaches about the gospel of the kingdom of God. Opposition to Jesus begins. (11:1-12:50)<br>1. Jesus tells parables about the kingdom of God (13:1-52)<br>1. Further opposition to Jesus and misunderstanding of the kingdom of God (13:53-17:57)<br>1. Jesus teaches about life in the kingdom of God (18:1-35)<br>1. Jesus ministers in Judea (19:1-22:46)<br>1. Jesus teaches about the final judgment and salvation (23:1-25:46)<br>1. The crucifixion of Jesus, his death and resurrection (26:1-28:19)<br><br>### What is the book of Matthew about?<br><br>The Gospel of Matthew is one of four books in the New Testament that describe some of the life of Jesus Christ. The authors of the Gospels wrote about different aspects of who Jesus was and what he did. Matthew showed that Jesus was the Messiah, and God would save Israel through him. Matthew often explained that Jesus fulfilled the Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah. This may indicate that he expected most of his first readers to be Jewish. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/christ]])<br><br>### How should the title of this book be translated?<br><br>Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “The Gospel of Matthew,” or “The Gospel according to Matthew.” Or they may choose a title that may be clearer, such as, “The Good News about Jesus that Matthew wrote.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])<br><br>### Who wrote the book of Matthew?<br><br>The book does not give the name of the author. However, since early Christian times, most Christians have thought that the author was the Apostle Matthew.<br><br>## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts<br><br>### What is the “kingdom of heaven?”<br><br>Matthew spoke of the "kingdom of heaven" in the same way that other Gospel writers spoke of the kingdom of God. The kingdom of heaven represents God ruling over all people and all creation everywhere. Those whom God accepts into his kingdom will be blessed. They will live with God forever.<br><br>### What were the teaching methods of Jesus?<br><br>The people regarded Jesus as a rabbi. A rabbi is a teacher of God’s law. Jesus taught in ways similar those of other religious teachers in Israel. He had students who followed him wherever he went. These students were called disciples. He often told parables. Parables are stories that teach moral lessons. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/disciple]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/parable]])<br><br>## Part 3: Important Translation Issues<br><br>### What are the Synoptic Gospels?<br><br>The Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke are called the Synoptic Gospels because they have many similar passages. The word “synoptic” means to “see together.”<br><br>The texts are considered “parallel” when they are the same or almost the same among two or three gospels. When translating parallel passages, translators should use the same wording and make them as similar as possible.<br><br>### Why does Jesus refer to himself as the “Son of Man”?<br><br>In the gospels, Jesus calls himself the “Son of Man.” It is a reference to Daniel 7:13-14. In that passage there is a person described as a “son of man.” That means the person was someone who looked like a human being. God gave authority to the son of man to rule over the nations forever. All the people will worship him forever.<br><br>Jews of Jesus’ time did not use “Son of Man” as a title for anyone. Therefore, Jesus used it for himself to help them understand who he truly was. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sonofman]])<br><br>Translating the title “Son of Man” can be difficult in many languages. Readers may misunderstand a literal translation. Translators can consider alternatives, such as “The Human One.” It may also be helpful to include a footnote to explain the title.<br><br>### What are the major issues in the text of the book of Matthew?<br><br>The following verses are found in older versions of the Bible but are not included in most modern versions:<br>* “Bless those who curse you; do good to those who hate you” (5:44)<br>* “For yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen” (6:13)<br>* “But this kind of demon does not go out except with prayer and fasting” (17:21)<br>* “For the Son of Man came to save that which was lost” (18:11)<br>* “Many are called, but few are chosen” (20:16)<br>* “Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you devour widows’ houses, while you make a show of long prayers. You will therefore receive greater condemnation.” (23:14)<br><br>Translators are advised not to include these passages. However, if in the translators’ region, there are older versions of the Bible that include one or more of these passages, the translators may include them. If they are included, they should be put inside square brackets ([]) to indicate that they were probably not original to Matthew’s Gospel. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
MAT	1	intro	y7kk			0		# Matthew 1 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and Formatting<br><br>### Indentation<br><br>Some translations set a quotation from the Old Testament farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text. The ULT does this for the quoted material in 1:23.<br><br>### Genealogy<br><br>A genealogy is a list that records a person’s ancestors or descendants. Genealogies were important to the Jewish people because family lineage is how they decided how someone functioned in society. For instance, if someone was a descendant of Aaron, they were able to become priests. Similarly, if someone was a descendant of King David, they were able to become a king. This genealogy shows that Jesus was clearly a descendant of King David, and therefore, was able to become king.<br><br>## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter<br><br>### Use of the passive voice<br><br>Matthew uses the passive voice very purposefully in this chapter to indicate that Mary did not have a sexual relationship with anyone. She became pregnant with Jesus because the Holy Spirit performed a miracle. Many languages do not have a passive voice, so translators in those languages must find other ways to present the same truths. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

MAT	3	intro	a6h3			0		# Matthew 3 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Some translations set quotations from the Old Testament farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text. The ULT does this with the quoted material in verse 3.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### John the Baptist<br><br>In this chapter, John the Baptist appear preaching in the wilderness. He is portrayed by Matthew as resembling the Prophet Elijah in the way that he dresses and by what he eats. We know from other Gospels that John is Jesus' cousin. John the Baptist comes before Jesus to make people ready for his coming.<br><br>### "Kingdom of Heaven"<br><br>“The kingdom of Heaven” is synonymous with "Kingdom of God" from the other three Gospels. It is a major concept in the Gospel of Matthew. It is very rich in meaning. It includes the idea of eternal life in the presence of God, but it also includes the idea of what the earth will be like in the future when God rules everything, and the idea of life on earth right now, when and where God’s wishes are carried out fully. The unifying concept behind all of these ideas is that of people becoming one of the people over whom God rules. Wherever the expression “the kingdom of God” occurs, translation notes will suggest communicating this idea behind the abstract noun “kingdom”. UST models this approach consistently. (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns)<br><br>### “Bear fruit worthy of repentance”<br><br>Fruit is a common metaphor for doing good things that God desires you to do. Similar to if a fruit plant is healthy, it will bear a lot of good fruit, and if a fruit plant is unhealthy, it will bear a lot of bad fruit.<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Metonymy<br><br>Matthew uses metonymy frequently in this chapter to express groups of people or things. If your readers would not understand this, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language to express these figures of speech.
MAT	3	1	xp3z	writing-newevent	δὲ	1	General Information:	This is the beginning of a new part of the story where Matthew tells of the ministry of John the Baptist. Use the natural form in your language for introducing a new event. Alternate translation: “Some time while Jesus was still in Galilee” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
MAT	3	1	ifa0	writing-participants	Ἰωάννης ὁ Βαπτιστὴς	1		This introduces John as a new character in the story. Use the natural form in your language for introducing a new character. The expression “the Baptizer” identifies him as someone who baptized people in water after they were sorry for their sins. Since he is a new participant, if it would be helpful to your readers, you could call him something like “a man named John, who baptized people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
MAT	3	2	hvx8	figs-metonymy	ἤγγικεν…ἡ Βασιλεία τῶν Οὐρανῶν	1	the kingdom of the heavens is near	The phrase **the kingdom of the heavens** refers to God ruling as king. **heavens** refers to the place where God rules from.

If this would be confusing in your language, you could translate the second direct quotation as an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: “a voice crying out in the wilderness, telling people to make ready the way of the Lord and to make his paths straight” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
MAT	3	3	hxb6	writing-quotations	φωνὴ βοῶντος ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ	1	The voice of one calling out in the wilderness	Consider natural ways of introducing direct quotations in your language.

MAT	3	3	n7lh	figs-parallelism	ἑτοιμάσατε τὴν ὁδὸν Κυρίου; εὐθείας ποιεῖτε τὰς τρίβους αὐτοῦ	1		**Make ready the way of the Lord** and **make his paths straight** mean the same thing. If this would be confusing in your language, you could combine the two. “Prepare to hear and obey the Lord’s message when he comes”. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
MAT	3	3	j99i	figs-metaphor	ἑτοιμάσατε τὴν ὁδὸν Κυρίου	1	Make ready the way of the Lord	Isaiah uses a metaphor here of preparing paths or the way that someone will travel on. If someone prepares a path for another, they make the path walkable. If someone in high authority were coming, they would make sure the roads were clear from any hazards. So this metaphor means that the people should prepare themselves to receive the Lord’s message when he comes. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture or use plain speech. Alternate translation: “Prepare to hear and obey the Lord’s message when he comes” (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor)
MAT	3	4	j647	writing-background	αὐτὸς δὲ ὁ Ἰωάννης εἶχεν τὸ ἔνδυμα αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ τριχῶν καμήλου καὶ ζώνην δερματίνην περὶ τὴν ὀσφὺν αὐτοῦ, ἡ δὲ τροφὴ ἦν αὐτοῦ ἀκρίδες καὶ μέλι ἄγριον	1	Now this John had his clothing from the hair of a camel and a leather belt around his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey	The word **Now** is used here to mark a break in the main story line. Matthew gives the reader some background information about what John the Baptist ate, and what he looked like. Use the natural form in your language for expressing background information. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])

MAT	3	4	wo34	translate-unknown	καμήλου	1		If your readers would not know what a **camel** is, you could include a description in a footnote or use a more general term. Alternate translation: “large, humped animal used for riding” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
MAT	3	4	xgxk	translate-unknown	ἀκρίδες	1		If your readers would not know what **locusts** are, you could include a description in a footnote or use a more general term. Alternate translation: “grasshoppers” or “insects” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

MAT	3	5	zys1	figs-hyperbole	Ἱεροσόλυμα, καὶ πᾶσα ἡ Ἰουδαία, καὶ πᾶσα ἡ περίχωρος	1	Jerusalem, and all Judea, and all the region around	The word **all** is an exaggeration to emphasize that very many people went out. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent expression from your language that depicts many people. Alternate translation: “very many people from Jerusalem, Judea, and the region near the Jordan river” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
MAT	3	6	v5xn	figs-activepassive	ἐβαπτίζοντο…ὑπ’ αὐτοῦ	1	being baptized by him	If your language does not use this passive form, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

MAT	3	7	c4cl	figs-rquestion	τίς ὑπέδειξεν ὑμῖν φυγεῖν ἀπὸ τῆς μελλούσης ὀργῆς?	1	who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?	John uses a question to rebuke the Pharisees and Sadducees because they were asking him to baptize them so that God would not punish them, but they did not want to stop sinning. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “you cannot flee from God’s wrath like this.” or “do not think that you can escape God’s wrath just because I baptize you.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
MAT	3	7	h7ac	figs-personification	φυγεῖν ἀπὸ τῆς μελλούσης ὀργῆς	1	to flee from the coming wrath	The phrase **coming wrath** is being used to refer to God’s punishment. Wrath itself cannot come, but God is the one who causes it to happen. If this might be confusing for your readers, you could express this meaning in a nonfigurative way. Alternate translation: “to flee from God’s wrath which he is bringing against you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
MAT	3	8	s8ac	figs-metaphor	ποιήσατε οὖν καρπὸν ἄξιον τῆς μετανοίας	1	Therefore produce fruit worthy of repentance	The phrase **produce fruit** is a metaphor referring to a person’s actions. Just as a healthy tree bears good fruit, so should someone who love God do good. If your readers would not understand what it means, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning in a nonfigurative way. Alternate translation: “Let your actions show that you have truly repented” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
MAT	3	9	anyf	figs-explicit	πατέρα ἔχομεν τὸν Ἀβραάμ	1		They would say **We have Abraham {as} father** because they thought being Abraham’s descendants would protect them from God’s judgement.

If our readers would misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent expression from your language that portrays this exaggeration. Alternate translation: “God could make children of Abraham even out of these rocks!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
MAT	3	9	eedc	figs-metaphor	τέκνα τῷ Ἀβραάμ	1		Here, the word children figuratively means “descendants.” If your readers would not understand what it means, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture.

So every tree not producing good fruit is chopped down and is thrown into the fire.	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “the person who is going to cut down the tree has already placed his ax against the roots. So, he will cut down every tree which does not bear good fruit and throw it into the fire” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
MAT	3	10	a8m8	figs-metaphor	πᾶν οὖν δένδρον μὴ ποιοῦν καρπὸν καλὸν ἐκκόπτεται καὶ εἰς πῦρ βάλλεται	1		**every tree not producing good fruit is chopped down and is thrown into the fire** is a figurative way of describing punishment.

MAT	3	12	sq4p	figs-idiom	οὗ τὸ πτύον ἐν τῇ χειρὶ αὐτοῦ	1	whose winnowing fork is in his hand	Here, **in his hand** means the person is ready to act.

MAT	3	12	b5m4	translate-unknown	τὸ πτύον	1	winnowing fork	A **winnowing fork** is a tool for tossing wheat into the air to separate the wheat grain from the chaff. The heavier grain falls back down, and the wind blows away the unwanted chaff. This tool is similar to a pitchfork. If you have a similar tool in your culture, you can use the word for it here. Otherwise, you can use a phrase that would express the meaning. Alternate translation: “tool for threshing grain” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
MAT	3	12	r2ua	translate-unknown	τὴν ἅλωνα αὐτοῦ	1	his threshing floor	The **threshing floor** was the place where wheat was stacked in preparation for threshing.

If your readers would not be familiar with this place, you could use the name of a place of similar use in your culture, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “The place where food is prepared” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
MAT	3	12	av8l	figs-metaphor	συνάξει τὸν σῖτον αὐτοῦ εἰς τὴν ἀποθήκην…τὸ δὲ ἄχυρον κατακαύσει πυρὶ ἀσβέστῳ	1	gather his wheat into the storehouse … he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire	John continues to speak figuratively to describe how the coming Messiah will judge people. The wheat is the part of the crop that is useful. It represents people who are obedient to God, who will be welcomed into his presence. The chaff is the husk that surrounds the grain. It is not useful for anything, so people burn it up.You could express this metaphor as a simile in your translation. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “He will welcome those who are obedient to God, just as a farmer stores good grain in his barn.

John uses a question to show his surprise at Jesus’ request.

MAT	5	intro	awz8			0		# Matthew 5 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Many people call the words in Matthew 5-7 the Sermon on the Mount. This is one long lesson that Jesus taught. Bibles divide this lesson into three chapters, but this can sometimes confuse the reader. If your translation divides the text into sections, be sure that the reader understands that the whole sermon is one large section.<br><br>Matthew 5:3-10, known as the Beatitudes or Blessings, has been set apart by being set farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text, with each line beginning with the word “blessed.” This way of placing the words on the page highlights the poetic form of this teaching.<br><br>Jesus spoke about many different subjects in this sermon, so you may wish to help the reader by putting an empty line into the text whenever Jesus changed the subject.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### “His disciples”<br><br>It is possible to refer to anyone who followed Jesus as a follower or disciple. Jesus selected twelve of his followers to become his closest disciples, “the twelve disciples.” They would later become known as the apostles.<br><br>### Generic Noun Phrases<br><br>In this chapter, because Jesus is talking to a very large crowd, he often uses words such as “you”, “those”, “a person”, “someone” or other ways of speaking about people in general. He is not speaking about any particular person. This is a common practice when giving important universal teachers as Jesus is doing here. Express these phrases in a way that is natural in your language for speaking about people in general. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])<br><br>### The Law<br><br>Many times in this chapter, it sounds like Jesus contrasts what the law says with “but I say”. Jesus is not actually contrasting what he says with the law, but is just expanding on the meaning of the law for his listeners, to apply it to their lives. Make sure this is clear to your readers.<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### You singular and you plural<br><br>In this chapter, Jesus is talking to a large crowd of his followers. Throughout the chapter, Jesus switches between using you in the singular and you in the plural. In both instances he is talking to the same people. When he is using the singular, he is referring to all of the individuals in the crowd, but is still referring to the crowd as a whole. Your language may require you to use a plural here.

MAT	6	intro	jrj2			0		# Matthew 6 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Matthew 6 continues Jesus’ extended teaching known as “The Sermon on the Mount.”<br><br>You may wish to set apart the prayer in 6:9-11 by placing it farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text.<br><br>Jesus spoke about many different subjects in this sermon, so you may wish to help the reader by putting an empty line into the text whenever Jesus changed the subject.<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### You singular and you plural<br><br>In this chapter, as in the last chapter, Jesus is talking to a large crowd of his followers.

MAT	7	intro	bz7e			0		# Matthew 7 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Jesus spoke about many different subjects in this sermon, so you may wish to help the reader by putting an empty line into the text whenever Jesus changed the subject.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Matthew 5-7<br><br>Many people call the words in Matthew 5-7 the Sermon on the Mount. This is one long lesson that Jesus taught. Bibles divide this lesson into three chapters, but this can sometimes confuse the reader. If your translation divides the text into sections, be sure that the reader understands that the whole sermon is one large section.<br><br>### “By their fruits you will know them”<br><br>Fruit is a common image in the scriptures. It is used to describe the results of either good or bad actions. In this chapter, good fruit is the result of living as God commands. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/fruit]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### You singular and you plural<br><br>In this chapter, as in the past two chapters, Jesus is talking to a large crowd of his followers. Throughout the chapter, Jesus switches between using you in the singular and you in the plural. In both instances he is talking to the same people. When he is using the singular, he is referring to all of the individuals in the crowd, but is still referring to the crowd as a whole. Your language may require you to use a plural here.

Jesus is exaggerating to emphasize that a person should pay attention to their own more offensive sins before he deals with another person’s less offensive sins.

Alternate translation: “you do not see your own very offensive sins” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
MAT	7	4	k58h	figs-rquestion	ἢ πῶς ἐρεῖς τῷ ἀδελφῷ σου, ἄφες ἐκβάλω τὸ κάρφος ἐκ τοῦ ὀφθαλμοῦ σου, καὶ ἰδοὺ, ἡ δοκὸς ἐν τῷ ὀφθαλμῷ σοῦ?	1	Or how will you say to your brother, ‘Let me take out the speck from your eye,’ while behold, the log is in your own eye?

MAT	9	intro	tg41			0		# Matthew 9 General Notes<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### “Sinners”<br><br>When the people of Jesus’ time spoke of “sinners,” they were talking about people who did not obey the law of Moses and instead committed sins like stealing or sexual sins. When Jesus said that he came to call “sinners,” he meant that only people who believe that they are sinners can be his followers. This is true even if they are not what most people think of as “sinners.” (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Passive voice<br><br>Many sentences in this chapter tell that a person had something happen to him without saying who caused that something to happen. You may have to translate the sentence so that it tells the reader who performed the action. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])<br><br>### Rhetorical questions<br><br>Speakers in this chapter asked questions to which they already knew the answer. They asked the questions to show that they were not happy with the hearers or to teach them or to get them to think. Your language may have another way of doing this. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])<br><br>### Proverbs<br><br>Proverbs are very short sentences that use words that are easy to remember to tell about something that is generally true. People who understand proverbs usually have to know much about the language and culture of the speaker. When you translate the proverbs in this chapter, you may have to use many more words than the speakers used so that you can add information that the hearers knew but your reader do not know. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-proverbs]])

This proverb draws a figurative comparison. Just as sick people need to see a doctor to be healed, so sinners need to see Jesus in order to be forgiven and restored. But since Jesus explains the comparison in the next verse, you do not need to explain it here. Rather, you can translate the proverb itself in a way that will be meaningful in your language and culture. Alternate translation: “People who are well do not need to see a doctor, but people who are sick do” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-proverbs]])

The **healthy** are equated with those who do not think they need Jesus. Jesus does not actually think those who do not want him are **strong**, but the opposite. He says this because those people think they are healthy in their own eyes and do not need Jesus. If your readers would misunderstand this, consider expressing the meaning plainly..

Jesus uses a question to answer John’s disciples.

Jesus uses this proverb to show that his disciples do not **mourn** because he **is still** there **with them**. In this proverb, Jesus is the **bridegroom**, and his disciples are the **sons of the bridal chamber**. You can translate the proverb itself in a way that will be recognized as a proverb and be meaningful in your language and culture. If it would be misunderstood in your language, you can state it explicitly.

MAT	10	intro	m5iu			0		# Matthew 10 General Notes<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### The sending of the twelve disciples<br><br>Many verses in this chapter describe how Jesus sent the twelve disciples out. He sent them to tell his message about the kingdom of heaven. They were to tell his message only in Israel and not to share it with the Gentiles.<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### The twelve disciples<br><br>The following are the lists of the twelve disciples:<br><br>In Matthew:<br><br>Simon (Peter), Andrew, James son of Zebedee, John son of Zebedee, Philip, Bartholomew, Thomas, Matthew, James son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot.<br><br>In Mark:<br><br>Simon (Peter), Andrew, James the son of Zebedee and John the son of Zebedee (to whom he gave the name Boanerges, that is, sons of thunder), Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot.<br><br>In Luke:<br><br>Simon (Peter), Andrew, James, John, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Simon (who was called the Zealot), Judas the son of James, and Judas Iscariot.<br><br>Thaddaeus is probably the same person as Jude, the son of James.<br><br>### “The kingdom of heaven has come near”<br><br>No one knows for sure whether the “kingdom of heaven” was present or still coming when John spoke these words.

MAT	12	intro	y7z6			0		# Matthew 12 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 12:18-21, which are words from the Old Testament.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### The Sabbath<br><br>This chapter has much to say about how God’s people are to obey the Sabbath. Jesus said that the rules that the Pharisees made up did not help people obey the Sabbath the way God wanted them to. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sabbath]])<br><br>### “Blasphemy against the Spirit”<br><br>No one knows for sure what actions people perform or what words they say when they commit this sin. However, they probably insult the Holy Spirit and his work. Part of the Holy Spirit’s work is to make people understand that they are sinners and that they need to have God forgive them. Therefore, anyone who does not try to stop sinning is probably committing blasphemy against the Spirit. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/blasphemy]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/holyspirit]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Brothers and sisters<br><br>Most people call those who have the same parents “brother” and “sister” and think of them as the most important people in their lives. Many people also call those with the same grandparents “brother” and “sister.” In this chapter Jesus says that the most important people to him are those who obey his Father in heaven. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/brother]])

MAT	13	intro	s3lu			0		# Matthew 13 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 13:14-15, which are words from the Old Testament.<br><br>This chapter begins a new section. It contains some of Jesus’ parables about the kingdom of heaven.<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Metonymy<br><br>Jesus often says The word **heaven** when he wants his hearers to think of God, who lives in heaven ([13:11](../mat/13/11.md)).<br><br>### Implicit information<br><br>Speakers usually do not say things that they think their hearers already understand. When Matthew wrote that Jesus “sat beside the sea” ([Matthew 13:1](../mat/13/01.md)), he probably expected his hearers to know that Jesus was about to teach the people. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])<br><br>### Metaphor<br><br>Speakers often use words for things that can be touched to speak of things that cannot be touched. Jesus spoke of a bird eating a seed to describe how Satan kept people from understanding Jesus’ message ([13:19](../mat/13/19.md)).<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Passive voice<br><br>Many sentences in this chapter tell that a person had something happen to him without saying who caused that something to happen. For example, “they were scorched” ([13:6](../mat/13/06.md)). You may have to translate the sentence so that it tells the reader who performed the action. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])<br><br>### Parables<br><br>The parables were short stories that Jesus told so that people would easily understand the lesson he was trying to teach them. He also told the stories so that those who did not want to believe in him would not understand the truth ([13:11-13](./11.md)).

He did not want his followers to listen to what the Pharisees and Sadducees taught. This was because if they did listen, they would not understand who God is and how he wants his people to live. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Metaphor<br><br>Jesus told his people to obey his commands. He did this by telling them to “follow” him. It is as if he were walking on a path and they were walking after him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Background information<br><br>Matthew continues his account from chapter 15 in verses 1-20.

Then the account continues in verses 22-27 with what happened the first time Jesus told the disciples that he would die.<br><br>### Paradox<br><br>A paradox is a true statement that appears to describe something impossible.

It is best to translate each of these accounts as it appears in the ULT without trying to make them all say exactly the same thing. (See: [Matthew 21:1-7](../mat/21/01.md) and [Mark 11:1-7](../mrk/11/01.md) and [Luke 19:29-36](../luk/19/29.md) and [John 12:14-15](../jhn/12/14.md))<br><br>### Hosanna<br><br>This is what the people shouted to welcome Jesus into Jerusalem. This word meant “Save us,” but people used it to praise God.<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### “The kingdom of God will be taken away from you”<br><br>No one knows for sure what this phrase means. No one knows if Jesus meant that God would someday give the kingdom back or not.

The ULT does this with the poetry in verse 44, which are words from the Old Testament.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Wedding Feast<br><br>In the parable of the wedding feast ([Matthew 22:1-14](./01.md)), Jesus taught that when God offers to save a person, that person needs to accept the offer. Jesus spoke of life with God as a feast that a king prepares for his son, who has just gotten married. In addition, Jesus emphasized that not everyone whom God invites will properly prepare themselves to come to the feast. God will throw these people out from the feast.<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Implicit information<br><br>Speakers usually do not say things that they think their hearers already understand. When the king in the parable said, “My oxen and fattened calves have been killed” ([Matthew 22:4](../mat/22/04.md)), he assumed that the hearers would understand that those who had killed the animals had also cooked them.<br><br>### Paradox<br><br>A paradox is a true statement that appears to describe something impossible. To the Jews, the ancestors were the masters of the descendants, but in one psalm David calls one of his descendants “Lord.” Jesus tells the Jewish leaders that this is a paradox, saying, “If David then calls the Christ ‘Lord,’ how is he David’s son?” ([Matthew 22:45](../mat/22/45.md)).

MAT	26	intro	mtq8			0		# Matthew 26 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 26:31, which is words from the Old Testament.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Sheep<br><br>Sheep are a common image used in Scripture to refer to the people of Israel. In [Matthew 26:31](../mat/26/31.md), however, Jesus used the words “the sheep” to refer to his disciples and to say that they would run away when he was arrested.<br><br>### Passover<br><br>The Passover festival was when the Jews would celebrate the day God killed the firstborn sons of the Egyptians but “passed over” the Israelites and let them live.<br><br>### The eating of the body and blood<br><br>[Matthew 26:26-28](./26.md) describes Jesus’ last meal with his followers. At this time, Jesus told them that what they were eating and drinking were his body and his blood. Nearly all Christian churches celebrate “the Lord’s Supper,” the “Eucharist”, or “Holy Communion” to remember this meal.<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Judas’ kiss for Jesus<br><br>[Matthew 26:49](../mat/26/49.md) describes how Judas kissed Jesus so the soldiers would know whom to arrest. The Jews would kiss each other when they greeted each other.<br><br>### “I am able to destroy the temple of God”<br><br>Two men accused Jesus of saying that he could destroy the temple in Jerusalem and then rebuild it “in three days” ([Matthew 26:61](../mat/26/61.md)). They were accusing him of insulting God by claiming that God had given him the authority to destroy the temple and the power to rebuild it. What Jesus actually said was that if the Jewish authorities were to destroy this temple, he would certainly raise it up in three days ([John 2:19](../jhn/02/19.md)).

It was an actual room cut into a rock. It had a flat place on one side where they could place the body after they had put oil and spices on it and wrapped it in cloth. Then they would roll a large rock in front of the tomb so no one could see inside or enter.<br><br>### “Make disciples”<br><br>The last two verses ([Matthew 28:19-20](../mat/28/19.md)) are commonly known as “The Great Commission” because they contain a very important command given to all Christians. Christians are to “make disciples” by going to people, sharing the gospel with them and training them to live as Christians.<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### An angel of the Lord<br><br>Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John all wrote about angels in white clothing with the women at Jesus’ tomb. Two of the authors called them men, but that is only because the angels looked human. Two of the authors wrote about two angels, but the other two authors wrote about only one of them. It is best to translate each of these passages as it appears in the ULT without trying to make the passages all say exactly the same thing.
