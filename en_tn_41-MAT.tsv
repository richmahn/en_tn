MAT	front	intro	sa9c			0		# Introduction to the Gospel of Matthew<br><br>## Part 1: General Introduction<br><br>### Outline of the book of Matthew<br><br>1. The birth of Jesus Christ and the beginning of his ministry (1:1-4:25)<br>1. Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount (5:1-7:28)<br>1. Jesus illustrates the kingdom of God through acts of healing (8:1-9:34)<br>1. Jesus teaches about mission and the kingdom (9:35-10:42)<br>1. Jesus teaches about the gospel of the kingdom of God. Opposition to Jesus begins. (11:1-12:50)<br>1. Jesus tells parables about the kingdom of God (13:1-52)<br>1. Further opposition to Jesus and misunderstanding of the kingdom of God (13:53-17:57)<br>1. Jesus teaches about life in the kingdom of God (18:1-35)<br>1. Jesus ministers in Judea (19:1-22:46)<br>1. Jesus teaches about the final judgment and salvation (23:1-25:46)<br>1. The crucifixion of Jesus, his death and resurrection (26:1-28:19)<br><br>### What is the book of Matthew about?<br><br>The Gospel of Matthew is one of four books in the New Testament that describe some of the life of Jesus Christ. The authors of the Gospels wrote about different aspects of who Jesus was and what he did. Matthew showed that Jesus was the Messiah, and God would save Israel through him. Matthew often explained that Jesus fulfilled the Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah. This may indicate that he expected most of his first readers to be Jewish. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/christ]])<br><br>### How should the title of this book be translated?<br><br>Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “The Gospel of Matthew,” or “The Gospel according to Matthew.” Or they may choose a title that may be clearer, such as, “The Good News about Jesus that Matthew wrote.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])<br><br>### Who wrote the book of Matthew?<br><br>The book does not give the name of the author. However, since early Christian times, most Christians have thought that the author was the Apostle Matthew.<br><br>## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts<br><br>### What is the “kingdom of heaven?”<br><br>Matthew spoke of the “kingdom of heaven” in the same way that other Gospel writers spoke of the kingdom of God. The kingdom of heaven represents God ruling over all people and all creation everywhere. Those whom God accepts into his kingdom will be blessed. They will live with God forever.<br><br>### What were the teaching methods of Jesus?<br><br>The people regarded Jesus as a rabbi. A rabbi is a teacher of God’s law. Jesus taught in ways similar those of other religious teachers in Israel. He had students who followed him wherever he went. These students were called disciples. He often told parables. Parables are stories that teach moral lessons. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/disciple]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/parable]])<br><br>## Part 3: Important Translation Issues<br><br>### What are the Synoptic Gospels?<br><br>The Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke are called the Synoptic Gospels because they have many similar passages. The word “synoptic” means to “see together.”<br><br>The texts are considered “parallel” when they are the same or almost the same among two or three gospels. When translating parallel passages, translators should use the same wording and make them as similar as possible.<br><br>### Why does Jesus refer to himself as the “Son of Man”?<br><br>In the gospels, Jesus calls himself the “Son of Man.” It is a reference to Daniel 7:13-14. In that passage there is a person described as a “son of man.” That means the person was someone who looked like a human being. God gave authority to the son of man to rule over the nations forever. All the people will worship him forever.<br><br>Jews of Jesus’ time did not use “Son of Man” as a title for anyone. Therefore, Jesus used it for himself to help them understand who he truly was. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sonofman]])<br><br>Translating the title “Son of Man” can be difficult in many languages. Readers may misunderstand a literal translation. Translators can consider alternatives, such as “The Human One.” It may also be helpful to include a footnote to explain the title.<br><br>### What are the major issues in the text of the book of Matthew?<br><br>The following verses are found in older versions of the Bible but are not included in most modern versions:<br>* “Bless those who curse you; do good to those who hate you” (5:44)<br>* “For yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen” (6:13)<br>* “But this kind of demon does not go out except with prayer and fasting” (17:21)<br>* “For the Son of Man came to save that which was lost” (18:11)<br>* “Many are called, but few are chosen” (20:16)<br>* “Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you devour widows’ houses, while you make a show of long prayers. You will therefore receive greater condemnation.” (23:14)<br><br>Translators are advised not to include these passages. However, if in the translators’ region, there are older versions of the Bible that include one or more of these passages, the translators may include them. If they are included, they should be put inside square brackets ([]) to indicate that they were probably not original to Matthew’s Gospel. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
MAT	1	intro	y7kk			0		# Matthew 1 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and Formatting<br><br>### Indentation<br><br>Some translations set a quotation from the Old Testament farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text. The ULT does this for the quoted material in 1:23.<br><br>### Genealogy<br><br>A genealogy is a list that records a person’s ancestors or descendants. Genealogies were important to the Jewish people because family lineage is how they decided how someone functioned in society. For instance, if someone was a descendant of Aaron, they were able to become priests. Similarly, if someone was a descendant of King David, they were able to become a king. This genealogy shows that Jesus was clearly a descendant of King David, and therefore, was able to become king.<br><br>## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter<br><br>### Use of the passive voice<br><br>Matthew uses the passive voice very purposefully in this chapter to indicate that Mary did not have a sexual relationship with anyone. She became pregnant with Jesus because the Holy Spirit performed a miracle. Many languages do not have a passive voice, so translators in those languages must find other ways to present the same truths. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

MAT	3	intro	a6h3			0		# Matthew 3 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nSome translations set quotations from the Old Testament farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text. The ULT does this with the quoted material in verse 3.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### John the Baptist\n\nIn this chapter, John the Baptist appear preaching in the wilderness. He is portrayed by Matthew as resembling the Prophet Elijah in the way that he dresses and by what he eats. We know from other Gospels that John is Jesus’ cousin. John the Baptist comes before Jesus to make people ready for his coming.\n\n### “Kingdom of the Heavens”\n\n“The kingdom of Heaven” is synonymous with “Kingdom of God” from the other three Gospels. It is a major concept in the Gospel of Matthew. It is very rich in meaning. It includes the idea of eternal life in the presence of God, but it also includes the idea of what the earth will be like in the future when God rules everything, and the idea of life on earth right now, when and where God’s wishes are carried out fully. The unifying concept behind all of these ideas is that of people becoming one of the people over whom God rules. Wherever the expression “the kingdom of the heavens” occurs, translation notes will suggest communicating this idea behind the abstract noun “kingdom”. UST models this approach consistently. (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns)\n\n### “Bear fruit worthy of repentance”\n\nFruit is a common metaphor for doing good things that God desires you to do. Similar to if a fruit plant is healthy, it will bear a lot of good fruit, and if a fruit plant is unhealthy, it will bear a lot of bad fruit.\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### Metonymy\n\nMatthew uses metonymy frequently in this chapter to describe groups of people or things. If your readers would not understand this, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language to express these figures of speech.
MAT	3	1	xp3z	writing-newevent	δὲ	1	General Information:	This is the beginning of a new part of the story where Matthew tells of the ministry of John the Baptist. Use the natural form in your language for introducing a new event. Alternate translation: “Some time while Jesus was still in Galilee” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
MAT	3	1	ifa0	writing-participants	Ἰωάννης ὁ Βαπτιστὴς	1		This introduces John as a new character in the story. Use the natural form in your language for introducing a new character. The expression “the Baptizer” identifies him as someone who baptized people in water after they were sorry for their sins. Since he is a new participant, if it would be helpful to your readers, you could call him something like “a man named John, who baptized people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
MAT	3	2	hvx8	figs-metonymy	ἤγγικεν…ἡ Βασιλεία τῶν Οὐρανῶν	1	the kingdom of the heavens is near	The phrase **the kingdom of the heavens** refers to God ruling as king. **heavens** refers to the place where God rules from.

If this would be confusing in your language, you could translate the second direct quotation as an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: “a voice crying out in the wilderness, telling people to make ready the way of the Lord and to make his paths straight” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
MAT	3	3	hxb6	writing-quotations	φωνὴ βοῶντος ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ	1	The voice of one calling out in the wilderness	Consider natural ways of introducing direct quotations in your language.

If this would be confusing in your language, you could combine the two. “Prepare for the coming of the Lord”. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
MAT	3	3	j99i	figs-metaphor	ἑτοιμάσατε τὴν ὁδὸν Κυρίου	1	Make ready the way of the Lord	Isaiah uses a metaphor here of preparing paths or the way that someone will travel on. If someone prepares a path for another, they make the path walkable. If someone in high authority were coming, they would make sure the roads were clear from any hazards. So this metaphor means that the people should prepare themselves to receive the Lord’s message when he comes. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture or use plain speech. Alternate translation: “Prepare to hear and obey the Lord’s message when he comes” (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor)

MAT	3	4	wo34	translate-unknown	καμήλου	1		If your readers would not know what a **camel** is, you could include a description in a footnote or use a more general term. Alternate translation: “large, humped animal used for riding” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
MAT	3	4	xgxk	translate-unknown	ἀκρίδες	1		If your readers would not know what **locusts** are, you could include a description in a footnote or use a more general term. Alternate translation: “grasshoppers” or “insects” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

MAT	3	5	zys1	figs-hyperbole	Ἱεροσόλυμα, καὶ πᾶσα ἡ Ἰουδαία, καὶ πᾶσα ἡ περίχωρος	1	Jerusalem, and all Judea, and all the region around	The word **all** is an exaggeration to emphasize that very many people went out.

Alternate translation: “very many people from Jerusalem, Judea, and the region near the Jordan river” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
MAT	3	6	v5xn	figs-activepassive	ἐβαπτίζοντο…ὑπ’ αὐτοῦ	1	being baptized by him	If your language does not use this passive form, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

MAT	3	7	c4cl	figs-rquestion	τίς ὑπέδειξεν ὑμῖν φυγεῖν ἀπὸ τῆς μελλούσης ὀργῆς?	1	who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?	John uses a question to rebuke the Pharisees and Sadducees because they were asking him to baptize them so that God would not punish them, but they did not want to stop sinning. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “you cannot flee from God’s wrath like this.” or “do not think that you can escape God’s wrath just because I baptize you.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
MAT	3	7	h7ac	figs-personification	φυγεῖν ἀπὸ τῆς μελλούσης ὀργῆς	1	to flee from the coming wrath	The phrase **coming wrath** is being used to refer to God’s punishment. Wrath itself cannot come, but God is the one who causes it to happen. If this might be confusing for your readers, you could express this meaning in a nonfigurative way.

MAT	3	8	s8ac	figs-metaphor	ποιήσατε οὖν καρπὸν ἄξιον τῆς μετανοίας	1	Therefore produce fruit worthy of repentance	The phrase **produce fruit** is a metaphor referring to a person’s actions.

Alternate translation: “God could make children of Abraham even out of these rocks!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

So every tree not producing good fruit is chopped down and is thrown into the fire.	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “the person who is going to cut down the tree has already placed his ax against the roots.

The wheat is the part of the crop that is useful. It represents people who are obedient to God, who will be welcomed into his presence. The chaff is the husk that surrounds the grain. It is not useful for anything, so people burn it up.You could express this metaphor as a simile in your translation. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “and he will welcome those who are obedient to God, just as a farmer stores good grain in his barn.

MAT	5	intro	awz8			0		# Matthew 5 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Many people call the words in Matthew 5-7 the Sermon on the Mount. This is one long lesson that Jesus taught. Bibles divide this lesson into three chapters, but this can sometimes confuse the reader. If your translation divides the text into sections, be sure that the reader understands that the whole sermon is one large section.<br><br>Matthew 5:3-10, known as the Beatitudes or Blessings, has been set apart by being set farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text, with each line beginning with the word “blessed.” This way of placing the words on the page highlights the poetic form of this teaching.<br><br>Jesus spoke about many different subjects in this sermon, so you may wish to help the reader by putting an empty line into the text whenever Jesus changed the subject.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### “His disciples”<br><br>It is possible to refer to anyone who followed Jesus as a follower or disciple. Jesus selected twelve of his followers to become his closest disciples, “the twelve disciples.” They would later become known as the apostles.<br><br>### Generic Noun Phrases<br><br>In this chapter, because Jesus is talking to a very large crowd, he often uses words such as “you”, “those”, “a person”, “someone” or other ways of speaking about people in general. He is not speaking about any particular person. This is a common practice when giving important universal teachers as Jesus is doing here. Express these phrases in a way that is natural in your language for speaking about people in general. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])<br><br>### The Law<br><br>Many times in this chapter, it sounds like Jesus contrasts what the law says with “but I say”. Jesus is not actually contrasting what he says with the law, but is just expanding on the meaning of the law for his listeners, to apply it to their lives. Make sure this is clear to your readers.<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### You singular and you plural<br><br>In this chapter, Jesus is talking to a large crowd of his followers. Throughout the chapter, Jesus switches between using you in the singular and you in the plural. In both instances he is talking to the same people. When he is using the singular, he is referring to all of the individuals in the crowd, but is still referring to the crowd as a whole. Your language may require you to use a plural here.

MAT	6	intro	jrj2			0		# Matthew 6 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Matthew 6 continues Jesus’ extended teaching known as “The Sermon on the Mount.”<br><br>You may wish to set apart the prayer in 6:9-11 by placing it farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text.<br><br>Jesus spoke about many different subjects in this sermon, so you may wish to help the reader by putting an empty line into the text whenever Jesus changed the subject.<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### You singular and you plural<br><br>In this chapter, as in the last chapter, Jesus is talking to a large crowd of his followers.

MAT	7	intro	bz7e			0		# Matthew 7 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Jesus spoke about many different subjects in this sermon, so you may wish to help the reader by putting an empty line into the text whenever Jesus changed the subject.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Matthew 5-7<br><br>Many people call the words in Matthew 5-7 the Sermon on the Mount. This is one long lesson that Jesus taught. Bibles divide this lesson into three chapters, but this can sometimes confuse the reader. If your translation divides the text into sections, be sure that the reader understands that the whole sermon is one large section.<br><br>### “By their fruits you will know them”<br><br>Fruit is a common image in the scriptures. It is used to describe the results of either good or bad actions. In this chapter, good fruit is the result of living as God commands. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/fruit]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### You singular and you plural<br><br>In this chapter, as in the past two chapters, Jesus is talking to a large crowd of his followers. Throughout the chapter, Jesus switches between using you in the singular and you in the plural. In both instances he is talking to the same people. When he is using the singular, he is referring to all of the individuals in the crowd, but is still referring to the crowd as a whole. Your language may require you to use a plural here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])

Jesus is exaggerating to emphasize that a person should pay attention to their own more offensive sins before he deals with another person’s less offensive sins. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent expression from your language that shows this exaggeration. Alternate translation: “you do not see your own very offensive sins” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
MAT	7	4	k58h	figs-rquestion	ἢ πῶς ἐρεῖς τῷ ἀδελφῷ σου, ἄφες ἐκβάλω τὸ κάρφος ἐκ τοῦ ὀφθαλμοῦ σου, καὶ ἰδοὺ, ἡ δοκὸς ἐν τῷ ὀφθαλμῷ σοῦ?	1	Or how will you say to your brother, ‘Let me take out the speck from your eye,’ while behold, the log is in your own eye?

This proverb draws a figurative comparison. Just as sick people need to see a doctor to be healed, so sinners need to see Jesus in order to be forgiven and restored.

Rather, you can translate the proverb itself in a way that will be meaningful in your language and culture.

Jesus uses this proverb to show that his disciples do not **mourn** because he **is still** there **with them**. In this proverb, Jesus is the **bridegroom**, and his disciples are the **sons of the bridal chamber**. You can translate the proverb itself in a way that will be recognized as a proverb and be meaningful in your language and culture. If it would be misunderstood in your language, you can state it explicitly.

MAT	10	intro	m5iu			0		# Matthew 10 General Notes<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### The sending of the twelve disciples<br><br>Many verses in this chapter describe how Jesus sent the twelve disciples out. He sent them to tell his message about the kingdom of heaven. They were to tell his message only in Israel and not to share it with the Gentiles.<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### The twelve disciples<br><br>The following are the lists of the twelve disciples:<br><br>In Matthew:<br><br>Simon (Peter), Andrew, James son of Zebedee, John son of Zebedee, Philip, Bartholomew, Thomas, Matthew, James son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot.<br><br>In Mark:<br><br>Simon (Peter), Andrew, James the son of Zebedee and John the son of Zebedee (to whom he gave the name Boanerges, that is, sons of thunder), Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot.<br><br>In Luke:<br><br>Simon (Peter), Andrew, James, John, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Simon (who was called the Zealot), Judas the son of James, and Judas Iscariot.<br><br>Thaddaeus is probably the same person as Jude, the son of James.<br><br>### “The kingdom of heaven has come near”<br><br>No one knows for sure whether the “kingdom of heaven” was present or still coming when John spoke these words.

MAT	12	intro	y7z6			0		# Matthew 12 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 12:18-21, which are words from the Old Testament.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### The Sabbath<br><br>This chapter has much to say about how God’s people are to obey the Sabbath. Jesus said that the rules that the Pharisees made up did not help people obey the Sabbath the way God wanted them to. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sabbath]])<br><br>### “Blasphemy against the Spirit”<br><br>No one knows for sure what actions people perform or what words they say when they commit this sin. However, they probably insult the Holy Spirit and his work. Part of the Holy Spirit’s work is to make people understand that they are sinners and that they need to have God forgive them. Therefore, anyone who does not try to stop sinning is probably committing blasphemy against the Spirit. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/blasphemy]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/holyspirit]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Brothers and sisters<br><br>Most people call those who have the same parents “brother” and “sister” and think of them as the most important people in their lives. Many people also call those with the same grandparents “brother” and “sister.” In this chapter Jesus says that the most important people to him are those who obey his Father in heaven.

Alternate translation: “the spirit finds that it was empty, and someone swept it and left it organized” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
MAT	12	44	s6jf	figs-metaphor	σχολάζοντα σεσαρωμένον καὶ κεκοσμημένον	1	empty and swept out and put in order	Here, the phrase **empty, having been swept out and put in order** is figurative language referring to a house that has been cleaned and moved out of so no one lives there. Similar to this, the spirit found this person to not have any spirit living in it. Jesus is saying that the person did not have the Holy Spirit living within them so the demon came back. If your readers would not understand what it means, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternative translation: “the spirit finds that the person did not have the Holy Spirit living in them, but that there was no spirit living in them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
MAT	12	47	qd32	figs-quotations	εἶπεν δέ τις αὐτῷ, ἰδοὺ, ἡ μήτηρ σου καὶ οἱ ἀδελφοί σου ἔξω ἑστήκασιν ζητοῦντές σοι λαλῆσαι.	1	Someone said to him, “Behold, your mother and your brothers stand outside, seeking to speak to you.”	If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this as an indirect quotation.

MAT	12	48	e535	figs-rquestion	τίς ἐστιν ἡ μήτηρ μου καὶ τίνες εἰσὶν οἱ ἀδελφοί μου?	1	Who is my mother and who are my brothers?	Jesus asks this question to teach the crowd about which people are a part of his spiritual family. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “I will tell you who the people are that are my mother and brothers.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
MAT	12	49	rxe8	translate-kinship	ἡ μήτηρ μου καὶ οἱ ἀδελφοί μου	1	my mother and my brothers	The phrase **my mother and my brothers** is not here referring to Jesus’ actual brothers and mother, but he is referring to his disciples as his brothers and mother. Jesus says this because he considers them a part of his spiritual family. If it would be helpful to your readers, you can state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “these are like like a mother and brothers to me” or “these are like family to me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship]])
MAT	12	50	e25c		ὅστις…ἂν ποιήσῃ	1	whoever may do	The word **For** here tells the reader that Jesus is explaining the previous thing he said.

MAT	12	50	gn31	figs-metaphor	αὐτός μου ἀδελφὸς, καὶ ἀδελφὴ, καὶ μήτηρ ἐστίν	1	he is my brother, and sister, and mother	This is a metaphor meaning that those who obey God belong to Jesus’ spiritual family.

MAT	13	intro	s3lu			0		# Matthew 13 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 13:14-15, which are words from the Old Testament.<br><br>This chapter begins a new section. It contains some of Jesus’ parables about the kingdom of heaven.<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Metonymy<br><br>Jesus often says The word **heaven** when he wants his hearers to think of God, who lives in heaven ([13:11](../mat/13/11.md)).<br><br>### Implicit information<br><br>Speakers usually do not say things that they think their hearers already understand. When Matthew wrote that Jesus “sat beside the sea” ([Matthew 13:1](../mat/13/01.md)), he probably expected his hearers to know that Jesus was about to teach the people. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])<br><br>### Metaphor<br><br>Speakers often use words for things that can be touched to speak of things that cannot be touched. Jesus spoke of a bird eating a seed to describe how Satan kept people from understanding Jesus’ message ([13:19](../mat/13/19.md)).<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Passive voice<br><br>Many sentences in this chapter tell that a person had something happen to him without saying who caused that something to happen. For example, “they were scorched” ([13:6](../mat/13/06.md)). You may have to translate the sentence so that it tells the reader who performed the action. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])<br><br>### Parables<br><br>The parables were short stories that Jesus told so that people would easily understand the lesson he was trying to teach them. He also told the stories so that those who did not want to believe in him would not understand the truth ([13:11-13](./11.md)).

MAT	13	7	vt8z	figs-explicit	ἀνέβησαν αἱ ἄκανθαι καὶ ἀπέπνιξαν αὐτά	1	choked them	The phrase **the thorns grew up and choked them** might be confusing to come readers. What this means is that the weeds grew much faster than the crops which the sower planted did, and so they did not allow the crops to grow. If this would be confusing to your readers, you can state this explicitly with an example from your culture. Alternate translation: “the thorns grew much faster and overwhelmed the plants” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

MAT	15	intro	i9a5			0		# Matthew 15 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 15:8-9, which are words from the Old Testament.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### The “traditions of the elders”<br><br>The “traditions of the elders” were oral laws that the Jewish religious leaders developed because they wanted to make sure that everyone obeyed the law of Moses. However, they often worked harder to obey these rules than to obey the law of Moses itself. Jesus rebuked the religious leaders for this, and they became angry as a result. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]])<br><br>### Jews and Gentiles<br><br>The Jews of Jesus’ time thought that only Jews could please God by the way they lived. Jesus healed a Canaanite Gentile woman’s daughter to show his followers that he would accept both Jews and Gentiles as his people.<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Sheep<br><br>The Bible often speaks of people as if they were sheep because sheep need someone to take care of them. This is because they do not see well and they often go to where other animals can kill them easily. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

MAT	22	intro	k5ze			0		# Matthew 22 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in verse 44, which are words from the Old Testament.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Wedding Feast<br><br>In the parable of the wedding feast ([Matthew 22:1-14](./01.md)), Jesus taught that when God offers to save a person, that person needs to accept the offer. Jesus spoke of life with God as a feast that a king prepares for his son, who has just gotten married. In addition, Jesus emphasized that not everyone whom God invites will properly prepare themselves to come to the feast. God will throw these people out from the feast.<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Implicit information<br><br>Speakers usually do not say things that they think their hearers already understand. When the king in the parable said, “My oxen and fattened calves have been killed” ([Matthew 22:4](../mat/22/04.md)), he assumed that the hearers would understand that those who had killed the animals had also cooked them.<br><br>### Paradox<br><br>A paradox is a true statement that appears to describe something impossible. To the Jews, the ancestors were the masters of the descendants, but in one psalm David calls one of his descendants “Lord.” Jesus tells the Jewish leaders that this is a paradox, saying, “If David then calls the Christ ‘Lord,’ how is he David’s son?” ([Matthew 22:45](../mat/22/45.md)).

MAT	26	intro	mtq8			0		# Matthew 26 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 26:31, which is words from the Old Testament.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Sheep<br><br>Sheep are a common image used in Scripture to refer to the people of Israel. In [Matthew 26:31](../mat/26/31.md), however, Jesus used the words “the sheep” to refer to his disciples and to say that they would run away when he was arrested.<br><br>### Passover<br><br>The Passover festival was when the Jews would celebrate the day God killed the firstborn sons of the Egyptians but “passed over” the Israelites and let them live.<br><br>### The eating of the body and blood<br><br>[Matthew 26:26-28](./26.md) describes Jesus’ last meal with his followers. At this time, Jesus told them that what they were eating and drinking were his body and his blood. Nearly all Christian churches celebrate “the Lord’s Supper,” the “Eucharist”, or “Holy Communion” to remember this meal.<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Judas’ kiss for Jesus<br><br>[Matthew 26:49](../mat/26/49.md) describes how Judas kissed Jesus so the soldiers would know whom to arrest. The Jews would kiss each other when they greeted each other.<br><br>### “I am able to destroy the temple of God”<br><br>Two men accused Jesus of saying that he could destroy the temple in Jerusalem and then rebuild it “in three days” ([Matthew 26:61](../mat/26/61.md)). They were accusing him of insulting God by claiming that God had given him the authority to destroy the temple and the power to rebuild it. What Jesus actually said was that if the Jewish authorities were to destroy this temple, he would certainly raise it up in three days ([John 2:19](../jhn/02/19.md)).

It was an actual room cut into a rock. It had a flat place on one side where they could place the body after they had put oil and spices on it and wrapped it in cloth. Then they would roll a large rock in front of the tomb so no one could see inside or enter.<br><br>### “Make disciples”<br><br>The last two verses ([Matthew 28:19-20](../mat/28/19.md)) are commonly known as “The Great Commission” because they contain a very important command given to all Christians. Christians are to “make disciples” by going to people, sharing the gospel with them and training them to live as Christians.<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### An angel of the Lord<br><br>Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John all wrote about angels in white clothing with the women at Jesus’ tomb. Two of the authors called them men, but that is only because the angels looked human. Two of the authors wrote about two angels, but the other two authors wrote about only one of them. It is best to translate each of these passages as it appears in the ULT without trying to make the passages all say exactly the same thing. (See: [Matthew 28:1-2](../mat/28/01.md) and [Mark 16:5](../mrk/16/05.md) and [Luke 24:4](../luk/24/04.md) and [John 20:12](../jhn/20/12.md))
