front:intro	r2f2				0	# Introduction to the Gospel of Mark\n\n## Part 1: General Introduction\n\n### Outline of the book of Mark\n\n1. Introduction (1:1–13)\n1. The ministry of Jesus in Galilee\n    * Early ministry (1:14–3:6)\n    * Becoming more popular among the people (3:7–5:43)\n    * Moving away from Galilee and then returning (6:1–8:26)\n1. Progress toward Jerusalem; Jesus repeatedly predicts his own death; the disciples misunderstand, and Jesus teaches them how difficult it will be to follow him (8:27–10:52)\n1. Last days of ministry and preparation for final conflict in Jerusalem (11:1–13:37)\n1. The death of Christ and the empty tomb (14:1–16:8)\n\n### What is the book of Mark about?\n\nThe Gospel of Mark is one of four books in the New Testament that describe some of the life of Jesus Christ. The authors of the Gospels wrote about who Jesus was and what he did during his lifetime. Mark wrote much about how Jesus suffered and died on the cross. He did this to encourage his readers who were being persecuted. Mark also explained Jewish customs and some Aramaic words. This may indicate that Mark expected most of his first readers to be Gentiles.\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nTranslators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “The Gospel of Mark,” or “The Gospel According to Mark.” They may also choose a title that may be clearer, such as, “The Good News about Jesus that Mark Wrote.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])\n\n### Who wrote the book of Mark?\n\nThe book does not give the name of the author. However, since early Christian times, most Christians have thought that the author was Mark. Mark was also known as John Mark. He was a close friend of Peter. Mark may not have witnessed what Jesus said and did. Many experts think that Peter the Apostle was the source of what Mark wrote about Jesus.\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### What were Jesus’ teaching methods?\n\nThe people regarded Jesus as a rabbi. A rabbi is a teacher of God’s law. Jesus taught in ways similar to the ways other religious teachers in Israel. He had students who followed him wherever he went. These students were called disciples. Jesus often taught by telling parables, stories that teach moral lessons. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/disciple]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/parable]])\n\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\n\n### What are the Synoptic Gospels?\n\nThe Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke are called the Synoptic Gospels because they have many similar passages. The word “synoptic” means to “see together.”\n\nThe texts are considered “parallel” when they are the same or almost the same among two or three of the Gospels. When translating parallel passages, translators should use the same wording and make them as similar as possible.\n\n### Why does Jesus refer to himself as the “Son of Man”?\n\nIn the Gospels, Jesus calls himself the “Son of Man.” This phrase could mean a few things:\n* The phrase “son of man” can simply be describing that someone’s father is also a human being. Therefore, the person being described is literally a son of a man, a human being.\n* The phrase sometimes is a reference to Daniel 7:13–14. In this passage there is a person described as a “Son of Man.” This description tells us that the person ascending to the throne of God looked like a human being. This description is different than the first because God gives this Son of Man authority forever. Therefore, the title “Son of Man” became a title for the Messiah.\n\nTranslating the title “Son of Man” can be difficult in many languages. Readers may misunderstand a literal translation. Translators can consider alternatives, such as “The Human One.” It may also be helpful to include a footnote to explain the title.\n\n### Why does Mark frequently use terms indicating short periods of time?\n\nThe Gospel of Mark uses the word “immediately” 42 times. Mark does this to make the events more exciting and vivid. It moves the reader quickly from one event to the next.\n\n### Sabbath/Sabbaths\n\nOften in the culture of the Bible, religious festivals would be written in the plural form of the word instead of a singular form. This occurs in Mark as well. In the ULT, the word should be kept plural, “Sabbaths.” This is simply for the sake of rendering the translated text as close to the original text as possible. In the UST, Sabbaths is changed to singular, Sabbath, to make more sense of the use of the word in its context.\n\n### What are the major issues in the text of the book of Mark?\n\nSome verses found in older versions of the Bible are not included in most modern versions. Translators are advised not to include these verses. However, if there are older versions of the Bible in the translator’s region that include one or more of these verses, the translators can include them. If they are included, they should be surrounded by square brackets ([]) to indicate that they were probably not original to Mark’s Gospel.\n* “If any man has ears to hear, let him hear.” (7:16)\n* “where their worm never dies and the fire is never quenched” (9:44)\n* “where their worm never dies and the fire is never quenched” (9:46)\n* “And the scripture was fulfilled that says, ‘He was counted with the lawless ones’” (15:28)\n\nThe following passage is not found in the earliest manuscripts. Most Bibles include this passage, but modern Bibles put it in brackets ([]) or indicate in some way that this passage may not have been original to Mark’s Gospel. Translators are advised to do something similar to the modern versions of the Bible.\n* “Early on the first day of the week, after he arose, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven demons. She went and told those who were with him, while they were mourning and weeping. They heard that he was alive and that he had been seen by her, but they did not believe. After these things he appeared in a different form to two of them, as they were walking out into the country. They went and told the rest of the disciples, but they did not believe them. Jesus later appeared to the eleven as they were reclining at the table, and he rebuked them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they did not believe those who saw him after he rose from the dead. He said to them, ‘Having gone into all the world, and preach the gospel to the entire creation. The one having believed and having been baptized will be saved, and the one not having believed will be condemned. These signs will go with the ones believing: In my name they will cast out demons. They will speak in new languages. They will pick up snakes with their hands, and if they drink anything deadly, it will not hurt them. They will lay hands on the sick, and they will get well.’ After the Lord had spoken to them, he was taken up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God. The disciples left and preached everywhere, while the Lord worked with them and confirmed the word by the signs that went with them.” (16:9–20)\n\n(See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
1:intro	c6ep				0	# Mark 1 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 1:2–3, words from the Old Testament.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### “You can make me clean”\n\nLeprosy is a disease of the skin. It made a person unclean and unable to properly worship God. Jesus is capable of making people physically “clean” or healthy as well as spiritually “clean” or right with God. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/clean]])\n\n### “The kingdom of God is near”\n\nScholars debate whether the “kingdom of God” was present at this time or is something that is still coming or is a combination of both. English translations frequently use the phrase “at hand,” but this can create difficulty for translators. Other versions use the phase “is coming” and “has come near.”\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### The historic present\n\nTo call attention to a development in the story, Mark uses the present tense in past narration. In this chapter, the historic present occurs in verses 12, 21, 30, 37, 38, 40, 41, and 44. If it would not be natural to do that in your language, you could use the past tense in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture]])

1:2	gu7i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	πρὸ προσώπου σου	1	Here, **before your face** is an idiom which means that the **messenger** was sent first, and then the second person came after him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could clarify. Alternate translation: “first” or “before you”.
1:2	fsqn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	The term **Behold** focuses the attention of the listener on what the speaker is about to say. Though it literally means “look” or “see,” in this case “seeing” means giving attention to what follows. Alternate translation, as a new sentence: “Pay attention!”

1:3	peh5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἑτοιμάσατε τὴν ὁδὸν Κυρίου	1	Here Isaiah uses the metaphor of preparing **paths** or **the way** on which someone will travel to make them walkable. If a person in high authority were coming, the people would clear the roads of any hazards. So this metaphor means that the people should prepare themselves to receive the Lord’s message when he comes.

1:3	yyk3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	Κυρίου	1	In this quotation from Isaiah, **the Lord** refers to God, but Mark is showing how it also refers to Jesus the Messiah. However, do not translate this as “Jesus” here, because this double reference must be maintained.

This baptism was done one time and showed that these people were converting from their former way of life to the new way of life. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express that explicitly. Alternate translation: “and preaching that he must baptize them to show that they have turned from their former evil ways, accepted God’s forgiveness for their sins, and were now following God”
1:4	dtqv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	καὶ κηρύσσων βάπτισμα μετανοίας εἰς ἄφεσιν ἁμαρτιῶν	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **repentance**, **forgiveness**, and **sins**, you can express those ideas with verbs.

1:7	bk1j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἔρχεται & ὀπίσω μου	1	Here, **coming after me** means that this mightier person would come at a later time than John came.

If possible, use the same word for **baptize** here as you used for John’s baptism. That should aid the comparison between the two. If this is not possible, you could use a simile or plain language. Alternate translation: “but he will join you to the Holy Spirit”
1:8	r1j9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	δὲ	1	Here, baptism by water and baptism by the Holy Spirit are being contrasted. Use a natural way in your language to introduce a contrast.

1:20	b2ci			ἀπῆλθον ὀπίσω αὐτοῦ	1	The phrase, **they went away after him** means the same as “they followed him” in [1:18](../01/18.md). Alternate translation: “James and John followed Jesus”

If it would be helpful in your language, you could clarify. Alternate translation: “for he was teaching them as someone who has authority teaches and not as the scribes teach”
1:22	e9gf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	ἦν γὰρ διδάσκων αὐτοὺς ὡς ἐξουσίαν ἔχων, καὶ οὐχ ὡς οἱ γραμματεῖς.	1	Here, Jesus’ teaching is being contrasted with the way that the Jewish teachers taught. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a contrast.

Alternate translation: “Jesus of Nazareth, leave us alone! There is no reason for you to interfere with us”
1:24	m8gz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	ἦλθες ἀπολέσαι ἡμᾶς?	1	The demons ask the rhetorical question **Have you come to destroy us** in order to urge Jesus not to harm them. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “Do not destroy us!”
1:24	qsig		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἦλθες ἀπολέσαι ἡμᾶς	1	Here, **us** refers to many spirits. Often times in the biblical passages about evil spirits, there are multiple spirits controlling one person (Mark 5:1–20). If it would be helpful in your language, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “Have you come to destroy all of us evil spirits”
1:28	hrbh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	καὶ ἐξῆλθεν ἡ ἀκοὴ αὐτοῦ εὐθὺς, πανταχοῦ εἰς ὅλην τὴν περίχωρον τῆς Γαλιλαίας	1	The phrase **went out everywhere** means that the story of what just happened in the synagogue spread from person to person until many heard about it throughout the region of Galilee.

1:30	vnp5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	πυρέσσουσα	1	A **fever** is a symptom of an illness in which the temperature of the body temporarily increases. This usually results in the need to lie down in bed and rest, as Peter’s mother-in-law was doing. If your reader would not be familiar with this, you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “being feverish from illness” or “being ill with an elevated temperature”
1:31	bzd2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-events	ἤγειρεν αὐτὴν, κρατήσας τῆς χειρός	1	Here, the author mentions Jesus helping her up before mentioning that Jesus took her by the hand, even though it happened in the opposite order. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the order of events clear. Alternate translation: “Jesus took her hand and helped her up out of bed”
1:31	sff6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἀφῆκεν αὐτὴν ὁ πυρετός	1	This is a metaphor meaning that Jesus healed her of **the fever**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternate translation: “he healed her of the fever”

Use the natural form in your language for expressing background information.
1:32	d1i7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	πάντας τοὺς κακῶς ἔχοντας καὶ τοὺς δαιμονιζομένους	1	The word **all** is an exaggeration to emphasize the great number of people who came. It is not likely that every single sick person was brought to Jesus. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “a great number of people who were sick or possessed by demons”
1:33	grp2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἦν ὅλη ἡ πόλις ἐπισυνηγμένη πρὸς τὴν θύραν	1	The word **city** means the people who lived in the city.

1:44	xhu8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	σεαυτὸν δεῖξον τῷ ἱερεῖ	1	Jesus told the man to **show** himself **to the priest** so that the priest could look at his skin to see if his leprosy was really gone. The law of Moses required people to present themselves to the priest for inspection if they had been unclean but were now clean. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “get inspected by the priest to confirm that you are healed of the leprosy”
1:44	w6b2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	σεαυτὸν δεῖξον	1	Here, the word **yourself** represents the skin of the leper. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “show your skin”

2:intro	zhb5				0	# Mark 2 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n1. Jesus heals the paralytic (2:1–12)\n1. Jesus tells Levi to follow him (2:13,14)\n1. The feast at Levi’s house (2:15–17)\n1. Questions about fasting (2:18–22)\n1. Picking grain on the Sabbath (2:22–28)\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### “Sinners”\n\nWhen the people of Jesus’ time spoke of “sinners,” they were talking about people who did not obey the law of Moses and instead committed sins like theft or murder, or they committed sexual sins. When Jesus said that he came to call “sinners,” he meant that only people who believe that they are sinners can be his followers. This is true even if they are not what most people think of as “sinners.” (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])\n\n### Fasting and feasting\n\nPeople would fast (not eat food for a longer than usual period of time) when they were sad or were showing God that they were sorry for their sins. When they were happy, like during weddings, they would have feasts, or meals where they would eat much food. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/fast]])\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Rhetorical questions\n\nThe Jewish leaders used rhetorical questions to show that they were angry because of what Jesus said and did and that they did not believe that he was God’s Son ([Mark 2:7](../mrk/02/07.md)). Jesus used them to show the Jewish leaders that they were arrogant ([Mark 2:25–26](./25.md)). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])\n\n### The historic present\n\nTo call attention to a development in the story, Mark uses the present tense in past narration. In this chapter, the historic present occurs in verses 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 12, 14, 17, 18, 25. If it would not be natural to do that in your language, you could use the past tense in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture]])
2:1	ir5j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἠκούσθη ὅτι ἐν οἴκῳ ἐστίν	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “the people there heard that he was staying at his home”
2:1	j6pa		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background	καὶ εἰσελθὼν πάλιν εἰς Καφαρναοὺμ	1	The author tells us that Jesus **entered again** to remind us that he had already been in Capernaum in [1:21](../01/21.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this more explicit. Use a natural way in your language for introducing background information. Alternate translation: “Jesus came a second time to the town called Capernaum”
2:1	afvi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐν οἴκῳ ἐστίν	1	There is some debate over whose **house** this is. It could possibly be: (1) Peter’s house. Peter’s house functioned as the place to which Jesus always returned when he was in Capernaum. Alternate translation: “He was in Peter’s house” or (2) you could leave it generic and not specify whose house it was.
2:3	s21g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	παραλυτικὸν	1	Here, **a paralytic** is someone who, because of injury or disease, is not able to use their arms, legs, torso, or some combination of those parts of their body.
2:4	v6ma		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ἀπεστέγασαν τὴν στέγην ὅπου ἦν, καὶ ἐξορύξαντες, χαλῶσι	1	In the region where Jesus lived, houses had flat roofs made of clay covered with tiles. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “they removed the tiles from the part of the roof above where Jesus was. And when they had dug through the clay roof, they lowered” or “they made a hole in the roof above where Jesus was, and then they lowered”
2:4	ouxr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	κράβαττον	1	A **mat** was a portable bed that could also be used to transport a person. Think of something in your culture on which you might carry an injured person to take them for medical attention. Alternate translation: “a stretcher” or “a cot”
2:5	trg9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἰδὼν & τὴν πίστιν αὐτῶν	1	The implication is that Jesus recognized that the friends of this paralyzed man strongly believed that he could heal him. Their actions proved that. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “When Jesus recognized that the man’s friends were convinced that he could heal him”
2:5	hzg6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship	τέκνον	1	The word **Child** here shows Jesus cared for the man as a father cares for a son. This man was not actually Jesus’ son. If your language has a term like this that would be appropriate in this context, you could use it here. Alternate translation: “Beloved”
2:6	le6v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	διαλογιζόμενοι ἐν ταῖς καρδίαις αὐτῶν	1	Here, **hearts** is a metonym for the people’s thoughts. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “thinking to themselves”
2:7	yr5a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τί οὗτος οὕτως λαλεῖ?	1	These religious leaders do not expect someone to tell them who Jesus is. Instead, they are using the question form to emphasize how inappropriate they think it is for Jesus to tell someone that he forgives their sins. As the next sentence explains, they think this means that Jesus was claiming to be God, and so in their view he would be speaking blasphemies. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate their words as a statement or exclamation. Alternate translation: “This man should not be speaking this way!”
2:7	sj6j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τίς δύναται ἀφιέναι ἁμαρτίας, εἰ μὴ εἷς ὁ Θεός?	1	The scribes used this question to say that since no one **is able to forgive sins except God alone**, then Jesus should not say “Your sins are forgiven.” If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “Only God can forgive sins, not a man!”
2:8	niy6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τῷ πνεύματι αὐτοῦ	1	Here, **spirit** means Jesus’ inner thoughts. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “in his inner being” or “within himself”
2:8	h3zp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐπιγνοὺς ὁ Ἰησοῦς τῷ πνεύματι αὐτοῦ	1	This phrase implies that Jesus had supernatural knowledge. It indicates that Jesus knew what the scribes were saying even though he did not hear what they said. If it would be helpful in your language, your could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “Jesus, having become aware though no one told him” or “Jesus, without hearing them, knows”
2:8	wga7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τί ταῦτα διαλογίζεσθε ἐν ταῖς καρδίαις ὑμῶν?	1	Jesus uses this question to tell the scribes that what they are thinking is wrong. It also shows that He knows what they are thinking without them saying it out loud. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “What you are thinking is wrong.” or “Do not think that I am blaspheming.”
2:8	s3m6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ταῦτα & ἐν ταῖς καρδίαις ὑμῶν	1	The word **hearts** means their inner thoughts and desires. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “this inside yourselves” or “these things”
2:9	wv5d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τί ἐστιν εὐκοπώτερον, εἰπεῖν τῷ παραλυτικῷ, ἀφίενταί σου αἱ ἁμαρτίαι, ἢ εἰπεῖν, ἔγειρε καὶ ἆρον τὸν κράβαττόν σου καὶ περιπάτει?	1	Jesus is not asking for information but is using the question form here to prepare the scribes and Pharisees for the miracle he is about to perform. It is easier to say, “Your sins are forgiven you,” because there is no visible proof when someone’s sins are forgiven. However, if someone says to a paralyzed person, “Get up and take up your mat, and walk,” but the person does not do so, then it is obvious that the person speaking lacks God’s authority. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “It is surely easier to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven you,’ than to say, ‘Get up and walk!’”
2:9	q905		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	τί ἐστιν εὐκοπώτερον, εἰπεῖν τῷ παραλυτικῷ, ἀφίενταί σου αἱ ἁμαρτίαι, ἢ εἰπεῖν, ἔγειρε καὶ ἆρον τὸν κράβαττόν σου καὶ περιπάτει	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “Is it easier to tell someone that his sins are forgiven, or to tell him to get up, take his mat, and walk?”
2:10	g4jn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	εἰδῆτε	1	The word **you** refers to the scribes and the crowd. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express that explicitly in a way that would be natural in your language.
2:10	jsyp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	ἐξουσίαν ἔχει ὁ Υἱὸς τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου	1	By calling himself **the Son of Man**, Jesus is referring to himself in the third person. If it would be helpful in your language, you can use the first person. Alternate translation: “God has given me, the Son of Man, authority”
2:11	f369		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	ἔγειρε ἆρον τὸν κράβαττόν σου, καὶ ὕπαγε εἰς τὸν οἶκόν σου	1	The words **get up, take up your mat, and go** were not commands that the man was able to obey with his own strength. Instead, this was a command that directly caused the man to be healed, and then the man was able to obey this command. Alternate translation: “I heal you, so you can get up, take up your mat, and go away to your house”
2:12	ki94			ἔμπροσθεν πάντων	1	Alternate translation: “in the presence of everyone in the house”
2:12	e0xs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἠγέρθη, καὶ εὐθὺς ἄρας τὸν κράβαττον, ἐξῆλθεν ἔμπροσθεν πάντων	1	The implication is that the man was able to get up because Jesus had healed him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “And all at once the man was healed, so he got up”
2:13	ma6f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background	καὶ ἐξῆλθεν πάλιν παρὰ τὴν θάλασσαν, καὶ πᾶς ὁ ὄχλος ἤρχετο πρὸς αὐτόν, καὶ ἐδίδασκεν αὐτούς	1	# Connecting Statement:\n\nIn this verse Mark gives background information to tell the reader where the next event is taking place. Use a natural way in your language for introducing background information.
2:13	zecn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	πᾶς ὁ ὄχλος ἤρχετο πρὸς αὐτόν	1	Your language may say “going” or “went” rather than **coming** in contexts such as this. Use whichever is more natural. Alternate translation: “A large crowd was going to him” or “all the crowd went to him”
2:14	sc4g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ἁλφαίου	1	The word **Alphaeus** is the name of a man.
2:14	ekv0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἀκολούθει μοι	1	In this context, to follow someone means to become that person’s disciple. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent idiom or use plain language. Alternate translation: “Become my disciple” or “Come, follow me as your teacher”
2:15	bwv2			ἦσαν γὰρ πολλοὶ, καὶ ἠκολούθουν αὐτῷ	1	Alternate translation: “because there were many tax collectors and sinful people who followed Jesus”
2:15	zqcu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	καὶ πολλοὶ τελῶναι καὶ ἁμαρτωλοὶ συνανέκειντο τῷ Ἰησοῦ	1	These two groups are used to express that Jesus and his disciples were eating with many people upon whom the religious leaders looked down.
2:16	rwu1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	οἱ γραμματεῖς τῶν Φαρισαίων	1	Mark is using the possessive form to tell his readers that **the scribes** were members of the group known as **the Pharisees**. If this is not clear in your language, you could indicate this explicitly. Alternate translation: “the scribes, who were members of the Pharisees”
2:16	b1bi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	ὅτι μετὰ τῶν τελωνῶν καὶ ἁμαρτωλῶν ἐσθίει?	1	The Pharisees and scribes are using the question form to express their disapproval. They believed that religious people should separate themselves from people whom they considered to be sinners. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate their words as a statement or exclamation. Alternate translation: “You should not eat and drink with sinful tax collectors!”
2:17	ak1u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-proverbs	οὐ χρείαν ἔχουσιν οἱ ἰσχύοντες ἰατροῦ, ἀλλ’ οἱ κακῶς ἔχοντες	1	Jesus begins his response by quoting or creating a proverb, a short saying about something that is generally true in life. This proverb draws a comparison. Just as sick people need a doctor to be healed, so sinners need Jesus in order to be forgiven and restored. But since Jesus explains the comparison in the next verse, you do not need to explain it here. Rather, you could translate the proverb itself in a way that will be meaningful in your language and culture. Alternate translation: “People who are well do not need a doctor’s help; people who are sick do”
2:17	c62j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony	οὐ χρείαν ἔχουσιν οἱ ἰσχύοντες ἰατροῦ, ἀλλ’ οἱ κακῶς ἔχοντες. οὐκ ἦλθον καλέσαι δικαίους, ἀλλὰ ἁμαρτωλούς	1	**The ones having sickness** are equated with those who are wanting to be saved by Jesus. The **ones being healthy** are equated with those who do not think they need Jesus. Jesus does not actually think those who do not want him are healthy. He thinks the opposite. He says these words while speaking to people who think they are healthy in their own eyes and do not need Jesus. If it would be helpful in your language, you could be more explicit. Alternate translation: “Those who suppose themselves to be healthy do not need a doctor. It is those who know that they are sick who need a doctor”
2:17	lh4l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	οὐ χρείαν ἔχουσιν οἱ ἰσχύοντες ἰατροῦ, ἀλλ’ οἱ κακῶς ἔχοντες	1	The words **have a need of a physician** are assumed in the second phrase. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could supply these words from the context. Alternate translation: “Those who are healthy do not need a doctor, but those who are sick need a doctor”
2:17	ca4e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	οὐκ ἦλθον καλέσαι δικαίους, ἀλλὰ ἁμαρτωλούς	1	The words **I came … to call** are understood from the phrase before this. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could supply these words from the context. Alternate translation: “I did not come to call the righteous, but I came to call sinners”
2:18	z394		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	ἔρχονται	1	The phrase **they come** refers to an unknown group of people. It is best to leave this unknown, as it is not clear who is being talked about here. Alternate translation: “a group of unknown men came”
2:18	j1h2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καὶ ἦσαν οἱ μαθηταὶ Ἰωάννου καὶ οἱ Φαρισαῖοι νηστεύοντες	1	This fast is likely referring to the fast which the religious leaders performed twice per week.

Alternate translation: “Now, it happened at the time when the students of John the Baptizer and the Pharisees were fasting”
2:19	eke3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	μὴ δύνανται οἱ υἱοὶ τοῦ νυμφῶνος ἐν ᾧ ὁ νυμφίος μετ’ αὐτῶν ἐστιν νηστεύειν?	1	Jesus is using the question form to teach. He wants the scribes and Pharisees to reflect on the actions of his disciples in light of a situation with which they are already familiar. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “No one tells the groom’s party at a wedding to fast while the groom is still with them!”
2:19	tiiz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	μὴ δύνανται οἱ υἱοὶ τοῦ νυμφῶνος ἐν ᾧ ὁ νυμφίος μετ’ αὐτῶν ἐστιν νηστεύειν?	1	It is best to keep this verse the way it is. Do not clarify that it is about Jesus.
2:19	wetb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	οἱ υἱοὶ τοῦ νυμφῶνος	1	The expression **sons of** is a Hebrew idiom that means a person shares the qualities of something. In this case, Jesus is describing people who share the quality of being an integral part of a wedding. These are the male friends who attend to the needs of the groom during the ceremony and the festivities. Alternate translation: “The groom’s attendants” or “The groom’s friends”
2:20	vg2u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἀπαρθῇ ἀπ’ αὐτῶν ὁ νυμφίος	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could express the meaning of the phrase **the bridegroom may be taken away** with an active form. Alternate translation: “the bridegroom will leave his friends”
2:20	y79o		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential	τότε	1	Here, the word **then** shows the reader that the bridegroom must first leave, after which the friends will begin fasting. Make sure this is clear in your language.
2:21	v6xc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οὐδεὶς ἐπίβλημα ῥάκους ἀγνάφου ἐπιράπτει ἐπὶ ἱμάτιον παλαιόν	1	When a piece of clothing gets a hole in it, another piece of cloth, a patch, is sewn onto the clothing to cover the hole. If this patch has not yet been washed, it will shrink and tear the piece of clothing, making the hole worse than it was before.
2:21	vdza		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables	οὐδεὶς ἐπίβλημα ῥάκους ἀγνάφου ἐπιράπτει ἐπὶ ἱμάτιον παλαιόν; εἰ δὲ μή αἴρει τὸ πλήρωμα ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ, τὸ καινὸν τοῦ παλαιοῦ, καὶ χεῖρον σχίσμα γίνεται.	1	This verse, as well as verse 22, is a parable.
2:22	fk15		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀσκοὺς	1	The word **wineskins** refers to bags made out of animal skins and used to store wine. If the bags were old and previously used, and someone put new wine in them, they would likely tear. This happens because wine expands as it sits for a long time, and the old wine skins could no longer stretch with the expanding wine.
2:22	dgcz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ἀλλὰ οἶνον νέον εἰς ἀσκοὺς καινούς	1	In this phrase, it is assumed that **new wine** is being poured **into fresh wineskins**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that clear. Alternate translation: “but you should pour new wine into new wineskins”
2:23	jya1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τίλλοντες τοὺς στάχυας	1	Plucking grain in others’ fields and eating it was not considered stealing. It was actually a commandment of the Law to leave the grain on the edges of your field standing so that those who were hungry could eat it. The question was whether it was lawful to do this on the Sabbath. If it would be helpful in your language, you could clarify. Alternate translation: “plucking heads of grain, as the Law permitted”
2:23	k3pa		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τοὺς στάχυας	1	The **heads** are the topmost part of the wheat plant. The heads hold the mature grain or seeds of the plant. The disciples were **picking the heads of grain** to eat the kernels, or seeds, in them. This can be worded to show the full meaning. Alternate translation: “the heads of grain and eating the seeds”. If this would be misunderstood in your language, think of a type of food from which you have to remove a shell or casing and use it in your translation in place of the word **grain**.
2:24	h41a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	ἴδε, τί ποιοῦσιν τοῖς Σάββασιν ὃ οὐκ ἔξεστιν?	1	The Pharisees are not asking Jesus for information, but rather, they are using the question form here to make a statement and emphatically condemn him. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “Look! They are breaking the Jewish law concerning the Sabbaths!”
2:24	ec3u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τί ποιοῦσιν τοῖς Σάββασιν ὃ οὐκ ἔξεστιν	1	The Pharisees considered even the small action of plucking and rubbing heads of grain to be harvesting, and therefore work. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “you are harvesting grain, and that is work that the law does not permit you to do on the Sabbath!”
2:24	bf8w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	ἴδε	1	**Look** is a word used to get the attention of someone to show them something. If there is a word in your language that is used to draw a person’s attention to something, you could use that here.
2:25	g8sf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	οὐδέποτε ἀνέγνωτε τί ἐποίησεν Δαυεὶδ	1	Jesus does not expect the Pharisees to tell him whether they have read this passage in the Scriptures. Instead, he is using the question form to emphasize that the Pharisees should have learned a principle from that passage that indicates that they are wrong to criticize the disciples. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could state this (1) as a command. Alternate translation: “Remember what you read about what David did” or (2) as a statement. Alternate translation: “You have read that David did the same thing when he and those with him were hungry”
2:25	r14d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οὐδέποτε ἀνέγνωτε τί ἐποίησεν Δαυεὶδ	1	Jesus refers to reading about **what David did**, as recorded in the Old Testament. If it would be helpful in your language, you could indicate this explicitly. Alternate translation: “Have you not read in the scriptures what David did”
2:25	cjzx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	ὅτε χρείαν ἔσχεν καὶ ἐπείνασεν	1	The phrase **had need** and the word **hungry** are both expressing the same idea. If it would be helpful in your language, you could combine these two expressions in your translation. Alternate translation: “when he was in need of food”
2:26	y57j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τοὺς ἄρτους τῆς Προθέσεως	1	The phrase **the bread of the presence** refers to the 12 loaves of **bread** that were placed on a golden table in the tabernacle or temple building as a sacrifice to God during Old Testament times. If it would be helpful in your language, you could indicate this in your translation.
2:26	wz3g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	εἰσῆλθεν εἰς τὸν οἶκον τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Jesus is describing the tabernacle as **the house of God**. He is speaking of it as the place where God lived, since God’s presence was there. Alternate translation: “David went into the tabernacle”
2:27	i374		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τὸ Σάββατον διὰ τὸν ἄνθρωπον ἐγένετο	1	With the passive phrase **The Sabbath was made for man**, Jesus explains why God established the Sabbath. If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “God made the Sabbath for mankind”
2:27	u83s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	τὸν ἄνθρωπον & ὁ ἄνθρωπος	1	Although the term **man** is masculine, Jesus is using the word here in a generic sense that includes both men and women. Alternate translation: “people … people”
2:27	v3mb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	τὸν ἄνθρωπον & ὁ ἄνθρωπος	1	The word **man** is a generic noun. It does not refer to any specific person but to mankind as a whole. Alternate translation: “people … people”
2:27	s2yd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	οὐχ ὁ ἄνθρωπος διὰ τὸ Σάββατον	1	The words **was made** are understood from the previous phrase. They can be repeated here if that would be helpful in your language. Alternate translation: “man was not made for the Sabbath” or “God did not make man for the Sabbath”
2:28	wgwu			ὁ Υἱὸς τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου	1	See how you translated the title **Son of Man** in [2:10](../02/10.md).
2:28	kq1c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	ἐστιν ὁ Υἱὸς τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου	1	By calling himself **the Son of Man**, Jesus is referring to himself in the third person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use the first person. Alternate translation: “I, the Son of Man, am”
2:28	pwb5			ὥστε Κύριός ἐστιν ὁ Υἱὸς τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου καὶ τοῦ Σαββάτου	1	There are two major interpretations of this passage. (1) Many think that Jesus is here appealing to his heavenly authority to speak about the Sabbath day to the religious leaders. Alternate translation: “Therefore, I, the Son of Man, am Lord of the Sabbath” (2) **Son of Man** is a popular title used in the Old Testament to refer to a human being. Jesus could be saying (functioning as the conclusion to the previous verse) that mankind has authority over the Sabbath, and that the Sabbath does not have authority over mankind. Alternate translation: “Therefore, mankind has authority over the Sabbath”
3:intro	x969				0	# Mark 3 General Notes\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Sabbath\n\nIt was against the law of Moses to do work on the Sabbath. The Pharisees believed healing a sick person on the Sabbath was “work,” so they said that Jesus did wrong when he healed a person on the Sabbath. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]])\n\n### “Blasphemy against the Spirit”\n\nNo one knows for sure what actions people perform or what words they say when they commit this sin. However, they probably insult the Holy Spirit and his work. Part of the Holy Spirit’s work is to make people understand that they are sinners and that they need to have God forgive them. Therefore, anyone who does not try to stop sinning is probably committing blasphemy against the Spirit. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/blasphemy]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/holyspirit]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### The 12 disciples\n\nThe following are the lists of the 12 disciples:\n\nIn Matthew:\n\nSimon (Peter), Andrew, James son of Zebedee, John son of Zebedee, Philip, Bartholomew, Thomas, Matthew, James son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot.\n\nIn Mark:\n\nSimon (Peter), James the son of Zebedee and John the son of Zebedee (to whom he gave the name Boanerges, that is, Sons of Thunder), Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot.\n\nIn Luke:\n\nSimon (Peter), Andrew, James, John, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Simon (who was called the Zealot), Judas the son of James, and Judas Iscariot.\n\nThaddaeus is probably the same person as Judas, the son of James.\n\n### Brothers and sisters\n\nMost people call those who have the same parents “brother” and “sister” and think of them as some of the most important people in their lives. Many people also call those with the same grandparents “brother” and “sister.” In this chapter Jesus says that the most important people to him are those who obey God. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/brother]])\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### The historic present\n\nTo call attention to a development in the story, Mark uses the present tense in past narration. In this chapter, the historic present occurs in verses 3, 4, 5, 13, 20, 31, 32, 33, and 34. If it would not be natural to do that in your language, you could use the past tense in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture]])
3:1	bm6z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	καὶ εἰσῆλθεν πάλιν εἰς συναγωγήν, καὶ ἦν ἐκεῖ ἄνθρωπος, ἐξηραμμένην ἔχων τὴν χεῖρα	1	Mark uses this sentence to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event.
3:1	rn8y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	καὶ ἦν ἐκεῖ ἄνθρωπος	1	This expression introduces a new character into the story. If your language has an expression that serves this purpose, you could use it here.
3:1	ye6d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ἐξηραμμένην ἔχων τὴν χεῖρα	1	This means that the man’s **hand** was damaged in such a way that he could not stretch it out. It was probably bent almost into a fist, making it appear to be smaller. Alternate translation: “whose hand was shriveled” or “whose hand was atrophied”
3:2	vr25		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἵνα κατηγορήσωσιν αὐτοῦ	1	The Pharisees wanted Jesus to heal the man so that they could **accuse him** of breaking the law by doing work on the Sabbath. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express that explicitly. Alternate translation: “so that they could accuse him of wrongdoing” or “so that they could accuse him of breaking the law of Moses”
3:2	q35x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	ἵνα κατηγορήσωσιν αὐτοῦ	1	This phrase tells the reader why the Pharisees were watching Jesus. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a purpose clause. You might also want to begin a new sentence. Alternate translation: “They were doing this so that they could accuse him of working on the Jewish day of rest”
3:3	nm6w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἔγειρε εἰς τὸ μέσον	1	Here, **in the midst** is referring to the group of people who were gathered inside of the synagogue. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Stand up in front of all of those meeting here”
3:4	mh3z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	ἔξεστιν τοῖς Σάββασιν ἀγαθοποιῆσαι ἢ κακοποιῆσαι, ψυχὴν σῶσαι ἢ ἀποκτεῖναι?	1	Jesus is not asking for information, but is using the question form here to challenge them. He wanted them to acknowledge that it is **lawful** to obey God and do good on the Sabbath. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement. Alternate translation: “It is allowed that people do good on the Sabbaths, but not do evil. Likewise it is allowed that a person save someone on the Sabbaths, but not kill.”
3:4	vz6c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ψυχὴν σῶσαι ἢ ἀποκτεῖναι	1	The phrase **Is it lawful** is assumed here. If it would be helpful in your language, you may clarify and add it again to the second phrase. Alternate translation: “Is it lawful to save a life or to kill”
3:4	nut4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ψυχὴν	1	The phrase **a life** refers to physical life and means “a person.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “someone from dying” or “someone’s life”
3:5	n4ep		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τῇ πωρώσει τῆς καρδίας αὐτῶν	1	The phrase **hardness of heart** is a common metaphor which describes stubbornness towards God’s will. The Pharisees were stubborn about their unwillingness that anyone would do anything on the Sabbath—whether good or evil. They therefore leave this man to suffer with his crippled hand. If your readers would not understand what it means to have **hardness of heart** in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture or plain language. Alternate translation: “their stubbornness”
3:5	c3qe		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἀπεκατεστάθη ἡ χεὶρ αὐτοῦ	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “Jesus restored his hand” or “Jesus healed his hand”
3:6	nvk1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τῶν Ἡρῳδιανῶν	1	**Herodians** is the name of a group of people who supported the ruler Herod Antipas. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state that explicitly, as modeled by the UST.
3:8	bi1b			τῆς Ἰδουμαίας	1	**Idumea** is the region, previously known as Edom, which covered the southern half of the province of Judea.
3:8	mm5v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὅσα ἐποίει	1	This phrase refers to the miracles Jesus was performing. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “of the great miracles that Jesus had performed”
3:9	zu5e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	εἶπεν τοῖς μαθηταῖς αὐτοῦ, ἵνα πλοιάριον προσκαρτερῇ αὐτῷ διὰ τὸν ὄχλον, ἵνα μὴ θλίβωσιν αὐτόν	1	As the large **crowd** was pushing forward toward Jesus, he was in danger of being crushed by them. They would not crush him intentionally; the danger was because there were so many people who wanted to touch him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state that explicitly, as modeled by the UST.
3:10	e86s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	πολλοὺς γὰρ ἐθεράπευσεν, ὥστε ἐπιπίπτειν αὐτῷ, ἵνα αὐτοῦ ἅψωνται ὅσοι εἶχον μάστιγας	1	This verse tells why so many people were crowding around Jesus that they might crush him. Alternate translation: “For, because Jesus had healed many people, everyone pressed against him so that they might touch him”
3:10	ge71		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐπιπίπτειν αὐτῷ, ἵνα αὐτοῦ ἅψωνται ὅσοι εἶχον μάστιγας	1	They **pressed against him** because they believed that touching Jesus would make them well. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state that explicitly, as modeled by the UST. Alternate translation: “all the sick people pushed forward, eagerly trying to touch him so that they might be healed”
3:10	qyyv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ὥστε ἐπιπίπτειν αὐτῷ & ὅσοι εἶχον μάστιγας	1	Here, **pressed against him** means they came very close to Jesus to make physical contact with him. Usually this has to do with crowds surrounding someone. If this might be misunderstood, think of a way to express this more clearly in your language. Alternate translation: “so all the people who had diseases surrounded him closely”
3:11	ca5i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	προσέπιπτον αὐτῷ καὶ ἔκραζον λέγοντα	1	Here, **they** refers to the unclean spirits. It is they who cause the people they possess to do such things. This can be made explicit. Alternate translation: “they caused the people they were possessing to fall down before him and to cry out to him, saying”
3:11	xf41		rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	ὁ Υἱὸς τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	The title **Son of God** is an important title for Jesus. See how you translated this title in [1:1](../01/01.md).
3:13	fatx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἀναβαίνει εἰς τὸ ὄρος	1	Here, **he goes up on the mountain** does not refer to a specific mountain. This phrase is an idiom which means that Jesus was in a mountainous area. If it would be helpful in your language, you may state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “Jesus went up into the mountainous regions” or “Jesus went up into area with many hills”
3:16	ywli		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	καὶ ἐποίησεν τοὺς δώδεκα	1	Some manuscripts do not include the words **And he appointed the Twelve**. This is likely original, but some writers decided to leave it out because verse 14 has a similar phrase.
3:16	ozli		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	τοὺς δώδεκα	1	Mark is using the adjective **Twelve** as a noun to indicate a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “his 12 apostles” or “the 12 men whom he had chose to be apostles”
3:16	rj1c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	τοὺς δώδεκα	1	Alternatively, even if your language does not ordinarily use adjectives as nouns, you may be able to do that in this case with **the Twelve**, since this is a title by which the apostles were known. Even though it is a number, if you translate it as a title, as ULT does, follow the conventions for titles in your language. For example, capitalize main words and write out numbers rather than use digits.
3:16	i7tf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	καὶ ἐπέθηκεν ὄνομα τῷ Σίμωνι, Πέτρον	1	The word **Simon** is the name of the first man listed. All of the names listed in [3:17–19](../03/17.md) are also names of men.
3:16	bt0f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐπέθηκεν ὄνομα τῷ Σίμωνι, Πέτρον	1	In ancient times, people changed their names to show that something about themselves was changing. Here, Jesus changes Peter’s name to show that Peter is now one of his followers and to describe something about him that is important. This also happens in the next verse. If this would be misunderstood, think of something in your language that people do to signify a major change in their lives.
3:17	n4gy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ὀνόματα Βοανηργές, ὅ ἐστιν υἱοὶ βροντῆς	1	Jesus called the brothers **Sons of Thunder** because they were like **thunder**. Alternate translation: “the name Boanerges, which means ‘Men Who Are Like Thunder’” or “the name Boanerges, which means ‘Thunder Men’”
3:19	r3zs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	ὃς καὶ παρέδωκεν αὐτόν	1	Mark adds the phrase **who also betrayed him** to tell the reader that **Judas Iscariot** was the one who would betray the Lord. Alternate translation: “who later betrayed Jesus”
3:20	jxr5			καὶ ἔρχεται εἰς οἶκον	1	This is likely the same **house** which was mentioned previously. See note on [2:1](../02/01.md).
3:20	rq6k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	μὴ δύνασθαι αὐτοὺς μηδὲ ἄρτον φαγεῖν	1	The word **bread** represents food. Alternate translation: “Jesus and his disciples could not eat at all” or “they could not eat anything”
3:21	uyl8			ἔλεγον γὰρ	1	Here, **they** could refer to: (1) his relatives. (2) some people in the crowd.
3:21	mf5q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐξέστη	1	The phrase **out of his mind** is an idiom that refers to acting crazily. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “He is crazy”
3:23	q8f3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	πῶς δύναται Σατανᾶς Σατανᾶν ἐκβάλλειν?	1	Jesus asked this rhetorical question in response to the scribes saying that he **cast out** demons by Beelzebul. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “Satan cannot cast out himself!” or “Satan does not go against his own evil spirits!”
3:23	xb13		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	Σατανᾶν	1	The name **Satan** is used here to refer to Satan’s “kingdom” and not just him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “his own power” or “his own evil spirits”
3:24	j5sv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables	καὶ ἐὰν βασιλεία ἐφ’ ἑαυτὴν μερισθῇ, οὐ δύναται σταθῆναι ἡ βασιλεία ἐκείνη	1	Jesus uses this parable to show why the scribes are wrong to think Jesus is controlled by Satan. He is saying that if a group of people is not united, they will not be able to exist together successfully.
3:24	b4z4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	ἐὰν βασιλεία ἐφ’ ἑαυτὴν μερισθῇ	1	The word **kingdom** refers to the people who live in the **kingdom**. Alternate translation: “If the people who live in a kingdom are divided against each other”
3:24	k3bz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	οὐ δύναται σταθῆναι	1	This phrase, **not able to stand** means that the kingdom, no longer united, will fall. Alternate translation: “will no longer exist”
3:24	h7hr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes	οὐ δύναται σταθῆναι	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this phrase in positive form. Alternate translation: “will fall”
3:25	zcr1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	οἰκία	1	The phrase **a house** means the people who live in **a house**. Alternate translation: “a family” or “a household”
3:25	dm6j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables	καὶ ἐὰν οἰκία ἐφ’ ἑαυτὴν μερισθῇ, οὐ δυνήσεται ἡ οἰκία ἐκείνη σταθῆναι	1	This is another parable which shows the religious leaders why they are wrong.
3:25	dlev		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	καὶ ἐὰν οἰκία ἐφ’ ἑαυτὴν μερισθῇ, οὐ δυνήσεται ἡ οἰκία ἐκείνη σταθῆναι	1	This parable is almost identical to the previous one. If the repetition would confuse readers, you could use one or the other.
3:26	w7na		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns	εἰ ὁ Σατανᾶς ἀνέστη ἐφ’ ἑαυτὸν καὶ ἐμερίσθη	1	The word **himself** is a reflexive pronoun that refers back to Satan.
3:26	vif7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	καὶ εἰ ὁ Σατανᾶς ἀνέστη ἐφ’ ἑαυτὸν καὶ ἐμερίσθη, οὐ δύναται στῆναι, ἀλλὰ τέλος ἔχει	1	While this parable is similar to the previous two, it would be good to retain it, as the parable refers back to the original problem.
3:26	df2f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	οὐ δύναται στῆναι, ἀλλὰ τέλος ἔχει	1	This means Satan will fall and not endure. Alternate translation: “he will cease to be united and will be finished” or “he cannot endure, and he comes to an end” or “he will fall and come to an end”
3:27	mvr6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables	ἀλλ’ οὐ δύναται οὐδεὶς εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν τοῦ ἰσχυροῦ εἰσελθὼν τὰ σκεύη αὐτοῦ διαρπάσαι, ἐὰν μὴ πρῶτον τὸν ἰσχυρὸν δήσῃ; καὶ τότε τὴν οἰκίαν αὐτοῦ διαρπάσει.	1	This parable tells about how Jesus is binding Satan and his evil spirits and saving the people whom Satan had previously controlled.
3:27	x9lk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	οὐδεὶς	1	This phrase, **no one**, does not refer to a specific person but to people in general.

4:intro	f5ua				0	# Mark 4 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nMark 4:3–10 forms one parable. The parable is explained in 4:14–23.\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 4:12, words from the Old Testament.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Parables\n\nThe parables were short stories that Jesus told so that people would easily understand the lesson he was trying to teach them. He also told the stories so that those who did not want to believe in him would not understand the truth.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### The historic present\n\nTo call attention to a development in the story, Mark uses the present tense in past narration. In this chapter, the historic present occurs in verses 1, 13, 35, 36, 37 and 38. If it would not be natural to do that in your language, you could use the past tense in your translation.

6:4	y2oa		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	ἐν τῇ πατρίδι αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐν τοῖς συγγενεῦσιν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐν τῇ οἰκίᾳ αὐτοῦ	1	These three phrases mean basically the same thing. The second and third emphasize the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. In this case, the second and third phrases are more precise, smaller groups of people. If the repetition might confuse your readers, you could connect the phrases with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: “among the people with whom he grew up”
6:4	mutm			τοῖς συγγενεῦσιν	1	Here, **relatives** refers to people who are related to Jesus, but are not his siblings, mother, or father. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a natural way in your language to express this.

6:22	a1d7			εἰσελθούσης τῆς θυγατρὸς αὐτοῦ Ἡρῳδιάδος	1	We know from verse 17 that Herod married **Herodias** after she divorced his brother. Herodias’ daughter, who danced for Herod, was Herod’s niece and step-daughter. There are a few possible reasons why Mark refers to her as **his daughter Herodias**. Mark could: (1) be referring to Herod’s daughter-in-law as if she were Herod’s daughter’s to emphasize how close they were. Alternate translation: “And his daughter by Herodias” (2) be speaking about the daughter by using the name of her better-known mother, Herodias.
6:25	caz0			εὐθὺς & μετὰ σπουδῆς & ἐξαυτῆς	1	The words **immediately**, **with haste**, and **at once** all communicate a sense of urgency. Make sure to communicate this urgency in your language.

They washed their hands before they ate, even when their hands were not dirty. and even though the law of Moses did not say that they had to do it. Jesus told them that they were wrong and that people please God by trusting and obeying him.

8:intro	ry56				0	# Mark 8 General Notes\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Bread\n\nWhen Jesus worked a miracle and provided bread for a large crowd of people, they probably thought about when God miraculously provided food for the people of Israel when they were in the wilderness.\n\nYeast is the ingredient that causes bread to expand before it is baked. In this chapter, Jesus uses yeast as a metaphor for things that change the way people think, speak, and act. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n### “Adulterous generation”\n\nWhen Jesus called the people an “adulterous generation,” he was telling them that they were not faithful to God. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/faithful]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/peopleofgod]])\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### The historic present\n\nTo call attention to a development in the story, Mark uses the present tense in past narration. In this chapter, the historic present occurs in verses 1, 2, 6, 12, 17, 19, 20, 22, 29 and 33. If it would not be natural to do that in your language, you could use the past tense in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture]])\n\n### Rhetorical questions\n\nJesus used many rhetorical questions as a way of both teaching the disciples [Mark 8:17–21](./17.md) and rebuking the people [Mark 8:12](../mrk/08/12.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Paradox\n\nA paradox is a true statement that appears to describe something impossible. Jesus uses a paradox when he says, “Whoever wants to save his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it” [Mark 8:35–37](../08/35.md)
8:1	rmd8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	ἐν ἐκείναις ταῖς ἡμέραις	1	The phrase **In those days** introduces a new event that happened some time after the events in the story that Mark has just related.

9:intro	n92j				0	# Mark 9 General Notes\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### “Transfigured”\n\nScripture often speaks of God’s glory as a great, brilliant light. When people see this light, they are afraid. Mark says in this chapter that Jesus’ clothing shone with this glorious light so that his followers could see that Jesus truly was God’s Son. At the same time, God told them that Jesus was his Son. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/glory]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/fear]])\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Hyperbole\n\nJesus said things that he did not expect his followers to understand literally. When he said, “If your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off” ([Mark 9:43](../mrk/09/43.md)), he was exaggerating so that his hearers would pay close attention to what he was saying and realize how important it is to avoid sin.\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Elijah and Moses\n\nElijah and Moses suddenly appear to Jesus, James, John, and Peter, and then they disappear. All four of them saw Elijah and Moses, and because Elijah and Moses spoke with Jesus, the reader should understand that Elijah and Moses appeared physically.\n\n### “Son of Man”\n\nJesus refers to himself as the “Son of Man” in this chapter ([Mark 9:31](../mrk/09/31.md)). Your language may not allow people to speak of themselves as if they were speaking about someone else. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sonofman]] and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])\n\n### Paradox\n\nA paradox is a true statement that appears to describe something impossible. Jesus uses a paradox when he says, “If anyone wants to be first, he must be last of all and servant of all” ([Mark 9:35](../mrk/09/35.md)).

Alternate translation: “You unbelieving generation. You test my patience” or “You unbelieving generation. Your unbelief tires me!

9:22	f5yu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	βοήθησον ἡμῖν, σπλαγχνισθεὶς ἐφ’ ἡμᾶς	1	In the sentence **help us, having compassion on us**, Mark records the father using a figure of speech in which the logical flow of events is altered in order to put what is most important in the mind of the speaker first (here the speaker is the father). The normal way of saying this would be, “having compassion on us, help us”, because it shows the natural order of events, since **having compassion** on someone normally precedes helping them.

9:41	lz5d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ποτίσῃ ὑμᾶς ποτήριον ὕδατος ἐν ὀνόματι, ὅτι Χριστοῦ ἐστε	1	Jesus speaks about giving someone **a cup of water** as an example of how one person may help another, and the example could refer to any possible way that a person might help someone else. Here, giving one of the disciples a cup of water in Jesus’ name refers to helping them because they represent Jesus and are doing his work. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a similar expression from your language or say this using plain language. Alternate translation: “gives you a cup of water because you are working for me” or “helps you on my account”

9:41	u325		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ἐν ὀνόματι	1	Here, the phrase **in the name** leaves out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete. If it would be helpful in your language, you could supply these words from the context. Alternate translation: “in my name” or “in the name of me, Jesus,”
9:41	bpz5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐν ὀνόματι, ὅτι Χριστοῦ ἐστε	1	Here, **in the name because** is an idiom which means to do something for the sake of someone.

9:41	bgq1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes	οὐ μὴ ἀπολέσῃ	1	Here, Jesus uses the negative phrase **certainly not** together with the negative word **lose**to express a strong positive meaning. If it would be helpful in your language, you can express the meaning positively. Alternate translation: “he will certainly receive”
9:41	wnb2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	οὐ μὴ ἀπολέσῃ τὸν μισθὸν αὐτοῦ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **reward**, you can express the idea behind the abstract noun **reward** by using a verb phrase. Alternate translation: “he will certainly be rewarded” or “God will certainly reward that person”
9:41	jjq5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	οὐ μὴ ἀπολέσῃ τὸν μισθὸν αὐτοῦ	1	Although the pronouns **he** and **his** are masculine, they are being used here in a generic sense that includes both men and women. Alternate translation: “that person will certainly not lose their reward”
9:42	cj0l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἕνα τῶν μικρῶν τούτων	1	The phrase **these little ones** could be: (1) a reference to children who love Jesus and who are physically little compared to adults. Alternate translation: “one of these children who believe in me” (2) a reference to people whose faith is new and has not yet become mature and strong. Alternate translation: “one of these new believers” or (3) a reference to people who are not important from a human perspective. Alternate translation: “one of these common people”
9:42	gef5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo	καλόν ἐστιν αὐτῷ μᾶλλον εἰ	1	Jesus is using a hypothetical situation to teach. Here, Jesus is making a comparison to the punishment that people will receive from God for causing other people to sin. Jesus means that the person’s punishment from God for causing people to sin will be worse than if that person had drowned in the sea. He is not saying that someone would actually put a stone around a person’s neck and throw them into the sea as an alternative to being punished by God. Use the natural form in your language for expressing a hypothetical situation. Alternate translation: “The punishment he will receive will be worse than if”
9:42	z6k5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	μύλος ὀνικὸς	1	A **large millstone** was a round stone used for grinding grain into flour. It was so heavy that it required a donkey or an ox to turn it. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use the name of an object in your area that is very heavy, or you could use a general expression such as “a very heavy stone,” as modeled by the UST.

9:43	ifcv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	ἐὰν σκανδαλίσῃ σε ἡ χείρ σου, ἀπόκοψον αὐτήν	1	When Jesus says, **if your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off**, he is using exaggeration in order to emphasize the seriousness of sin and the importance of avoiding it. Jesus is not being literal when he says to cut off **your hand**, because Judaism taught against harming one’s body, and Jesus taught in [Mark 7:14–23](../mrk/07/14.md), and elsewhere that the human heart is what causes people to sin. If it would be helpful in your language, you could clarify this in a footnote if you are using footnotes.
9:43	wd7y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	εἰσελθεῖν εἰς τὴν ζωὴν	1	Here, the phrase **enter into life** is referring to living eternally with God after one’s life on earth has ended.

9:43	h9lh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	κυλλὸν εἰσελθεῖν εἰς τὴν ζωὴν	1	When Jesus speaks of entering into eternal **life maimed**, he is not being literal, but rather, he is using hyperbole in order to emphasize the importance of striving against sin and things that could prevent one from receiving eternal life. The Bible teaches that when people enter into eternal life with God, he will restore their bodies of any physical defects. If it would be helpful in your language, you could clarify this in a footnote if you are using footnotes.

The Bible teaches that when people enter into eternal life with God, he will restore their bodies of any physical injuries or impairments. If it would be helpful in your language, you could clarify this in a footnote if you are using footnotes in your translation.
9:45	hbt9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	βληθῆναι εἰς τὴν Γέενναν	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can express the phrase **to be thrown** in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Jesus implies that “God” is the one who will do it. Alternate translation: “for God to throw you into Gehenna”
9:47	okc3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐὰν ὁ ὀφθαλμός σου σκανδαλίζῃ σε, ἔκβαλε αὐτόν	1	Being the organ of vision, the **eye** substitutes for looking at something. In this case, the person looks at something which God has prohibited, which in turn can cause the person to sin. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning in plain language. Alternate translation: “if you want to sin because of looking at something, tear your eye out” or “if you want to do something sinful because of what you look at, tear your eye out”
9:47	h4dv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	μονόφθαλμον εἰσελθεῖν εἰς τὴν Βασιλείαν τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Here, the phrase **enter into the kingdom of God** is referring to living eternally with God after one’s life on earth has ended. This phrase has a similar meaning to the phrase “to enter into life” which was used in [Mark 9:43](../mrk/09/43.md) and [Mark 9:45](../mrk/09/45.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning of this phrase explicitly. Alternate translation: “to enter into God’s kingdom and live with him forever with only one eye”
9:47	t7uv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	μονόφθαλμον εἰσελθεῖν εἰς τὴν Βασιλείαν τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	When Jesus speaks of entering **into the kingdom of God with one eye** he is not being literal, but rather is using exaggeration in order to emphasize the importance of striving against sin and things that could prevent one from receiving eternal life. The Bible teaches that when people enter into eternal life with God, he will restore their bodies of any physical defects. If it would be helpful in your language, you could clarify this in a footnote if you are using footnotes.

9:49	mr5y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	πᾶς & πυρὶ ἁλισθήσεται	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can express the phrase **will be salted** in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Jesus implies that “God” is the one who will do it. Alternate translation: “God will salt everyone with fire”
9:49	ma3s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	πυρὶ ἁλισθήσεται	1	Here, **fire** is a metaphor for suffering, and putting salt on people is a metaphor for purifying them, so **will be salted with fire** is a metaphor for being purified through suffering. Alternate translation: “will be made pure in the fire of suffering” or “will suffer in order to be purified, as a sacrifice is purified with salt”
9:50	rb7r			ἄναλον γένηται	1	Alternate translation: “loses its salty taste”
9:50	fqb8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	ἐν τίνι αὐτὸ ἀρτύσετε?	1	By using the question **with what will you season it?**, Jesus is not asking for information, but rather, he is using the question form to emphasize a truth that he wants his listeners to understand. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “you cannot make it salty again.”
9:50	t76n			αὐτὸ ἀρτύσετε	1	Alternate translation: “will you make it taste salty again”
9:50	f34y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἔχετε ἐν ἑαυτοῖς ἅλα	1	Jesus speaks of doing good things for one another as if good things were **salt**. If it would be helpful in your language to understand what **salt** means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture or you could use plain language. Alternate translation: “Do good to each other, like salt adds flavor to food”
9:50	syc9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns	ἔχετε ἐν ἑαυτοῖς ἅλα	1	The plural reflexive pronoun **yourselves** is used here to emphasize that Jesus wanted his 12 disciples to apply what he was saying to themselves. Use a form that is natural in your language to indicate this. Alternate translation: “Make sure that each of you has salt within yourself”
9:50	tind		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	εἰρηνεύετε ἐν ἀλλήλοις	1	The command, **be at peace with one another**, is an instruction to all of Jesus’ 12 disciples. Use the most natural form in your language to give direction to a group of people.
10:intro	bq25				0	# Mark 10 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nSome translations set quotations from the Old Testament farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text. The ULT does this with the quoted material in [Mark10:7–8](../mrk/10/07.md).\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Jesus’ teaching about divorce\n\nThe Pharisees wanted to find a way to make Jesus say that it is good to break the law of Moses, so they asked him about divorce. As Jesus tells how God originally designed marriage, he shows that the Pharisees taught wrongly about divorce.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Metaphor\n\nMetaphors are mental pictures of visible objects that speakers use to explain invisible truths. When Jesus spoke of “the cup which I will drink,” he was speaking of the pain he would suffer on the cross as if it were a bitter, poisonous liquid in a cup.\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Paradox\n\nA paradox is a true statement that appears to describe something impossible. Jesus uses a paradox when he says, “Whoever wishes to become great among you must be your servant” ([Mark 10:43](../mrk/10/43.md)).
10:1	qq93		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐκεῖθεν ἀναστὰς, ἔρχεται	1	Jesus’ disciples were traveling with him, and they were leaving Capernaum.

10:5	xqzb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	τὴν σκληροκαρδίαν ὑμῶν	1	The phrase **hardness of heart** is an idiom which describes stubbornly choosing to resist God’s will and desires and instead choosing one’s own will and desires. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent idiom or use plain language. See how you translated the phrase “the hardness of their heart” in [Mark 3:5](../mrk/03/05.md). Alternate translation: “your stubbornness”
10:6	m6lj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	ἄρσεν καὶ θῆλυ ἐποίησεν αὐτούς	1	Here, the adjectives **male** and **female** are being used as nouns in order to describe two groups of people, men and women.

In this verse, Jesus begins quoting two Old Testament scripture passages, [Genesis 1:27](../gen/01/27.md) and [Genesis 2:24](../gen/02/24.md) which he concludes at the end of [Mark 10:8](../mrk/10/08.md). Jesus’ entire address is enclosed with double quotation marks. His quotation of the Old Testament is enclosed with single quotation marks, because it is a quote within a quote. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate Jesus’ direct quotation as an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: “But from the beginning of creation, the Scriptures tell us that God made people male and female”
10:7	lfzd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	καταλείψει ἄνθρωπος τὸν πατέρα αὐτοῦ καὶ τὴν μητέρα	1	Here, the word **man** is a singular noun that refers to a group of people. If your language does not use singular nouns in that way, you can use a different expression. Alternate translation: “men will leave their fathers and mothers” or “men will leave their parents”
10:8	rd63			καὶ ἔσονται οἱ δύο εἰς σάρκα μίαν; ὥστε οὐκέτι εἰσὶν δύο, ἀλλὰ μία σάρξ	1	In this verse Jesus finishes his quotation of [Genesis 1:27](../gen/01/27.md) and [Genesis 2:24](../gen/02/24.md). Jesus began quoting Genesis in the second half of [Mark 10:6](../mrk/10/06.md).
10:8	p7yc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	οὐκέτι εἰσὶν δύο, ἀλλὰ μία σάρξ	1	A husband and wife **no longer** being **two** but instead being **one flesh** is metaphor illustrating the husband and wife’s close union as a couple.

10:9	ty4e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὃ οὖν ὁ Θεὸς συνέζευξεν, ἄνθρωπος μὴ χωριζέτω	1	The phrase **what God joined together** refers to any married couple. If it would be helpful in your language, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “Therefore, since God has joined together husband and wife, let no one separate them” or “Therefore, since God has joined together husband and wife, let no one tear them apart”
10:9	pty4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	ἄνθρωπος μὴ χωριζέτω	1	Here, although the term **man** is masculine, it is used in a generic sense to refer to any person, male or female.

If it would be helpful in your language, you could express that explicitly. Alternate translation: “Anyone who”
10:12	sn1m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	μοιχᾶται	1	Here, the phrase **she commits adultery** means that a woman who divorces her husband and marries another man commits adultery against her previous husband.

The repetition is used for emphasis. If your language does not use repetition in this way, you can combine these phrases. Alternate translation: “Be sure to allow the little children to come to me”
10:14	qj7i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	μὴ κωλύετε	1	If the double negative **do not prevent** would be misunderstood in your language, you could translate it as a positive statement. Alternate translation: “allow”

10:15	a1e7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	ὡς παιδίον	1	The point of the comparison, **as a little child**, is that Jesus is comparing how a person must receive the kingdom of God with how a little child would receive things. If it would help in your language, you could use an equivalent comparison or express this meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “with humble faith”
10:15	q3ck		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οὐ μὴ εἰσέλθῃ εἰς αὐτήν	1	Here, the word **it** refers to the kingdom of God. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “will certainly not enter the kingdom of God”

10:17	fpp6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἵνα ζωὴν αἰώνιον κληρονομήσω	1	Here, the word **inherit** means “be given” or “receive” and is being used to mean “receive eternal life” or “be given eternal life.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “in order to receive eternal life” or “in order to obtain eternal life”
10:17	d0iy			Διδάσκαλε	1	See how you translated **Teacher** in [4:38](../04/38.md).
10:17	h45i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ζωὴν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **life**, you can express the idea behind **life** by using a verbal form like “live,” as modeled by the UST.
10:18	lw1f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τί με λέγεις ἀγαθόν?	1	Jesus’ statement “Why are you calling me good?” is a rhetorical question which Jesus is using in order to make a point and not to obtain information. If you would not use a rhetorical question to make a point in your language, you could translate Jesus’ words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “You do not understand what you are saying when you call me good!”
10:18	gyod		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τί με λέγεις ἀγαθόν? οὐδεὶς ἀγαθὸς, εἰ μὴ εἷς ὁ Θεός	1	By saying, **Why are you calling me good? No one is good except God alone**, Jesus is correcting the man’s misunderstanding regarding eternal life and about what it takes to please God. In the previous verse, the man called Jesus “Good Teacher,” thinking that Jesus was a good man but not knowing that Jesus was God. In this verse, Jesus redirects the man’s focus away from people and towards God. As evidenced by the man’s question to Jesus in the previous verse, the man thinks that in order to merit God’s approval and “inherit eternal life,” a person simply needs to know the right things and do them. Jesus’ words in this verse are meant to correct the man’s thinking and show the man that only God is fully good and that to please God, a person must focus on God and put their trust in God. If it would be helpful in your language, you could indicate that explicitly.

This verse continues Jesus’ direct speech to the man. However, in this verse, beginning with the phrase **Do not kill**, Jesus begins quoting several Old Testament passages. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate Jesus’ direct quotation of the Old Testament as an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: “You know that the Scriptures tell us that we should not kill, commit adultery, steal, testify falsely, or defraud others, and that each person must honor their father and mother”
10:19	hj3v			μὴ ψευδομαρτυρήσῃς	1	Alternate translation: “do not testify falsely against anyone” or “do not lie about someone in court”

10:21	ux1l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	τοῖς πτωχοῖς	1	Jesus is using the adjective **poor** as a noun in order to describe a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate the phrase **the poor** with a noun phrase. Alternate translation: “people who are poor”
10:21	iij4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἕξεις θησαυρὸν ἐν οὐρανῷ	1	Jesus speaks of rewards in heaven as if these rewards are **treasure**.

Alternative translation, “you will be rewarded in heaven”

11:intro	xg3t				0	# Mark 11 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in [Mark 11:9–10](../mrk/11/09.md) and [Mark 11:17](../mrk/11/17.md), which are words from the Old Testament.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### The donkey and the colt\n\nJesus rode into Jerusalem on an animal. In this way he was like a king who came into a city after he had won an important battle. Also, the kings of Israel in the Old Testament rode on a donkeys. Other kings rode on horses. So Jesus was showing that he was the king of Israel and that he was not like other kings.\n\nMatthew, Mark, Luke, and John all wrote about this event. Matthew and Mark wrote that the disciples brought Jesus a donkey. John wrote that Jesus found a donkey. Luke wrote that they brought him a colt. Only Matthew wrote that there were both; the donkey had a colt. No one knows for sure whether Jesus rode the donkey or the colt. It is best to translate each of these accounts as it appears in the ULT without trying to make them all say exactly the same thing. (See: [Matthew 21:1–7](../mat/21/01.md) and [Mark 11:1–7](../mrk/11/01.md) and [Luke 19:29–36](../luk/19/29.md) and [John 12:14–15](../jhn/12/14.md))

11:32	x4bo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἅπαντες γὰρ εἶχον	1	Here, the word **all** refers to the people in the crowd. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “for everyone in the crowd held” or “for all those who were in the crowd believed”
11:33	rmbd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ	1	Here, Mark uses the word **And** to introduce the results of what the previous sentences described. Use a natural form in your language for introducing a reason-and-result relationship. Alternate translation: “So”
11:33	us4a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	οὐκ οἴδαμεν	1	The reply **We do not know** leaves out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete. If it would be helpful in your language, you could supply these words from the context. Alternate translation: “We do not know where the baptism of John came from” or “We do not know where John’s authority to baptize came from”
11:33	av5y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	οὐδὲ ἐγὼ λέγω ὑμῖν	1	With the words **Neither do I say to you**, Jesus is indicating that this is the result of what the Jewish leaders told him. Alternate translation: “Then I will not tell you”
11:33	arpm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐξουσίᾳ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **authority**, you can express the same idea with a verbal form such as “authorized,” as modeled by the UST, or you can express the meaning some other way.
12:intro	ne55				0	# Mark 12 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 12:10–11, 36, which are words from the Old Testament.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Hypothetical situations\n\nHypothetical situations are situations that have not actually happened. People describe these situations so their listeners can imagine them happening and learn lessons from them. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### The son of David as Lord\n\nA paradox is a statement that describes two things that seem as if they cannot both be true at the same time, but which actually are both true. In this chapter, Jesus quotes a Psalm that records David calling his son “Lord,” that is, “master.” However, to the Jews, ancestors were greater than their descendants, so a father would not call his son “master.” In this passage, Mark 12:35–37, Jesus is trying to help his hearers understand that the Messiah will be divine, and that he himself is the Messiah. So, David is speaking to his son, that is, his descendant, as the Messiah, and it is appropriate for him to address him as his “Lord.”
12:1	w2hb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables	καὶ ἤρξατο αὐτοῖς ἐν παραβολαῖς λαλεῖν	1	# Connecting Statement:\n\nTo help the people understand what the Jewish leaders were doing by rejecting him and John the Baptist, Jesus tells a brief story that provides an illustration. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “Jesus told the people stories to help them understand better. He began”
12:1	qa93		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	ἀμπελῶνα ἄνθρωπος ἐφύτευσεν	1	Jesus uses the phrase **A man planted a vineyard** to introduce the main character in the story. Use a natural form in your language for introducing the main character in a story. Alternate translation: “There once was a man who planted a vineyard”
12:1	l2i2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ἐξέδετο αὐτὸν γεωργοῖς	1	As the rest of the story shows, the man rented the vineyard not for regular cash payments, but under an arrangement that entitled him to a share of the crop in exchange for the use of the land. If an arrangement like that would not be familiar to your readers, you could translate this in a way that explains it. Alternate translation: “allowed some grape farmers to use his vineyard in exchange for a share of the crop”
12:1	fd71			γεωργοῖς	1	While **farmers** is a general term for anyone who farms the ground, in this context it refers to people who tend grape vines and grow grapes. Alternate translation: “vine dressers” or “grape farmers”
12:2	s83v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τῷ καιρῷ	1	This refers to the time of harvest. If it would be helpful in your language, this could be made clear, as modeled by the UST.
12:2	su2e			γεωργοὺς & γεωργῶν	1	See how you translated **farmers** in [12:1](../12/01.md).
12:2	oxoo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	καρπῶν	1	The word **fruit** could be: (1) literal. Alternate translation: “some of the grapes they had grown” (2) figurative. Alternate translation: “some of what they had produced from the grapes they had grown” or “some of the money they had earned by selling their produce”
12:3	c321		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἀπέστειλαν κενόν	1	Jesus speaks of this servant as if he were a container with nothing in it. Here, the word **empty** means that they did not give him any of the fruit from the vineyard. If it would be helpful in your language to understand what it means to be **empty** in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture or use plain language. Alternate translation: “sent him away without giving him anything”
12:4	jhi3			καὶ ἠτίμασαν	1	Alternate translation: “and humiliated” or “badly mistreated”
12:6	z5hz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	λέγων, ὅτι ἐντραπήσονται τὸν υἱόν μου	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “thinking that they would respect his son” or “thinking to himself that the farmers would respect his son”
12:7	m63e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐκεῖνοι δὲ οἱ γεωργοὶ πρὸς ἑαυτοὺς εἶπαν, ὅτι οὗτός ἐστιν ὁ κληρονόμος; δεῦτε, ἀποκτείνωμεν αὐτόν, καὶ ἡμῶν ἔσται ἡ κληρονομία	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state explicitly that this happened after the owner sent his son and the son arrived, as the UST does.
12:7	kefz			γεωργοὶ	1	See how you translated **farmers** in [12:1](../12/01.md).
12:7	s5dc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἡ κληρονομία	1	By **inheritance**, the farmers mean “the vineyard”, which the son would inherit. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “this vineyard, which he would inherit”
12:8	gx6l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ	1	Jesus uses the word **And** to introduce the results of what the previous sentence described, specifically that the farmers carried out the plan that they had decided on. Use a natural form in your language for introducing a reason-and-result relationship. Alternate translation: “So”
12:9	r4md		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τί οὖν ποιήσει ὁ κύριος τοῦ ἀμπελῶνος?	1	Jesus does not want the people to tell him what the owner of the vineyard will do. Rather, he is using the question form to get his listeners to pay attention to what he says the owner will do. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “So now, listen to what the lord of the vineyard will do to them” or “So I will tell you what the owner of the vineyard will do.”
12:9	tlji			γεωργούς	1	See how you translated **farmers** in [12:1](../12/01.md).

12:9	mc5y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	δώσει τὸν ἀμπελῶνα ἄλλοις	1	The word **others** refers to other vine dressers who will care for the vineyard. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “he will give the vineyard to other farmers to care for it”
12:10	v6ta		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	οὐδὲ τὴν Γραφὴν ταύτην ἀνέγνωτε: λίθον ὃν ἀπεδοκίμασαν οἱ οἰκοδομοῦντες, οὗτος ἐγενήθη εἰς κεφαλὴν γωνίας	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “And surely you have read the scripture that says that the stone which the builders rejected became the cornerstone”
12:10	xj9j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	οὐδὲ τὴν Γραφὴν ταύτην ἀνέγνωτε:	1	Jesus does not want the Jewish leaders to tell him whether or not they have read the scripture he quotes to them. He knows that they have read the scripture. He is using the question form for emphasis and to rebuke them. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “And surely you have read this scripture!” or “And you should remember this scripture!” or “And you should pay attention to this scripture!”
12:10	mzr2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	λίθον ὃν ἀπεδοκίμασαν οἱ οἰκοδομοῦντες, οὗτος ἐγενήθη εἰς κεφαλὴν γωνίας	1	This quotation from Psalm 118 is a metaphor. It speaks of the Messiah as if he were a stone that builders chose not to use. This means that people will reject the Messiah. The Psalm says that this stone became the cornerstone, which is the most important stone in the building. This means that God will make the Messiah the ruler of these people. However, since this is a quotation from Scripture, translate the words directly rather than providing an explicit explanation of them, even if your language does not customarily use such figures of speech. If you want to explain the meaning of the metaphor, we recommend that you do that in a footnote rather than in the Bible text.
12:10	kv7t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	λίθον ὃν ἀπεδοκίμασαν οἱ οἰκοδομοῦντες	1	This Psalm refers implicitly to the way people in this culture used stones to build the walls of houses and other buildings. Alternate translation: “The stone which the builders thought was not good enough to use for building”
12:10	l5ma		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	κεφαλὴν γωνίας	1	The phrase the **head of the corner** is an idiom that refers to a large stone with straight edges that builders would place down first and use as a reference to make sure that the walls of a stone building were straight and that the building was oriented in the right direction. Your language may have its own term for such a stone. You could also use a general expression. Alternate translation: “the cornerstone” or “the reference stone for the whole building”
12:11	r8z8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	παρὰ Κυρίου ἐγένετο αὕτη, καὶ ἔστιν θαυμαστὴ ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς ἡμῶν	1	This entire verse is a continuation of Jesus’ quotation from Psalm 118. If you chose not to translate [12:10](../12/10.md) as a quotation within a quotation, then you should do the same with this verse. Alternate translation: “and which says that it was the Lord who did it and those who saw it marveled as they looked at it” or “and that it was the Lord who did it and those who saw it marveled when they saw what the Lord had done”
12:11	k5w6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἔστιν θαυμαστὴ ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς ἡμῶν	1	Here, **eyes** represent “seeing,” so the expression **in our eyes** refers to the perspective of the person seeing the event. Alternate translation: “from our perspective, it is marvelous” or “we see that it is wonderful”
12:12	b1vz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἐζήτουν	1	Here, the pronoun **they** refers to the chief priests, scribes, and elders mentioned in [11:27](../11/27.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could refer to this group as “the Jewish leaders.”
12:12	lx62		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background	καὶ ἐφοβήθησαν τὸν ὄχλον	1	Mark is providing this background information to help readers understand what happens next. The religious leaders fear of the crowd is why they **left** Jesus and **went away**. Use a natural way in your language for introducing background information. Alternate translation: “but because they were afraid of the crowd, they did not seize him” or “but they did not seize him, because they feared the crowd”
12:12	v9wb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	καὶ ἐζήτουν αὐτὸν κρατῆσαι, καὶ ἐφοβήθησαν τὸν ὄχλον; ἔγνωσαν γὰρ ὅτι πρὸς αὐτοὺς τὴν παραβολὴν εἶπεν. καὶ ἀφέντες αὐτὸν, ἀπῆλθον	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could change the order of these phrases to show the logical sequence of events, as modeled by the UST.
12:12	v5wv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	καὶ ἐφοβήθησαν τὸν ὄχλον	1	Here, Mark uses the word **but** to introduce a contrast between what the Jewish leaders wanted to do and the reason why they were not able to do so. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a contrast. Alternate translation: “however, they were afraid of what the people might do”
12:13	z2sf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	καὶ ἀποστέλλουσιν	1	Here, the pronoun **they** refers to the chief priests, scribes, and elders mentioned in [11:27](../11/27.md).

12:13	pj3c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τῶν Ἡρῳδιανῶν	1	The term **the Herodians** means those who supported the Roman Empire and Herod Antipas. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say that explicitly, as modeled by the UST.
12:13	kuy5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἵνα αὐτὸν ἀγρεύσωσιν	1	Here, Mark describes tricking Jesus as trapping him. If it would be helpful in your language to understand what **to trap him** means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “to trick him”
12:13	s1hb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	λόγῳ	1	# Connecting Statement:\n\nHere, Mark uses the term **word** to mean something Jesus might say by using words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “in something he might say” or “with something he might say”
12:14	dh3d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	λέγουσιν	1	Mark could mean that one person spoke to Jesus on behalf of the whole group. So instead of **they**, you could say “one of them says,” as the UST does.

12:14	awv5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	οἴδαμεν	1	The spies are speaking only of themselves, so **we** would be exclusive, if your language marks that distinction.

12:14	xptc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	οὐ γὰρ βλέπεις εἰς πρόσωπον ἀνθρώπων	1	The phrase **not look at the face of men** is a Hebrew expression that means “to not give attention to people’s outward appearances.” “Outward appearance” in this context refers to social position and whether or not a person was wealthy or influential or had a high social and/or religious position. This phrase, taken as a whole here, means that Jesus was impartial in his judgement and teaching and did not show favoritism. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent idiom or use plain language. Alternate translation: “for you pay no attention to external things when you speak” or “for you do not regard people’s position or status when you teach”
12:14	qvpo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	πρόσωπον ἀνθρώπων	1	Here, the term **face** means “external status and position.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or use plain language. Alternate translation: “the status and social position of people”
12:14	brm3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	ἀνθρώπων	1	Although the term **men** is masculine, the word is used here in a generic sense that includes both men and women. Alternate translation: “of people”
12:14	yfnc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τὴν ὁδὸν τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Here, the Jewish leaders speak of how God wants people to live as if it were a **way** or path that people should follow. If it would help your readers to understand what **way** means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture or you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “how God wants people to live”
12:14	ap2q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐπ’ ἀληθείας	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **truth**, you can express the same idea with an adverb such as “truthfully,” as modeled by the UST or in some other way that is natural in your language.
12:14	k0tw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἔξεστιν	1	The Jewish leaders are asking about God’s law, not the law of the Roman government. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “Does God’s law permit us”
12:14	gtsk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	Καίσαρι	1	The Jewish leaders were referring to the Roman government by Caesar’s name, since he was its ruler. If it would be helpful in your language, you could indicate that explicitly, as modeled by the UST.
12:15	g48w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ὁ δὲ εἰδὼς αὐτῶν τὴν ὑπόκρισιν, εἶπεν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **hypocrisy**, you can express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “But Jesus knew that they were not being sincere, so he said” or “But Jesus realized that they were trying to trick him, and so he said”
12:15	c7nj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τί με πειράζετε?	1	Jesus is not asking for information, but is using the question form here as a rebuke and for emphasis.

Alternate translation: “I know that you are trying to make me say something wrong so you can accuse me!”
12:15	wl34		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney	δηνάριον	1	A **denarius** was a silver coin equivalent to a day’s wage for a laborer. Alternate translation: “a Roman coin”

12:17	la16		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	καὶ τὰ τοῦ Θεοῦ τῷ Θεῷ	1	Jesus is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete.

12:18	edcn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	οἵτινες λέγουσιν ἀνάστασιν μὴ εἶναι	1	Mark provides this background information about the Sadducees to help readers understand what happens in this episode.

It may be helpful to introduce them more fully in your translation. Alternate translation: “Some members of the group of Jews called the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, then came to Jesus”
12:18	ss09		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish	Σαδδουκαῖοι & οἵτινες λέγουσιν ἀνάστασιν μὴ εἶναι	1	This phrase is identifying the Sadducees as a group of Jews that said no one would rise from the dead. It is not identifying the Sadducees who came to question Jesus as members of that group who held that belief, as if other members did not. If it would be helpful in your language, you could begin a new sentence here to clarify this. Alternate translation: “Sadducees, men who believe that no one will rise from the dead”
12:18	rdl7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οἵτινες λέγουσιν ἀνάστασιν μὴ εἶναι	1	The word **resurrection** refers to becoming alive again after being dead. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say that explicitly, as modeled by the UST.

12:19	r0tg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	σπέρμα	1	The term **seed** means “offspring.” It is a word picture.

12:20	pj71		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	ὁ πρῶτος	1	Jesus is using the adjective **first** as a noun in order to indicate a particular person.

If it would be helpful in your language, you could supply these words from the context. Alternate translation: “the seven brothers”
12:24	zp2p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	οὐ διὰ τοῦτο πλανᾶσθε, μὴ εἰδότες τὰς Γραφὰς, μηδὲ τὴν δύναμιν τοῦ Θεοῦ?	1	Jesus is not asking for information, but is using the question form here to emphasize the fact that the Sadducees do not correctly understand the Scriptures or God’s power. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “You are greatly misunderstanding this matter because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God!”
12:24	sie3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	οὐ διὰ τοῦτο πλανᾶσθε, μὴ εἰδότες τὰς Γραφὰς, μηδὲ τὴν δύναμιν τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “You are greatly mistaken because you do not know the Scriptures or God’s power”
12:24	i8il			τὴν δύναμιν τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Alternate translation: “how powerful God is”
12:25	nvh6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ὅταν γὰρ ἐκ νεκρῶν ἀναστῶσιν, οὔτε γαμοῦσιν οὔτε γαμίζονται	1	Both uses of the pronoun **they** refer to men and women in general. If it would be helpful in your language, you could clarify this in your translation. Alternate translation: “For when men and women rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage” or “For when people rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage”
12:25	ox82		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	ἐκ νεκρῶν	1	Jesus is using the adjective **dead** as a noun in order to indicate a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this with an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “the people who have died”
12:25	y8vz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	οὔτε γαμοῦσιν οὔτε γαμίζονται	1	If your language does not use passive verbal forms, but your culture does use different expressions for men and women when they marry, you can use two different active verbal forms here, and you can say who does the action in the second case. Alternate translation: “men marry wives and parents give their daughters in marriage to husbands”
12:25	ensg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	οὔτε γαμοῦσιν οὔτε γαμίζονται	1	In this culture, the idiom was to say that men married their wives and that women were given in marriage to their husbands by their parents. If your culture does not use different expressions like that, you could use a single term here. Alternate translation: “they do not get married”
12:25	asw4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀλλ’ εἰσὶν ὡς ἄγγελοι ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς	1	Jesus assumes that his listeners will know that angels do not marry. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “because they will be like the angels, who do not marry”
12:25	pi8l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	ἀλλ’	1	What follows the word **but** here is in contrast to what is currently the case on earth. Jesus is using this contrast to show the Sadducees that the were mistaken to think that the existence of men and women in heaven would follow the same pattern or order of things as had their former lives on earth. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a contrast. Alternate translation: “but rather”
12:26	mffe		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	τῶν νεκρῶν	1	Jesus is using the adjective **dead** as a noun in order to indicate a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this with an equivalent expression. See how you translated the phrase **the dead** in [12:25](../12/25.md). Alternate translation: “people who have died”
12:26	z36n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τῶν νεκρῶν, ὅτι ἐγείρονται	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who does the action. Alternate translation: “the matter of God bringing back to life people who have died”
12:26	eod4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	οὐκ ἀνέγνωτε ἐν τῇ βίβλῳ Μωϋσέως	1	Jesus is not asking for information, but is using the question form here for emphasis in order to rebuke the Sadducees for not correctly understanding the Scriptures. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “you have surely read in the book of Moses”
12:26	jc5a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τῇ βίβλῳ Μωϋσέως	1	Here, Jesus is using the possessive form to describe **the book** that **Moses** wrote, the Pentateuch. Jesus is not using the possessive form to indicate a book that Moses owned. If this is not clear in your language, you could clarify this in your translation, as modeled by the UST.
12:26	w2lj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐπὶ τοῦ βάτου	1	Jesus assumes that his listeners will know that he means the **bush** in the desert that was burning without being consumed, the place at which Moses first encountered God. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “at the burning bush”
12:26	y35v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-verbs	λέγων	1	In many languages, it is conventional to use the present tense to describe what a writer does within a composition. However, if that would not be natural in your language, you could use the past tense here. Alternate translation: “and he called out”
12:26	re82		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὁ Θεὸς Ἀβραὰμ, καὶ ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσαὰκ, καὶ ὁ Θεὸς Ἰακώβ	1	The implication is that God would not have identified himself as the God of these men if they were not alive. This must mean that God brought them back to life after they died. If it would be helpful in your language, you could indicate that explicitly, as UST does.
12:27	dgc9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	νεκρῶν	1	Jesus is using the adjective **dead** as a noun in order to indicate a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this with an equivalent expression or by using plain language. Alternate translation: “people who have died”
12:27	xxzs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	ζώντων	1	Jesus is using the adjective **living** as a noun in order to indicate a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this with an equivalent expression or by using plain language. Alternate translation: “people who are alive” or “people whom he has brought back to life”
12:27	v7ui		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	πολὺ πλανᾶσθε	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “You misunderstand”
12:28	zqy4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	καὶ & εἷς τῶν γραμματέων	1	Mark uses the statement **And one of the scribes** to introduce this new character into the story. Use the natural form in your language for introducing a new character. The expression “one of the scribes” identifies him as a teacher who had carefully studied the law of Moses. Since he is a new participant, if it would be helpful in your language, you could refer to him as something like “A man who taught the Jewish laws,” as the UST does.
12:28	b3yh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἰδὼν	1	Here, Mark is using the word **seen** to mean “observed” or “knew.” He is describing something a person would perceive with their mind by association with their eyes. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “having understood”
12:28	q1u5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ποία ἐστὶν ἐντολὴ πρώτη πάντων	1	Here, the scribe is using the word **first** to mean “most important.” If your readers would not understand the use of **first** in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture or state the meaning using plain language, as the UST does.
12:28	kftz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal	ποία ἐστὶν ἐντολὴ πρώτη πάντων	1	If your language does not use ordinal numbers such as **first**, you can express the meaning behind the word **first** in a way that would be natural in your language.
12:29	ztyh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	πρώτη	1	Here, Jesus continues the use of the word **first**. See how you translated the phrase **the first** in [12:28](../12/28.md), where it is used with the same meaning.
12:29	euim		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	πρώτη	1	Jesus is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete. If it would be helpful in your language, you could supply these words from the context. Alternate translation: “The first commandment is this”
12:29	n74y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	πρώτη	1	If your language does not use ordinal numbers such as **first**, you can express the meaning behind the word **first** in a way that would be natural in your language. See how you translated the phrase **the first** in [12:28](../12/28.md), where it is used with the same meaning.
12:29	mq92		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	Ἰσραήλ	1	Jesus is citing a scripture from Deuteronomy in which God addresses all of the people of Israel by the name of their ancestor, **Israel**. Alternate translation: “O Israelites” or “descendants of Israel”
12:29	mmtb			Κύριος εἷς ἐστιν	1	The phrase **the Lord our God, the Lord is one** could be: (1) an affirmation of the exclusiveness of the Lord as Israel’s God for the purpose of reminding Israel that the Lord was to be the only God they should worship. Alternate translation: “the Lord alone is our God” (2) an affirmation of the uniqueness of the Lord. Alternate translation: “the Lord our God, the Lord is special”
12:30	thj7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative	ἀγαπήσεις	1	Here, Jesus is quoting a scripture in which a future statement is used to give an instruction. If it would be helpful in your language, you can use a more natural form for instruction.
12:30	xjng		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	ἐξ ὅλης τῆς καρδίας σου, καὶ ἐξ ὅλης τῆς ψυχῆς σου, καὶ ἐξ ὅλης τῆς διανοίας σου, καὶ ἐξ ὅλης τῆς ἰσχύος σου	1	Jesus is citing a scripture from Deuteronomy in which God is referring to the entirety of a person by listing different parts. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “with the entirety of your being” or “completely, with your entire person”
12:30	q49v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐξ ὅλης τῆς καρδίας σου	1	Here, the **heart** represents the desires and motives. Alternate translation: “with all your desires” or “zealously”
12:30	m8hi			ἐξ & ἐξ & ἐξ & ἐξ	1	Alternate translation: “with”
12:30	x3n5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ψυχῆς	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **soul**, you can express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “essence” or “being”

12:31	eu8b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	δευτέρα αὕτη	1	Jesus is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete. If it would be helpful in your language, you could supply these words from the context. Alternate translation: “The second commandment is this”
12:31	fz8g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	δευτέρα	1	Here, Jesus is using the word **second** to mean “second most important.” If your readers would not understand the use of **second** in this context, you could use an equivalent expression from your culture or state the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “The second most important commandment”
12:31	oegh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal	δευτέρα	1	If your language does not use ordinal numbers such as **second**, you can express the meaning behind the word **second** in a way that would be natural in your language.
12:31	np4y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ἀγαπήσεις τὸν πλησίον σου ὡς σεαυτόν	1	Jesus is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete.

12:31	tp6p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative	ἀγαπήσεις	1	Here, Jesus is quoting a scripture in which a future statement is used to give an instruction. If it would be helpful in your language, you can use a more natural form for instruction.
12:31	pyc1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τούτων	1	Here, the word **these** refers to the two commandments that Jesus has just quoted. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express that explicitly, as modeled by the UST.

12:34	b144		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	οὐ μακρὰν εἶ ἀπὸ τῆς Βασιλείας τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a positive expression to translate this double negative that consists of the negative particle **not** and the negative adverb **far**. Alternate translation: “You are very close to the kingdom of God”
12:34	is4c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	οὐ μακρὰν εἶ ἀπὸ τῆς Βασιλείας τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Here, Jesus speaks of the man being almost ready to submit to God as being physically close to **the kingdom of God**. Jesus is speaking of **the kingdom of God** as if it were a physical place. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “You are close to submitting to God as king”
12:34	lfti		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	Βασιλείας τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **kingdom**, you can express the same idea in another way, as the UST does.
12:34	rgh8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	οὐδεὶς οὐκέτι ἐτόλμα	1	If this double negative would be misunderstood in your language, you could translate it as a positive statement. Alternate translation: “everyone was afraid”
12:35	ptc8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	ἱερῷ	1	See how you translated the word **temple** in [11:11](../11/11.md), where it is used with the same meaning.
12:35	q6e4			πῶς λέγουσιν οἱ γραμματεῖς ὅτι ὁ Χριστὸς, υἱὸς Δαυείδ ἐστιν?	1	This is not a rhetorical question. Rather, Jesus’ listeners had asked him some difficult questions, and they had admitted that he answered them well. Now, in return, he is asking them a difficult question. None of them will be able to answer it, and this will demonstrate his wisdom even further. His question actually will teach something to those who are able to recognize its implications. But it would be appropriate to leave it in question form and not translate it as a statement.
12:35	i6a4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	υἱὸς Δαυείδ	1	Here, Jesus is using the term **son** to mean “descendant.” If your readers would not understand what **son** means in this context, you could express its meaning using plain language. Alternate translation: “a descendant of David”
12:36	e1zq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns	αὐτὸς Δαυεὶδ	1	Jesus uses the word **himself** here to emphasize that it was David, the very person whom the scribes call the father of the Christ, who spoke the words in the quotation that follows. Use a natural way in your language to indicate this emphasis. Alternate translation: “None other than David” or “David, the very person whom you call the father of the Christ”
12:36	jlbd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	εἶπεν ἐν τῷ Πνεύματι τῷ ἁγίῳ, εἶπεν ὁ Κύριος τῷ Κυρίῳ μου, κάθου ἐκ δεξιῶν μου, ἕως ἂν θῶ τοὺς ἐχθρούς σου ὑποκάτω τῶν ποδῶν σου	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation and then another quotation within that one. Alternate translation: “said, by inspiration of the Holy Spirit, that the Lord told his Lord to sit at his right side until he made his enemies a footstool for his feet”
12:36	ejy2			ἐν τῷ Πνεύματι τῷ ἁγίῳ	1	Alternate translation: “inspired by the Holy Spirit” or “by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit”
12:36	dv7b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	εἶπεν ὁ Κύριος τῷ Κυρίῳ μου	1	Here, the term **Lord** does not refer to the same person in both instances. The first instance is representing the name Yahweh, which David actually uses in this psalm. In order to honor the commandment not to misuse God’s name, Jewish people often avoided saying that name and said Lord instead. The second instance is the regular term for “lord” or “master.” The ULT and UST capitalize the word because it refers to the Messiah. Alternate translation: “The Lord God said to my Lord” or “God said to my Lord”
12:36	v53p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	κάθου ἐκ δεξιῶν μου	1	The seat at the right side of a ruler was a position of great honor and authority. By telling the Messiah to sit there, God was symbolically conferring honor and authority on him. Alternate translation: “Sit in the place of honor beside me”
12:36	k2j1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	κάθου ἐκ δεξιῶν μου	1	In this quotation, Yahweh is using the adjective **right** as a noun in order to indicate his right side. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could state that specifically. Alternate translation: “Sit at my right side”
12:36	rfy9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	ἕως ἂν θῶ τοὺς ἐχθρούς σου ὑποκάτω τῶν ποδῶν σου	1	Placing an enemy under one’s feet represents conquering them and making them submit. Here, it means that Yahweh would make His enemies stop resisting the Messiah and force them to submit to him. Alternate translation: “until I conquer your enemies for you”
12:37	j7wn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	αὐτὸς Δαυεὶδ λέγει αὐτὸν, Κύριον	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “David himself calls the Messiah his Lord”
12:37	ka5u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	λέγει αὐτὸν	1	Here, the word **him** refers to the Messiah. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express that explicitly, as the UST does.
12:37	ssq3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns	αὐτὸς Δαυεὶδ	1	See how you translated the word **himself** in [12:36](../12/36.md), where it is used with the same meaning. Alternate translation: “None other than David” or “David, the very person” or “David, whom we all respect”
12:37	qpdy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	αὐτὸς Δαυεὶδ λέγει αὐτὸν, Κύριον, καὶ πόθεν υἱός αὐτοῦ ἐστιν?	1	In this culture, an ancestor was more respected than a descendant. But to call someone **Lord** was to address that person as the more respected one. As the General Notes to this chapter describe, this is a paradox. That is, it is a statement that describes two things that seem as if they cannot both be true at the same time but which actually are both true. Jesus is calling attention to this paradox to get his listeners to think more deeply about who the Messiah is. If it would be helpful in your language, you could indicate explicitly what makes this a paradox. Alternate translation: “David respectfully addresses the Messiah as his Lord, but David should be more respected than his descendant. So why does David address him that way?”
12:37	rh2t			καὶ πόθεν υἱός αὐτοῦ ἐστιν	1	Like the question in [12:35](../12/35.md), this seems to be a question that Jesus wanted his listeners to try to answer, even though he is also using it to teach. It is a difficult question, like the ones they asked him, which he answered well. They will not be able to answer his question, and this should give them a further appreciation for his wisdom, in addition to what they might learn from reflecting on the question later. So it would be appropriate to leave it in question form and not translate it as a statement. Alternate translation: “So why do people say that the Messiah is David’s descendant”
12:37	qucc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ	1	Jesus is using the word **and** to show that a conclusion should be made as a result of what he has just said, and that this conclusion would be different from what his listeners had previously believed. Use a natural form in your language for showing this. Alternate translation: “so”
12:37	tjp6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	υἱός	1	Jesus is using the term **son** to mean “descendant,” as he did in [12:35](../12/35.md). See how you translated the term **son** there. Alternate translation: “descendant”
12:38	bh8w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential	καὶ	1	Mark uses the word **And** to indicate that Jesus is still sitting in the temple area taking to the people, as he was in the previous verse. Alternate translation: “Then”
12:38	rwxq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	βλέπετε	1	In the original language in which Mark wrote this Gospel, the phrase **Watch out** is a command or instruction written in the plural form. Use the most natural form in your language to give direction to a group of people. Alternate translation: “All of you watch out for” or “Every one of you watch out for”
12:38	yhfv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	βλέπετε ἀπὸ τῶν γραμματέων	1	Jesus says **Watch out** to warn about the influence of certain people. He is not saying that the scribes themselves are physically dangerous, but that it would be dangerous spiritually to follow their example. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “Be careful not to follow the example of the scribes”
12:38	nxy9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	τῶν θελόντων ἐν στολαῖς περιπατεῖν	1	In this culture, **long robes** were a symbol of wealth and status. To walk around in public in **long robes** was to assert one’s right to high status. If it would be helpful in your language, you could indicate this explicitly. Alternate translation: “who like to walk around looking important in their long robes”
12:38	mu5a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀσπασμοὺς	1	The implication is that these would be respectful **greetings** in which the scribes would be addressed by important titles. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “respectful greetings”
12:39	mwmf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	πρωτοκαθεδρίας & πρωτοκλισίας	1	Both uses of the word **first** here mean “best.” Alternate translation: “the best seats … the best places”
12:40	jtw4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	οἱ κατεσθίοντες τὰς οἰκίας τῶν χηρῶν	1	Jesus speaks of the **houses** of widows to mean their wealth and possessions, which they would have in their houses. If it would be helpful in your language, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “They defraud widows of everything they own”
12:40	j27b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	οἱ κατεσθίοντες τὰς οἰκίας τῶν χηρῶν	1	Jesus says that the scribes are **devouring** or eating up the possessions of widows. He means that they continually ask the widows for money until the widows have none left. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or use plain language to express the meaning. Alternate translation: “They defraud widows of everything they own”
12:40	r3ht			καὶ προφάσει μακρὰ προσευχόμενοι	1	Here, **pretext** refers to something that someone would do in order to appear a certain way. Alternate translation: “in order to seem godly, they are offering long prayers”
12:40	qm52		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	οὗτοι λήμψονται περισσότερον κρίμα	1	Jesus is using the word **condemnation** to mean the punishment that a person would receive after being condemned (found guilty) for doing something wrong. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or use plain language to express the meaning. Alternate translation: “These scribes will receive greater punishment”
12:40	h36x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οὗτοι λήμψονται περισσότερον κρίμα	1	The implication seems to be that these proud and greedy scribes will receive **greater** punishment than they would have if they had not pretended to be so godly. It is also implicit that God will be the one who punishes them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use plain language to express the meaning. Alternate translation: “God will punish these scribes more severely because they do all these wrong things while pretending to be godly”
12:41	r69x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	καὶ	1	# Connecting Statement:\n\nMark uses the word **And** to introduce background information that will help his readers understand what happens next in the story. Alternate translation: “Now”
12:41	nohd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	καθίσας κατέναντι τοῦ γαζοφυλακίου, ἐθεώρει πῶς ὁ ὄχλος βάλλει χαλκὸν εἰς τὸ γαζοφυλάκιον; καὶ πολλοὶ πλούσιοι ἔβαλλον πολλά	1	This background information introduces a new event in the story. Alternate translation: “after Jesus sat down he was watching the crowd put money into the offering box and noticing that there were many rich people who were placing gifts of money in the offering boxes”
12:41	p2kp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τοῦ γαζοφυλακίου & τὸ γαζοφυλάκιον	1	Mark is speaking of the boxes in the temple courtyard where people put money that they were giving to God. He associates the boxes with **the treasury**, the name of the place where this money would be kept until it was needed. Alternate translation: “the offering boxes … the offering boxes”
12:41	w4xc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	ὁ ὄχλος	1	The word **crowd** is a singular noun that refers to a group of people. If your language does not use singular nouns in that way, you can use a different expression such as “many people,” as modeled by the UST.
12:41	jgkw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	πλούσιοι	1	Mark is using the adjective **rich** as a noun in order to indicate a type of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this with an equivalent expression such as “rich people,” as the UST does. Alternate translation: “wealthy people”
12:41	rl1l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	πολλά	1	Mark is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete. If it would be helpful in your language, you could supply these words from the context. Alternate translation: “much money”
12:42	g6ry		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney	λεπτὰ δύο, ὅ ἐστιν κοδράντης	1	The word **lepta** is the plural of “lepton.” A lepton was a small bronze or copper coin used by the Jews. It was equivalent to a few minutes’ wages. It was the least valuable coin that people used in this culture. You could try to express this amount in terms of current monetary values, but that might cause your Bible translation to become outdated and inaccurate, since those values can change over time. So instead, you might use the name of the least valuable coin in your culture, or use a general expression. Alternate translation: “two pennies” or “two small coins of little value”
12:42	n29e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney	ὅ ἐστιν κοδράντης	1	A **quadrans** was the smallest Roman coin. Mark is seeking to help his readers, who are Roman, understand the value of **two leptas** in their own currency. You could clarify in your translation that a **quadrans** is a Roman coin, as the UST does, or you can leave this information untranslated.
12:43-44	ipl1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge		0	# General Information:\n\nIn verse 43 Jesus says that the widow put more money in the offering than the rich people put in, and in verse 44 he gives his reason for saying that. If your language would put the reason before the result, you could create a verse bridge by moving this verse to the end of the following verse. You would then present the combined verses as 43–44, as the UST does.
12:43	q124			ἀμὴν, λέγω ὑμῖν	1	See how you translated the statement **Truly I say to you** in [3:28](../03/28.md).
12:43	ih0m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἡ χήρα αὕτη ἡ πτωχὴ	1	Even though it is not literally true that the widow has put more money into the offering box than all the rich people, this is still not figurative language. As Jesus explains in the next verse, he means that she has put in proportionately more than all the others, relative to her means, and that is literally true. But Jesus makes the seemingly untrue statement first, using it to get his disciples to reflect on how it can be true. So it would be appropriate to translate Jesus’ words directly and not interpret them as if they were figurative. For example, it would be a figurative interpretation to say, “God considers what this poor widow has given to be more valuable than the gifts of all the others”
12:43	n8z5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πάντων & τῶν βαλλόντων	1	In context, **all** means specifically all of the rich people who were putting large monetary gifts in the collection boxes. Alternate translation: “all of those rich people putting”

12:44	c7jj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	Here, the word **For** introduces the reason for what Jesus said in [12:43](../12/43.md). Use a natural way in your language for introducing a contrast. Alternate translation: “Because”
12:44	ihuq			ἐκ τοῦ περισσεύοντος αὐτοῖς ἔβαλον	1	Alternate translation: “had a lot of money but only gave a small portion of it”
12:44	ui9a			αὕτη δὲ, ἐκ τῆς ὑστερήσεως αὐτῆς, πάντα ὅσα εἶχεν ἔβαλεν, ὅλον τὸν βίον αὐτῆς	1	Alternate translation: “but she who had only had a very little money gave everything she had to live on”
12:44	l4tp			τῆς ὑστερήσεως αὐτῆς	1	Alternate translation: “her lack” or “the little she had”
12:44	p3as			τὸν βίον αὐτῆς	1	Alternate translation: “she had to survive on”
13:intro	ti7d				0	# Mark 13 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 13:24–25, which are words from the Old Testament.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### The return of Christ\n\nJesus said much about what would happen before he returned ([Mark 13:6–37](./06.md)). He told his followers that bad things would happen to the world and bad things would happen to them before he returned, but they needed to be ready for him to return at any time.

13:1	ql81		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ποταποὶ λίθοι καὶ ποταπαὶ οἰκοδομαί	1	Here, **stones** refers to the very large stones with which the temple walls were built. If it would be helpful in your language, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “How wonderful these huge stones are and how wonderful these buildings are”
13:2	rez6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	βλέπεις ταύτας τὰς μεγάλας οἰκοδομάς?	1	Jesus is not asking for information, but is using the question form here to draw attention to the buildings and to emphasize what he is about to say. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “Look at these great buildings!”
13:2	xdhj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	οὐ μὴ ἀφεθῇ ὧδε λίθος ἐπὶ λίθον, ὃς οὐ μὴ καταλυθῇ	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who will do the action. Alternate translation: “Your enemies will not leave one stone upon another here, but will tear them down”
13:3	izt8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	καὶ καθημένου αὐτοῦ εἰς τὸ Ὄρος τῶν Ἐλαιῶν κατέναντι τοῦ ἱεροῦ, ἐπηρώτα αὐτὸν κατ’ ἰδίαν Πέτρος, καὶ Ἰάκωβος, καὶ Ἰωάννης, καὶ Ἀνδρέας	1	Here, the pronouns **he** and **him** refer to Jesus. If it would be helpful in your language, you could clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “And as Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew were privately asking him”
13:3	u7ju			κατ’ ἰδίαν	1	Alternate translation: “when they were alone with him” or “privately”
13:4	uf37		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πότε ταῦτα ἔσται, καὶ τί τὸ σημεῖον ὅταν μέλλῃ ταῦτα συντελεῖσθαι πάντα	1	Both occurrences of the phrase **these things** refer to what Jesus said in [13:2](../13/02.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could say explicitly what the phrase **these things** refers to, as the UST models.
13:4	lw1n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ὅταν μέλλῃ ταῦτα συντελεῖσθαι πάντα	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Jesus implies that “God” will do it. Alternate translation: “when God is about to fulfill all these things”
13:5	fe42		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	λέγειν αὐτοῖς	1	The pronoun **them** refers to Peter, James, John, and Andrew, who are mentioned in [13:3](../13/03.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could clarify this in a way that would be natural in your language. Alternate translation: “to say to these four disciples”
13:5	qekc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	βλέπετε	1	In the original language in which Mark wrote this Gospel, the phrase **Be careful** is a command or instruction written in the plural form. Use the most natural form in your language to give direction to a group of people. Alternate translation: “All of you be careful that”
13:6	z63u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματί μου	1	Here Jesus uses the word **name** to mean identity and the authority that comes with the identity. The people he is talking about will likely not say that their name is Jesus, but they will claim to be the Messiah. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “claiming to be me”
13:6	cee7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	πολλοὶ ἐλεύσονται ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματί μου λέγοντες, ὅτι ἐγώ εἰμι	1	If the direct quotation inside a direct quotation would be confusing in your language, you could translate the second direct quotation as an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: “Many will come in my name claiming to be me”
13:6	pbz4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πολλοὶ & πολλοὺς	1	Here both uses of the word **Many** refer to “many people.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could say that explicitly, as the UST does.
13:6	wv12		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐγώ εἰμι	1	The implication is that **he** means the Messiah. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “I am the Messiah”
13:7	fl5h			πολέμους καὶ ἀκοὰς πολέμων	1	The phrase **wars and rumors of wars** could mean: (1) reports of wars that are currently happening and reports of wars that might happen in the future. (2) reports of wars that are already taking place near by and reports of wars that are happening in distant places. Alternate translation: “reports of wars that are close by and of wars that are far away”
13:7	d1k9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ἀλλ’ οὔπω τὸ τέλος	1	Jesus is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. If it would be helpful in your language, you could supply these words from the context. Alternate translation: “but the end will not happen immediately” or “but the end will not happen until later”
13:7	mi4d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὸ τέλος	1	Here, **the end** implicitly means “the end of the world.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could express that explicitly, as the UST models.
13:8	ydrb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	ἐγερθήσεται & ἔθνος ἐπ’ ἔθνος, καὶ βασιλεία ἐπὶ βασιλείαν	1	These two phrases mean basically the same thing. Jesus is likely using repetition for emphasis. If it would be helpful in your language, you could combine these two phrases into one phrase. Alternate translation: “Different groups of people will attack each other”
13:8	rlxf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	ἐγερθήσεται & ἔθνος ἐπ’ ἔθνος	1	The word **nation** represents nations in general, not one particular nation. Alternate translation: “The people of some nations will attack the people of other nations”
13:8	oyrd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐγερθήσεται & ἔθνος ἐπ’ ἔθνος	1	The term **nation** refers to the people of one nationality or ethnic group. Alternate translation: “The people of some nations will attack the people of other nations”
13:8	xln4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐγερθήσεται & ἐπ’	1	The phrase **rise against** is an idiom that means to attack. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent idiom or use plain language. Alternate translation: “The people of some nations will attack the people of other nations”
13:8	e2ln		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	βασιλεία ἐπὶ βασιλείαν	1	Jesus is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete.

13:8	hz6g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	βασιλεία ἐπὶ βασιλείαν	1	The word **kingdom** represents kingdoms in general, not one particular kingdom. Alternate translation: “the people of some kingdoms will attack the people of other kingdoms”
13:8	wpd3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	βασιλεία ἐπὶ βασιλείαν	1	The term **kingdom** represents the people of a kingdom.

13:8	pcyi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ταῦτα	1	Here, **These things** refers to the things that Jesus has said will happen. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express that explicitly. Alternate translation: “These things that I have just described”
13:8	dz8g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἀρχὴ ὠδίνων ταῦτα	1	Jesus uses the metaphor of **birth pains** because, in the same way that the pain of childbirth is eventually replaced by joy when the child is born, so the suffering that is experienced by true believers will eventually be replaced by joy when Christ returns. Because childbirth occurs in all cultures, you should retain this metaphor in your translation. Alternate translation: “These events will be like the first pains a woman suffers when she is about to bear a child” or “These events will be like the first pains a woman suffers when she is about to give birth to a child”
13:9	nuti		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	βλέπετε & ἑαυτούς	1	Jesus uses a word for seeing to indicate the need for paying attention or being ready.

Alternatively, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “pay attention to yourselves” or “beware”
13:9	c2cl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	βλέπετε & ἑαυτούς	1	In the original language in which Mark wrote this Gospel, the phrase **watch yourselves** is a command or instruction written in the plural form.

13:9	ulws		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns	βλέπετε δὲ ὑμεῖς ἑαυτούς	1	Jesus uses the word **yourselves** to draw the disciples’ attention to themselves, because he now transitions away from telling them about general signs and begins telling them about specific trials that they will personally encounter. Use a way that is natural in your language to indicate this. Alternate translation: “But give heed to yourselves personally”
13:9	mbr5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	παραδώσουσιν ὑμᾶς	1	The pronoun **They** refers to people in general who will persecute Jesus’ followers. If this might confuse your readers, you could say the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “People will deliver you”
13:9	voih		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	δαρήσεσθε	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “they will beat you”
13:9	zdp8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	σταθήσεσθε	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “they will make you stand”
13:9	gbb4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐπὶ & σταθήσεσθε	1	Here, **made to stand before** means to be put on trial and judged. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “you will be put on trial before” or “you will be brought to trial and judged by”
13:9	v23p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	εἰς μαρτύριον	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **testimony**, you can express the same idea in another way as the UST does or use a verb form such as “testify.” Alternate translation: “to testify”
13:9	qq6r			εἰς μαρτύριον αὐτοῖς	1	Alternate translation: “to testify about me to them”
13:9	y6p6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	εἰς μαρτύριον αὐτοῖς	1	The pronoun **them** refers to the **governors** and **kings** mentioned in this verse.
13:10	ruk9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal	πρῶτον	1	Here, Jesus uses the ordinal number **first** in order to indicate position in an order of events. If your language does not use ordinal numbers, you can express this same idea in a way that would be natural in your language. Alternate translation: “before the end comes”
13:10	sfjc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	κηρυχθῆναι τὸ εὐαγγέλιον	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Jesus implies that believers will be the ones who proclaim the gospel. Alternate translation: “believers to proclaim the gospel”

13:11	m0xq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	δοθῇ	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

13:11	nr2r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐν ἐκείνῃ τῇ ὥρᾳ	1	Jesus is using the term **hour** to refer to a specific time. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning in plain language, as the UST models.
13:11	q2o3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οὐ γάρ ἐστε ὑμεῖς οἱ λαλοῦντες, ἀλλὰ τὸ Πνεῦμα τὸ Ἅγιον	1	The phrase **for you are not be the ones speaking, but the Holy Spirit** implicitly means that it is the Holy Spirit who will give the disciples the words to say. This does not mean that the Holy Spirit audibly speaks for the disciples. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express that explicitly. Alternate translation: “for the Holy Spirit will give you the words to say” or “for the Holy Spirit will instruct you what to say”
13:11	a9b6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ἀλλὰ τὸ Πνεῦμα τὸ Ἅγιον	1	Jesus is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete.

13:12	py9u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	παραδώσει ἀδελφὸς ἀδελφὸν εἰς θάνατον, καὶ πατὴρ τέκνον; καὶ ἐπαναστήσονται τέκνα ἐπὶ γονεῖς	1	Here, Jesus is explaining to his disciples what “some” brothers and “some” fathers and “some” children will do to their family members. He is speaking in general terms and is not saying that “all” brothers or fathers or children will do this. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express that explicitly, as modeled by the UST.
13:12	m6iq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	παραδώσει ἀδελφὸς ἀδελφὸν	1	Although the term **brother** is masculine, Jesus is using the word here in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “brothers and sisters will deliver their siblings”
13:12	utyk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	θάνατον & θανατώσουσιν αὐτούς	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **death**, you can express the same idea with a verb form. Alternate translation: “be killed … have them killed”
13:12	b9ux		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	πατὴρ τέκνον	1	Jesus is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete. If it would be helpful in your language, you could supply these words from the context. Alternate translation: “a father will deliver up his child to death”
13:12	hrhw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	πατὴρ τέκνον	1	Although the term **father** is masculine, Jesus is probably using the word here in a generic sense that includes both fathers and mothers. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “parents, their children” or “fathers and mothers will deliver their children to the authorities to be killed”
13:12	vjcw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐπαναστήσονται τέκνα ἐπὶ γονεῖς καὶ θανατώσουσιν αὐτούς	1	Here, **children will rise up against parents and put them to death** probably does not mean that children will directly murder their parents. Rather, this probably means that children will deliver their parents to people in positions of authority and then these people will have their parents killed. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express that explicitly, as modeled by the UST.
13:12	r66s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	ἐπαναστήσονται τέκνα ἐπὶ γονεῖς	1	Here, **rise up** means to stand up.

Alternate translation: “children will stand up to testify against their parents”
13:13	pk3g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἔσεσθε μισούμενοι ὑπὸ πάντων	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “everyone will hate you”
13:13	w8pz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	ἔσεσθε μισούμενοι ὑπὸ πάντων	1	Here, **everyone** is an exaggeration which Jesus uses to emphasize to his disciples the fact that many people will hate them because they believe in him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your language or use plain language, as modeled by the UST.
13:13	jhp6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	διὰ τὸ ὄνομά μου	1	Here, **name** is a way of referring to a person by reference to something associated with that person, their name. Jesus is using the phrase **my name** to refer to himself. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “because of me”
13:13	w28q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ὁ & ὑπομείνας εἰς τέλος, οὗτος σωθήσεται	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “whoever endures to the end, God will save that person” or “God will save whoever endures to the end”
13:13	c33n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὁ & ὑπομείνας εἰς τέλος	1	Here, **endured** represents having continued to be faithful to God even while suffering. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express that explicitly. Alternate translation: “whoever suffers and stays faithful to God to the end”
13:13	vcz4			ὑπομείνας εἰς τέλος	1	The phrase **to the end** could mean: (1) to the end of one’s life.

This meaning means that believers must endure and keep on enduring until the time when Christ returns. Alternate translation: “who keeps on enduring to the very end” (3) to the end of that time of hardship and persecution. Alternate translation: “who endures until the time of testing is over”
13:14	d4nw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὸ βδέλυγμα τῆς ἐρημώσεως	1	The phrase **the abomination of desolation** is from the book of Daniel. Jesus’ audience would have been familiar with this passage and the prophecy about **the abomination** entering the temple and defiling it. If it would be helpful in your language, you could indicate the meaning explicitly, as modeled by the UST. Alternate translation: “the shameful thing that defiles the temple”
13:14	vx3c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἑστηκότα ὅπου οὐ δεῖ	1	Jesus’ audience would have known that this refers to the temple. If it would be helpful in your language, you could indicate this explicitly. Alternate translation: “standing in the temple, where it should not be standing”
13:14	ck7a			ὁ ἀναγινώσκων νοείτω	1	The phrase **Let the one reading understand** is not Jesus speaking. Mark added this to get the readers’ attention so that they would pay attention to this warning. If it would be helpful in your language, you could show that this is not part of Jesus’ direct speech by putting brackets around this phrase, as the UST and ULT do, or you could show your readers in some other way that is natural in your language.
13:15	m1hq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὁ & ἐπὶ τοῦ δώματος, μὴ καταβάτω, μηδὲ εἰσελθάτω ἆραί τι ἐκ τῆς οἰκίας αὐτοῦ	1	Where Jesus lived, the tops of houses were flat. People would eat and do other activities on top of their houses. Jesus assumes that his hearers know this and that they know that the roofs were accessed by an exterior staircase at the back of the house, distant from the entry at the front. If it would be helpful in your language, you could indicate that explicitly.

The word **after** does not express how long it will be before the events of [13:24–27](../013/24.md) take place so you should choose a word or phrase in your language that communicates the sequential meaning of the word **after** but does not limit the time frame.

The phrase “it is near” then refers to the abomination of desolation and the other events related to Jerusalem’s destruction rather than to Christ’s second coming, which the translation **he is near** would indicate. Alternate translation: “it is almost here”

14:intro	uk36				0	# Mark 14 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 14:27, 62, which are words from the Old Testament.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### The meaning of the “body” and “blood” of Jesus\n\n[Mark 14:22–25](./22.md) describes Jesus’ last meal with his followers. During this meal, Jesus said of the bread, “This is my body,” and of the wine, “This is my blood of the covenant, which is being poured out for many.” As Jesus instructed, Christian churches around the world re-enact this meal regularly, calling it “the Lord’s Supper,” the “Eucharist”, or “Holy Communion.” But they have different understandings of what Jesus meant by these sayings. Some churches believe that Jesus was speaking and that he meant that the bread and wine represented his body and blood. Other churches believe that he was speaking literally and that the actual body and blood of Jesus are really present in the bread and wine of this ceremony. Translators should be careful not to let how they understand this issue affect how they translate this passage.\n\n### The new covenant\n\nSome people think that Jesus established the new covenant during the supper. Others think he established it after he went up to heaven. Others think it will not be established until Jesus comes again. Your translation should say no more about this than ULT does. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/covenant]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Abba, Father\n\n“Abba” is an Aramaic word that the Jews used to speak to their fathers. Mark writes it as it sounds and then translates it. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate]])\n\n### “Son of Man”\n\nJesus refers to himself as the “Son of Man” in this chapter ([Mark 14:20](../mrk/14/20.md)). Your language may not allow people to speak of themselves as if they were speaking about someone else. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sonofman]] and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
14:1	hwb4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	δὲ	1	# Connecting Statement:\n\nMark uses the word **Now** to introduce background information that will help readers understand what happens next in the story. Use a natural way in your language for introducing background information.

You could translate this phrase as either a description or as a name.

14:25	y1pf			αὐτὸ πίνω καινὸν, ἐν τῇ Βασιλείᾳ τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	The word **new** could be referring to: (1) Jesus, and therefore would mean “again” or “in a new way.” See the parallel account in [Luke 22:18](../luk/022/18.md) where Jesus seems to mean this. Alternate translation: “I drink it in a new way in the kingdom of God” or “I drink it anew in the kingdom of God” or “I drink it again when I celebrate the Passover after it is fulfilled when God’s kingdom is consummated” (2) the wine and thus would be referring to drinking a new type or quality of wine.

The Jews would traditionally sing a psalm from Psalms 113–118 at the end of the Passover meal, so the **hymn** that Jesus and his disciples sang was likely one of these psalms. If your readers would not be familiar with a **hymn**, you could use the name for religious songs in your culture, if you have them, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “having sung a psalm” or “having sung a song of praise to God”
14:27	pu4s			λέγει αὐτοῖς ὁ Ἰησοῦς	1	Alternate translation: “Jesus said to his disciples”
14:27	lty4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	πάντες σκανδαλισθήσεσθε	1	Here, **fall away** is an idiom meaning “to desert.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent idiom or use plain language. Alternate translation: “You will all leave me”
14:27	gkb5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	γέγραπται	1	Here, Mark uses **it is written** to introduce a quotation from an Old Testament passage of Scripture, ([Zechariah 13:7](../zec/13/07.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase that indicates that Mark is quoting from an important text. Alternate translation: “it is written in God’s Word” or “it is written by Zechariah the prophet”
14:27	jp51		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	γέγραπται	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can express the idea in active form, as modeled by the UST, or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Jesus implies that “Zechariah” did it. Alternate translation: “regarding what would happen to the Messiah and his followers, Zechariah wrote”
14:27	qzzv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	ὅτι γέγραπται, πατάξω τὸν ποιμένα καὶ τὰ πρόβατα διασκορπισθήσονται	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “because Zechariah the prophet wrote that God would strike the shepherd and the sheep would be scattered” or “because Zechariah the prophet predicted in the Scriptures that God would strike the shepherd and the sheep would be scattered”
14:27	cv7z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	πατάξω τὸν ποιμένα καὶ τὰ πρόβατα διασκορπισθήσονται	1	Jesus is quoting a prophecy from ([Zechariah 13:7](../zec/13/07.md)) in which the prophet Zechariah speaks of the Messiah as if he were a **shepherd** and of the Messiah’s followers as if they were **sheep**. Since this is a quotation from Scripture, translate the words directly rather than providing an explanation of them, even if your language does not customarily use such figures of speech. If you want to explain the meaning of the metaphor, we recommend that you do that in a footnote rather than in the Bible text.
14:27	w2az		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τὰ πρόβατα διασκορπισθήσονται	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can express the idea behind the phrase **the sheep will be scattered** in another way that is natural in your language. The phrase **the sheep will be scattered** does not necessarily imply that there is someone making the action of scattering happen, so try to translate this phrase in a way that simply shows that **the sheep will be scattered** without saying who will make the action happen. Alternate translation: “the sheep will run away in different directions”
14:28	dm1q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐγερθῆναί με	1	The phrase **raised up** means to having become alive again after having died. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express that explicitly. Alternate translation: “I am made alive again”
14:28	qi4g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τὸ ἐγερθῆναί με	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Jesus implies that God will do it. Alternate translation: “God raises me from the dead”
14:29	op1t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πάντες	1	By using the word **all** in this context, the implication is that **Peter** is referring to “all the other disciples.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could express that explicitly. Alternate translation: “all the other disciples”
14:29	j961		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	σκανδαλισθήσονται	1	See how you translated the phrase **fall away** in [14:27](../14/27.md). Alternate translation: “leave you”
14:29	div5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	οὐκ ἐγώ	1	In the phrase **not I**, Peter is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete. If it would be helpful in your language, you could supply these words from the context. Alternate translation: “I will not fall away” or “I will not forsake you”
14:30	z2q9			ἀμὴν, λέγω σοι	1	See how you translated the statement **Truly I say to you** in [3:28](../03/28.md).

14:31	z9le		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὡσαύτως & καὶ πάντες ἔλεγον	1	The phrase **they all also were speaking in the same manner** means that all of the disciples were saying the same thing that Peter said. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express that explicitly, as modeled by the UST.
14:32	deg7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἔρχονται	1	The pronoun **they** refers to Jesus and his disciples. If this might confuse your readers, you could say the meaning explicitly, as modeled by the UST.
14:32	ni66		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	ἔρχονται	1	# Connecting Statement:\n\nYour language may say “went” rather than **come** or “came” in contexts such as this. Use whichever is more natural. Alternate translation: “they went” or “they go”
14:34	eyw3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	ἐστιν ἡ ψυχή μου	1	By using the phrase **My soul**, Jesus is speaking of his entire self by referring to one part of himself, his **soul**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your culture or use plain language, as modeled by the UST.
14:34	krj1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ψυχή μου	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **soul**, you can express the same idea in another way, as modeled by the UST.
14:34	ic1g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	ἕως θανάτου	1	Jesus is using the phrase **even to death** to describe the extent of his grief. Jesus is exaggerating in order to show the depth of the distress and sorrow that he feels. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your language that expresses great sorrow, or you could turn the phrase **even to death** into a simile, as modeled by the UST. Alternate translation: “and I have so much grief that it makes me feel like I am near death”
14:35	nk8l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	εἰ δυνατόν ἐστιν	1	Alternate translation: “if possible”
14:35	wc6d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	παρέλθῃ & ἡ ὥρα	1	Jesus is using the term **hour** to refer to a specific time at which an event or events would take place. Here, the phrase **the hour** refers specifically to the time of Jesus’ suffering. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning in plain language, as the UST models.
14:35	gj74		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	παρέλθῃ ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ ἡ ὥρα	1	Here, Jesus is referring to the events that would take place during the upcoming hours as if they were the **hour** itself. Because Jesus is associating the upcoming events with the time of the events themselves, by asking that **the hour might pass**, Jesus is actually asking that the events themselves would not happen. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or use plain language. Alternate translation: “the upcoming events would pass from him” or “he would not have to experience the upcoming things which he knew he was going to have to suffer”
14:36	c11w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate	Ἀββά	1	The word **Abba** is an Aramaic word meaning **Father** and which the Jews used to address their fathers. Mark writes it as it sounds in Aramaic (he transliterates it) and then translates its meaning into Greek for his readers, who did not know Aramaic. Since the Aramaic word **Abba** is followed by the Greek word **Father**, it is best to transliterate **Abba** and then give its meaning in your language as Mark does.
14:36	t9r2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	ὁ Πατήρ	1	The word **Father** is an important title for God.
14:36	jk6a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	παρένεγκε τὸ ποτήριον τοῦτο ἀπ’ ἐμοῦ	1	Jesus is referring to the sufferings he will soon experience as if they were a **cup** of bitter-tasting liquid that he would have to drink. If your readers would not understand what **cup** means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Please spare me from these sufferings”
14:36	s1r5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	παρένεγκε τὸ ποτήριον τοῦτο ἀπ’ ἐμοῦ	1	The statement **Remove this cup from me** is an imperative, but it should be translated as a request rather than as a command. It may be helpful to add an expression such as “please” to make this clear. Alternate translation: “Please spare me from these sufferings”
14:37	ja6d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	εὑρίσκει αὐτοὺς καθεύδοντας	1	The pronoun **them** refers to Peter, James, and John. If it would be helpful in your language, you could indicate that in a way that would be natural in your language. Alternate translation: “finds the three disciples sleeping”
14:37	kp33		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	Σίμων, καθεύδεις? οὐκ ἴσχυσας μίαν ὥραν γρηγορῆσαι?	1	Jesus is not asking for information, but is using the question form here to rebuke **Peter** for falling asleep. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate Jesus’ words as a statement, as modeled by the UST.
14:38	hi36		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	προσεύχεσθε, ἵνα μὴ ἔλθητε εἰς πειρασμόν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **temptation**, you can express the idea behind it with a verb such as “tempt.” Alternate translation: “pray, so that nothing will tempt you to sin”
14:38	zrp4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	προσεύχεσθε, ἵνα μὴ ἔλθητε εἰς πειρασμόν	1	The implications are that the disciples will soon experience the **temptation** to abandon Jesus in order to save themselves. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “pray that when the Jewish leaders come to arrest me and you are tempted to try to save yourselves by running away or denying that you know me, you will not sin by doing that”
14:38	c1je		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τὸ & πνεῦμα	1	Jesus is describing the inner part of a person (which includes their desires and will) by association with their **spirit**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your culture or use plain language. See how you translated **spirit** in [2:8](../02/08.md), where **spirit** is used with a similar meaning. Alternate translation: “The inner self” or “The inner person”
14:38	djxc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τὸ & πνεῦμα	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **spirit**, you can express the same idea in another way, as modeled by the UST.
14:38	gt2n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	πρόθυμον	1	Jesus is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete. If it would be helpful in your language, you could supply these words from the context. Alternate translation: “is willing to do what is right” or “is willing to do what pleases God” or “is willing to obey me”
14:38	b909			ἡ & σὰρξ ἀσθενής	1	Here, the word **flesh** could: (1) include the meaning of both option 2 and option 3 and therefore **flesh** would refer to both the weakness of the human body and also to the deficiency of human desire and ability to do what is right. Alternate translation: “the body and your spiritual strength is weak” (2) refer to the human “body.” Alternate translation: “the body is weak” (3) refer to the sinful part of human nature that prefers to seek comfort and seek what it desires rather than obey God and do the things that please him. Alternate translation: “the sinful human nature is weak”
14:39	l9nj			τὸν αὐτὸν λόγον εἰπών	1	Alternate translation: “and said the same thing he had prayed the first time”
14:40	zkb2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	εὗρεν αὐτοὺς καθεύδοντας, ἦσαν γὰρ αὐτῶν οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ καταβαρυνόμενοι	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “because the three disciples’ eyes were weighed down, he found them sleeping”
14:40	bgyj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	αὐτοὺς	1	Here, the pronoun **them** refers to Peter, James, and John. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning in a way that would make that clear in your language. Alternate translation: “the three disciples”
14:40	vwlx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1	Here, the word **for** indicates that what follows is the reason that Jesus found the disciples sleeping. Use a natural way in your language to show this connection. Alternate translation: “because”

14:41	lw7w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	καθεύδετε τὸ λοιπὸν καὶ ἀναπαύεσθε	1	Jesus is not asking for information, but is using the question form here to rebuke his disciples for falling asleep and resting.

14:41	wxmq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀπέχει	1	The phrase **It is enough** most likely refers to the apostles sleeping. They need to wake up and prepare for what is about tot happen. Alternate translation: “It is enough sleep” or “That is enough sleep”

Here Mark uses the word **Now** to introduce the background information which he gives in the rest of this verse. Use the natural form in your language for expressing background information. Alternate translation: “Now Judas, who was going to betray Jesus, gave this sign to those who were going to arrest Jesus. Judas said, ‘Whomever I may kiss, he it is. Seize him and lead him away securely’”

14:48	eq25		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	ὡς ἐπὶ λῃστὴν ἐξήλθατε μετὰ μαχαιρῶν καὶ ξύλων συνλαβεῖν με?	1	Jesus is not asking for information, but is using the question form here as an emphatic way to rebuke the crowd. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way, as modeled by the UST. Alternate translation: “It is ridiculous that you come here to seize me with swords and clubs as if I were a robber!”
14:48	djp0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	ἐξήλθατε	1	Your language may say “go” rather than **come** in contexts such as this. Use whichever is more natural. Alternate translation: “Did you go out”
14:49	my05		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	τῷ ἱερῷ	1	Only priests were allowed to enter the temple building, so by saying **the temple**, Jesus means the temple courtyard. He is using the word for the entire building to refer to one part of it. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this explicitly, as modeled by the UST.
14:49	t9d8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ἀλλ’ ἵνα πληρωθῶσιν αἱ Γραφαί	1	Jesus’ words **But so that the Scriptures might be fulfilled** could: (1) be an ellipsis. If this is the case, then Jesus is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete. If it would be helpful in your language, you could supply these words. Matthew, in his parallel account in [Matt 26:56](../mat/26/56.md), supplies the words “all this has happened” between the words **But** and **so that**, so if this is an ellipsis these are the words that should be supplied. Alternate translation: “But all this has happened so that the Scriptures might be fulfilled” or “But, so that the Scriptures might be fulfilled, all this has happened” (2) instead be translated with an imperatival meaning as “But let the Scriptures be fulfilled.” Alternate translation: “But let the Scriptures be fulfilled”
14:49	d8wh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	πληρωθῶσιν αἱ Γραφαί	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Jesus implies that both God and sinful humans are acting to fulfill Scripture. God is intentionally acting to fulfill Scripture by leading Jesus to be willing to die and not flee from those trying to kill him. Sinful humans are also acting to fulfill Scripture even though they do not know that they are fulfilling what God had foretold in the Old Testament would happen to the Messiah. Because of this, if you must state who did the action, it would be best to translate this in a way that includes both or allows for both. Alternate translation: “God might fulfill through the acts of sinful men what has been foretold in the Scriptures”
14:50	pk0i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	αὐτὸν	1	The pronoun **him** refers to Jesus. If it would be helpful in your language, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “Jesus”

It may be helpful to make this a separate sentence. Alternate translation: “Peter followed Jesus, staying some distance away so that he himself would not be recognized and arrested. He followed as far as going”

This was not an official trial. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express that explicitly. Alternate translation: “were looking for evidence against Jesus so that they could have him put to death”

Alternate translation: “but what they said against Jesus was not the same” or “but when they testified against Jesus, they contradicted each other” or “but when they testified against Jesus, their testimonies were not consistent with each other”

Alternate translation: “We heard him saying that he will destroy this temple made with hands and in three days will build another made without hands”
14:58	f82e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἡμεῖς	1	The pronoun **We** refers to the people who falsely testified against Jesus. It does not include the people to whom they are speaking. If your language requires you to mark such forms, **We** would be exclusive here.
14:58	e94y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	τὸν χειροποίητον & ἀχειροποίητον	1	Here, Jesus uses the word **hands** to mean “men”. Jesus uses one part of a person to refer to the entire person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your culture or plain language. Alternate translation: “made by men … made without man’s help” or “built by men … which will be built without man’s help”
14:58	hm5e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ἄλλον	1	By saying **another**, Jesus is leaving out a word that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete. If it would be helpful in your language, you could supply the word “temple” from the context, as modeled by the UST.
14:58	v4ny		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	ἄλλον ἀχειροποίητον οἰκοδομήσω	1	By saying **another made without hands**, Jesus is referring to his body which God would bring back to life after **three days**. Because this is a direct quote of something that Jesus said, you should keep this information implicit in your translation.

14:61	p8b5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	ὁ & ἐσιώπα, καὶ οὐκ ἀπεκρίνατο οὐδέν	1	The phrases **he was silent** and the phrase **did not answer** mean basically the same thing. The repetition is used to emphasize that Jesus did not respond to any of the false accusations that were being made against him. If your language does not use repetition to do this, you can use one phrase and provide emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “he did not reply to anything that was said against him at all!” or “Jesus did not reply to a single thing that was said against him!”
14:61	o27t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὁ Υἱὸς τοῦ Εὐλογητοῦ	1	Here, the title **the Blessed One** is a way of referring to God, so when the **high priest** asks Jesus if he is **the Son of the Blessed One**, he is asking Jesus if he is “the Son of God.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could indicate that explicitly, as modeled by the UST.

14:62	d5qm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	ἐκ δεξιῶν καθήμενον τῆς δυνάμεως	1	To sit **at the right hand** of God is a symbolic act of receiving great honor and authority from God. If there is a gesture with a similar meaning in your culture, you could consider using it here in your translation, or you could use plain language to express what **sitting at the right hand** of someone meant in Jesus’ culture. Alternate translation: “sitting in a place of honor beside the all-powerful God” or “sitting in a place of honor next to the all-powerful God”
14:62	e1xd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐκ δεξιῶν καθήμενον τῆς δυνάμεως	1	By using the phrase **of power**, Jesus is referring to God by association with his **power**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your culture that expresses power, or you could use plain language. Alternate translation: “sitting at the right hand of God” or “sitting at the right hand of God who is powerful”
14:63	jz48		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	διαρρήξας τοὺς χιτῶνας αὐτοῦ	1	In Jesus’ culture the act of tearing one’s clothes was a symbolic act done to show outrage or grief. If there is a gesture with a similar meaning in your culture, you could use it here in your translation, or you could use plain language to express what tearing one’s clothes meant in Jesus’ culture. Alternate translation: “having torn his garments in outrage”
14:63	afd3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τί ἔτι χρείαν ἔχομεν μαρτύρων?	1	By saying **What need do we still have of witnesses?**, the high priest is not asking for information but is using the question form here for emphasis. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “We certainly do not need any more people who will testify against this man!”
14:64	zwf9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἠκούσατε τῆς βλασφημίας	1	This refers to what Jesus had said, which the high priest labelled as blasphemy.

14:64	fu4g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἔνοχον εἶναι θανάτου	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **death**, you can express the same idea with a verbal form. Alternate translation: “and said he deserved to be executed”

14:65	d56t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	περικαλύπτειν αὐτοῦ τὸ πρόσωπον	1	To **blindfold** someone means to tie a thick cloth around the middle of a person’s head to cover the eyes and prevent that person from seeing. If it would be helpful in your language, you could explain it with a general expression. Alternate translation: “to cover his eyes so that he could not see”
14:65	gvq3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	προφήτευσον	1	The implication is that God would have to tell Jesus who struck him, since Jesus had his eyes covered and could not see who was striking him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “Prophesy and tell us who hit you” or “Speak words from God and tell us who hit you”
14:65	dg7u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony	προφήτευσον	1	The guards did not believe that Jesus was a real prophet and could **Prophesy**. When they demanded that Jesus should **Prophesy**, they were challenging him to do something they believed he could not do. They were only asking Jesus to **Prophesy** in order to mock him. If it would be helpful in your language, consider expressing the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Prove that you really are a prophet and prophesy” or “Prophesy, if you really are a prophet” or “Prophesy and tell us who hit you, if you really are a prophet”
14:68	l5i1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	οὔτε οἶδα, οὔτε ἐπίσταμαι σὺ τί λέγεις	1	The phrase **Neither have I known** and the phrase **nor do I understand what you are saying** mean basically the same thing. Peter is using the repetition for emphasis. If your language does not use repetition to do this, you can use one phrase and provide emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “I surely do not know what you are talking about” or “I have no idea what you are talking about” or “I know nothing about this man from Nazareth whom you are speaking about”
14:69	v5kr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	αὐτῶν	1	The pronoun **them** refers to Jesus and his disciples. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “Jesus and his disciples”

14:71	ce6r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀναθεματίζειν	1	Here, the phrase **to curse** means “to invoke a curse from God upon oneself.” Here, Peter is invoking God’s curse upon himself if what he is saying is not true. If it would be helpful in your language, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “to invoke God’s curse upon himself if what he was saying was not true” or “to ask God to curse him if what he was saying was false” or “to invoke God’s destruction upon himself if what he was saying was false”
14:71	vihe		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὀμνύειν, ὅτι οὐκ οἶδα τὸν ἄνθρωπον τοῦτον, ὃν λέγετε	1	Here, the phrase **to swear** means “to subject oneself to an oath” or “to put oneself under an oath.” Here, Peter is invoking God’s curse upon himself if what he is saying is not true. If it would be helpful in your language, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “to swear by saying, ‘God is my witness that I do not know the man whom you are talking about’” or “to promise by making an oath and saying, ‘God is my witness that I do not know the man whom you are talking about’”

14:72	ja3e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal	ἐκ δευτέρου	1	The word **second** is an ordinal number. If your language does not use ordinal numbers, you can translate the phrase **a second time** in a way that would be natural in your language. Alternate translation: “once more”
14:72	cfno		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ῥῆμα	1	Mark is using the term **word** to describe what Jesus had said using words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “statement”

14:72	zr4p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐπιβαλὼν, ἔκλαιεν	1	The Greek phrase which the ULT translates as **having broken down** could (1) be an idiom which means that Peter became overwhelmed with grief and lost control of his emotions. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent idiom from your culture or use plain language. Alternate translation: “having become overwhelmed with grief” or “having lost control of his emotions” (2) also be translated as “having thought of it” or “having reflected on it.” Alternate translation: “having thought of it, he was weeping” or “having reflected on it, he was weeping” or “having thought about what he had just done, he was weeping” (3) also be translated as “he began.” Alternate translation: “he began weeping” or “he started crying”
15:intro	d823				0	# Mark 15 General Notes\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### “The curtain of the temple was split in two”\n\nThe curtain in the temple was an important symbol that showed that people needed to have someone speak to God for them. They could not speak to God directly, because all people are sinful and God hates sin. God split the curtain to show that Jesus’ people can now speak to God directly because Jesus has paid for their sins.\n\n### The tomb\n\nThe tomb in which Jesus was buried ([Mark 15:46](../mrk/15/46.md)) was the kind of tomb in which wealthy Jewish families buried their dead. It was an actual room cut into a rock. It had a flat place on one side where they could place the body after they had put oil and spices on it and wrapped it in cloth. Then they would roll a large rock in front of the tomb so no one could see inside or enter.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Sarcasm\n\nThe soldiers were insulting Jesus when they put a “purple robe” on him and placed a “crown of thorns” on his head (See Mark 15:17) and said, “Hail, King of the Jews” (See Mark 15:18) and bent their knees and bowed down to him (See Mark 15:19). These actions were symbolic of things that people would do to a king, but the soldiers did not really believe that Jesus was a king. By pretending that they thought Jesus was a king, and by putting a “crown of thorns” on Jesus’ head instead of a regular crown, and by “striking his head with a staff and spitting on him” (See Mark 15:19) the soldiers showed that they did not believe that Jesus was the Son of God. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]] and (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]]) and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/mock]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Golgotha\n\nThe word “Golgotha” is an Aramaic word. Mark used Greek letters to express the sound of this Aramaic word so that his readers would know how it sounded, and then he told them it meant “Place of a Skull.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate]])\n\n### Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?\n\nThis is an Aramaic phrase. Mark transliterates the sounds of this phrase by writing them with Greek letters. Mark used Greek letters to express the sound of this Aramaic phrase so that his readers would know how it sounded, and then he told them that it meant “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate]])
15:1	xz7c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	δήσαντες τὸν Ἰησοῦν, ἀπήνεγκαν	1	The Jewish religious leaders commanded that Jesus should be **bound** but did not bind him themselves. It would have been the guards who actually bound Jesus and **led {him} away**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could indicate this in your translation, as modeled by the UST. Alternate translation: “commanded the guards to bind Jesus and then the guards bound him and led him away”
15:1	v2yf			παρέδωκαν Πειλάτῳ	1	Alternate translation: “delivered him over to Pilate” or “transferred control of Jesus to Pilate”
15:2	kn7i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	ἀποκριθεὶς αὐτῷ λέγει	1	Together the two words **answering** and **says** mean that Jesus responded to what Pilate asked him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent idiom or use plain language. Alternate translation: “responding to him, says”
15:2	dh6n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	σὺ λέγεις	1	**You say so** is an idiom. Jesus is using it to acknowledge that what Pilate has said is true. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent idiom or use plain language. Alternate translation: “Yes, it is as you say”
15:3	b9sj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background	καὶ κατηγόρουν αὐτοῦ οἱ ἀρχιερεῖς πολλά	1	Mark is providing this background information to help readers understand what happens next. Use a natural way in your language for introducing background information. Alternate translation: “Now the chief priests were accusing Jesus of many things”
15:3	ue18			κατηγόρουν αὐτοῦ & πολλά	1	Alternate translation: “were accusing Jesus of many things” or “were saying that Jesus had done many wrong things”
15:4	s2as			οὐκ ἀποκρίνῃ οὐδέν?	1	Alternate translation: “Are you not going to respond to anything they have said?”
15:5	way9			ὁ δὲ Ἰησοῦς οὐκέτι οὐδὲν ἀπεκρίθη	1	Alternate translation: “But Jesus made no further reply”
15:6	ul19		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	κατὰ δὲ ἑορτὴν, ἀπέλυεν αὐτοῖς ἕνα δέσμιον, ὃν παρῃτοῦντο	1	The word **Now** is used here to mark a break in the main story line as Mark shifts to telling background information about Pilate’s tradition of releasing a prisoner at feasts. Mark is providing background information in this verse to help readers understand what happens next. Use a natural way in your language for introducing background information. Alternate translation: “It was Pilate’s custom to release to them a prisoner of their choice during the festival”
15:7	pdy3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	δὲ	1	The word **Now** is used here to mark a continuation of the break in the main story line which began in the preceding verse. Mark introduces more background information, this time about Barabbas, to help readers understand what happens next. Use a natural way in your language for introducing background information. Alternate translation: “And”
15:7	lx8n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	λεγόμενος	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “who bore the name”
15:7	wvzq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	δεδεμένος	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Mark implies that “the Roman authorities” had soldiers do it. Alternate translation: “whom the Roman soldiers tied up and put”
15:7	iofn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	φόνον πεποιήκεισαν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **murder**, you can express the same idea with a verbal form, as modeled by the UST.
15:8	a4xb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	ἀναβὰς	1	Your language may say “having gone up” rather than **having come up** in contexts such as this. Use whichever is more natural. Alternate translation: “having gone up”
15:9	o3j4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	ἀπεκρίθη αὐτοῖς λέγων	1	When translating the phrase **answered them, saying** see how you translated the similar phrase “answering him, says” in [15:2](../15/02.md). Alternate translation: “responded to them”
15:10	i4ib		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	ἐγίνωσκεν γὰρ ὅτι διὰ φθόνον παραδεδώκεισαν αὐτὸν οἱ ἀρχιερεῖς	1	Mark provides this background information about why Jesus was **handed over** in order to help readers understand why Pilate asked the question in [15:9](../15/09.md). Mark introduces the background information in this verse with the word **For**. Use the natural form in your language for expressing background information.
15:10	u647		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	διὰ φθόνον παραδεδώκεισαν αὐτὸν οἱ ἀρχιερεῖς	1	The **chief priests** envied Jesus because so many people were following him and becoming his disciples. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express that explicitly. If you decide to express this information explicitly, consider beginning a new sentence. Alternate translation: “the chief priests were envious of Jesus because so many people were becoming his disciples. Pilate knew that this was why they had handed him over” or “the chief priests were envious of Jesus’ popularity among the people. This is why they had handed him over”
15:10	yjp3			παραδεδώκεισαν αὐτὸν	1	Alternate translation: “had handed Jesus over”
15:11	y5w3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἀνέσεισαν τὸν ὄχλον	1	Mark speaks of the **chief priests** as if they had **stirred** a pot and put into motion things that had been lying quietly on the bottom. Mark means that the **chief priests** encouraged the crowd to ask Pilate to release Barabbas. If your readers would not understand what **stirred up** means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “encouraged the crowd” or “incited the crowd”
15:11	pvu6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	ἵνα	1	The phrase **so that** introduces what the **chief priests stirred up the crowd** to request of Pilate. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a purpose clause. Alternate translation: “in order that”

15:12	p94y			πάλιν	1	Mark uses the word **again** here because Pilate had already spoken to them regarding this matter in [15:9](../15/09.md). Use a natural form in your language for expressing the meaning of **again** as it is used here.
15:12	vlm3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τί οὖν ποιήσω λέγετε τὸν Βασιλέα τῶν Ἰουδαίων?	1	Pilate uses the word **therefore** because, as [15:11](../15/11.md) indicates, the chief priests had “stirred up the crowd” to request that Pilate “release Barabbas” to them. So Pilate is asking what he should **therefore** do with Jesus if Barabbas is the prisoner to be released at their request. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express that explicitly. Alternate translation: “If I release Barabbas, what then should I do with the one you call the King of the Jews”
15:12	r7ge			οὖν	1	Alternate translation: “then”
15:13	n6jb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	σταύρωσον αὐτόν	1	The Romans executed some criminals by nailing them to a wooden beam with a crossbar and setting the beam upright so that the criminals would slowly suffocate. That was what it meant to **Crucify** someone. Alternate translation: “Nail him to a cross! Execute him!”
15:13	nwms		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	σταύρωσον αὐτόν	1	Here, the word **Crucify** is an imperative, but since the crowd cannot command Pilate to do this, you could translate the phrase **Crucify him** as an expression of what they want. Alternate translation: “We want you to nail him to a cross to execute him”
15:14	e55i			σταύρωσον αὐτόν	1	See how you translated the phrase **Crucify him** in [15:13](../15/13.md).
15:15	qt8y			τῷ ὄχλῳ τὸ ἱκανὸν ποιῆσαι	1	Alternate translation: “to make the crowd happy by doing what they wanted him to do”
15:15	fwg6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὸν Ἰησοῦν φραγελλώσας	1	Mark assumes that his readers will know that Pilate did not actually flog **Jesus**, and he assumes his readers will know that Pilate ordered his soldiers to do it. If it would be helpful in your language, you could indicate that explicitly, as modeled by the UST.
15:15	yzn5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	φραγελλώσας	1	If your readers would not be familiar with this form of punishment, you could explain explicitly what flogging was. Flogging was a Roman penalty in which they whipped a person with a whip to which were attached pieces of bone and metal to increase the whip’s capacity to do harm to the person being flogged. Alternate translation: “having whipped Jesus with a whip with pieces of bone and metal attached to it” or “having whipped Jesus with a whip to which was attached pieces of bone and metal”
15:15	w1sl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	καὶ παρέδωκεν τὸν Ἰησοῦν φραγελλώσας, ἵνα σταυρωθῇ	1	The phrase **so that** introduces a purpose clause. With the phrase **so that he might be crucified**, Mark is stating the purpose for which Pilate** handed over Jesus**. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a purpose clause. Alternate translation: “and after having Jesus flogged, he handed Jesus over to them in order that they might crucify him”
15:15	r9id		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	σταυρωθῇ	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Mark implies that Pilate’s “soldiers” did it. Alternate translation: “his soldiers might take him away and crucify him”
15:16	eg6x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	ὅ ἐστιν πραιτώριον	1	By clarifying **(that is, the Praetorium)**, Mark explains that **the palace** is the official residence of the Roman governor. This background information is given to help his readers understand exactly what he means by using the word **palace**. Use the natural form in your language for expressing background information. Alternate translation: “which is, the Praetorium”
15:16	lb2x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πραιτώριον	1	The **Praetorium** was where the Roman governor stayed when he was in Jerusalem and where the soldiers in Jerusalem lived. Mark assumes that his readers will know what the **Praetorium** is. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express that explicitly. Alternate translation: “the palace where the governor and his soldiers lived” or “the Roman governor’s residence”
15:16	b5gs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὅλην τὴν σπεῖραν	1	Mark assumes that his readers will know that a **cohort** was a unit of Roman soldiers. A **cohort** normally numbered around 600 men but could sometimes refer to a number as small as 200 men. Here, by saying **the whole cohort**, Mark most likely means all the soldiers from the **cohort** who were on duty at that time. If it would be helpful in your language, you could indicate explicitly that a **cohort** was a unit of Roman soldiers. Additionally, you could also say explicitly that it was only the soldiers who were on duty who were called together, as modeled by the UST. Alternate translation: “the whole unit of soldiers” or “the whole unit of soldiers who were on duty there”
15:17	tn33		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐνδιδύσκουσιν αὐτὸν πορφύραν, καὶ περιτιθέασιν αὐτῷ πλέξαντες ἀκάνθινον στέφανον	1	In Roman culture, a **purple robe** and a **crown** were worn by kings. The soldiers put a **crown** made from **thorns** and a **purple robe** on Jesus in order to mock him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning explicitly. It may be helpful to your readers to make this a separate sentence. Alternate translation: “they put a purple robe on him and placed on his head a crown that they had made by twisting thorns together. They did these things in order to mock him by pretending that they believed he really was a king”
15:17	ly5a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	πορφύραν	1	The word **purple** denotes a color. If your readers would be unfamiliar with the color **purple**, you could use the closest equivalent color that your readers would be familiar with such as “crimson” or “scarlet” (“crimson” and “scarlet” are two different names for the same color) since Matthew records in [Matt 27:28](../mat/27/28.md) that the color of the robe was “scarlet.” The fact that Matthew and Mark use a different color to describe the color of the same robe probably means that its color closely resembled both “scarlet” and **purple**. If your readers would be unfamiliar with these colors, you could use the closest equivalent color that they would be familiar with, such as “red” or “dark red.” Alternate translation: “dark red” or “red” or “crimson” or “scarlet”
15:17	xfk8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	πλέξαντες ἀκάνθινον στέφανον	1	Mark uses the word **thorns** to refer to small branches with **thorns** on them.

15:18	ft1j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony	ἀσπάζεσθαι αὐτόν, Χαῖρε, Βασιλεῦ τῶν Ἰουδαίων	1	The word **Hail** was a common greeting, but the soldiers used this greeting in order to mock Jesus. They did not believe that Jesus was really the **King of the Jews**. They actually meant to communicate the opposite of the literal meaning of their words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could provide a brief explanation. Alternate translation: “to salute him by saying in a mocking manner: ‘Hail, King of the Jews’”
15:19	gz3b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony	καλάμῳ, καὶ	1	Matthew records in [Matt 27:19](../mat/27/19.md) that the soldiers placed a **reed** in Jesus’ “right hand” and that “they mocked him” by saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!” At this time in history, kings used scepters. The **reed** would have resembled a scepter, so the soldiers are using a **reed** here to mock Jesus. If it would be helpful in your language, you could provide a brief explanation. Alternate translation: “with a reed that they were using as a pretend scepter, and they were”
15:19	muvw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	ἐνέπτυον αὐτῷ	1	In this culture, the action of **spitting on** a person was a way to show thorough disgust. It expressed strong contempt for someone. If your readers would not understand the meaning of **spitting on** someone in this context and there is a gesture with a similar meaning in your culture, you could use it here in place of this action.
15:19	a8a9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony	τιθέντες τὰ γόνατα, προσεκύνουν αὐτῷ	1	The acts of **bending the knee** and **bowing down** were things normally done as a way of honoring kings. The soldiers actually mean to communicate the opposite of the literal meaning of their actions. These soldiers do not really believe that Jesus is a king, but rather, they are doing these things to express mockery. If it would be helpful in your language, you could provide a brief explanation. Also see the discussion about this idea in the General Notes for this chapter. Alternate translation: “bending the knee, they were bowing down to him in order to mock him”

Mark used Greek letters to express the sound of this Aramaic word so that his readers would know how it sounded, and then he told them that it meant **Place of a Skull**. In your translation you could spell it the way it sounds in your language and then explain its meaning.
15:22	e49p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	Γολγοθᾶν & Κρανίου Τόπος	1	Matthew says in [Matt 27:33](../mat/27/33.md) that **Golgotha** was “a place called Golgotha,” so it is clear that this was the name of a location, but the reason why this place was called **Place of a Skull** is not known. It could have been called **Place of a Skull** because the appearance of this place resembled a skull or because it was the site of so many executions, in which case the name **Skull** is being used as metonymy to refer to death. Because the reason that this location was called **Place of a Skull** is unknown, you should translate this phrase in a way that allows for either meaning, as modeled by the ULT and UST.

15:24	s5m6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	βάλλοντες κλῆρον ἐπ’ αὐτὰ	1	The term **lots** refers to objects with different markings on various sides that were used to decide randomly among several possibilities. They were tossed onto the ground to see which marked side would come up on top. If your readers would not be familiar with **lots**, you could state that they were “something like dice,” as UST does. But if your readers would also not be familiar with dice, then you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “and the Roman soldiers gambled for them”
15:24	mn6x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	τίς τί ἄρῃ	1	Mark is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete.

Here the phrase **the third hour** refers to **the third hour** of the day, which was approximately three hours after sunrise. Here, **third** is an ordinal number. If your language does not use ordinal numbers, you can translate the phrase **the third hour** as “nine o’clock in the morning”, as modeled by the UST, since this is what time the phrase **the third hour** is referring to. Alternately, you can express the meaning of the phrase **the third hour** in some other way that is natural in your culture. Alternate translation: “nine o’clock in the morning”

If your readers would not understand what it means to shake one’s head at someone in this context and there is a gesture with a similar meaning in your culture, you could consider using it here in your translation.
15:29	a7ft		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	οὐὰ	1	**Aha** is an exclamation word that communicates triumph, usually over an enemy. Use an exclamation that is natural in your language for communicating this. Alternate translation: “Take that!”

15:31	o9qv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἄλλους ἔσωσεν	1	In context, the Jewish leaders are implicitly referring to how Jesus **saved others** by healing their diseases, releasing them from demon-possession, and helping saving them from other physical problems. They did not think that Jesus saved them from sin or divine judgment. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state that explicitly.

They do not really believe that Jesus is **the Christ, the King of Israel**. If it would be helpful in your language, consider expressing the meaning plainly.

Jesus is quoting from [Psalm 22:1](../psa/22/01.md). Mark uses Greek letters to express the sounds of this Aramaic phrase so that his readers would know how it sounded, and then he told them that it meant **My God, my God, why have you forsaken me**.

You would then present the combined verses as 40–41, as modeled by the UST.
15:40	zc9b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	Μαριὰμ ἡ Μαγδαληνὴ & Μαρία ἡ Ἰακώβου τοῦ μικροῦ καὶ Ἰωσῆ μήτηρ	1	Because **Mary** was a very common name at this time and because Mark refers to two different women with the name **Mary** in this verse, he provides this background information to help readers know to which **Mary** he is referring in each case. Use the natural form in your language for expressing background information.

God commanded in Deuteronomy 21:22–23 that any person who was put to death by hanging on a wooden object should be buried on the same day that they were put to death. Because of this and the fact that **evening had already come** and because the following day was the **Sabbath**, on which Jews did not work, the people involved wanted to bury Jesus’ body quickly.

16:intro	j5yz				0	# Mark 16 General Notes\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### The tomb\n\nThe tomb in which Jesus was buried ([Mark 15:46](../mrk/15/46.md)) was the kind of tomb in which wealthy Jewish families buried their dead. It was an actual room cut into a rock. It had a flat place on one side where they could place the body after they had put oil and spices on it and wrapped it in cloth. Then they would roll a large rock in front of the tomb so no one could see inside or enter.\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### A young man dressed in a white robe\n\nMatthew, Mark, Luke, and John all wrote about angels in white clothing with the women at Jesus’ tomb. Two of the authors called them men, but that is only because the angels were in human form. Two of the authors wrote about two angels, but the other two authors wrote about only one of them. It is best to translate each of these passages as it appears in the ULT without trying to make the passages all say exactly the same thing. (See: [Matthew 28:1–2](../mat/28/01.md) and [Mark 16:5](../mrk/16/05.md) and [Luke 24:4](../luk/24/04.md) and [John 20:12](../jhn/20/12.md))
16:1	p61n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	διαγενομένου τοῦ Σαββάτου	1	By using the phrase **the Sabbath having passed**, Mark is explaining that the Jewish day of rest, called the **Sabbath**, had ended and that it was now permissible, according to Jewish law, for these women to buy spices. The phrase **the Sabbath having passed** does not mean that the actual day on which the **Sabbath** occurred was over. The Jewish **Sabbath** ended at sunset on Saturday evening. If it would be helpful in your language, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “when the sun had set on Saturday evening”
16:1	cw1b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	ἡ Μαρία ἡ Μαγδαληνὴ	1	# Connecting Statement:\n\nSee how you translated **Mary Magdalene** in [15:40](../15/40.md).

16:1	zrcf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	ἵνα	1	The phrase **so that** introduces a purpose clause. The women **bought spices** for the purpose of anointing Jesus’ body with them. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a purpose clause. Alternate translation: “in order that”
16:2	qcmt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τῇ μιᾷ	1	Here, the word **first** refers to the “first day” of the week. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express that explicitly. Alternate translation: “on the first day”
16:4	kld9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἀποκεκύλισται ὁ λίθος	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form, as modeled by the UST, or you can translate it in another way that is natural in your language.
16:5	oaqk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	νεανίσκον	1	Here, the **young man** is actually an angel who looked like a young man. See the discussion of this under the General Notes section for this chapter.You should translate the phrase **young man** as it appears in the ULT.

16:6	ie57		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τὸν ἐσταυρωμένον	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form, as modeled by the UST, or you can translate it in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Mark implies in chapter 15 that Pilate’s “soldiers” did it. Alternate translation: “who Pilate’s soldiers crucified”
16:6	x9m8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἠγέρθη	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, it is implied that “God” did it. Alternate translation: “God raised him from the dead!” or “He has risen!”
16:7	x3u1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καὶ τῷ Πέτρῳ	1	The phrase **and Peter** is not making a distinction between **Peter** and the disciples by indicating that **Peter** is not part of the group of Jesus’ 12 **disciples**. Rather, the phrase **and Peter** is being used to emphasize that of all of the 12 disciples of Jesus, these women should take special care to tell Peter the information that follows this phrase. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express that explicitly. Alternate translation: “and especially Peter”
16:7	axgu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	Πέτρῳ, ὅτι προάγει ὑμᾶς εἰς τὴν Γαλιλαίαν; ἐκεῖ αὐτὸν ὄψεσθε, καθὼς εἶπεν ὑμῖν	1	If the direct quotation inside a direct quotation would be confusing in your language, you could translate the second direct quotation as an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: “Peter that he is going ahead of them to Galilee and that they will see him there, just as he told them”
16:8	dlji		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	ἐξελθοῦσαι	1	Your language may say “come” rather than **gone** in contexts such as this. Use whichever is more natural. Alternate translation: “having come out”
16:8	sh40		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	εἶχεν γὰρ αὐτὰς τρόμος καὶ ἔκστασις	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **amazement**, you can express the same idea with a verbal form such as “amazed.” Alternate translation: “for they were greatly amazed, and they trembled”
16:8	bdgb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	εἶχεν γὰρ αὐτὰς τρόμος καὶ ἔκστασις	1	Here, the word **gripping** is an idiom which means “overcoming.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent idiom or use plain language. Alternate translation: “for they were overcome by trembling and amazement” or “for they were overcome with trembling and amazement”
16:8	ydb0			καὶ οὐδενὶ οὐδὲν εἶπον	1	Alternate translation: “And they told no one anything”
