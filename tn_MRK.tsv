front:intro	r2f2				0	# Introduction to the Gospel of Mark\n\n## Part 1: General Introduction\n\n### Outline of the book of Mark\n\n1. Introduction (1:1–13)\n2. The ministry of Jesus in Galilee (1:14–8:26)\n      * Early ministry (1:14–3:6)\n      * Becoming more popular among the people (3:7–5:43)\n      * Moving away from Galilee and then returning (6:1–8:26)\n3. Progress toward Jerusalem; Jesus repeatedly predicts his own death; the disciples misunderstand, and Jesus teaches them how difficult it will be to follow him (8:27–10:52)\n4. Last days of ministry and preparation for final conflict in Jerusalem (11:1–13:37)\n5. The death of Christ and the empty tomb (14:1–16:8)\n\n### What is the book of Mark about?\n\nThe Gospel of Mark is one of four books in the New Testament that describe some of the life of Jesus Christ. The authors of the Gospels wrote about who Jesus was and what he did during his lifetime. Mark wrote much about how Jesus suffered and died on the cross. He did this to encourage his readers who were being persecuted. Mark also explained Jewish customs and some Aramaic words. This may indicate that Mark expected most of his first readers to be Gentiles.\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nTranslators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “The Gospel of Mark,” or “The Gospel According to Mark.” They may also choose a title that may be clearer, such as, “The Good News about Jesus that Mark Wrote.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])\n\n### Who wrote the book of Mark?\n\nThe book does not give the name of the author. However, since early Christian times, most Christians have thought that the author was Mark. Mark was also known as John Mark. He was a close friend of Peter. Mark may not have witnessed what Jesus said and did. Many experts think that Peter the Apostle was the source of what Mark wrote about Jesus.\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### What were Jesus’ teaching methods?\n\nThe people regarded Jesus as a rabbi. A rabbi is a teacher of God’s law. Jesus taught in ways similar to the ways other religious teachers in Israel. He had students who followed him wherever he went. These students were called disciples. Jesus often taught by telling parables, stories that teach moral lessons. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/disciple]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/parable]])\n\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\n\n### What are the Synoptic Gospels?\n\nThe Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke are called the Synoptic Gospels because they have many similar passages. The word “synoptic” means to “see together.”\n\nThe texts are considered “parallel” when they are the same or almost the same among two or three of the Gospels. When translating parallel passages, translators should use the same wording and make them as similar as possible.\n\n### Why does Jesus refer to himself as the “Son of Man”?\n\nIn the Gospels, Jesus calls himself the “Son of Man.” This phrase could mean a few things:\n* The phrase “son of man” can simply be describing that someone’s father is also a human being. Therefore, the person being described is literally a son of a man, a human being.\n* The phrase sometimes is a reference to Daniel 7:13–14. In this passage there is a person described as a “Son of Man.” This description tells us that the person ascending to the throne of God looked like a human being. This description is different than the first because God gives this Son of Man authority forever. Therefore, the title “Son of Man” became a title for the Messiah.\n\nTranslating the title “Son of Man” can be difficult in many languages. Readers may misunderstand a literal translation. Translators can consider alternatives, such as “The Human One.” It may also be helpful to include a footnote to explain the title.\n\n### Why does Mark frequently use terms indicating short periods of time?\n\nThe Gospel of Mark uses the word “immediately” 42 times. Mark does this to make the events more exciting and vivid. It moves the reader quickly from one event to the next.\n\n### Sabbath/Sabbaths\n\nOften in the culture of the Bible, religious festivals would be written in the plural form of the word instead of a singular form. This occurs in Mark as well. In the ULT, the word should be kept plural, “Sabbaths.” This is simply for the sake of rendering the translated text as close to the original text as possible. In the UST, Sabbaths is changed to singular, Sabbath, to make more sense of the use of the word in its context.\n\n### What are the major issues in the text of the book of Mark?\n\nSome verses found in older versions of the Bible are not included in most modern versions. Translators are advised not to include these verses. However, if there are older versions of the Bible in the translator’s region that include one or more of these verses, the translators can include them. If they are included, they should be surrounded by square brackets ([]) to indicate that they were probably not original to Mark’s Gospel.\n* “If any man has ears to hear, let him hear.” (7:16)\n* “where their worm never dies and the fire is never quenched” (9:44)\n* “where their worm never dies and the fire is never quenched” (9:46)\n* “And the scripture was fulfilled that says, ‘He was counted with the lawless ones’” (15:28)\n\nThe following passage is not found in the earliest manuscripts. Most Bibles include this passage, but modern Bibles put it in brackets ([]) or indicate in some way that this passage may not have been original to Mark’s Gospel. Translators are advised to do something similar to the modern versions of the Bible.\n* “Early on the first day of the week, after he arose, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven demons. She went and told those who were with him, while they were mourning and weeping. They heard that he was alive and that he had been seen by her, but they did not believe. After these things he appeared in a different form to two of them, as they were walking out into the country. They went and told the rest of the disciples, but they did not believe them. Jesus later appeared to the eleven as they were reclining at the table, and he rebuked them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they did not believe those who saw him after he rose from the dead. He said to them, ‘Having gone into all the world, and preach the gospel to the entire creation. The one having believed and having been baptized will be saved, and the one not having believed will be condemned. These signs will go with the ones believing: In my name they will cast out demons. They will speak in new languages. They will pick up snakes with their hands, and if they drink anything deadly, it will not hurt them. They will lay hands on the sick, and they will get well.’ After the Lord had spoken to them, he was taken up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God. The disciples left and preached everywhere, while the Lord worked with them and confirmed the word by the signs that went with them.” (16:9–20)\n\n(See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
1:intro	c6ep				0	# Mark 1 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n1. Introduction (1:1–13)\n      * Opening (1:1–3)\n      * The ministry of John the Baptist (1:4–8)\n      * Jesus is baptized and tempted (1:9–13)\n2. The ministry of Jesus in Galilee (1:14–8:26)\n      * Early ministry (1:14–3:6)\n        * Jesus calls four disciples (1:14–20)\n        * Jesus teaches and casts out a demon (1:21–28)\n        * Jesus heals Simon’s mother-in-law and many others (1:29–34)\n        * Jesus teaches and heals people throughout Galilee (1:35–39)\n        * Jesus heals a leper (1:40–45)\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in [1:2–3](../01/02.md), which is made up of quotations from [Malachi 3:1](../mal/03/01.md) and [Isaiah 40:3](../isa/40/03.md).\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Baptism\n\nThe word “baptism” refers to a ritual washing, usually with water. John’s baptism is similar to Christian baptism, but it does not mean exactly the same thing (see [Acts 18:24–26](../act/18/24.md)). Mark writes that John’s baptism is “of repentance” (see [1:4](../01/04.md)). Most likely, it symbolized the removal of the sins that people were repenting of and the beginning of a new way of living. However, even Jesus received this baptism despite the fact that he did not need to repent of any sins. In this case, the baptism may symbolize complete dedication to God. Consider how you might refer to this kind of ritual washing in your language.\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Singular and plural forms of “you”\n\nMany of the forms of “you” in this chapter appear in speeches that John the Baptist delivers to groups of people. Because of this, most forms of “you” in this chapter are plural. You should assume forms of “you” are plural unless a note specifies that the form is singular. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])\n\n### The historic present\n\nTo call attention to a development in the story, Mark uses the present tense in past narration. In this chapter, the historic present occurs in verses 12, 21, 30, 37, 38, 40, 41, and 44. If it would not be natural to do that in your language, you could use the past tense in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense]])
1:1-4	ewhd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀρχὴ τοῦ εὐαγγελίου Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ, Υἱοῦ Θεοῦ & καθὼς γέγραπται ἐν τῷ Ἠσαΐᾳ τῷ προφήτῃ: ἰδοὺ, ἀποστέλλω τὸν ἄγγελόν μου πρὸ προσώπου σου, ὃς κατασκευάσει τὴν ὁδόν σου & φωνὴ βοῶντος ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ, ἑτοιμάσατε τὴν ὁδὸν Κυρίου, εὐθείας ποιεῖτε τὰς τρίβους αὐτοῦ & ἐγένετο Ἰωάννης	1	Here, the phrase **Just as it is written in Isaiah the prophet** and the quotation that follows could go with: (1) verse 1: **The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God**. In this case, Mark means that the**gospel** had its **beginning** just as Isaiah prophesied. Alternate translation: “The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, happened just as it is written in Isaiah the prophet, “Behold, I am sending my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way; a voice crying out in the wilderness, ‘Make ready the way of the Lord; make his paths straight.’” And so John came” (2) verse 4: **John came**. In this case, Mark means that **John came** as Isaiah had prophesied. Alternate translation: “This is the beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. Just as it is written in Isaiah the prophet, “Behold, I am sending my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way; a voice crying out in the wilderness, ‘Make ready the way of the Lord; make his paths straight,’” John came”
1:1	ybv6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἀρχὴ τοῦ εὐαγγελίου	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **beginning**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “Here begins the gospel”
1:1	kpq1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τοῦ εὐαγγελίου Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	Here, Mark is using the possessive form to describe a **gospel** that is about **Jesus Christ**. If this is not clear in your language, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: “of the gospel concerning Jesus Christ”
1:1	i3bc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	Υἱοῦ Θεοῦ	1	**Son of God** is an important title for Jesus that describes his relationship with God the Father.
1:1	et9o		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	Υἱοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Many ancient manuscripts include the phrase **the Son of God**. The ULT follows that reading. A few ancient manuscripts do not include these words. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of the ULT.
1:2	e3by		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	καθὼς γέγραπται ἐν τῷ Ἠσαΐᾳ τῷ προφήτῃ	1	In Mark’s culture, **Just as it has been written in Isaiah the prophet** is a normal way to introduce quotations from important texts, in this case, the Old Testament books written by the prophet Malachi and by **Isaiah the prophet** (see [Malachi 3:1](../mal/03/01.md) and [Isaiah 40:3](../isa/40/03.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase that indicates that Mark is quoting from important texts. Alternate translation: “Just as you can read in what Isaiah the prophet wrote” or “Just as it says in the Scriptures connected with Isaiah the prophet”\n
1:2	fc4t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	καθὼς γέγραπται ἐν τῷ Ἠσαΐᾳ τῷ προφήτῃ	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “Just as Isaiah the prophet wrote”
1:2	z8b7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐν τῷ Ἠσαΐᾳ τῷ προφήτῃ	1	Here, **Isaiah the prophet** represents the book written by Isaiah. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your language or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “in the scroll of Isaiah the prophet”
1:2	br10		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	ἰδοὺ	1	Here, the word **Behold** draws the attention of the audience and asks them to listen carefully. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express **Behold** with a word or phrase that asks the audience to listen, or you could draw the audience’s attention in another way. Alternate translation: “See” or “Pay attention”
1:2	gu7i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	πρὸ προσώπου σου	1	Here, the phrase **before your face** means before or in front of the person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “in front of you” or “before I send you”
1:2	kl12		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	κατασκευάσει τὴν ὁδόν σου	1	Here the author of the quotation speaks of helping people to get ready for the coming of the Messiah as if it were preparing the **way** or road for the Messiah. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable figure of speech or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “will help people get ready for you to arrive”
1:3	cf0e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	φωνὴ βοῶντος	1	The author of the quotation is using **voice** to represent a person speaking.

1:3	lkm3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	βοῶντος ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ,	1	Consider natural ways of introducing direct quotations in your language. Alternate translation: “of one calling out in the wilderness and saying” or “of one calling out in the wilderness, declaring”
1:3	dqi9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ, ἑτοιμάσατε τὴν ὁδὸν Κυρίου, εὐθείας ποιεῖτε τὰς τρίβους αὐτοῦ	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. If you do, you will need to delete the single quotation mark at the end of this quotation. Alternate translation: “the wilderness that people must make ready the way of the Lord, that they must make his paths straight”
1:3	v3n3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	ἑτοιμάσατε τὴν ὁδὸν Κυρίου, εὐθείας ποιεῖτε τὰς τρίβους αὐτοῦ	1	These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if it would be helpful to your readers, you could connect the phrases with a connecting word in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: “Make ready the way of the Lord, yes, make his paths straight”
1:3	peh5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἑτοιμάσατε τὴν ὁδὸν Κυρίου, εὐθείας ποιεῖτε τὰς τρίβους αὐτοῦ	1	Here the author of the quotation speaks as if people should build or maintain roads for **the Lord** to travel on as he comes to visit his people. He means that people need to be living and acting in proper ways when **the Lord** appears to his people.

Alternate translation: “Live and behave in a way that pleases God, as if you were making a road ready for him to travel on”
1:3	tz2g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	ἑτοιμάσατε & ποιεῖτε	1	Because the person who is **crying out** is speaking to many people, the commands **Make ready** and **make** are plural.
1:4	pmse		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐγένετο Ἰωάννης, ὁ βαπτίζων ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ, καὶ κηρύσσων	1	Here, the phrase translated **the one baptizing** could be: (1) a description of what John did, in parallel with the word **preaching**. Alternate translation: “John came. He was baptizing in the wilderness and preaching” (2) a title (“the Baptist”) that people called **John**. Alternate translation: “John the Baptist came in the wilderness, preaching”
1:4	je3t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	ἐγένετο Ἰωάννης	1	This phrase introduces a new character into the story. If your language has an expression of its own that serves this purpose, you could use it here. Alternate translation: “There was a man named John” or “A man called John appeared”
1:4	q9np		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	κηρύσσων βάπτισμα μετανοίας εἰς ἄφεσιν ἁμαρτιῶν	1	It may be more natural in your language to have a direct quotation here. Alternate translation: “preaching, ‘Receive a baptism of repentance for forgiveness of sins.’”
1:4	s05n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	κηρύσσων βάπτισμα μετανοίας	1	Here Mark implies that John was **preaching** that people should undergo **a baptism of repentance**.

Alternate translation: “preaching that people should receive a baptism of repentance” or “preaching that people should ask to receive a baptism of repentance”
1:4	dtqv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	βάπτισμα μετανοίας εἰς ἄφεσιν ἁμαρτιῶν	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **repentance** and **forgiveness**, you could express the same ideas in another way. Alternate translation: “that people should be baptized to show that they had repented, so that their sins would be forgiven”\n
1:4	vz74		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	βάπτισμα μετανοίας	1	Here, Mark is using the possessive form to describe a **baptism** that shows or expresses **repentance**. If this is not clear in your language, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: “a baptism that expresses repentance” or “a baptism that demonstrates repentance”
1:4	p86z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	εἰς ἄφεσιν ἁμαρτιῶν	1	Here, the phrase **for the forgiveness of sins** indicates the goal of the **baptism of repentance**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different word or phrase that indicates the goal of an action. Alternate translation: “that would lead to forgiveness of sins”
1:5	cf75		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	πᾶσα ἡ Ἰουδαία χώρα καὶ οἱ Ἱεροσολυμεῖται πάντες	1	Mark twice writes **all** as a generalization for emphasis.

If it would be helpful in your language, you could rearrange the elements so that these events are in sequential order, or you could use another form to indicate the sequence. Alternate translation: “confessing their sins, they were being baptized by him in the Jordan River” or “were being baptized by him in the Jordan River after they confessed their sins”
1:5	h8h7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐβαπτίζοντο ὑπ’ αὐτοῦ	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “he was baptizing them”
1:5	yezj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐξομολογούμενοι	1	Here it is the people who are **confessing**, not John. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “as they confessed”
1:6	n3rk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	καὶ & ὁ Ἰωάννης	1	Here Mark uses the word **And** to introduce background information that will help readers understand what happens next.

Alternate translation: “Concerning this John, he”
1:6	kyy3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἦν & ἐνδεδυμένος	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “clothed himself with”
1:6	j141		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἦν & ἐνδεδυμένος τρίχας καμήλου	1	Here Mark implies that John wore clothes made from **camel hair**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “wore clothing made from the hair of camels”
1:6	h518		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ζώνην δερματίνην	1	A **leather belt** is a thin strap made out of animal skin that holds clothing in place. If your readers would not be familiar with this type of clothing, you could use the name of something similar in your area or you could use a more general term. Alternate translation: “an animal skin strap” or “a band made from animal skin”
1:7	p7tl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	λέγων	1	Consider natural ways of introducing direct quotations in your language. Alternate translation: “and he said”
1:7	bk1j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἔρχεται & ὀπίσω μου	1	Here John speaks as if someone is walking behind him. He means that soon someone will continue what he has started doing.

Alternate translation: “I am not worthy to be the slave who, stooping down, unties the strap of his sandals” or “I am not worthy to act as his slave”
1:7	lyjx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	ἱκανὸς, κύψας λῦσαι	1	The expression **stooping down** contains extra information that would be unnatural to express in some languages. If this is true of your language, you could shorten the expression. Alternate translation: “worthy to untie”
1:7	nnbj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	λῦσαι τὸν ἱμάντα τῶν ὑποδημάτων αὐτοῦ	1	In Jesus’ culture, people wore **sandals** on their feet by tying them on with a **strap**. To take off the **sandals**, someone had to **untie the strap**.

Alternate translation: “to help him remove his sandals by untying the strap” or “to remove his sandals”
1:8	rtdf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense	ἐβάπτισα	1	Here John could be using the past tense: (1) to refer generally to how he baptizes people. Alternate translation: “always baptize” (2) to refer specifically to how he just baptized some people. Alternate translation: “I have baptized”

If possible, preserve the baptism metaphor or express the idea in simile form. Alternate translation: “but he will baptize you, as it were, with the Holy Spirit” or “and he also will perform something like baptism, but he will use the Holy Spirit”
1:8	r1j9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	δὲ	1	Here, the word **but** introduces what the one coming after John will use for baptism in contrast to what John uses. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different word or phrase that introduces a contrast. Alternate translation: “and, in contrast,”
1:9	u65k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	καὶ ἐγένετο	1	The phrase **And it happened that** marks the beginning of a new event in the story. Use a natural form in your language for introducing a new event. Alternate translation: “Then,” or “Next,”
1:9	arc9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐν ἐκείναις ταῖς ἡμέραις	1	Here, Matthew uses the term **days** to refer to a particular period of time.

1:9	gi39		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐβαπτίσθη & ὑπὸ Ἰωάννου	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “John baptized him”
1:10	stwh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	εὐθὺς ἀναβαίνων ἐκ τοῦ ὕδατος, εἶδεν	1	Here, the word **immediately** indicates that as soon as John baptized Jesus, Jesus **saw the heavens being split open** as he was **coming up out of the water**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “right away, as he was coming up out of the water, he saw”
1:10	jeof		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀναβαίνων ἐκ τοῦ ὕδατος	1	Here Mark implies that Jesus was in the Jordan River when he was baptized. Afterwards, he came up out of the river.

1:31	bzd2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-events	ἤγειρεν αὐτὴν, κρατήσας τῆς χειρός	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these clauses, since the second clause describes what Jesus did before what the first clause describes.

Alternate translation: “because the demons knew him, he was not permitting them to speak”
1:34	m04o		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ᾔδεισαν αὐτόν	1	Here Mark implies that the **demons** knew that Jesus was the Christ, the Son of God. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “they knew who he really was” or “they knew that he was the Christ”
1:35	mffz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πρωῒ ἔννυχα λείαν	1	Here Mark is referring to a time early in morning before the sun rose. Consider how you might naturally refer to this time period in your language. Alternate translation: “early the next day, before dawn”

1:36	emic		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	κατεδίωξεν	1	Here Mark speaks as if **Simon and the ones with him** were hunting Jesus down or trying to capture him. He uses the word **pursued** as an overstatement to emphasize how urgently they were looking for Jesus. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different way to express the emphasis. Alternate translation: “looked everywhere” or “diligently looked”
1:37	p2s3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πάντες ζητοῦσίν σε	1	Here the disciples imply that they think that Jesus should come back with them to **All** the people who are **seeking** him.

1:37	vgc7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	πάντες	1	Simon and those with him say **All** here as an overstatement for emphasis. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different way to express the emphasis. Alternate translation: “Very many”
1:38	tzvb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ἄγωμεν ἀλλαχοῦ εἰς τὰς ἐχομένας κωμοπόλεις, ἵνα καὶ ἐκεῖ κηρύξω; εἰς τοῦτο γὰρ ἐξῆλθον	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these clauses, since the last clause gives the reason for the result that the first clauses describe. Alternate translation: “Because I went out to preach in many places, let us go elsewhere, into the surrounding towns, so that I may preach there also”
1:38	plm9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἄγωμεν ἀλλαχοῦ	1	Here Jesus implies that he will not go back to Capernaum to meet all the people who were looking for him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “Instead of going back to Capernaum, let us go elsewhere”
1:38	z53z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	ἐξῆλθον	1	Here Jesus does not start where he **went out** from. He may be referring to how he left Capernaum, or he may be referring to how he came to the world as a human being, or he may be implying to both of these meanings.

1:38	lz0f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	ἐξῆλθον	1	In a context such as this, your language might say “came” instead of **went**. Alternate translation: “I came out”
1:38	jh2z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	εἰς τοῦτο	1	The pronoun **this** refers to Jesus preaching in **the surrounding towns**.

1:40	kq50		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	γονυπετῶν	1	In the this man’s culture, **kneeling down** before a person was a way to honor a greater person.

Alternate translation: “prostrating himself before him” or “bowing down to him in respect”
1:40	mwv9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative	δύνασαί με καθαρίσαι	1	The man is using this statement to make a request. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in request form. Alternate translation: “please make me clean”
1:40	uotm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	με καθαρίσαι	1	The man talks about becoming **clean** ceremonially, but it is implicit that he has become unclean because of his leprosy, so he is primarily asking Jesus to heal him of this disease. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “to heal my disease”
1:41	l9jg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	σπλαγχνισθεὶς	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **compassion**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “having sympathized with him”
1:41	jz24		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	σπλαγχνισθεὶς	1	Many ancient manuscripts read **having had compassion**. The ULT follows that reading. A few ancient manuscripts read “having become angry.” If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of the ULT.
1:41	qjz4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	θέλω	1	Here Jesus implies that he is **willing** to cleanse or heal the man. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “I am willing to cleanse you”
1:42	lc7b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	ἀπῆλθεν ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ ἡ λέπρα	1	Here, Mark speaks of the man’s **leprosy** as if it were a person who **departed from him**. He means that the man no longer had **leprosy**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “his leprosy was gone” or “he was no longer a leper”
1:42	lkks		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐκαθερίσθη	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who did the action, it is clear from the context that it was Jesus. Alternate translation: “he was clean” or “Jesus had made him clean”
1:43-44	iw7t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-events	καὶ ἐμβριμησάμενος αὐτῷ, εὐθὺς ἐξέβαλεν αὐτόν & καὶ λέγει αὐτῷ, ὅρα μηδενὶ, μηδὲν εἴπῃς; ἀλλὰ ὕπαγε, σεαυτὸν δεῖξον τῷ ἱερεῖ, καὶ προσένεγκε περὶ τοῦ καθαρισμοῦ σου ἃ προσέταξεν Μωϋσῆς, εἰς μαρτύριον αὐτοῖς	1	Jesus **strictly warned** the man using the words recorded in [1:44](../01/44.md) before he **sent him away**. It might be helpful to make it clear that Jesus **strictly warned** the man before he **sent him away**. Alternate translation: “While he was immediately sending him away, he strictly warned him by saying to him, ‘See that you say nothing to anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing what Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.’” or “He immediately sent him away. Before he went, Jesus strictly warned him, saying to him, ‘See that you say nothing to anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing what Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.’”
1:44	xc4d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	μηδενὶ, μηδὲν εἴπῃς	1	The implication is that the man is not to tell **anyone** that Jesus healed him. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “you tell no one that I healed you”
1:44	k2e0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	μηδενὶ, μηδὲν εἴπῃς	1	The words translated **nothing** and **anyone** are two negative words. In this construction, the second negative does not cancel the first to create a positive meaning. Instead, it gives greater emphasis to the negative. If your language can use two negatives that do not cancel one another to create a positive meaning, you could use a double negative here. If your language does not use two negatives in that way, you could translate with one strong negative, as the ULT does. Alternate translation: “you certainly do not say anything to anyone”
1:44	xhu8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	σεαυτὸν δεῖξον τῷ ἱερεῖ	1	Jesus told the man to **show** himself **to the priest** so that the priest could look at his skin to see if his leprosy was really gone. The law of Moses required people to present themselves to the priest for inspection if they had been unclean but were now clean. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “ask to be inspected by the priest” or “let yourself be examined by the priest”
1:44	he7v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	προσένεγκε περὶ τοῦ καθαρισμοῦ σου ἃ προσέταξεν Μωϋσῆς	1	Jesus assumes that the man will know that the law required a person who had been healed from a skin disease to make a specific sacrifice. This made the person ceremonially clean and they could participate once again in community religious activities. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “offer the sacrifice that Moses commanded so that you could become ceremonially clean once again”
1:44	w6b2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	εἰς μαρτύριον αὐτοῖς	1	Here Jesus means that the man should show himself to the priest and offer the gift to prove or provide **testimony** that he had been healed. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “for a testimony to them that you have been cleansed”
1:44	plof		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	εἰς μαρτύριον αὐτοῖς	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **testimony**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “so that it testifies to them”
1:44	a6tj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	αὐτοῖς	1	The pronoun **them** could refer to: (1) Jewish people in general. Alternate translation: “to people” (2) the priests specifically. Alternate translation: “to the priests”
1:45	yjjc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	ἐξελθὼν	1	In a context such as this, your language might say “come” instead of **gone**. Alternate translation: “having come out”
1:45	i91a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	κηρύσσειν πολλὰ καὶ διαφημίζειν τὸν λόγον	1	The phrases **to proclaim often** and **to report the word** mean similar things. Mark is using the two phrases together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single clause. Alternate translation: “to proclaim the word often” or “to report the word often”
1:45	ov5c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τὸν λόγον	1	Here, **word** represents what the man said about how Jesus healed him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your language or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “what Jesus had done for him”
1:45	b9n2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὥστε μηκέτι αὐτὸν δύνασθαι φανερῶς εἰς πόλιν εἰσελθεῖν	1	Here Mark implies that Jesus **was able no longer to enter into a town openly** because people who had heard about him would crowd around him so much. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “so that, because so many people would crowd around him, he was able no longer to enter into a town openly”
1:45	tq0w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	ἤρχοντο	1	In a context such as this, your language might say “going” instead of **coming**. Alternate translation: “they were going”
1:45	z363		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	πάντοθεν	1	The phrase **from all sides** is an overstatement for emphasis. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different way to express the emphasis. Alternate translation: “from all over the region” or “from very many places”
2:intro	zhb5				0	# Mark 2 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n2. The ministry of Jesus in Galilee (1:14–8:26)\n      * Early ministry (1:14–3:6)\n        * Jesus heals a paralytic (2:1–12)\n        * Jesus calls Levi and dines at his house (2:13–17)\n        * Jesus brings something new (2:18–22)\n        * Picking heads of grain on the Sabbath (2:22–28)\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### “Sinners”\n\nWhen Mark uses the word “sinners,” he is describing a group of people whom many Jewish religious groups would have considered to be living in ways that were improper for those who were part of God’s people. Some of these people may have committed significant sins, while others may have disagreed with many of the Jewish religious groups about how Jews could properly behave. If possible, use a word or phrase that identifies people who are not living as many religious groups think that people should live. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])\n\n### Fasting and feasting\n\nIn Jesus’ culture, people would “fast,” or abstain from eating for a period of time, in order to honor God or to repent of their sins. They would “feast,” or eat a lot of food, when they were celebrating some important event, such as a wedding. Consider how you will refer to these behaviors in [2:15–22](../02/15.md), in which Jesus feasts and teaches about why he and his disciples do not fast. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/fast]])\n\n### The Sabbath\n\nIn the law that God gave to Moses, God commanded the Israelites to rest on the seventh day, which was called the Sabbath. The Jewish religious leaders disagreed with each other about what kinds of things a person could do on the Sabbath and still rest as God had commanded. In [2:22–28](../02/22.md), the Pharisees and Jesus engage in these kinds of debates about the Sabbath. Jesus disagrees with how the Pharisees understand the Sabbath, and he argues for a different view. If your readers may not understand what the Sabbath is and why Jesus and the Pharisees are debating about it, you may need to include some information in a footnote. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sabbath]])\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### The short parables in [2:19–22](../02/19.md)\n\nIn these verses, Jesus gives three short parables that emphasize how certain things do not go well together. Fasting does not happen during a wedding celebration. An unshrunk piece of cloth does not make a good patch for an old garment. Old wineskins do not make good containers for fresh wine that still needs to ferment. Jesus tells these parables to illustrate how his ministry and preaching do not match well with how people had previously done things. In other words, Jesus wants people to expect what he does to be new, and this may require thinking and doing many new things. You should preserve these parables, since they are not direct metaphors. If necessary, you could introduce them in such a way that your readers recognize that they are parables or illustrations. See the notes on each verse for possible translation options. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Singular and plural forms of “you”\n\nMany of the forms of “you” in this chapter appear in dialogues between Jesus and other individuals. Because of this, most forms of “you” in this chapter are singular. You should assume forms of “you” are singular unless a note specifies that the form is plural. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])\n\n### The historic present\n\nTo call attention to a development in the story, Mark uses the present tense in past narration. In this chapter, the historic present occurs in verses 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 12, 14, 17, 18, 25. If it would not be natural to do that in your language, you could use the past tense in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense]])
2:1	j6pa		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	δι’ ἡμερῶν	1	Here, the phrase **after {some} days** indicates that the events Mark is about to narrate occurred a few, but not very many, days after the event he just narrated, the healing of the leper. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable word or phrase that indicates that a few **days** passed between the previous event and this event. Alternate translation: “a few days later”
2:1	ir5j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἠκούσθη	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who did the action, it is clear from the context that it was people who were in **Capernaum**. Alternate translation: “the people there heard”
2:1	afvi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐν οἴκῳ	1	Here Mark implies that this **house** was Jesus’ home while he was in Capernaum. This **house** could belong to: (1) Simon and Andrew, since he stayed at their house previously (see [1:29](../01/29.md)). Alternate translation: “in Simon and Andrew’s house” (2) Jesus and his relatives, who may have moved to Capernaum. Alternate translation: “in his house”
2:2	zja1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	πολλοὶ	1	Mark is using the adjective **many** as a noun to mean many people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “many men and women”
2:2	pv8e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	συνήχθησαν	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “gathered” or “came together”\n
2:2	m8pw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	μηκέτι χωρεῖν	1	Here, the clause **it could no longer receive** means that the house was so full that no one else could fit inside. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “there was no space left” or “no one else could fit”
2:2	ilsu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	μηδὲ τὰ πρὸς τὴν θύραν	1	Here Mark means that there were so many people even outside the house that no one could get near **the door**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “and no one could even get to the door” or “and there was no space even at the door into the house”
2:2	zkka		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τὸν λόγον	1	Mark is using the term **word** to mean the gospel, that Jesus preached using words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the gospel”
2:3	sotm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἔρχονται φέροντες πρὸς αὐτὸν παραλυτικὸν, αἰρόμενον ὑπὸ τεσσάρων	1	Here Mark could be implying that: (1) more than four people came, but only **four** of them were carrying the paralytic. Alternate translation: “people come bringing to him a paralytic, being carried by four of them” (2) **four** people came and were carrying the paralytic. Alternate translation: “four men come bringing to him a paralytic, whom they were carrying”
2:3	h1t1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	ἔρχονται	1	In a context such as this, your language might say “go” instead of **come**. Alternate translation: “they go”
2:3	s21g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	παραλυτικὸν	1	A **paralytic** is someone who is not able to use or control some or all of his or her arms and legs because of injury or sickness. If your readers would not be familiar with this sickness, you could use the name of something like this in your language, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “a paralyzed person” or “a person who could not move his limbs”
2:3	k1ev		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	αἰρόμενον ὑπὸ τεσσάρων	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “whom four men were carrying”
2:3	i2wu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	αἰρόμενον	1	As the next verse states, the **four men** carried the **paralytic** on a “mat.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea explicit here. Alternate translation: “being carried on a mat”

If your readers would not be familiar with this kind of roof, you could use descriptive phrases, or you could use more general terms.

If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. He could mean: (1) that saying **Your sins are forgiven** is easier than saying **Get up and take up your mat and walk**. This is because it is easy to show that someone is lying when they try to heal a paralytic, but it is not easy to show that someone is lying when they claim to forgive sins. Alternate translation: “It is easier to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ than to say, ‘Get up and take up your mat and walk.’” (2) that both things are equally easy to say.

He wants them to think of the new things that he teaches and does as **a patch of unshrunk cloth** and of the current ways of doing things as if they were **an old garment**. You should preserve the form of the parable, but if it would be helpful in your language, you could state explicitly that what Jesus does and teaches is like the **patch of unshrunk cloth**, and the normal way of doing things is like **an old garment**. Alternate translation: “no one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, but if not, the patch tears away from it, the new from the old, and a worse tear happens.

2:21	m3sx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	τὸ καινὸν τοῦ παλαιοῦ	1	Jesus is using the adjectives **new** and **old** as nouns to mean new and old cloth. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “the new patch from the old garment”
2:22	q5fg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables	καὶ οὐδεὶς βάλλει οἶνον νέον εἰς ἀσκοὺς παλαιούς; εἰ δὲ μή ῥήξει ὁ οἶνος τοὺς ἀσκούς, καὶ ὁ οἶνος ἀπόλλυται καὶ οἱ ἀσκοί; ἀλλὰ οἶνον νέον εἰς ἀσκοὺς καινούς	1	To help the people who asked the question understand why his disciples do not fast, Jesus offers another brief illustration. He wants them to think of the new things that he teaches and does as **new wine** and of the current ways of doing things as if they were **old wineskins**. You should preserve the form of the parable, but if it would be helpful in your language, you could state explicitly that what Jesus does and teaches is like the **new wine**, and the normal way of doing things is like **old wineskins**. Alternate translation: “And no one puts new wine into old wineskins, but if not, the wine will burst the wineskins and the wine and the wineskins are destroyed, but new wine into new wineskins. What I say and do is like the new wine, and the normal way of doing things is like the old wineskins.”
2:22	fk15		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo	εἰ δὲ μή ῥήξει ὁ οἶνος τοὺς ἀσκούς, καὶ ὁ οἶνος ἀπόλλυται καὶ οἱ ἀσκοί	1	Jesus is using a hypothetical situation to teach. Use a natural method in your language for introducing a hypothetical situation. Alternate translation: “but if someone actually did, the wine would burst the wineskins and the wine and the wineskins would be destroyed” or “but were a person to do that, the wine would burst the wineskins and the wine and the wineskins would be destroyed”
2:22	alse		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ῥήξει ὁ οἶνος τοὺς ἀσκούς	1	Here Jesus implies that the new **wine**, when it ferments, will expand and burst the **wineskins**, which are old and so no longer able to stretch. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “when the wine ferments, the wineskins cannot stretch and will burst”
2:22	n0iy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ὁ οἶνος ἀπόλλυται καὶ οἱ ἀσκοί	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

2:22	dgcz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ἀλλὰ οἶνον νέον εἰς ἀσκοὺς καινούς	1	Jesus is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete.

2:23	ko42		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τῶν σπορίμων	1	The word **grainfields** refers to places where grain is grown and harvested. This grain is usually ground and made into bread. If your readers would not be familiar with this type of field, you could use the name of something similar in your area or you could use a more general term. Alternate translation: “fields where grain is grown”
2:23	s8rg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἤρξαντο ὁδὸν ποιεῖν	1	Here, the phrase **to make a way** means that the disciples were traveling or walking along.

2:24	qybi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	ἴδε	1	Here, the word **Behold** is meant to draw the attention of Jesus.

Alternate translation: “they are doing what is not lawful on the Sabbaths.” or “they should certainly not be doing what is not lawful on the Sabbaths!”
2:24	ec3u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ποιοῦσιν τοῖς Σάββασιν ὃ οὐκ ἔξεστιν	1	The Pharisees considered even the small action of picking heads of grain to be harvesting, and therefore work.

If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “You have not understood what you have read about what David did when he had need and was hungry, he and the ones with him—how he went into the house of God in the time of Abiathar the high priest and ate the bread of the presence, which is not lawful to eat except for the priests, and he also gave to the ones being with him.”

The current king, Saul was trying to kill David. So, David ran away to the priest who was serving God at the time, **Abiathar**. David and the men who ran away with him were very hungry, so they asked the Abiathar for food. Abiathar gave them the special bread that was laid out in God’s presence every day, and David and his men ate this bread. You can read this story in [1 Samuel 21:1–6](../1sa/21/01.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could include some extra information in your translation or in a footnote. Alternate translation: “Have you never read what David did when he had need and was hungry after he and the ones with him escaped from King Saul, who wanted to kill him? He visited the high priest Abiathar, went into the house of God, and ate the bread of the presence, which was not lawful to eat except for the priests. He also gave some of it to the ones being with him.”
2:25	wxd7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	οὐδέποτε ἀνέγνωτε	1	Because Jesus is speaking to the Pharisees, the word **you** is plural.
2:25	cjzx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	χρείαν ἔσχεν	1	Here Jesus is implying that David did not have everything that he needed, especially food. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “he had need of something to eat”

2:27	fse5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-proverbs	τὸ Σάββατον διὰ τὸν ἄνθρωπον ἐγένετο, καὶ οὐχ ὁ ἄνθρωπος διὰ τὸ Σάββατον	1	Here, Jesus uses or invents a proverb in order to teach that God set up the **Sabbath** for the sake of people. Translate this proverb in a way that will be recognized as a proverb and be meaningful in your language and culture. Alternate translation: “Humans were made first, and then the Sabbath was set up because of them. It is not true that the Sabbath was set up first, and then humans were made because of it”
2:27	i374		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τὸ Σάββατον διὰ τὸν ἄνθρωπον ἐγένετο	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

2:27	v3mb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	τὸν ἄνθρωπον & ὁ ἄνθρωπος	1	The word **man** represents men and women in general, not one particular man. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: “people … people”

2:28	wgwu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ὥστε	1	Here, the word **Therefore** introduces a conclusion or inference that Jesus draws from what he just said.

3:intro	x969				0	# Mark 3 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n2. The ministry of Jesus in Galilee (1:14–8:26)\n      * Early ministry (1:14–3:6)\n        * Healing a man on the Sabbath\n      * Becoming more popular among the people (3:7–5:43)\n        * Jesus ministers to many people (3:7–12)\n        * Jesus appoints the twelve apostles (3:13–19)\n        * Jesus and his family, part one (3:20–21)\n        * Jesus and the scribes debate whether he has a demon (3:22–30)\n        * Jesus and his family, part two (3:31–35)\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Sabbath\n\nIn this chapter, just as in chapter 2, the Pharisees and Jesus are in conflict about the Sabbath. For more information about the Sabbath, see the General Notes to chapter 2.\n\n### Blaspheming against the Spirit\n\nIn [3:29](../03/29.md), Jesus speaks about blaspheming against the Spirit. He indicates that God will forgive all kinds of sins, but he will not forgive people who blaspheme against the Holy Spirit. Jesus says these things because the Pharisees said that he cast out demons by the power of Beelzebul. Jesus implies that he actually cast out demons by the power of the Holy Spirit. So, since the Pharisees have called the Holy Spirit Beelzebul, they have blasphemed or spoken against the Spirit. Christians debate what counts as this kind of blasphemy and why God will not forgive people for it. In your translation, you should not be more specific than Jesus is. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/blasphemy]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/holyspirit]])\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### The parable about the strong man\n\nIn [3:27](../03/27.md), Jesus describes how thieves must subdue and tie up a strong man before they can steal things from his house. Jesus does not directly state how to apply this proverb. However, most Christians think that Satan is like the strong man, and the demons that Jesus casts out are like the strong man’s things. In this case, Jesus is like the thieves who tie up the strong man. Jesus is saying that, since he can cast out demons, it proves that he has subdued and conquered Satan, just as thieves can only steal things after they have subdued the strong man. You should not include this extra information in your translation, but if it would be helpful for your readers, you could include it in a footnote. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])\n\n### Jesus’ mother and brothers\n\nIn [3:31–35](../03/31.md), Jesus’ mother and brothers arrive and want to talk with Jesus. In response, Jesus says that his disciples, those who do God’s will, are his mother and brother and sister. In other words, Jesus calls his disciples, who are those who do God’s will, his family members. He means that they are as close and important to him as his own family. This is an important metaphor that appears throughout the Bible, so preserve the metaphor or express the idea in simile form. See the notes on these verses for translation options. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### The 12 disciples\n\nThe following are the lists of the 12 disciples in Matthew, Mark, and Luke:\n\nIn [Matthew 10:2–4](../mat/10/02.md):\n\nSimon (Peter), Andrew, James son of Zebedee, John son of Zebedee, Philip, Bartholomew, Thomas, Matthew, James son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot.\n\nIn [Mark 3:16–19](../mrk/03/16.md):\n\nSimon (Peter), James son of Zebedee, John son of Zebedee, Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot.\n\nIn [Luke 6:14](../luk/06/14.md):\n\nSimon (Peter), Andrew, James, John, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot, Judas son of James, and Judas Iscariot.\n\nThese lists do not always follow the same order or use the same names for the disciples. In that culture, people often had two or three names. For example, it is likely that that Thaddaeus was also named Judas or Jude. So, do not harmonize these lists by using the same sequence or names in each case. You should translate Mark’s list as Mark presents it.\n\n### Singular and plural forms of “you”\n\nMany of the forms of “you” in this chapter appear in dialogues between Jesus and other individuals. Because of this, most forms of “you” in this chapter are singular. You should assume forms of “you” are singular unless a note specifies that the form is plural. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])\n\n### The historic present\n\nTo call attention to a development in the story, Mark uses the present tense in past narration. In this chapter, the historic present occurs in verses 3, 4, 5, 13, 20, 31, 32, 33, and 34. If it would not be natural to do that in your language, you could use the past tense in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense]])
3:1	bm6z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	καὶ	1	Here, the word **And** introduces the next major event in the story. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces the next event, or you could leave **And** untranslated. Alternate translation: “After that,”
3:1	mjfa		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πάλιν εἰς συναγωγήν	1	Here Mark implies that this is a **synagogue** that Jesus has already visited, most likely the one in Capernaum (see [1:21](../01/21.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “again into the synagogue in Capernaum”
3:1	rn8y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	ἦν ἐκεῖ ἄνθρωπος, ἐξηραμμένην ἔχων τὴν χεῖρα	1	Here Mark introduces a **man** with **a withered hand** as a new participant in the story. If your language has its own way of introducing new participants, you could use it here in your translation. Alternate translation: “a certain man was in the synagogue, and he had a withered hand”
3:1	ye6d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ἐξηραμμένην ἔχων τὴν χεῖρα	1	This means that the man’s **hand** was damaged in such a way that he could not stretch it out. It was probably bent almost into a fist, making it look smaller. Use a word or phrase that expresses this idea clearly. Alternate translation: “having a shriveled hand” or “whose hand was atrophied”

Alternate translation: “And they wanted to accuse him. So, they were watching him closely, if he will heal him on the Sabbaths”
3:2	vr25		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	παρετήρουν αὐτὸν & κατηγορήσωσιν	1	The pronouns **they** and **they** refer to the Pharisees who were there, as [3:6](../03/06.md) shows.

3:2	dw2w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	τοῖς Σάββασιν	1	See how you translated this phrase in [2:23](../02/23.md). Alternate translation: “on a Sabbath day” or “during a Sabbath day”
3:2	q35x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	κατηγορήσωσιν αὐτοῦ	1	Here Mark implies that they would **accuse** Jesus of breaking the Sabbath commandments.

3:3	pi5h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τῷ τὴν χεῖρα ἔχοντι ξηράν	1	See how you expressed this idea in [3:1](../03/01.md). Alternate translation: “having the shriveled hand” or “whose hand was atrophied”
3:3	nm6w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἔγειρε εἰς τὸ μέσον	1	Here, the implication is that Jesus wanted this man to stand where everyone could see him.

He knows that they would agree with what his question implies. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “I know that you realize that it is lawful on the Sabbaths to do good and not to do harm; to save a life and not to kill.” or “Surely you know that it is lawful on the Sabbaths to do good and not to do harm; to save a life and not to kill!”
3:4	zvln		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	τοῖς Σάββασιν	1	See how you translated this phrase in [2:23](../02/23.md). Alternate translation: “on any of the Sabbath days” or “during a Sabbath day”

3:4	vz6c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ψυχὴν σῶσαι ἢ ἀποκτεῖναι	1	Jesus is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete.

3:5	x9ln		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	μετ’ ὀργῆς	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **anger**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “in an angry way”
3:5	los0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	συνλυπούμενος ἐπὶ τῇ πωρώσει τῆς καρδίας αὐτῶν	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say what caused the action, it is clear from the context that it was **the hardness of their heart**. Alternate translation: “the hardness of their heart grieving him”
3:5	thek		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τῇ πωρώσει τῆς καρδίας αὐτῶν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **hardness**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “how hard their heart was”
3:5	n4ep		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τῇ πωρώσει τῆς καρδίας αὐτῶν	1	Here, Jesus is speaking of the Pharisees’ **heart** as if it were characterized by **hardness**. He means that the Pharisees are stubborn and refuse to listen and learn. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “their stubbornness” or “their unwillingness to listen”\n
3:5	zr89		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	τῆς καρδίας αὐτῶν	1	If it would not be natural in your language to speak as if a group of people had only one **heart**, you could use the plural form of that word in your translation. Alternate translation: “of their hearts”\n
3:5	itqu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	ἔκτεινον τὴν χεῖρα σου	1	This was not a command that the man was capable of obeying. Instead, this was a command that directly caused the man to be healed. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express that idea more explicitly. Alternate translation: “I heal you. Now stretch out your hand!”
3:5	c3qe		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἀπεκατεστάθη ἡ χεὶρ αὐτοῦ	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

3:6	qu9o		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	μετὰ τῶν Ἡρῳδιανῶν συμβούλιον ἐποίουν κατ’ αὐτοῦ	1	Here, the phrase **were making counsel with the Herodians against him** indicates that the Pharisees were working together with the Herodians to figure out ways to harm Jesus.

Alternate translation: “no one, unless he has first bound the strong man, is able, entering into the house of that strong man, to steal his belongings”\n
3:27	i7tr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	μὴ πρῶτον & δήσῃ & διαρπάσει	1	Although the term **he** in both these places is masculine, Jesus is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a phrase that makes this clear. Alternate translation: “that person has not first bound … that person will plunder”
3:27	o503		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	αὐτοῦ διαρπάσει	1	Here, the word **he** refers to the person who is stealing. The word **his** refers to the strong man. If this is not clear for your readers, you could refer to these people more directly. Alternate translation: “the thief will plunder the strong man’s”

Alternate translation: “the only sin or blasphemy that will not be forgiven the sons of men is the blasphemy against the Holy Spirit. Whoever does that” or “most sins and blasphemies, as much as they blaspheme, will be forgiven the sons of men, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven. Whoever has done that”
3:28	f6fq			ἀμὴν, λέγω ὑμῖν	1	Jesus says this to emphasize what he is about to tell his audience. Use a natural form in your language for emphasizing the truth and importance of a statement. Alternate translation: “I can assure you”

If you need to say who will do the action, it is clear from the context that it will be God. Alternate translation: “God will forgive the sons of men for all the sins and the blasphemies, as much as they may blaspheme”

3:28	vbwa		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	πάντα ἀφεθήσεται & τὰ ἁμαρτήματα καὶ αἱ βλασφημίαι, ὅσα ἐὰν βλασφημήσωσιν	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **sins** and **blasphemies**, you could express the same ideas in another way. Alternate translation: “all sinful and blasphemous things, as much as they may blaspheme, will be forgiven” or “whenever anyone sins or blasphemes in any way, it will be forgiven”

If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Since Jesus answers the question in [3:34–35](../03/34.md), you should not include an implied answer here.

4:intro	f5ua				0	# Mark 4 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n2. The ministry of Jesus in Galilee (1:14–8:26)\n      * Becoming more popular among the people (3:7–5:43)\n        * The parable of the sower (4:1–9)\n        * Jesus explains the parable of the sower (4:10–20)\n        * Jesus teaches about secrets and knowledge (4:21–25)\n        * The parable of the seeds growing by themselves (4:26–29)\n        * The parable of the mustard seed (4:30–32)\n        * Summary statement (4:33–34)\n        * Jesus calms a storm (4:35–41)\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in [4:12](../04/12.md), which is a quotation from [Isaiah 6:9–10](../isa/06/09.md).\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Farming\n\nJesus refers to several different farming practices in this chapter. In his culture, farmers often threw seeds over their fields, a process called sowing. After throwing the seeds, they would use a tool called a plow to cover the seeds with dirt. Then, they would water and take care of the seeds until they sprouted and grew. Finally, when the plants produced grain or other kinds of crops, they would cut down the plants, separate the edible parts from the inedible parts, and store the edible parts in a safe place. See the notes on the verses in which Jesus discusses farming practices for specific information and translation options.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Parables\n\nThroughout this chapter, Jesus uses several parables to teach the crowds and his disciples. Each parable is a short story that includes a specific lesson. Jesus uses parables to teach so that people who already know his message will learn more but people who do not know his message will not learn anything (see [4:11–12](../04/11.md)). Jesus explains one of the parables, but he does not explain any of the others. Possible explanations for each parable are included below, but only for help in translation. Your translation should not directly explain the meaning of any parable more than Jesus does. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])\n\n* The parable of the sower—In [4:3–9](../04/03.md), Jesus tells a story about a man who sows seed and about what happens to the seed. Jesus explains this parable in [4:14–20](../04/14.md). Even with this explanation, Christians debate who the sower is, what the seed represents, and what the different areas in the field represent. The sower could be Jesus himself, God, or anyone who preaches the gospel. The seed could be the gospel or the person who hears the gospel. The different areas in the field could be regions or areas where people hear the gospel, different kinds of people, or different ways of responding to the gospel. Most likely, the seed and the area in the field together describe what happens when people respond to the gospel in these four ways.\n\n* The parable of the seeds growing by themselves—In [4:26–29](../04/26.md), Jesus tells a story about a farmer who sows seed. The seed sprouts, grows, and produces a crop all by itself, and the farmer does not know how it happens. However, when the crop is ready, he harvests it. Most likely, Jesus is describing how God’s kingdom grows and expands, even without help from people. By the time God judges everyone, which is like a harvest, the kingdom will be very large and productive, even though people do not always know how that happens.\n\n* The parable of the mustard seed—In [4:30–32](../04/30.md), Jesus tells a story about how a very small seed (a mustard seed) grows into a very large plant. Most likely, he is describing how his group of followers was very small but will eventually become very large. Jesus mentions that birds nest in the shadow of this large plant. Some people think that Jesus is referring to passages like [Ezekiel 17:23](../ezk/17/23.md), which could suggest that the birds represent Gentiles who become part of God’s kingdom. Others think that the detail about the birds simply illustrates how large the plant is. If possible, your translation should allow for all of these interpretations.\n\n### Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Singular and plural forms of “you”\n\nMost of the forms of “you” in this chapter appear in teaching that Jesus gives to his disciples and to the crowds. Because of this, most forms of “you” in this chapter are plural. You should assume forms of “you” are plural unless a note specifies that the form is singular. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])\n\n### The historic present\n\nTo call attention to a development in the story, Mark uses the present tense in past narration. In this chapter, the historic present occurs in verses 1, 13, 35, 36, 37 and 38. If it would not be natural to do that in your language, you could use the past tense in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense]])
4:1	q0xe		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	καὶ	1	Here, the word **And** introduces the next major event in the story.

4:1	cqq0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	ὄχλος πλεῖστος	1	Mark says **the largest crowd** here as an overstatement for emphasis. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different way to express the emphasis. Alternate translation: “a huge crowd” or “an enormous crowd”
4:1	ufxn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	συνάγεται πρὸς αὐτὸν	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “gathered to him” or “came to listen to him”
4:1	i95e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καθῆσθαι ἐν τῇ θαλάσσῃ	1	In Jesus’ culture, teachers usually **sat down** when they were going to teach.

Alternate translation: “Picture this:” or “Pay attention to this:”
4:3	w0ng		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	ἐξῆλθεν ὁ σπείρων	1	Here Jesus introduces a **sower** as a character in his story.

4:4	zc07		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐν τῷ σπείρειν	1	While there are many ways to sow or plant seeds, here Jesus is describing a practice in which farmers pick up handfuls of seed and throw them so that they are scattered all over the top of the soil. This method is a quick and easy way to plant seeds in large fields, but some seeds land on ground that is not good for them to grow in. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make it more explicit what kind of sowing this is. Alternate translation: “as he threw the seeds over the ground” or “as he scattered the seeds over the field”
4:4	si37		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὃ μὲν ἔπεσεν παρὰ τὴν ὁδόν, καὶ ἦλθεν τὰ πετεινὰ καὶ κατέφαγεν αὐτό	1	Here Jesus implies that the seeds that fall **beside the road** do not sink into the ground.

4:5	hyj8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	εὐθὺς ἐξανέτειλεν διὰ τὸ μὴ ἔχειν βάθος γῆς	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these clauses, since the second clause gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “because it did not have deep soil, immediately it sprang up”
4:5	u5rz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐξανέτειλεν	1	Here, the phrase **sprang up** refers to how plants sprout or begin to grow. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase. Alternate translation: “it came up” or “it began to grow”

4:7	fgz4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καρπὸν οὐκ ἔδωκεν	1	Here the word **fruit** refers to the crop that the plants that grew from the seeds should have produced.

Alternate translation: “in a box” or “under a container that hides its light”
4:21	y7f9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ὑπὸ τὴν κλίνην	1	A **bed** is a piece of furniture that people would lie on when they were eating or sleeping. Most likely, this kind of **bed** had short legs that raised it off the floor. If someone put a lamp under this kind of furniture, it would hide the light from the lamp. If your readers would not be familiar with this type of container, you could use the name of something similar in your area or you could use a more general term. Alternate translation: “under a couch” or “under furniture”
4:21	gc4s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐπὶ τὴν λυχνίαν	1	Here Jesus implies that the lamp can illuminate a large area when it is on a **lampstand**.

The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could connect the clauses with a word other than and in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternatively, you could combine the two clauses into one. Alternate translation: “it is not hidden except so that it might be revealed; yes, it has not become secret except so that it might come into visibility” or “it is not hidden except so that it will come into visibility”

4:22	x0dp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	οὐ & ἐστιν & οὐδὲ ἐγένετο	1	The pronoun **it** in both places refers generally to any thing. Jesus may more specifically have in mind the meaning of his preaching or the kingdom of God.

4:24	lqor		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	μετρηθήσεται ὑμῖν, καὶ προστεθήσεται ὑμῖν	1	In both places, the word **it** refers to what **you measure**. Jesus is speaking in general about anything that people **measure**, so you should avoid making the phrase specific. Alternate translation: “the same thing will be measured to you, and it will be added to you” or “that very thing will be measured to you, and it will be added to you”
4:24	sbmk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	προστεθήσεται ὑμῖν	1	Here Jesus uses the phrase **will be added to you** to indicate that God will give all what is **measured**.

If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “he who has understanding, it will be given to him, and he who does not have understanding, even what he has will be taken away from him” or “he who has knowledge about the gospel, more will be given to him, and he who does not have knowledge about the gospel, even what knowledge he has will be taken away from him”

4:25	oceg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	καὶ	1	Here, the word **and** introduces a person **who does not have** in contrast to the person **who has**.

4:25	emrz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	ὃς οὐκ ἔχει	1	Jesus says **he who does not have** here as a generalization for emphasis.

4:37	fmgz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐπέβαλλεν εἰς	1	When waves are **breaking into** a boat, they are high enough that they come over the side of the boat and splash water into it. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “were coming over the sides into”
4:37	oad8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἤδη γεμίζεσθαι τὸ πλοῖον	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who did the action, it is clear from the context that it was the waves. Alternate translation: “the waves were already filling the boat”
4:38	cets		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns	αὐτὸς ἦν	1	Mark uses the word **himself** to emphasize how significant it was that Jesus was **in the stern, sleeping**. Use a way that is natural in your language to indicate this significance. Alternate translation: “as for Jesus, he was”
4:38	uauq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τῇ πρύμνῃ	1	The word **stern** is a nautical term that means the back of a ship. If your language does not have a comparable nautical term, you could state the meaning plainly in your translation. Alternate translation: “the back end of the boat”
4:38	lwed		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τὸ προσκεφάλαιον	1	A **cushion** is a soft object that person would lie or rest on. If your readers would not be familiar with this type of object, you could use the name of something similar in your area or you could use a more general term. Alternate translation: “the sleeping pad” or “a soft surface”
4:38	b4xb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	οὐ μέλει σοι ὅτι ἀπολλύμεθα?	1	The disciples are using the question form to show Jesus that they are afraid and to convince him to do something to help them. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “it should be a concern to you that we are perishing.” or “it is clearly not a concern to you that we are perishing!”
4:38	viz2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	οὐ μέλει σοι	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **concern**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “does it not concern you”
4:38	fu0n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	σοι	1	Because the disciples are speaking to Jesus, the word **you** here is singular.
4:38	qtb3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἀπολλύμεθα	1	Here, the word **we** includes both Jesus and the disciples. Your language may require you to mark this form.
4:39	yym6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	σιώπα, πεφίμωσο	1	The terms **Be silent** and **Be still** mean similar things. Jesus is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “Be very calm!” or “Be completely still!”
4:39	mnsa		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	σιώπα, πεφίμωσο	1	Because Jesus is speaking to the sea, the commands **Be silent** and **Be still** are singular.
4:39	ydoa		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐγένετο γαλήνη μεγάλη	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **calm**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “the sea became very calm”
4:40	w5n4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τί δειλοί ἐστε? οὔπω ἔχετε πίστιν?	1	Jesus is using the question form to rebuke the disciples for being **cowardly** and for **not yet** having **faith**. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate these questions as statements or exclamations. Alternate translation: “You should not be cowardly. I am disappointed that you do not have more faith.” or “Do not be cowardly! You should have already have faith!”
4:40	t6qf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	οὔπω ἔχετε πίστιν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **faith**, you could express the same idea in another way. Jesus could be implying that this **faith** is in: (1) God. Alternate translation: “Do you not yet believe God” (2) himself. Alternate translation: “Do you not yet trust me”
4:41	txh1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐφοβήθησαν φόβον μέγαν	1	Here, the phrase **feared a great fear** means that they were extremely afraid. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “they were extremely afraid” or “they were terrified”
4:41	u8e1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	τίς ἄρα οὗτός ἐστιν, ὅτι καὶ ὁ ἄνεμος καὶ ἡ θάλασσα ὑπακούει αὐτῷ?	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could turn this into two sentences, one asking the question, and the other giving the reason for the question. Alternate translation: “Who then is this? Even the wind and the sea obey him!”
4:41	biog			τίς ἄρα οὗτός ἐστιν, ὅτι καὶ ὁ ἄνεμος καὶ ἡ θάλασσα ὑπακούει αὐτῷ	1	This is a genuine question, not a statement in question form. The disciples are looking for information about what kind of person Jesus could be if he can do these things. Alternate translation: “Who then is this person, for even the wind and the sea obey him”
4:41	hc6s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	τίς ἄρα	1	Here, the word **then** indicates that the disciples ask this question in response to what Jesus has done. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “So then, who” or “Given what he just did, who”
5:intro	lh25				0	# Mark 5 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n2. The ministry of Jesus in Galilee (1:14–8:26)\n      * Becoming more popular among the people (3:7–5:43)\n        * Casting demons out of a man (5:1–20)\n        * Healing a woman and resurrecting a girl (5:21–43)\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Resurrecting the dead\n\nIn [5:21–24](../05/21.md) and [5:35–43](../05/35.md), Mark narrates how Jesus raised a girl from the dead. While Jesus describes her as only “sleeping,” he uses this word to indicate that the girl will “wake up” from being dead. The story clearly indicates that the girl had died and that Jesus raises her from the dead by touching her.\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### How to refer to the demons and the demon-possessed man\n\nIn [5:1–20](../05/01.md), Jesus encounters a man whom demons had possessed. As Jesus interacts with this man, it becomes clear that there are three different entities who are involved. First, there is the man himself, but what he says and does is only what the demons want him to do. Second, there is a specific demon who seems to act as the spokesperson or leader for multiple demons. Third, there are the other demons, of whom there are so many that the man is called “Legion.” As Mark narrates the story, he sometimes refers to the man, sometimes to the individual demon, and sometimes to all the demons. Further, it is not always clear which of these three entities speaks and is spoken to by Jesus. Consider how you might refer to a demon-possessed person in this situation. If possible, preserve Mark’s switches between singular and plural, since learning that there are many demons is an important part of the story. Further, Mark implies that the man and the demons are so closely connected that referring to what the man did is the same as referring to what the demons did, and vice versa.\n\n### Singular and plural forms of “you”\n\nMany of the forms of “you” in this chapter appear in dialogues between Jesus and other individuals. Because of this, most forms of “you” in this chapter are singular. You should assume forms of “you” are singular unless a note specifies that the form is plural. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])\n\n### The historic present\n\nTo call attention to a development in the story, Mark uses the present tense in past narration. In this chapter, the historic present occurs in verses 7, 9, 15, 19, 22, 23, 35, 36, 38, 39, 40 and 41. If it would not be natural in your language, you could use the past tense in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense]])
5:1	fix1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	καὶ	1	Here, the word **And** introduces the next major event in the story. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces the next event, or you could leave **And** untranslated. Alternate translation: “After that,”
5:1	gt8a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	ἦλθον	1	In a context such as this, your language might say “went” instead of **came**. Alternate translation: “they came”
5:1	vsc7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	τῶν Γερασηνῶν	1	The name **Gerasenes** refers to the people who lived in and near the town of Gerasa.
5:1	dzc1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	τῶν Γερασηνῶν	1	Many ancient manuscripts read **Gerasenes**. The ULT follows that reading. Some ancient manuscripts read “Gadarenes,” and other ancient manuscripts read “Gergesenes.” If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of the ULT.
5:2	pf16		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	ἐξελθόντος	1	In a context such as this, your language might say “come” instead of **gone**. Alternate translation: “having come out”
5:2	zwtq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	ὑπήντησεν αὐτῷ ἐκ τῶν μνημείων ἄνθρωπος ἐν πνεύματι ἀκαθάρτῳ	1	Here Mark introduces **a man with an unclean spirit** as a new participant in the story. If your language has its own way of introducing new participants, you could use it here in your translation. Alternate translation: “a certain man came from the tombs to meet him. This man had an unclean spirit”
5:3	pinm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	ὃς τὴν κατοίκησιν εἶχεν ἐν τοῖς μνήμασιν	1	Here Mark provides background information that will help readers understand what happens next. This background information continues in [5:4](../05/04.md) and [5:5](../05/05.md). Use a natural form in your language for introducing background information. Alternate translation: “and here is what that man was like. He had his dwelling in the tombs”
5:3-4	nll4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge	καὶ οὐδὲ ἁλύσει οὐκέτι οὐδεὶς ἐδύνατο αὐτὸν δῆσαι & διὰ τὸ αὐτὸν πολλάκις πέδαις καὶ ἁλύσεσι δεδέσθαι, καὶ διεσπάσθαι ὑπ’ αὐτοῦ τὰς ἁλύσεις καὶ τὰς πέδας συντετρῖφθαι, καὶ οὐδεὶς ἴσχυεν αὐτὸν δαμάσαι	1	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could combine [5:3](../05/03.md) and [5:4](../05/04.md) into a verse bridge in order to include the basis for the claim that **no one was able to bind him anymore** before the claim. Alternate translation: “and he had often been bound with shackles and chains, and the chains had been torn apart by him and the shackles had been shattered. So, no one was strong enough to subdue him or to bind him anymore, not even with a chain”
5:3	pjsx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οὐκέτι οὐδεὶς ἐδύνατο αὐτὸν δῆσαι	1	Here Mark implies that people tried to **bind** this man to keep him from hurting people and breaking things. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “no one was able to bind him anymore to keep him from hurting others” or “no one was able to use bonds to restrain him anymore”
5:3	dryi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	οὐκέτι οὐδεὶς ἐδύνατο	1	The words translated **no one** and **anymore** are two negative words. In this construction, the second negative does not cancel the first to create a positive meaning. Instead, it gives greater emphasis to the negative. If your language can use two negatives that do not cancel one another to create a positive meaning, you could use a double negative here. If your language does not use two negatives in that way, you could translate with one strong negative, as the ULT does. Alternate translation: “people were able … no longer”\n
5:3	nsol		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ἁλύσει	1	A **chain** is a long, flexible fastener that is made out of multiple rings of metal connected together. Chains are usually used to secure objects or bind things together. If your readers would not be familiar with chains, you could use the name of something similar in your area or you could use a more general term. Alternate translation: “with metal links connected together”
5:4	da4x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	αὐτὸν πολλάκις & δεδέσθαι	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who did the action, it is clear from the context that it was the people who lived nearby. Alternate translation: “the people who lived there had often bound him”
5:4	fk7t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	πέδαις & τὰς πέδας	1	The word **shackles** refers to pieces of metal that are fastened around the ankles of prisoners. These pieces of metal are connected together by ropes or chains, which prevent the prisoners from moving quickly or far. If your readers would not be familiar with shackles, you could use the name of something similar in your area or you could use a more general term. Alternate translation: “with leg irons … the leg irons” or “with strong restraints … the restraints”
5:4	dk1l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ἁλύσεσι & τὰς ἁλύσεις	1	See how you translated the word **chains** in [5:3](../05/03.md). Alternate translation: “metal links connected together … the metal links”
5:4	rjo3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	καὶ	2	Here, the word **and** introduces what the demon-possessed man did in contrast to what the people who tied him up wanted him to do. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces this kind of contrast. Alternate translation: “but”
5:4	nep6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	διεσπάσθαι ὑπ’ αὐτοῦ τὰς ἁλύσεις καὶ τὰς πέδας συντετρῖφθαι	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “he had torn apart the chains and had shattered the shackles”
5:5	ohvk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	διὰ παντὸς νυκτὸς καὶ ἡμέρας	1	Here, the phrase **throughout every night and day** indicates that this man was **crying out and cutting himself with stones** during both the day and the night. This means that he was doing those things very often every day. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “all the time” or “during every day and every night”
5:6	y6c2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καὶ ἰδὼν τὸν Ἰησοῦν ἀπὸ μακρόθεν	1	Here Mark stops giving background information and returns to the events in the story that he is telling. He implies that the man saw Jesus when he arrived in the boat from the other side of the Sea of Galilee (see [5:1–2](../05/01.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “Now, having seen Jesus from a distance when he got out of the boat”
5:6	w9zd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	προσεκύνησεν αὐτῷ	1	In the Jesus’ culture, bowing down to a person was a way to honor a greater person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could refer to a similar action from your culture, or you could explain what bowing down means. Alternate translation: “prostrated himself before him” or “bowed down to him in respect”
5:7-8	ux6u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge	καὶ κράξας φωνῇ μεγάλῃ λέγει, τί ἐμοὶ καὶ σοί Ἰησοῦ, Υἱὲ τοῦ Θεοῦ τοῦ Ὑψίστου? ὁρκίζω σε τὸν Θεόν, μή με βασανίσῃς & ἔλεγεν γὰρ αὐτῷ, ἔξελθε, τὸ πνεῦμα τὸ ἀκάθαρτον ἐκ τοῦ ἀνθρώπου	1	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could combine [5:7](../05/07.md) and [5:8](../05/08.md) into a verse bridge, as the UST does, in order to include the reason why the man cried out as he did before stating that the man cried out. Alternate translation: “And Jesus was saying to him, ‘Come out from the man, unclean spirit.’ So, crying out with a loud voice, he says, ‘What to me and to you, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I make you swear by God, do not torment me.’”
5:7	x6qj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	κράξας φωνῇ μεγάλῃ	1	Here, the phrase **crying out with a loud voice** means that the demon raised the volume of its voice. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “having yelled loudly”
5:7	ppu5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τί ἐμοὶ καὶ σοί Ἰησοῦ, Υἱὲ τοῦ Θεοῦ τοῦ Ὑψίστου?	1	The man, controlled by the demon, is using the question form to insist on something urgently. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “There is nothing to me and to you, Jesus, Son of the Most High God!”
5:7	fatr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	τί ἐμοὶ καὶ σοί	1	Here, the question **What to me and to you** asks whether **you** and **me** have anything in common or have any reason to be together. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “What do you and I have in common” or “What reason do you have to get involved with me”
5:7	kd19		rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	Υἱὲ τοῦ Θεοῦ τοῦ Ὑψίστου	1	**Son of the Most High God** is an important title for Jesus that describes his relationship with God the Father.
5:7	urq0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-oathformula	ὁρκίζω σε τὸν Θεόν	1	Here the man, controlled by the demon, puts Jesus under oath, or makes him **swear by God** that he will not **torment** him. Use a natural way in your language to express an oath. Alternate translation: “I make you swear before God” or “I require that you solemnly promise God”
5:8	ahtn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	Here, the word **For** introduces a reason why the man, controlled by the demon, acted as he did. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a reason or basis for an action, or you could leave **For** untranslated. Alternate translation: “He said that because” or “That was because”
5:9	h6ch		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	Λεγιὼν ὄνομά μοι, ὅτι πολλοί ἐσμεν.	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these clauses, since the second clause gives the reason for the result that the first clause describes. Alternate translation: “We are many, so my name is Legion”
5:9	oa64		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Λεγιὼν	1	A **Legion** is the name of a group of about 6,000 soldiers. So, translate the word **Legion** with a word in your language that refers to a large number of soldiers. You could show that this was the name of the man by using the convention in your language for proper names. Alternate translation: “is Army” or “is Battalion” or “is Brigade”
5:9	pdyp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πολλοί ἐσμεν	1	Here the demon indicates that he is speaking for many demons who are together controlling the man. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “I and the other demons with me are many”

Alternate translation: “often, ‘Do not send us demons out of this region’” or “often, ‘Do not send the legion of demons out of this region’”
5:11	jvrk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	δὲ	1	Mark uses the word **But** to introduce background information that will help readers understand what happens next. It does not introduce another event in the story. Use a natural form in your language for introducing background information. Alternate translation: “Meanwhile,” or “At the same time,”
5:12	ttpu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	λέγοντες	1	Consider natural ways of introducing direct quotations in your language. Alternate translation: “and they said”

5:12	trn9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	πέμψον	1	This is an imperative, but it should be translated as a polite request rather than as a command. It may be helpful to add an expression such as “please” to make this clear. Alternate translation: “We ask that you send”
5:12	zmsp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἡμᾶς & εἰσέλθωμεν	1	Here, the words **us** and **we** refer only to the demons, not to Jesus or any of his disciples. Your language may require you to mark this form.
5:12	z2j0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	εἰς αὐτοὺς εἰσέλθωμεν	1	Here the demons speak of wanting to **enter into** the herd of pigs. They mean that they want to enter and control the pigs. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “we might enter into them and possess them”
5:13	iff6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐπέτρεψεν αὐτοῖς	1	Here Mark implies that Jesus **permitted** the demons to enter into the pigs. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “he permitted them to enter into the pigs”
5:13	lfgr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	ἐπέτρεψεν αὐτοῖς	1	It may be more natural in your language to have a direct quotation here. Alternate translation: “he told them, ‘You may do so’”
5:13	lv3q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐξελθόντα	1	Here Mark implies that the demons came out of the man whom they had been controlling. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “having come out of the man whom they had been possessing”

5:13	zsd6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	εἰσῆλθον εἰς τοὺς χοίρους	1	See how you translated the similar phrase in [5:12](../05/12.md). Alternate translation: “entered into the pigs and possessed them”
5:13	a28z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὡς δισχίλιοι	1	Here Mark indicates that the herd was made up of **about 2,000** pigs.

5:14	cw1g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	καὶ οἱ βόσκοντες αὐτοὺς ἔφυγον	1	Here Mark introduces **the ones feeding them** as new characters in the story.

5:14	m4r2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	εἰς τὴν πόλιν καὶ εἰς τοὺς ἀγρούς	1	Here, Mark is referring to that whole region by naming its two primary parts. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “throughout the whole area”
5:14	zser		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	εἰς τὴν πόλιν καὶ εἰς τοὺς ἀγρούς	1	Here, the **city** is most likely Gerasa, since Jesus got out of the boat near this town (see [5:1](../05/01.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “in the town of Gerasa and in the countryside around it”
5:14	hlen		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἐξῆλθον	1	The pronoun **they** refers to the people who were living **in the city and in the countryside**. If this is not clear for your readers, you could refer to these people more directly. Alternate translation: “the people who lived in those places went out”
5:14	y60p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	ἐξῆλθον	1	In a context such as this, your language might say “came” instead of **went**. Alternate translation: “they came out”
5:15	yghh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	ἔρχονται	1	In a context such as this, your language might say “go” instead of **come**. Alternate translation: “they go”
5:15	g5j1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὸν δαιμονιζόμενον	1	Here Mark is referring to the man who had been **demon-possessed** until Jesus forced the demons out. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “the one who used to be demon-possessed”
5:15	jkqa		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τὸν δαιμονιζόμενον	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “the one whom the demons possessed”
5:15	vvsf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἱματισμένον καὶ σωφρονοῦντα	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “wearing clothes and having a sound mind”
5:15	fb4b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	σωφρονοῦντα	1	Here, the phrase **being sound-minded** means that the man was acting rationally and thinking like a normal person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “thinking sanely” or “acting rationally”
5:15	dg5o		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	τὸν ἐσχηκότα τὸν λεγεῶνα	1	Here Mark means that the man had been possessed or controlled by **the legion**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the one that had been possessed by the legion” or “the one whom the legion had possessed”

5:36	q8at		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πίστευε	1	Here Jesus implies that Jairus, the **synagogue ruler**, should **believe** in Jesus, specifically that Jesus can help his daughter. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “believe in me” or “believe that I can save your daughter”
5:37	g616		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-exceptions	οὐκ ἀφῆκεν οὐδένα μετ’ αὐτοῦ συνακολουθῆσαι, εἰ μὴ τὸν Πέτρον, καὶ Ἰάκωβον, καὶ Ἰωάννην τὸν ἀδελφὸν Ἰακώβου	1	If, in your language, it would appear that Mark was making a statement here and then contradicting it, you could reword this to avoid using an exception clause. Alternate translation: “he allowed only Peter and James and John the brother of James to accompany him”
5:37	kk98		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	αὐτοῦ	1	Here Mark implies that Jairus, the synagogue ruler, went with Jesus as well. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “him and the synagogue ruler” or “him and Jairus”
5:37	pshl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship	τὸν ἀδελφὸν Ἰακώβου	1	Mark never says whether **James** or **John** was older, but he mentions **James** first, which could imply that he was the older brother. If you have to use a form that refers to an older or younger brother, you could state that **John** was younger. See how you expressed the idea in [1:19](../01/19.md). Alternate translation: “the younger brother of James”
5:38	nb2w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἔρχονται	1	Here Mark implies that Peter, James, John, and Jairus were traveling with Jesus.

5:38	flu7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	θόρυβον, καὶ κλαίοντας καὶ ἀλαλάζοντας πολλά	1	This phrase expresses a single idea by using two terms connected with **and**. The phrase **weeping and much wailing** explains what actions created the **commotion**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this meaning with an equivalent phrase that does not use **and**. Alternate translation: “a commotion, including weeping and much wailing” or “a commotion caused by weeping and much wailing”
5:38	u8ze		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	κλαίοντας καὶ ἀλαλάζοντας πολλά	1	The terms **weeping** and **much wailing** mean similar things. Mark is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “very much mourning” or “a great deal of weeping”
5:39	atr1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	τί θορυβεῖσθε καὶ κλαίετε? τὸ παιδίον οὐκ ἀπέθανεν, ἀλλὰ καθεύδει	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these sentences, since the second sentence gives the reason for the result that the first sentence describes. Alternate translation: “The child did not die but is sleeping. So, why are you being disturbed and weeping?”
5:39	a3ih		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τί θορυβεῖσθε καὶ κλαίετε?	1	Jesus is using the question form to rebuke the people who were at the house. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “Stop being disturbed and weeping.” or “This is not a time to be disturbed and weeping!”
5:39	p5ah		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	θορυβεῖσθε	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “are you making a commotion” or “are you being noisy”
5:39	t35h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	θορυβεῖσθε	1	Because Jesus is speaking to many people in the house, the word **you** is plural.
5:39	dzrk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὸ παιδίον	1	Here, the word **child** refers to a very young woman. Mark clarifies in [5:42](../05/42.md) that she was about 12 years old.

5:40	g8k1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τοὺς μετ’ αὐτοῦ	1	Here Mark is referring to the three disciples (Peter, James, and John) whom Jesus took with him (see [5:37](../05/37.md)).

5:41	hx3c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate	ταλιθὰ, κοῦμ! ὅ ἐστιν μεθερμηνευόμενον τὸ κοράσιον, σοὶ λέγω ἔγειρε!	1	The phrase **Talitha, koum** is an Aramaic phrase. Mark spelled it out using Greek letters so his readers would know how it sounded, and then he explained what it meant: **Little girl, I say to you, arise**. In your translation you can spell it the way it sounds in your language and then explain its meaning. Alternate translation: “‘Talitha, koum!’ which is Aramaic for, ‘Little girl, I say to you, arise.’”
5:41	igcw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ὅ ἐστιν μεθερμηνευόμενον	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “which we translate as,”

Consider where you might include this information and how you might introduce it. Alternate translation: “And immediately the little girl, who was 12 years, rose up and was walking, and they were immediately astonished with great amazement” or “And immediately the little girl rose up and was walking, and they were immediately astonished with great amazement. Now the little girl was 12 years.”
5:42	edfv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀνέστη	1	Here, the phrase **rose up** indicates both that the girl came back to life and that she stood up. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “came back to life and got up”

5:42	pt5t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἦν & ἐτῶν δώδεκα	1	Here Mark means that the **little girl** was **12 years** old. Use whatever form your language commonly uses to indicate how old someone is. Alternate translation: “she had lived 12 years” or “she was 12 years of age”

Alternate translation: “they were immediately extremely astonished” or “they were immediately totally amazed”
5:42	atv7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐκστάσει μεγάλῃ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **amazement**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “and greatly amazed”
5:43	po7s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	αὐτοῖς & ἵνα μηδεὶς γνοῖ τοῦτο	1	It may be more natural in your language to have a direct quotation here. Alternate translation: “them, ‘No one must know about this’”

5:43	n29k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	εἶπεν δοθῆναι αὐτῇ φαγεῖν	1	It may be more natural in your language to have a direct quotation here. Alternate translation: “he said, ‘Something should be given to her to eat’”
5:43	j8ro		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	δοθῆναι αὐτῇ	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

6:intro	kl7n				0	# Mark 6 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n2. The ministry of Jesus in Galilee (1:14–8:26)\n      * Moving away from Galilee and then returning (6:1–8:26)\n        * Jesus teaches in his hometown (6:1–6)\n        * Jesus sends out the Twelve (6:7–13)\n        * Herod hears about Jesus (6:14–16)\n        * Flashback: Herod executes John the Baptist (6:17–29)\n        * Jesus feeds 5,000 men (6:30–44)\n        * Jesus walks on water (6:45–52)\n        * Jesus heals people in the region of Gennesaret (6:53–56)\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Jesus’ instructions on how to travel\n\nJesus instructs the disciples not to bring money, food, or extra clothing with them when they travel and preach the good news. Instead, he wants the disciples to rely on the hospitality of people they visit. Make sure that your translation indicates that the disciples should not pack money, food, or extra clothing because they will be staying with people who welcome and provide for them.\n\n### Herod and Herodias\n\nThe man named “King Herod” ([6:14](../06/14.md)) ruled over the area to the northwest of the Sea of Galilee, which is where Jesus spent much of his ministry. Herodias was married to Herod’s brother Philip, and the two of them had a daughter. However, Herodias divorced Philip and married Herod, who had also divorced his previous wife. Since the Jewish law condemned anyone who married his brother’s wife while his brother was still alive (see [Leviticus 20:21](../lev/20/21.md)), John the Baptist rebuked Herod for doing this. It was in response to this rebuke that Herod had John the Baptist put in prison and eventually executed. Make sure that your translation accurately refers to the relationships between Herod, Herodias, and Herodias’ daughter.\n\n### The miracle of multiplying food\n\nIn [6:30–44](../06/30.md), Mark tells a story in which Jesus provides 5,000 men with food. They were in a place where no people lived, and all the food that Jesus and his disciples had were five loaves of bread and two fish. Despite that, Jesus used the five loaves of bread and the two fish to feed everyone who was there. Mark does not tell us exactly how Jesus did this, but he does say that there were more leftovers than what they started with. Your translation should not explain how Jesus multiplied the food, but it should be clear that he did a miracle.\n\n### The miracle of walking on water\n\nIn [6:45–52](../06/45.md), Mark tells a story in which Jesus walks on top of the Sea of Galilee, even though there was a storm. When Jesus climbs into the boat that the disciples were in, the storm miraculously stops. Your translation should not explain exactly how Jesus walked on the water, but it should be clear that Jesus walking on the water and the storm stopping were both miracles.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### The flashback to John’s death\n\nIn this chapter, Mark includes a story that happened before the stories that appear before and after it in his narrative. Previously, Mark narrates how Jesus sent out the Twelve ([6:7–13](../06/07.md)). Then, he describes how people, and especially Herod Antipas, respond to Jesus (see [6:14–16](../06/14.md)). Then, to explain how Herod responded to Jesus, Mark includes a story that happened earlier. This type of storytelling is called a flashback. Here, the flashback tells about how John the Baptist died (see [6:17–29](../06/17.md)). In [6:30](../06/30.md), Mark returns to the main narrative and tells what happened after the events recorded in [6:7–13](../06/07.md). Make sure that you use a form that shows your readers that [6:17–29](../06/17.md) is a flashback that describes something that happened previously, and [6:30](../06/30.md) continues with the main narrative. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])\n\n### Singular and plural forms of “you”\n\nMany of the forms of “you” in this chapter appear when Jesus is talking to his disciples. Because of this, most forms of “you” in this chapter are plural. You should assume forms of “you” are plural unless a note specifies that the form is singular. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])\n\n### The historic present\n\nTo call attention to a development in the story, Mark uses the present tense in past narration. In this chapter, the historic present occurs in verses 1, 7, 30, 31, 37, 38, 45, 48, and 50. If it would not be natural to do that in your language, you could use the past tense in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense]])
6:1	mi7z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	καὶ	1	Here, the word **And** introduces the next major event in the story.

6:1	lpci		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	ἐξῆλθεν & ἔρχεται	1	In a context such as this, your language might say “came” instead of **went** or “goes” instead of **comes**. Alternate translation: “he came out … goes”
6:1	jcu8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐκεῖθεν	1	Here, the word **there** refers to the house of Jairus, the synagogue ruler. His house was in the town of Capernaum.

Alternate translation: “he astonished many of the ones hearing him, who were saying” or “what he said astonished many of the ones hearing him, who were saying”
6:2	uf10		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οἱ πολλοὶ ἀκούοντες	1	Here, the phrase translated **the many ones hearing him** could refer to: (1) the **many** people who were **hearing him**. In this case, all of the **many** people were astonished. Alternate translation: “all the many people hearing him” (2) **many** of the people who were **hearing him**.

6:2	xeh7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	λέγοντες	1	Consider natural ways of introducing direct quotations in your language. Alternate translation: “and they said”
6:2	bpq5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	πόθεν τούτῳ ταῦτα, καὶ τίς ἡ σοφία ἡ δοθεῖσα τούτῳ, καὶ αἱ δυνάμεις τοιαῦται διὰ τῶν χειρῶν αὐτοῦ γινόμεναι?	1	The people in Jesus’ hometown are using the question form to express their surprise that Jesus has **wisdom** and can do **miracles**. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “We are surprised to see this one doing these things, and we are surprised that this one has been given the wisdom and such miracles happening by his hands.” or “We have no idea where these things that this one does are from, and we do not know what the wisdom that has been given to this one is, and such miracles happening by his hands!”
6:2	s2jg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	πόθεν τούτῳ ταῦτα	1	Here, the phrase **From where to this one {are} these things** asks about the source from which **this one**, Jesus, was able to do **these things**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “What is the source of these things for this one” or “How is this one able to do these things”
6:2	cpf0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τίς ἡ σοφία ἡ δοθεῖσα τούτῳ, καὶ αἱ δυνάμεις τοιαῦται	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **wisdom**, you could express the same idea in another way.

They mean that Jesus is just an ordinary person. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate these questions as statements or exclamations. Alternate translation: “He is only a carpenter, the son of Mary and a brother of James, Joseph, Judas, and Simon. His sisters are here with us.” or “He is only a carpenter! He is the son of Mary a brother of James and Joseph and Judas and Simon! His sisters are right here with us!”
6:3	no4r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ὁ τέκτων	1	The word **carpenter** refers to someone who builds things with wood. If your readers would not be familiar with this type of worker, you could use the name of something similar in your area or you could use a more general term. Alternate translation: “the man who builds with wood” or “the construction worker”
6:3	i9qi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship	ἀδελφὸς	1	Jesus was the older **brother** of these men. They were sons of Mary and Joseph. Since the Father of Jesus was God, and their father was Joseph, Jesus was actually their half-brother. That detail is not normally translated, but if your language has a specific word for “older brother,” you could use it here.
6:3	tlub		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ἰωσῆτος & Ἰούδα & Σίμωνος	1	The words **Joses**, **Judas**, and **Simon** are the names of men.
6:3	cxgx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship	αἱ ἀδελφαὶ αὐτοῦ	1	These were Jesus' younger **sisters**. They were daughteres of Mary and Joseph. Since the Father of Jesus was God, and their father was Joseph, they were actually his half-sisters. That detail is not normally translated, but if your language has a specific word for “younger sister,” you could use it here.
6:3	d2g7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐσκανδαλίζοντο ἐν αὐτῷ	1	Here Mark speaks as if Jesus were a lump or rock that the people in Jesus’ hometown were stumbling on. He means that these people were offended by him and rejected him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “they were offended by him” or “they did not listen to him”
6:3	m412		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐσκανδαλίζοντο ἐν αὐτῷ	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “they were stumbling on him”
6:4	b42w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-exceptions	οὐκ ἔστιν προφήτης ἄτιμος, εἰ μὴ	1	If, in your language, it would appear that Jesus was making a statement here and then contradicting it, you could reword this to avoid using an exception clause. Alternate translation: “A prophet is only without honor”
6:4	l436		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	οὐκ ἔστιν & ἄτιμος	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a positive expression to translate this double negative that consists of the negative particle **not** and the negative preposition **without**. Alternate translation: “has honor” or “is always honored”\n

6:5	ystk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	οὐκ ἐδύνατο ἐκεῖ ποιῆσαι οὐδεμίαν δύναμιν	1	The words translated **not** and **any** are two negative words. In this construction, the second negative does not cancel the first to create a positive meaning. Instead, it gives greater emphasis to the negative. If your language can use two negatives that do not cancel one another to create a positive meaning, you could use a double negative here. If your language does not use two negatives in that way, you could translate with one strong negative, as the ULT does. Alternate translation: “he was able to do not even one miracle there”
6:6-7	swqh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	καὶ ἐθαύμασεν διὰ τὴν ἀπιστίαν αὐτῶν. καὶ περιῆγεν τὰς κώμας, κύκλῳ διδάσκων & καὶ προσκαλεῖται τοὺς δώδεκα, καὶ ἤρξατο αὐτοὺς ἀποστέλλειν δύο δύο, καὶ ἐδίδου αὐτοῖς ἐξουσίαν τῶν πνευμάτων τῶν ἀκαθάρτων	1	Here, the clause **he was going around the villages teaching** could be: (1) the end of the story about Jesus visiting his hometown.

6:7	fd56		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἤρξατο αὐτοὺς ἀποστέλλειν	1	Here, the phrase **began to send them out** indicates that Jesus prepared them for when he would **send them out**. The **Twelve** do not actually leave on their mission until [5:12](../05/12.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “prepared to send them out” or “began to get them ready to send them out”

Alternate translation: “the daughter of Herodias, Herod’s step-daughter” (2) the young woman, named Herodias, was the **daughter** of Herod. She had the same name as the woman Herod had married. Alternate translation: “Herod’s daughter Herodias”

6:23	vwbx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	ἕως ἡμίσους τῆς βασιλείας μου	1	Herod says **up to half of my kingdom** here as an overstatement for emphasis. He means that he will definitely give the young woman what she asks for. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that indicates that Herod is making an overstatement, or you could express the idea more generally. Alternate translation: “even if it were up to half of my kingdom” or “no matter how valuable” or “even if it is very difficult to give”

6:26	c1gn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	διὰ τοὺς ὅρκους καὶ τοὺς συνανακειμένους	1	Here Mark indicates two reasons why Herod kept his word. First, he had made **oaths** that he did not want to break. Second, he had promised in front of **the ones reclining to eat with him**, and it would be embarrassing and shameful to break his promise when everyone had heard it. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make these reasons more explicit. Alternate translation: “because he had used oaths and because the ones reclining to eat with him had heard what he promised”
6:26	gtal		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τοὺς συνανακειμένους	1	In Jesus’ culture, people would usually recline, or lay on one side, at a table when they were eating. If it would be helpful in your language, you could refer to the position in which people eat in your culture, or you could just refer to eating.

6:26	mu7i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	οὐκ ἠθέλησεν ἀθετῆσαι αὐτήν	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a positive expression to translate this double negative that consists of the negative particle **not** and the negative verb **refuse**.

6:30	u01i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	καὶ	1	Here, the word **And** introduces the next major event in the story.

Just as **sheep** without **a shepherd** have no one to lead and take care of them, so the people have no one to lead and take care of them.

Alternate translation: “because, like sheep without a shepherd, they did not know what to do or where to go”
6:35	sei9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἤδη ὥρας πολλῆς γενομένης & ἤδη ὥρα πολλή	1	When Mark says that an **hour** is **much**, he means that it is a time later in the day, probably soon before sunset.

7:intro	vq1j				0	# Mark 7 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n2. The ministry of Jesus in Galilee (1:14–8:26)\n      * Moving away from Galilee and then returning (6:1–8:26)\n        * Argument with the Pharisees and scribes about washing hands (7:1–13)\n        * Jesus teaches about what defiles people (7:14–23)\n        * Jesus meets a Canaanite woman (7:24–30)\n        * Jesus heals a man who is deaf and can barely speak (7:31–37)\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in [7:6–7](../07/06.md), which is a quote from [Isaiah 29:13](../isa/29/13.md).\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### The “tradition of the elders”\n\nThe “tradition of the elders” included interpretations of Moses’ law that Jewish religious leaders had developed and passed down to their disciples, and they to their disciples. These interpretations explained what specific laws meant and how to obey them. Jesus rebuked the religious leaders for specific interpretations of the law that he disagreed with. In this chapter, Jesus and the Pharisees argue about washing hands, honoring parents, and giving gifts to God. When you translate the phrase “tradition of the elders,” use a form that refers to teachings that teachers pass down to their students. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/tradition]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/elder]])\n\n### Washing hands before eating\n\nIn [7:5](../07/05.md), the scribes and Pharisees rebuke Jesus for failing to have his disciples wash their hands before eating. One of the traditions that the Pharisees followed was a requirement that people wash their hands before eating. They did this to make their hands ceremonially clean, not primarily to clean off dirt. Make sure that your translation indicates that Jesus and the Pharisees are debating about ceremonial or ritual washing, not washing off dirt.\n\n### The gift for God\n\nIn [7:10–13](../07/10.md), Jesus rebukes the Pharisees for allowing people to promise to give something to God instead of using it to help their parents. Jesus is not saying that giving things to God is wrong. Instead, he is saying that honoring one’s parents is one of the most important commandments that God gave, and no tradition should prevent people from honoring their parents. Make sure that this meaning is clear in your translation.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Things that go in and out of people\n\nIn [7:14–23](../07/14.md), Jesus speaks about things that are outside people and that go into them, and he speaks about things that are inside people and come out of them. When he speaks about things that are outside people and go into them, he is referring more specifically to food and drink. He teaches that these these things do not make people unclean. When he speaks about things that are inside people and go out of them, he is referring more specifically to people’s thoughts and desires that lead to actions. He teaches that these things do make people unclean. Since Jesus explains what he means when he refers to things going in and out of people, if possible preserve the movement and location language.\n\n### Feeding little dogs\n\nIn [7:27](../07/27.md), Jesus tells the Canaanite woman that it is not right to give food that is meant for children to little dogs. In [7:28](../07/28.md), the woman responds that little dogs eat the little bits of food that fall down from what the children are eating. The children represent Jews, and the little dogs represent non-Jews. The food represents things that Jesus does for people. What Jesus means is that he is supposed to do things for Jews first, before he does things for non-Jews. What the woman means is that what she is asking Jesus to do is unimportant enough that he can do it without taking away from what he does for Jews. If possible, do not directly express the meaning of what Jesus and the woman say about little dogs, but make sure that your translation can naturally imply this meaning.\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Verse 16\n\nSome of the earliest manuscripts do not include anything for [7:16](../07/16.md). Some early manuscripts and many later manuscripts include the following words: “If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear.” Since the earliest manuscripts do not include these words, the ULT and UST include these words in brackets. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to omit these words. If it would be helpful, you could put the words in brackets or in a footnote. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])\n\n### Singular and plural forms of “you”\n\nMany of the forms of “you” in this chapter appear when Jesus is talking to groups of people. Because of this, most forms of “you” in this chapter are plural. You should assume forms of “you” are plural unless a note specifies that the form is singular. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])\n\n### The historic present\n\nTo call attention to a development in the story, Mark uses the present tense in past narration. In this chapter, the historic present occurs in verses 1, 5, 18, 28, 32, and 34. If it would not be natural to do that in your language, you could use the past tense in your translation. Alternate translation: (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense]])

See the ULT. (2) end the sentence that began in verse 1. In this case, the explanatory information in verses 3–4 stands by itself, and a new sentence begins in verse 5. If you use the following alternate translation, you will need to delete the dash at the end of verse 4 and start a new sentence at the beginning of verse 5. Alternate translation: “And the Pharisees and some of the scribes are being gathered to him, having come from Jerusalem and having seen some of his disciples, that they eat bread with defiled hands, that is, unwashed.” (3) be a sentence fragment that stands by itself, with the implication being that the Pharisees disapproved of what they saw.

Alternate translation: “having seen some of his disciples eating”
7:2	a7xf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	ἐσθίουσιν τοὺς ἄρτους	1	The Pharisees and scribes are using **bread** to represent any food.

7:4	qhd4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ξεστῶν	1	A **pitcher** is a container for holding liquids. This specific type of container could hold about half a liter, or about one pint.

7:11	cd57		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate	κορβᾶν	1	The word **Corban** is a Hebrew word. Mark has spelled it out using Greek letters so his readers would know how it sounded.

8:intro	ry56				0	# Mark 8 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n2. The ministry of Jesus in Galilee (1:14–8:26)\n      * Moving away from Galilee and then returning (6:1–8:26)\n        * Jesus feeds 4,000 people (8:1–10)\n        * The Pharisees test Jesus (8:11–13)\n        * The yeast of the Pharisees and Herod (8:14–21)\n        * Jesus heals a blind man (8:22–26)\n3. Progress toward Jerusalem; Jesus repeatedly predicts his own death; the disciples misunderstand, and Jesus teaches them how difficult it will be to follow him (8:27–10:52)\n      * Who Jesus really is (8:27–30)\n      * What Jesus and his disciples must do (8:31–9:1)\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### The miracle of multiplying food\n\nIn [8:1–10](../08/01.md), Mark tells a story in which Jesus provides 4,000 people with food. All these people were in a place where no people lived, and all the food that Jesus and his disciples had were seven loaves of bread and a few fish. Despite that, Jesus used the seven loaves of bread and the few fish to feed everyone who was there. Mark does not tell us exactly how Jesus did this, but he does say that there were more leftovers than what they started with. Your translation should not explain how Jesus multiplied the food, but it should be clear that he did a miracle. Mark told a similar story about how Jesus fed 5,000 men in [6:30–44](../06/30.md), so see how you expressed the ideas there.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### The yeast of the Pharisees and the yeast of Herod\n\nIn [8:14–21](../08/14.md), Jesus tells his disciples to watch out for the “yeast” of the Pharisees and the “yeast” of Herod. The disciples misunderstand him and think that he is saying something about bread, which they forgot to bring with them. In response, Jesus reminds them that he is not talking about lack of bread, since he has proved twice that he can multiply food. He implies that “yeast” refers to what the Pharisees and Herod teach and do. Since the disciples misunderstanding “yeast” is an important part of this passage, and since Jesus never directly explains what “yeast” means, if possible you should avoid making that idea more explicit. If you do explain what “yeast” means, if possible only do so after Jesus has made it clear that he is not speaking about literal yeast. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Singular and plural forms of “you”\n\nMany of the forms of “you” in this chapter appear when Jesus is talking to his disciples. Because of this, most forms of “you” in this chapter are plural. You should assume forms of “you” are plural unless a note specifies that the form is singular. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])\n\n### The historic present\n\nTo call attention to a development in the story, Mark uses the present tense in past narration. In this chapter, the historic present occurs in verses 1, 6, 12, 17, 19, 20, 22, 29, and 33. If it would not be natural to do that in your language, you could use the past tense in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense]])\n

Alternate translation: “The crowd is remaining with me already three days and does not have anything that they might eat, so I have compassion on them”
8:2	drmz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	σπλαγχνίζομαι ἐπὶ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **compassion**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “I sympathize with”

If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation.

8:6	x2jr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	ἀναπεσεῖν ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς	1	In Jesus’ culture, people would usually **recline**, or lay on one side, when they were eating.

8:6	sygx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἔκλασεν καὶ ἐδίδου	1	Here Mark means that Jesus **broke** the loaves of bread in pieces so that they could be served to the crowds. This was a normal practice in his culture. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. See how you expressed the similar words in [6:41](../06/41.md). Alternate translation: “he divided the loaves into servings and was giving them” or “he broke the loaves into smaller pieces and was giving the pieces”
8:6	p17m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	ἵνα παρατιθῶσιν, καὶ παρέθηκαν τῷ ὄχλῳ	1	The clauses **so that they might set {them} before {them}, and they set {them} before the crowd** contains extra information that would be unnatural to express in some languages. If this is true of your language, you could shorten the expression. Alternate translation: “so that they set them before the crowd” or “and they were setting them before crowd”
8:7	bio6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	εἶπεν καὶ ταῦτα παρατιθέναι	1	It may be more natural in your language to have a direct quotation here. Alternate translation: “he said, ‘Set these also before them’”

8:9	m81z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	δὲ	1	Mark uses the word **Now** to introduce background information that helps the readers understand how amazing what Jesus did was.

9:intro	n92j				0	# Mark 9 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n3. Progress toward Jerusalem; Jesus repeatedly predicts his own death; the disciples misunderstand, and Jesus teaches them how difficult it will be to follow him (8:27–10:52)\n      * Jesus is transfigured (9:1–8)\n      * Jesus and the disciples discuss Elijah (9:9–13)\n      * Jesus heals a demon-possessed boy (9:14–29)\n      * Jesus predicts his suffering and death (9:30–32)\n      * Jesus teaches about how his disciples should behave (9:33–50)\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### “transfigured”\n\nIn [9:1–8](../09/01.md), Mark describes how Jesus was “transfigured.” This word indicates that Jesus looked very different to the disciples. Mark does not tell us all the ways in which Jesus looked different, but he does say that Jesus’ clothes became extremely white. What this means is that the disciples were able to see some of the glory and majesty that Jesus has as God’s Son. Make sure that your translation shows that Jesus looked great and glorious.\n\n### Elijah\n\nWhen Jesus was transfigured, the disciples saw Moses and Elijah talking with him. Later, they ask Jesus about Elijah. They refer specifically to what the scribes say about a prophecy in [Malachi 4:5–6](../mal/04/05.md), which indicates that God will send “Elijah” to prepare the way before God comes to judge his enemies and reward his people. Malachi is referring to a prophet who lived even earlier. This prophet, named Elijah, performed many miracles and spoke messages from God (see [1 Kings 17–19](../1ki/17/01.md) and [2 Kings 2:1–17](../2ki/02/01.md)). The disciples ask about whether this Elijah is supposed to come before the Messiah does. Jesus says that this is true, and he talks about this “Elijah” in a way that shows the disciples that John the Baptist was “Elijah.” He means that John fulfills the prophecy in Malachi that someone like the prophet Elijah will prepare the way before God comes to judge and reward people. If your readers would not know the prophecy in Malachi or the stories about the prophet Elijah, you may need to include some of this information in your translation or in a footnote. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/names/elijah]])\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Hyperbole\n\nIn [9:43–48](../09/43.md), Jesus commands his disciples to cut off or throw out body parts that cause them to sin. He uses this extreme example of resisting sin in order to show his disciples how serious sin really is. He does not mean that believers should always cut off body parts when they sin. Jesus intends his commands to be shocking, however, so you should preserve the extreme language. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that indicates that Jesus’ commands are extreme language.\n\n### Stumbling\n\nIn [9:42–47](../09/42.md), Jesus discusses people and things that cause “stumbling”. He uses this term to refer to sinning. See the notes on these verses for translation options.\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Singular and plural forms of “you”\n\nMost of the forms of “you” in this chapter appear in conversations, and many of the conversations are with one person. Because of this, the majority of the forms of “you” in this chapter are singular. So, you should assume forms of “you” are singular unless a note specifies that the form is plural. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])\n\n### The historic present\n\nTo call attention to a development in the story, Mark uses the present tense in past narration. In this chapter, the historic present occurs in verses 2, 5, 19, and 35. If it would not be natural to do that in your language, you could use the past tense in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense]])\n\n### The allusion to Isaiah 66:24 in verse 48\n\nIn verse 48, Jesus uses words that are very similar to words in [Isaiah 66:24](../isa/66/24.md). However, Jesus does not introduce his words as a quotation. So, Jesus is not directly quoting from Isaiah, but he intended his audience to think of [Isaiah 66:24](../isa/66/24.md) when they heard what he said. If your readers would not think of [Isaiah 66:24](../isa/66/24.md), you could refer to it in a footnote.\n\n### Verses 44 and 46\n\nSome of the earliest manuscripts do not include anything for [9:44](../09/44.md) and [9:46](../09/46.md). Some early manuscripts and many later manuscripts include the following words in each verse: “where their worm does not end, and the fire is not quenched.” Since these words also appear in all of the manuscripts in [9:48](../09/48.md), it is likely that people who copied the manuscripts accidentally or intentionally added these words earlier as verses 44 and 46. Since the earliest manuscripts do not include these words, the ULT and UST include these words in brackets. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to omit these words. If it would be helpful, you could put the words in brackets or in a footnote. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
9:1	q4b6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἔλεγεν αὐτοῖς	1	Here, the pronoun **he** refers to Jesus. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state who **he** refers to in your translation. Alternate translation: “Jesus was saying to them”
9:1	ad4e			ἀμὴν, λέγω ὑμῖν	1	Jesus says this to emphasize what he is about to tell his audience. Use a natural form in your language for emphasizing the truth and importance of a statement. Alternate translation: “I can assure you”
9:1	lsa2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	ὑμῖν	1	Because Jesus is speaking to everyone who was there, the word **you** here is plural.
9:1	kg4x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	οἵτινες οὐ μὴ γεύσωνται θανάτου	1	The phrase **taste death** is an idiom which means “to experience death.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your culture or state the meaning using plain language. Alternate translation: “who will certainly not experience death”
9:1	qloy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	οἵτινες οὐ μὴ γεύσωνται θανάτου	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **death**, you can express the idea behind the abstract noun **death** by using the verb form. Alternate translation: “who will certainly not die”
9:1	f95z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	οὐ μὴ	1	The words translated **certainly not** are two negative words. In this construction, the second negative does not cancel the first to create a positive meaning. Instead, it gives greater emphasis to the negative. If your language can use two negatives that do not cancel one another to create a positive meaning, you could use a double negative here. If your language does not use two negatives in that way, you could translate with one strong negative, as the ULT does. Alternate translation: “by no means”
9:1	yjf6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὴν Βασιλείαν τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐληλυθυῖαν	1	Here Jesus speaks as if **the kingdom of God** were a person who could **come**. He means that God will establish or begin his **kingdom**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable figure of speech or state the meaning plainly.

If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces the next event. Alternate translation: “Then, after six days had passed” or “Six days after those things happened”
9:2	uf5f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	κατ’ ἰδίαν μόνους	1	The terms **by themselves** and **alone** mean similar things. Mark is using the two terms together for emphasis.

9:2	krt6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	μετεμορφώθη	1	The word **transfigured** means to be changed in appearance or form.

Alternate translation: “his appearance was changed” or “he began to look different”
9:2	b3bb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	μετεμορφώθη	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

9:2	jjlt			ἔμπροσθεν αὐτῶν	1	Alternate translation: “in front of them” or “as they watched”

If your readers would not be familiar with the meaning of the word **launderer**, you could state the meaning in plain language. Alternate translation: “whiter than any person who bleached cloth could make them” or “such as no person on earth who washed cloth could make them”
9:4	f2d6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	ὤφθη αὐτοῖς Ἠλείας σὺν Μωϋσεῖ	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “they saw Elijah with Moses”
9:4	r3uu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	αὐτοῖς	1	Here, the word **them** refers to Peter, James, and John. If it would be helpful in your language, you could refer to them more directly. Alternate translation: “by Peter, James, and John”

9:5	w6vs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀποκριθεὶς	1	Here, the word **answering** indicates that Peter was responding to what he saw. He was not answering a question. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “in response to seeing those things”\n
9:5	iqc9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἡμᾶς	1	By **us**, Peter could mean: (1) everyone who was there, including himself, the other two disciples, Jesus, Moses, and Elijah. Alternate translation: “for us all” (2) just himself and the other two disciples. Alternate translation: “for us disciples”
9:5	i0iw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ποιήσωμεν	1	By **us**, Peter here means himself and the other two disciples, not Jesus, Elijah, and Moses. So, use the exclusive form of that word in your translation if your language marks that distinction.\n
9:5	k3y1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	σκηνάς	1	The term **tents** means simple, temporary places in which to sit or sleep. Peter probably had in mind that they would build them from the materials available on the mountain such as tree branches. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to this kind of temporary shelter. Alternate translation: “booths”
9:6	r3bn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	οὐ γὰρ ᾔδει τί ἀποκριθῇ; ἔκφοβοι γὰρ ἐγένοντο	1	This entire verse is a parenthetical statement which gives background information about Peter, James, and John. Use the natural form in your language for expressing background information. Alternate translation: “Now as a matter of fact, he did not know what he should answer, for they were terrified”
9:6	w4qz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	οὐ & ᾔδει τί ἀποκριθῇ; ἔκφοβοι γὰρ ἐγένοντο	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these clauses, since the second clause gives the reason for the result that the first clause describes. Alternate translation: “because they were terrified, he did not know what he should answer”
9:6	f8hn			ἔκφοβοι & ἐγένοντο	1	Alternate translation: “they were very frightened” or “they were very afraid”
9:7	e3id		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐπισκιάζουσα	1	Here Mark could be implying that: (1) the cloud enveloped or surrounded them. Alternate translation: “enveloping” or “surrounding” (2) the cloud cast a shadow on them. Alternate translation: “casting a shadow on”

Alternate translation: “a person was speaking” or “God the Father spoke”
9:7	ybu6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	ὁ Υἱός μου, ὁ ἀγαπητός	1	The word **Son** is an important title for Jesus, the **Son** of God.
9:7	ql9p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ὁ Υἱός μου, ὁ ἀγαπητός	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “my Son, whom I love”

This prophecy states that God will send **Elijah** before the day of the Lord arrives, and he will prepare people. Elijah was a prophet who did many powerful things a long time before Malachi wrote down this prophecy. The **scribes** teach that this means that **Elijah** must come before the Messiah does.

9:12	o8hf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense	Ἠλείας μὲν ἐλθὼν πρῶτον ἀποκατιστάνει πάντα	1	Here Jesus uses the present tense to describe something that is generally true.

9:12	qno2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	καὶ	1	Here, the word **And** introduces something further that Jesus wants the disciples to think about. What he asks about at first appears to contrast with what he has said about Elijah. However, in the following verse Jesus will show how these things actually go together.

9:12	toik		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	γέγραπται	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who did the action, it is clear from the context that it was God speaking through prophets. Alternate translation: “did the prophets say” or “did God have the prophets write”
9:12	ldt3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	τὸν Υἱὸν τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου, ἵνα & πάθῃ	1	Here Jesus speaks about himself in the third person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use the first person. Alternate translation: “me, who am the Son of Man, that I would suffer”

9:14	dgk7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	ἐλθόντες	1	In a context such as this, your language might say “gone” instead of **come**. Alternate translation: “having gone”

He is addressing the entire **generation** of people who were living at that time, and they are not all present to hear him.

9:22	vwcw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	βοήθησον ἡμῖν	1	This is an imperative, but it should be translated as a polite request rather than as a command. It may be helpful to add an expression such as “please” to make this clear. Alternate translation: “I ask that you help us”
9:22	y1qc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἡμῖν & ἡμᾶς	1	By **us**, the man means himself and his son but not Jesus, so use the exclusive form of that word in your translation if your language marks that distinction.

Alternate translation: “whoever receives one of these little children in my name, it is as if he or she received me” or “whoever receives one of these little children in my name proves that he or she would receive me”
9:37	h242		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἓν τῶν τοιούτων παιδίων	1	Here Jesus is referring to **little children** like the little child whom he set in their midst (see [9:36](../09/36.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “any little child like the one standing here” or “any little child, like this one here,”\n
9:37	ul12		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματί μου	1	Here, the phrase **in my name** could mean that: (1) the person receives a little child because the person follows Jesus. Alternate translation: “because that person is acting as my disciple” (2) the person receives the little child because the little child follows Jesus. Alternate translation: “because the child is my disciple”

He means that these people, by receiving him, show that they would receive God too. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in simile form or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “whoever receives me, it is as if he or she did not receive me but the one having sent me” or “the one receiving me proves that he or she would not only receive me but also the one having sent me”
9:37	uik3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	οὐκ ἐμὲ δέχεται, ἀλλὰ τὸν ἀποστείλαντά με	1	Jesus says **does not receive me** here as an overstatement for emphasis. He means that the people who receive him are not just receiving him but are also receiving God, who sent him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different way to express the emphasis. Alternate translation: “receives not just me but also the one having sent me” or “does not receive me only but also the one having sent me”
9:37	y24n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὸν ἀποστείλαντά με	1	Here Jesus implies that **the one having sent** him is God the Father. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “God, the one who sent me”
9:38	a3d3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	εἴδομέν & ἐκωλύομεν & ἡμῖν	1	When John says **we** and **us**, he is speaking of himself and the other disciples, so **we** and **us** would be exclusive, if your language marks that distinction.
9:38	dxq5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐν τῷ ὀνόματί σου	1	Here, **name** is a way of referring to a person by reference to something associated with him.

9:38	rmm2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	ἐν τῷ ὀνόματί σου & καὶ ἐκωλύομεν αὐτόν	1	Many ancient manuscripts read **in your name, and we were preventing him**. The ULT follows that reading. Other ancient manuscripts read “in your name who does not follow us, and we were preventing him.” If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of the ULT.
9:38	vpiz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ἐκωλύομεν αὐτόν, ὅτι οὐκ ἠκολούθει ἡμῖν	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these clauses, since the second clause gives the reason for the result that the first clause describes. Alternate translation: “because he was not following with us, we were preventing him”
9:38	k2i2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	οὐκ ἠκολούθει ἡμῖν	1	Here, **following** does not seem to mean “to be one of Jesus’ disciples”, since this man was claiming to act in Jesus’ **name**. Here, **following with us** means that this man did not travel in the group of Jesus and his disciples. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “he was not traveling with us in our group” or “he was not part of our group”
9:39-40	xrm3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge	ὁ δὲ Ἰησοῦς εἶπεν, μὴ κωλύετε αὐτόν; οὐδεὶς γάρ ἐστιν ὃς ποιήσει δύναμιν ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματί μου, καὶ δυνήσεται ταχὺ κακολογῆσαί με & ὃς γὰρ οὐκ ἔστιν καθ’ ἡμῶν, ὑπὲρ ἡμῶν ἐστιν	1	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could combine [9:39](../09/39.md) and [9:40](../09/40.md) into a verse bridge in order to include the reasons for Jesus’ command not to **prevent** the man before including the command. Alternate translation: “But Jesus said, ‘Whoever is not against us is for us. In fact, there is no one who will do a mighty work in my name and will be able soon afterwards to speak evil about me. Therefore, do not prevent him”

Alternate translation: “There is no one who will do a mighty work in my name and will be able soon afterwards to speak evil about me, so do not prevent him”
9:39	oynl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	μὴ κωλύετε αὐτόν	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a positive expression to translate this double negative that consists of the negative particle **not** and the negative verb **prevent**. Alternate translation: “Allow him to continue”
9:39	ouab		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	μὴ κωλύετε	1	Because Jesus is speaking to his disciples, the command **Do not prevent** is plural.
9:39	wyk3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense	ποιήσει & δυνήσεται	1	Here Jesus uses the future tense to describe something that is generally true.

9:39	yw2q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματί μου	1	See how you translated **name** in [9:38](../09/38.md). Alternate translation: “on my behalf” or “as my representative” or “by my authority”
9:39	h7ez		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	κακολογῆσαί	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **evil**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “to say evil things about”
9:40	ozrh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	Here, the word **For** introduces a reason for what Jesus has just told his disciples. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a reason or basis for a statement, or you could leave **For** untranslated. Alternate translation: “That is because” or “Here is why:”
9:40	tma4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	οὐκ ἔστιν καθ’ ἡμῶν, ὑπὲρ ἡμῶν ἐστιν	1	Here, the phrase **against us** describes people who attack or hate Jesus and his disciples. The phrase **for us** describes people who support or are friendly to Jesus and his disciples. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use comparable phrases or state the meaning plainly.

9:40	hp68		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἡμῶν	-1	By **us**, Jesus means himself and his disciples, so use the inclusive form of that word in your translation if your language marks that distinction.
9:41	gzql		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1	Here, the word **For** introduces an example that explains what Jesus has just said. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces an example, or you could leave **For** untranslated.

9:41	lz5d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὃς & ἂν ποτίσῃ ὑμᾶς ποτήριον ὕδατος	1	Jesus speaks about giving someone **a cup of water** to drink as an example of one small way in which a person can help another person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could indicate that this is an example, or you could use a more general expression. Alternate translation: “whoever, for example, gives you a cup of water” or “whoever helps you in any way”
9:41	nmx2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	ὑμᾶς & ἐστε & ὑμῖν	1	Because Jesus is talking to his disciples, the word **you** throughout this verse is plural.

9:41	ypgl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	Χριστοῦ ἐστε	1	Jesus is speaking about himself in the third person. If this would not be natural in your language, you could use the first person form. Alternate translation: “you belong to me, Christ”
9:41	bpz5			ἀμὴν, λέγω ὑμῖν	1	Jesus says this to emphasize what he is about to tell his disciples. Use a natural form in your language for emphasizing the truth and importance of a statement. Alternate translation: “I can assure you”
9:41	bgq1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes	οὐ μὴ ἀπολέσῃ	1	Jesus is using a figure of speech here that expresses a strongly positive meaning by using a negative phrase, **certainly not**, together with an expression that is the opposite of the intended meaning, **lose**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the positive meaning. Alternate translation: “he will most certainly receive”
9:41	jjq5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	οὐ μὴ ἀπολέσῃ τὸν μισθὸν αὐτοῦ	1	Although the pronouns **he** and **his** are masculine, they are being used here in a generic sense that includes both men and women. Alternate translation: “that person will certainly not lose his or her reward”
9:41	wnb2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	οὐ μὴ	1	The words translated **certainly not** are two negative words. In this construction, the second negative does not cancel the first to create a positive meaning. Instead, it gives greater emphasis to the negative. If your language can use two negatives that do not cancel one another to create a positive meaning, you could use a double negative here. If your language does not use two negatives in that way, you could translate with one strong negative, as the ULT does. Alternate translation: “by no means”
9:42	nhbw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	καὶ	1	Here, the word **And** introduces a situation that contrasts with the situation that Jesus described in the previous verse.

If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces this kind of contrast, or you could leave **And** untranslated. Alternate translation: “In contrast,” or “However,”
9:42	v8qw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	σκανδαλίσῃ ἕνα τῶν μικρῶν τούτων τῶν πιστευόντων εἰς ἐμέ	1	Here, Jesus is speaking of sinning as if it were stumbling. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin”
9:42	cj0l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἕνα τῶν μικρῶν τούτων τῶν πιστευόντων εἰς ἐμέ	1	The phrase **these little ones** could refer: (1) to people who are not important from a human perspective. Alternate translation: “one of these unimportant people who believe in me” (2) to children who love Jesus and who are physically **little** compared to adults. Alternate translation: “one of these children who believe in me” (3) to people whose faith is new and has not yet become mature and strong.

9:42	gef5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καλόν ἐστιν αὐτῷ μᾶλλον εἰ	1	Here Jesus implies that what he is about to describe is **better** than being punished by God for causing one of these little ones to sin.

9:42	t9fo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	αὐτῷ & αὐτοῦ & βέβληται	1	Although the terms **him**, **his**, and **he** are masculine, Jesus is using the words in a generic sense that includes both men and women.

9:42	bami		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	περίκειται μύλος ὀνικὸς περὶ τὸν τράχηλον αὐτοῦ, καὶ βέβληται εἰς τὴν θάλασσαν	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who did the action, you could use an indefinite subject. Alternate translation: “that people might put a millstone of a donkey around his neck and throw him into the sea”
9:42	z6k5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	μύλος ὀνικὸς	1	A **millstone** was a round stone used for grinding grain into flour. The phrase **of a donkey** indicates that this kind of **millstone** was heavy enough that it took a **donkey** to turn it. If your readers would not be familiar with this type of stone, you could use the name of something similar in your area or you could use a more general term. Alternate translation: “a very large rock” or “a very heavy object”
9:42	bx6c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	περίκειται & περὶ τὸν τράχηλον αὐτοῦ	1	The implication is that someone would tie the **millstone** around the person’s neck. If it would be helpful in your language, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “is attached to his neck”

Alternate translation: “it is your hand’s fault that you stumble” or “you stumble with your hand”
9:43	m3k1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd	σκανδαλίσῃ σε & σου, ἀπόκοψον αὐτήν & σε	1	Even though Jesus is speaking to many disciples, he is addressing an individual situation, so **your** and **you** throughout this verse as well as the command **cut it off** are singular. But if the singular form would not be natural in your language for someone who is speaking to a group of people, you could use plural forms in your translation. If you do so, you may also need to make some other words plural.
9:43	gxu4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	σκανδαλίσῃ σε	1	Here, Jesus is speaking of sinning as if it were stumbling. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “causes you to sin”
9:43	qo45		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	ἀπόκοψον αὐτήν	1	Here Jesus provides the most extreme response to sinning. He does not mean that this should be the normal way to deal with sin.

9:43	h9lh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὴν ζωὴν	1	Here Jesus implies that this **life** is everlasting or undying life. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “true life” or “everlasting life”
9:43	wlu7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τὴν Γέενναν	1	Here Jesus uses the name **Gehenna** to refer to hell. The valley named **Gehenna** was outside the city of Jerusalem and was a place where people threw out and burned garbage. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a simile or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “a place like the valley of Gehenna” or “hell, which is like Gehenna valley”
9:43	ttl7			εἰς τὸ πῦρ τὸ ἄσβεστον	1	Here, the phrase **the unquenchable fire** refers to **Gehenna**, or hell, and describes it as a very unpleasant place. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in simile form or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “which is as hot as unquenchable fire” or “a terrible place”

If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a related explanation, or you could leave **For** untranslated. Alternate translation: “Further,” or “As a matter of fact,”
9:49	mr5y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	πᾶς & ἁλισθήσεται	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who did the action, it is clear from the context that it was God. Alternate translation: “God will salt everyone”
9:49	ma3s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	πυρὶ ἁλισθήσεται	1	Here Jesus speaks as if people were food or sacrifices that **will be salted with fire**. In Jesus’ culture, people would put salt on their food and on sacrifices that they offered to God. The salt preserved the food and made it taste better. When someone is salted **with fire**, it most likely refers to that person experiencing difficult or painful situations that eventually help and sanctify that person. However, Jesus does not explain the metaphor, and Christians disagree on what it means. If possible, preserve the metaphor or express the idea in simile form. If necessary, you could state more explicitly that Jesus is referring to some form of suffering and its effects on people. Alternate translation: “will experience something like being salted with fire” or “will suffer as if they were being burned, and that will help them as if they were being salted”
9:49	mlnp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	πυρὶ	1	Many ancient manuscripts read **with fire**. The ULT follows that reading. Other ancient manuscripts include the words “and every sacrifice will be salted with salt” after **with fire**. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of the ULT.
9:50	qt9a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables	καλὸν τὸ ἅλας	1	To teach the disciples, Jesus offers a story or illustration. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “Listen to this illustration: Salt is good”
9:50	oaep		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical	ἐὰν & τὸ ἅλας ἄναλον γένηται, ἐν τίνι	1	Jesus means that it is possible for **salt** to become **unsalty**, and he is speaking about what can or cannot happen after **salt** has become **unsalty**. Use a natural form in your language for introducing a situation that could happen. Alternate translation: “suppose that the salt becomes unsalty. With what”
9:50	rb7r			ἄναλον γένηται	1	Alternate translation: “loses its salty taste”
9:50	fqb8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	ἐν τίνι αὐτὸ ἀρτύσετε?	1	Jesus is using the question form to show that no one can make ruined salt salty again. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “you cannot season it with anything!” or “you are not able to season it.”\n
9:50	t76n			αὐτὸ ἀρτύσετε	1	Alternate translation: “will you make it taste salty again”
9:50	gims		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	ἀρτύσετε & ἔχετε & εἰρηνεύετε	1	Because Jesus is talking to his disciples, the word **you** and the commands **Have** and **be at peace** are plural.
9:50	f34y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἔχετε ἐν ἑαυτοῖς ἅλα	1	Here Jesus commands his disciples to have **salt** in themselves. Just as salt makes food better in many ways, so Jesus’ disciples can make the world better in many ways. If possible, preserve the figure of speech or use simile form since it refers back to the illustration Jesus just gave. Alternate translation: “Be like food that has salt in it” or “Help others as if you had salt in yourselves”
9:50	syc9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	εἰρηνεύετε	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **peace**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “act peaceably”
10:intro	bq25				0	# Mark 10 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n3. Progress toward Jerusalem; Jesus repeatedly predicts his own death; the disciples misunderstand, and Jesus teaches them how difficult it will be to follow him (8:27–10:52)\n      * Jesus teaches about marriage and divorce (10:1–12)\n      * Jesus blesses little children (10:13–16)\n      * Jesus talks with a rich man (10:17–22)\n      * Jesus teaches about wealth, possessions, and the kingdom (10:23–31)\n      * Jesus predicts his death and resurrection (10:32–34)\n      * Jesus and the disciples speak about who will be great (10:35–45)\n      * Jesus heals blind Bartimaeus (10:46–52)\n\nSome translations set quotations farther to the right than the rest of the text to make them easier to read. The ULT does this with the quotations in [10:6–8](../10/06.md), which are from [Genesis 1:27](../gen/01/27.md) and [Genesis 2:24](../gen/02/24.md).\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Divorce\n\nIn [10:2](../10/02.md), the Pharisees test Jesus by asking him about an issue that was controversial among Jewish religious leaders: divorce. More specifically, the religious leaders argued about whether men could divorce their wives and about what were valid grounds for divorce. So, they ask Jesus about this. When Jesus asks what Moses wrote in the Law, the Pharisees refer to [Deuteronomy 24:1–4](../deu/24/01.md), which assumes that men do divorce their wives. Jesus responds that this section of the Law exists only because the Israelites were stubborn. He means that God knew that the Israelite men would sometimes divorce their wives, so he included a law about how to do it. Then Jesus argues that divorce is never what God wants, and he quotes from Genesis 1 and 2 to prove this. He further says that any divorced person who marries again is involved in adultery. Make sure that it is clear that both Jesus and the Pharisees are making arguments based on the Scriptures.\n\n### Rich people and the kingdom of God\n\nIn Jesus’ culture, many people thought that rich people had been specifically blessed by God. When Jesus said that it was extremely difficult for rich people to enter God’s kingdom (see [10:23–25](../10/23.md)), the disciples were shocked. They thought that if it was hard for rich people to enter the kingdom, it would be impossible for everyone else. That is why they ask the question, “And who is able to be saved?” ([10:26](../10/26.md)). If your readers might not understand why the disciples respond in this way, you may need to include a footnote that explains some of this information.\n\n### Sitting at Jesus’ right and left hand\n\nIn [10:37](../10/37.md) and [10:40](../10/40.md), Jesus and James and John refer to sitting at Jesus’ right hand and at his left hand. They are referring to the places of honor at the right and left side of a king or ruler. The people who sit in these places have authority and are respected the most after the king or ruler. Make sure that this meaning is clear in your translation. See the notes on these two verses for translation options.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Drinking the cup\n\nIn [10:38–39](../10/38.md), Jesus refers to a “cup” from which he is going to drink. He is using a figure of speech from the Old Testament that refers to experiencing suffering and pain (for example, see [Psalm 75:8](../psa/75/08.md) and [Isaiah 51:17](../isa/51/17.md)). He means that he will experience suffering, and his disciples must be ready to experience it as well. Since this figure of speech is from the Old Testament, if possible you should preserve it or express the idea in simile form. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n### Being baptized with a baptism\n\nIn [10:38–39](../10/38.md), Jesus refers to a “baptism” with which he and his disciples will be “baptized.” He means that, just as people who are baptized are covered with water, he and his disciples will be overwhelmed by suffering and difficult circumstances. Since baptism is an important concept in the Bible, if possible you should preserve the figure of speech or express the idea in simile form. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Singular and plural forms of “you”\n\nMost of the forms of “you” in this chapter appear in conversations, and many of the conversations are with one person. Because of this, the majority of the forms of “you” in this chapter are singular. So, you should assume forms of “you” are singular unless a note specifies that the form is plural. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])\n\n### The historic present\n\nTo call attention to a development in the story, Mark uses the present tense in past narration. In this chapter, the historic present occurs in verses 2, 5, 19, and 35. If it would not be natural to do that in your language, you could use the past tense in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense]])

This passage discusses divorce and remarriage, and it mentions the use of **a certificate of divorce**. The Pharisees interpreted this passage to mean that men could divorce their wives, but they had to use **a certificate of divorce**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could include some of this information in your translation or in a footnote. Alternate translation: “In the Law, Moses permitted a husband to write a certificate of divorce and then to divorce his wife”
10:4	vpgb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	βιβλίον ἀποστασίου γράψαι	1	Here the Pharisees imply that the husband must also give the **certificate of divorce** to his wife.

10:5	slxl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	πρὸς τὴν σκληροκαρδίαν ὑμῶν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **hardness**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “Because your hearts are hard”

Alternate translation: “But from the beginning of creation, as the Scriptures say, God made them male and female.

Alternatively, you could combine the two clauses. Alternate translation: “Permit the little children to come to me; yes, do not forbid them” or “Permit the little children to come to me”

Alternate translation: “the kingdom of God belongs to the ones such as these” or “the ones such as these belong in the kingdom of God”
10:14	jq4e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	τῶν & τοιούτων	1	The pronoun **these** refers to the little children. If this is not clear for your readers, you could refer to the little children more directly. Alternate translation: “of the ones such as these little children”
10:14	gq3e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	τῶν & τοιούτων	1	Jesus is referring to **the little children** and to people who are like them. He does not indicate exactly how these people are like **the little children**, so if possible express the idea in simile form. Alternate translation: “of people who are like these”
10:15	h2ir			ἀμὴν, λέγω ὑμῖν	1	Jesus says this to emphasize what he is about to tell his disciples. Use a natural form in your language for emphasizing the truth and importance of a statement. Alternate translation: “I can assure you”
10:15	e08x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	ὑμῖν	1	Because Jesus is speaking to his disciples, the word **you** here is plural.
10:15	y3a2			ὃς ἂν μὴ δέξηται τὴν Βασιλείαν τοῦ Θεοῦ ὡς παιδίον, οὐ μὴ εἰσέλθῃ εἰς αὐτήν	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the ideas in positive form. Alternate translation: “only whoever receives the kingdom of God as a little child will enter into it”
10:15	a1e7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	ὡς παιδίον	1	Jesus is saying that his disciples should be like **a little child** because little children are humble and thankfully receive gifts.

10:15	q3ck		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	οὐ μὴ	1	The words translated **certainly not** are two negative words. In this construction, the second negative does not cancel the first to create a positive meaning. Instead, it gives greater emphasis to the negative. If your language can use two negatives that do not cancel one another to create a positive meaning, you could use a double negative here. If your language does not use two negatives in that way, you could translate with one strong negative, as the ULT does. Alternate translation: “by no means”
10:16	jq4f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	τιθεὶς τὰς χεῖρας ἐπ’ αὐτά	1	In Mark’s culture, when Jesus placed his hands on the little children, that expressed God’s love for them and conveyed God’s blessing to them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could refer to a similar action from your culture, or you could explain what having laid his hands on them means. See how you translated “touch them” in [10:13](../10/13.md). Alternate translation: “stretching out his hands toward them” or “which he did by placing his hands on them”
10:17	d0iy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	καὶ	1	Here, the word **And** introduces the next major event in the story.

10:17	nffm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	ἐκπορευομένου	1	In a context such as this, your language might say “coming” instead of **going**. Alternate translation: “coming out”

If your language has its own way of introducing new participants, you could use it here in your translation. Alternate translation: “a man ran up to him. He knelt before him and was asking him”
10:17	oh92		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	γονυπετήσας αὐτὸν	1	In this man’s culture, kneeling down before a person was a way to honor a greater person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could refer to a similar action from your culture, or you could explain what kneeling down means. Alternate translation: “having prostrated himself before him” or “having bowed down to him in respect”
10:17	fpp6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ζωὴν αἰώνιον κληρονομήσω	1	Here the man speaks as if he were a child who would receive property from a relative. He speaks in this way to indicate that he wants to receive **eternal life**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I might receive eternal life” or “I might be given eternal life”\n
10:17	h45i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ζωὴν αἰώνιον κληρονομήσω	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of life, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “I might be able to live eternally”
10:18	kjkd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	δὲ	1	Here, the word **But** introduces what Jesus said in contrast to what the man said. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces this kind of contrast, or you could leave **But** untranslated. Alternate translation: “However,”
10:18	uwro		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	τί με λέγεις ἀγαθόν? οὐδεὶς ἀγαθὸς, εἰ μὴ εἷς ὁ Θεός	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these sentences, since the second sentence gives the reason for the result that the first sentence describes. Alternate translation: “No one is good except one—God. So, why are you calling me good?”
10:18	lw1f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τί με λέγεις ἀγαθόν?	1	Jesus is using the question form to rebuke the man for calling another human **good** without thinking carefully about it. Jesus is not denying that he is **good**, but he wants the man to think about it more carefully. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “You are calling me good without thinking carefully.” or “You do not understand what you are saying when you call me good!”
10:18	gyod		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-exceptions	οὐδεὶς ἀγαθὸς, εἰ μὴ εἷς ὁ Θεός	1	If, in your language, it would appear that Jesus was making a statement here and then contradicting it, you could reword this to avoid using an exception clause. Alternate translation: “Only one is good—God” or “No person is good—only God is good”
10:19	qs3e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	τὰς ἐντολὰς οἶδας: μὴ φονεύσῃς, μὴ μοιχεύσῃς, μὴ κλέψῃς, μὴ ψευδομαρτυρήσῃς, μὴ ἀποστερήσῃς, τίμα τὸν πατέρα σου καὶ τὴν μητέρα	1	Here Jesus quotes commands from the law that God gave to Moses. The first four commands and the sixth command come from either [Exodus 20:12–16](../exo/20/12.md) or [Deuteronomy 5:16–20](../deu/05/16.md). The fifth command is not directly quoted from the law that God gave Moses, but it may be a summary of the command found in [Exodus 20:17](../exo/20/17.md) or [Deuteronomy 5:21](../deu/05/21.md). If it would be helpful to your readers, you could format these words in a different way and include this information in a footnote. Alternate translation: “You know the commandments—as you can read in the Scriptures, ‘Do not kill, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not testify falsely, do not defraud, honor your father and your mother’”
10:19	vxpo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	μὴ φονεύσῃς, μὴ μοιχεύσῃς, μὴ κλέψῃς, μὴ ψευδομαρτυρήσῃς, μὴ ἀποστερήσῃς, τίμα τὸν πατέρα σου καὶ τὴν μητέρα	1	Since in these commands God is addressing each specific person who is part of God’s people, the commands are singular.
10:19	hj3v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	μὴ μοιχεύσῃς	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **adultery**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “do not be an adulterer or adulteress” or “do not do what is adulterous”
10:20	qlbg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1	Here, the word **But** introduces the next thing that happened.

10:20	bd3s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐκ νεότητός μου	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **youth**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “since the time when I was a young man” or “from when I was a child”
10:21	ocri		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1	Here, the word **But** introduces the next thing that happened.

10:21	a0hb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	καὶ	3	Here, the word and introduces the result that will follow if the man does **sell** what he owns and **give to the poor**.

10:21	iij4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	δεῦρο, ἀκολούθει μοι	1	Here, the clause **come, follow me** is a command to travel with Jesus and be his disciple. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “be my disciple” or “come with me as my student”
10:21	z24n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	ἀκολούθει μοι	1	Many ancient manuscripts do not include any words after **follow me**. The ULT follows that reading. Other ancient manuscripts include the words “having taken up the cross” after the words **follow me**. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of the ULT.
10:22	dxbx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	δὲ	1	Here, the word **But** introduces how the man reacted in contrast to what Jesus said.

Alternate translation: “because he was having many possessions, having become downcast at this word, he went away being grieved”
10:22	i5v3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	στυγνάσας	1	Here, the phrase **having become downcast** indicates that the man became sad and mournful.

Alternate translation: “Jesus’ statement” or “the words that Jesus said”
10:22	rczv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	λυπούμενος	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “being very sorrowful”

10:24	zqje		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	οἱ & μαθηταὶ ἐθαμβοῦντο ἐπὶ τοῖς λόγοις αὐτοῦ	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say what did the action, it is clear from the context that it was Jesus’ **words**. Alternate translation: “his words astonished the disciples”
10:24	z9z1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀποκριθεὶς	1	Here, the word **answering** indicates that Jesus is responding to how the disciples reacted to what he had said.

Jesus does this to emphasize how hard it is for **a rich {person} to enter into the kingdom of God**. As [10:27](../10/27.md) shows, Jesus does not think that this is completely impossible, however. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea here in such a way that it does not sound as if it is totally impossible for **a rich {person} to enter into the kingdom of God**. Alternate translation: “Consider how difficult it is for a camel to pass through an eye of a needle. That illustrates how difficult it is for a rich person to enter into the kingdom of God”

Alternate translation: “everyone who … will receive”

10:48	l86a			Υἱὲ Δαυείδ, ἐλέησόν με	1	Here Bartimaeus says the same thing he said in [10:47](../10/47.md) except he does not include the name Jesus. Express the idea as you did there.

10:49	pgfm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	εἶπεν, φωνήσατε αὐτόν	1	It may be more natural in your language to have a direct quotation here. Alternate translation: “said to call him”
10:49	po5z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	φωνήσατε	1	Because Jesus is speaking to some of the people in the crowd, the command **Call** is plural.
10:49	ac7h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	φωνοῦσι	1	Here, the pronoun **they** refers to people in the crowd.

10:49	py8t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἔγειρε	1	Here the people who are speaking to Bartimaeus imply that he should walk to where Jesus was after getting up.

10:50	rhrr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀποβαλὼν τὸ ἱμάτιον αὐτοῦ	1	Bartimaeus’ **coat** would have been an outer garment that people could ordinarily take off in public. Bartimaeus probably took it off so that it would be easier for him to hurry to where Jesus was. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make some or all of that information more explicit. Alternate translation: “having thrown aside his jacket” or “having thrown aside his coat so that he could move faster”
10:50	bf2a			ἀναπηδήσας	1	Alternate translation: “having quickly gotten to his feet” or “having immediately stood up”
10:50	jc66		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	ἦλθεν	1	In a context such as this, your language might say “went” instead of **came**. Alternate translation: “went”
10:51	qm1a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	εἶπεν, τί σοι θέλεις ποιήσω?	1	It may be more natural in your language to have an indirect quotation here. Alternate translation: “asked him what he desired him to do for him”
10:51	fcin		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	Ραββουνεί, ἵνα	1	Bartimaeus is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You could supply these words from the previous verse if it would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “Rabbi, I desire that”
10:51	ish0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀναβλέψω	1	Here, Bartimaeus could be implying: (1) that he once could see, and he wants to be able to see once more. Alternate translation: “I might regain my sight” (2) that he wants to be able to see for the first time. Alternate translation: “I might gain my sight” or “I might be able to see”

10:52	omxe		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀνέβλεψεν	1	Here, much as in [10:51](../10/51.md), Mark could be implying: (1) that Bartimaeus once could see, and now he can see once more.

Alternate translation: “he walked with him on the road” or “he went with him on the road”
11:intro	xg3t				0	# Mark 11 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n4. Last days of ministry and preparation for final conflict in Jerusalem (11:1–13:37)\n      * Jesus enters Jerusalem (11:1–11)\n      * Jesus curses a fig tree, part one (11:12–14)\n      * Jesus drives people out of the temple (11:15–19)\n      * Jesus curses a fig tree, part two (11:20–26)\n      * Jesus debates with the Jewish leaders about authority (11:27–33)\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in [11:9–10](../mrk/11/09.md), which includes a quotation from [Psalm 118:26](../psa/118/26.md).\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### The young donkey\n\nIn [11:1–11](../11/01.md), Mark narrates how Jesus rode on a colt, or young donkey, when he entered into Jerusalem. Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John all write about this event. Mark and Luke write that the disciples brought Jesus a colt. John writes that Jesus found a donkey. Matthew writes that the disciples brought Jesus a donkey and a colt. It is best to translate each of these accounts as it appears in the ULT without trying to make them all say exactly the same thing. (See: [Matthew 21:1–7](../mat/21/01.md), [Mark 11:1–7](../mrk/11/01.md), [Luke 19:29–36](../luk/19/29.md), and [John 12:14–15](../jhn/12/14.md))\n\n### Hosanna\n\nThe word “Hosanna” is a Hebrew word spelled out how it sounds in Mark’s language. The word means “save us, please.” By the time of Jesus, however, people would use the word to praise or honor God and others. Consider whether to spell the word out as it sounds or state its meaning. See the notes on [11:9](../11/09.md) and [11:10](../11/10.md) for translation options. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate]])\n\n### Disrupting activity in the temple area\n\nIn [11:15–17](../11/15.md), Jesus disrupts normal activity in the temple by driving out some people and by overturning the chairs and tables of others. Jesus performed this symbolic action to express a specific message. However, Christians debate exactly what the symbolic action means. Jesus could have been protesting against people who were buying and selling dishonestly. He could have been protesting against all buying and selling in the temple area. He could have been indicating that the temple would be destroyed. Your translation should state what Jesus did while allowing for all of these possible interpretations.\n\n### The baptism of John\n\nIn [11:29–33](../11/29.md), Jesus and the chief priests, scribes, and elders discuss “the baptism of John.” Here they are referring to how John baptized people for repentance. Jesus asks them whether they think that John’s baptism came from heaven or from people, which means that he performed baptisms by God’s authority or by human authority. The Jewish leaders decide not to answer the question. See the notes on these verses for ways to refer to John’s baptism and to the authority behind it.\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Singular and plural forms of “you”\n\nMost of the forms of “you” in this chapter appear when Jesus is talking to groups of people. Because of this, most forms of “you” in this chapter are plural. You should assume forms of “you” are plural unless a note specifies that the form is singular. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])\n\n### The historic present\n\nTo call attention to a development in the story, Mark uses the present tense in past narration. In this chapter, the historic present occurs in verses 1, 2, 4, 7, 15, 21, 22, 27, and 33. If it would not be natural to do that in your language, you could use the past tense in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense]])\n\n### Verse 26\n\nMany of the earliest manuscripts do not include anything for [11:26](../11/26.md). A few early manuscripts and many later manuscripts include the following words: “But if you do not forgive, neither will your Father in the heavens forgive your trespasses.” Since a similar sentence appears in [Matthew 6:15](../mat/06/15.md), it is likely that people who copied the manuscripts accidentally or intentionally added these words here in Mark. Since the earliest manuscripts do not include these words, the ULT and UST include these words in brackets. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to omit these words. If it would be helpful, you could put the words in brackets or in a footnote. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
11:1	djir		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	καὶ ὅτε	1	Here, the phrase **And when** introduces the next major event in the story. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces the next event. Alternate translation: “Then”

11:1	so0h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πρὸς τὸ Ὄρος τῶν Ἐλαιῶν	1	Here Matthew implies that **Bethphage** and **Bethany** are near **the Mount of Olives**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “near the Mount of Olives” or “which are at the Mount of Olives”
11:2	bi22		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	ὑπάγετε	1	In a context such as this, your language might say “Come” instead of **Go**. Alternate translation: “Come”
11:2	ahrd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	τὴν κώμην τὴν κατέναντι ὑμῶν	1	Here, a **village** that is **opposite** someone means that it is directly in front of them. Jesus could be referring to Bethany, Bethphage, or some other village. However, it is most likely that he is referring to the village of Bethphage. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the village directly in front of you” or “the village of Bethphage, which is before you”
11:2	si41		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual	ὑμῶν & εὑρήσετε	1	Since the word **you** applies to the two disciples in both of these instances, it would be dual, if your language uses that form. Otherwise, it would be plural.
11:2	g1qx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	πῶλον δεδεμένον	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who did the action, you could use an indefinite subject. Alternate translation: “a colt that a person has tied up”
11:2	r41g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	πῶλον	1	A **colt** is a young donkey that is no longer a baby but is not yet full grown. If your readers would not be familiar with this type of animal, you could use the name of something similar in your area or you could use a more general term. Alternate translation: “a donkey that is not yet fully grown” or “a young riding animal”
11:2	mwwv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	δεδεμένον	1	Here Jesus implies that someone has used a rope or tether to secure the donkey so that it cannot wander away. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “secured with a tether”
11:2	yw78		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	οὐδεὶς ἀνθρώπων	1	Although the term **men** is masculine, Mark is using the word here in a generic sense, that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful in your language, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “no human” or “no one person”
11:2	zloo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	οὔπω ἐκάθισεν	1	Jesus is using the term **sat** to refer to riding on an animal by association with the way people sit on an animal they are riding. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “has yet mounted” or “has yet used as a mount”
11:3	aw3v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	καὶ ἐάν τις ὑμῖν εἴπῃ, τί ποιεῖτε τοῦτο? εἴπατε, ὅτι ὁ Κύριος αὐτοῦ χρείαν ἔχει, καὶ εὐθὺς αὐτὸν ἀποστέλλει πάλιν ὧδε	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there are not quotations within a quotation. Alternate translation: “And if anyone asks you why you are doing this, say that the Lord has need of it and that immediately he sends it back here.”
11:3	q446		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual	ποιεῖτε	1	The person would be speaking to the two disciples, so **you** would be dual if your language uses that form. Otherwise, it would be plural.
11:3	xw55		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τί ποιεῖτε τοῦτο?	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could say explicitly what the phrase **doing this** refers to. Alternate translation: “Why are you untying and taking the colt”
11:3	j1w3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὁ Κύριος αὐτοῦ χρείαν ἔχει, καὶ εὐθὺς αὐτὸν ἀποστέλλει πάλιν ὧδε.	1	Here, the clause **and immediately he sends it back here** could be: (1) part of what Jesus wants the disciples to say. Alternate translation: “The Lord has need of it, and immediately the Lord sends it back here to you” (2) what Jesus predicts the person asking the question **Why are you doing this?** will do. Alternate translation: “The Lord has need of it,’ and immediately that person again sends it here”
11:3	k7fd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	αὐτοῦ χρείαν ἔχει	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **need**, you can express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “requires it”
11:3	yj5y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense	ἀποστέλλει	1	Here Jesus uses the present tense to describe a future action that will happen very soon. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use whatever tense is natural in your language for referring to an event in the near future. Alternate translation: “he will send”
11:3	ehde		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	πάλιν	1	Many ancient manuscripts read **back**. The ULT follows that reading. In this case, it is more likely that the phrase **and immediately he sends it** is part of what Jesus wanted the disciples to say (see previous note on this whole sentence). Other ancient manuscripts do not include the word **back**. In this case, it is more likely that the phrase **and immediately he sends it** is what Jesus predicts that the people who asked the question will do (see previous note on this whole sentence). If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of the ULT.
11:4	y381		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἀπῆλθον	1	Here, **they** refers to the two disciples mentioned in [11:1](../11/01.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could refer to them more explicitly. Alternate translation: “those two disciples went away”

11:5	psls		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	ἔλεγον αὐτοῖς, τί ποιεῖτε λύοντες τὸν πῶλον	1	It may be more natural in your language to have an indirect quotation here. Alternate translation: “were asking them what they were doing by untying the colt.”
11:5	wwup		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τί ποιεῖτε λύοντες	1	Here the people asking the question are asking the two disciples to provide a good reason for why they are **untying the colt**.

Hosanna had an original meaning of “save now,” but by the time of this event it had become a way of praising God. In your translation you can spell **Hosanna** the way it sounds in your language or you could translate it according to how the word was used. In this context, the people could be praising: (1) God.

11:9	suib		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	εὐλογημένος ὁ ἐρχόμενος ἐν ὀνόματι Κυρίου	1	The phrase **Blessed is the one** could be: (1) a request for God to bless Jesus.

11:13	wf0c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	καὶ	2	Here, the word **And** introduces what Jesus actually found on the tree in contrast to what Jesus wanted to find on the tree.

11:14	ij5h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	μηκέτι & μηδεὶς & φάγοι	1	The words translated **No one** and **any longer** are two negative words. In this construction, the second negative does not cancel the first to create a positive meaning. Instead, it gives greater emphasis to the negative.

If your language does not use two negatives in that way, you could translate with one strong negative, as the ULT does.

Alternate translation: “Has it not been written that God’s house will be called a house of prayer for all the nations? But you have made it, as it has been written, into a den of robbers.”
11:17	xrz2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	οὐ γέγραπται, ὅτι ὁ οἶκός μου, οἶκος προσευχῆς κληθήσεται πᾶσιν τοῖς ἔθνεσιν?	1	Jesus is using the question form to rebuke the people in the temple. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “You should have paid closer attention to what has been written: ‘My house will be called a house of prayer for all the nations.’” or “It has certainly been written, ‘My house will be called a house of prayer for all the nations’!”
11:17	le3k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	οὐ γέγραπται	1	In Jesus’ culture, **Has it not been written** was a normal way to introduce a quotation from an important text, in this case, the book of Isaiah (see [Isaiah 56:7](../isa/56/07.md)).

11:17	t9x9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	οὐ γέγραπται	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

Alternate translation: “Has the prophet Isaiah not said” or “Has God not had a prophet write”
11:17	npdf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	οἶκός μου & κληθήσεται	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

11:17	qeix		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	οἶκός μου	1	God, speaking through the prophet Isaiah, refers to his temple as **My house** because his presence is there. If it would be helpful for your readers, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “My temple”
11:17	t1ho		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	οἶκος προσευχῆς & πᾶσιν τοῖς ἔθνεσιν	1	Here God, speaking through the prophet Isaiah, is using the possessive form to describe **a house** that is a place where people perform **prayer**. If this is not clear in your language, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: “a house where all the nations offer prayer” or “a place where there is prayer from all the nations”\n

11:17	dpt1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	σπήλαιον λῃστῶν	1	Here God, speaking through the prophet Jeremiah, refers to the temple as a **den** where **robbers** hide and plot their crimes.

11:18	k6dv			ἐζήτουν πῶς	1	Alternate translation: “they were looking for a way by which”

11:20	pi9c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	παραπορευόμενοι	1	Here Mark implies that Jesus and his disciples were **passing by** the same route that they had traveled the previous morning, which means that they went past the same **fig tree** that they had gone past the previous morning.

11:21	rffd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	ἴδε	1	Here, the word **behold** is meant to draw the attention of Jesus.

11:22	x8k7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἔχετε πίστιν Θεοῦ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **faith**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “Believe”

Use a natural method in your language for introducing an imaginary situation. Alternate translation: “Truly I say this to you: imagine that someone says to this mountain, ‘Be taken up and be thrown into the sea.’ If that person does not doubt in his heart, but believes that what he says is happening, it will be for him.”
11:23	sy61			ἀμὴν, λέγω ὑμῖν	1	Jesus says this to emphasize what he is about to tell his audience. Use a natural form in your language for emphasizing the truth and importance of a statement. Alternate translation: “I can assure you”

11:23	dwsf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	μὴ διακριθῇ ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ αὐτοῦ, ἀλλὰ πιστεύῃ ὅτι ὃ λαλεῖ γίνεται	1	These two clauses mean basically the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could connect the phrases with a word other than **but** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternatively, you could combine the two phrases and express the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “believes that what he says is happening without doubting in his heart” or “truly believes in his heart that what he says is happening”
11:23	y76p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ αὐτοῦ	1	In Jesus’ culture, the **heart** is the place where humans think and feel.

11:23	rhhm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense	γίνεται	1	Here Jesus uses the present tense to refer to something that would happen in the near future.

11:24	abke		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense	ἐλάβετε	1	Here Jesus uses the past tense to refer to something in the future. He does this to indicate that the disciples should **believe** so strongly that they will receive what they ask for that it is as if they had already **received** it. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use the present or future tense and indicate the certainty in other way. Alternate translation: “you will certainly receive it” or “you are certain to receive it”
11:24	tu5z			ἔσται ὑμῖν	1	Alternate translation: “God will make it happen”
11:25	m7xi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	ὅταν στήκετε προσευχόμενοι	1	In Jesus’ culture, people often would **stand** when **praying** to God.

Alternate translation: “in order that”
11:25	m2aw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ὁ Πατὴρ ὑμῶν	1	Jesus speaks of his disciples as if God were their physical father. He means that they have a father-son relationship with God.

11:25	ttxg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὁ ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς	1	Here, the phrase **in the heavens** identifies the location in which God the Father is specially present and from which he rules.

11:27	alh5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	ἐν τῷ ἱερῷ	1	Here Mark means that Jesus was walking in the **temple** area.

Alternate translation: “By what kind of authority do you do these things, or who is the one who gave you this authority, so that you might do these things” (2) both have the same meaning and be asked together to strongly question Jesus’ authority.

12:intro	ne55				0	# Mark 12 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 12:10–11, 36, which are words from the Old Testament.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Hypothetical situations\n\nHypothetical situations are situations that have not actually happened. People describe these situations so their listeners can imagine them happening and learn lessons from them. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### The historic present\n\nTo call attention to a development in the story, Mark uses the present tense in past narration. In this chapter, the historic present occurs in verses 13, 14, 16, 18, and 41. If it would not be natural to do that in your language, you could use the past tense in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense]])\n\n### The son of David as Lord\n\nA paradox is a statement that describes two things that seem as if they cannot both be true at the same time, but which actually are both true. In this chapter, Jesus quotes a Psalm that records David calling his son “Lord,” that is, “master.” However, to the Jews, ancestors were greater than their descendants, so a father would not call his son “master.” In this passage, Mark 12:35–37, Jesus is trying to help his hearers understand that the Messiah will be divine, and that he himself is the Messiah. So, David is speaking to his son, that is, his descendant, as the Messiah, and it is appropriate for him to address him as his “Lord.”
12:1	w2hb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables	ἀμπελῶνα ἄνθρωπος ἐφύτευσεν	1	To teach the Jewish leaders, Jesus offers a story or illustration. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “Listen to this story: A man planted a vineyard”

12:5	q1ed		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	καὶ πολλοὺς ἄλλους	1	Jesus is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete.

12:10	mzr2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	λίθον ὃν ἀπεδοκίμασαν οἱ οἰκοδομοῦντες, οὗτος ἐγενήθη εἰς κεφαλὴν γωνίας	1	Here the author of the quotation speaks of a person whom others reject as if he were a **stone** that **builders rejected**. He speaks of this person gaining power and respect as if he became **the head of the corner**. Jesus is applying this quotation to himself, identifying himself with the **stone**. However, if possible, preserve the metaphor in your translation, or if that is not possible, express the idea in simile form. Alternate translation: “A person who is like a stone that the builders rejected, that person has become like the head of the corner”
12:10	kv7t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	λίθον ὃν ἀπεδοκίμασαν οἱ οἰκοδομοῦντες	1	Here the author of the quotation is referring to the way people in this culture used stones to build the walls of houses and other buildings. In this case, the people do not want to use the **stone** for building. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “A stone that the builders thought was not good enough to use for building”
12:10	l5ma		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	κεφαλὴν γωνίας	1	The phrase **the head of the corner** refers to a specific stone that is especially key or important for a structure. It could be a stone at the corner of a wall, a stone at the top of an arch, or another important stone. You could use a term for one of these kinds of stones, or you could refer generally to an important or essential stone. Alternate translation: “the cornerstone” or “the capstone” or “the most important stone”
12:11	r8z8			παρὰ Κυρίου ἐγένετο αὕτη	1	Alternate translation: “The Lord has caused this”
12:11	k5w6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς ἡμῶν	1	Here, **eyes** represent a person’s judgement or evaluation.

Also, the reason why they **left** Jesus without arresting him was because **they feared the crowd**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could put the reasons before their results. Alternate translation: “And they knew that he spoke the parable against them, so they were seeking to seize him. However, they feared the crowd, so having left him, they went away”
12:12	b1vz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἐζήτουν	1	Here, the pronoun **they** refers to the chief priests, scribes, and elders mentioned in [11:27](../11/27.md).

Use a natural way in your language for introducing a contrast. Alternate translation: “yet” or “but”
12:12	lx62		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὸν ὄχλον	1	Here Mark implies that the chief priests and the Pharisees feared what the **crowd** would do if they seized Jesus. They might have rioted or attacked them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit.

12:12	ql29		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καὶ ἀφέντες αὐτὸν, ἀπῆλθον	1	Here Mark implies that the Jewish leaders did not **seize** Jesus.

12:13	eq4t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	καὶ	1	Here, the word **And** introduces the next major event in the story. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces the next event, or you could leave **And** untranslated. Alternate translation: “After that,”

12:13	kuy5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	αὐτὸν ἀγρεύσωσιν	1	Mark is speaking as if **the Pharisees and the Herodians** intended to catch Jesus in a trap. He means that they wanted to get Jesus to say something that would allow them to accuse him of doing wrong. If it would be helpful for your readers, you could use a comparable figure of speech or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “catch him” or “cause him to make an error”
12:13	s1hb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	λόγῳ	1	Here, **word** represents something said in words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your language or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “in speech”
12:13	b141		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	λόγῳ	1	Here, the phrase **with a word** could refer to things spoken by: (1) Jesus. Alternate translation: “in his words” (2) the Pharisees. Alternate translation: “with their words”
12:14	dh3d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	ἐλθόντες	1	In a context such as this, your language might say “gone” instead of **come**. Alternate translation: “having gone”
12:14	awv5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	οἴδαμεν & δῶμεν & δῶμεν	1	The spies are speaking only of themselves, so **we** would be exclusive, if your language marks that distinction.
12:14	xhl6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	οὐ μέλει σοι περὶ οὐδενός; οὐ γὰρ βλέπεις εἰς πρόσωπον ἀνθρώπων	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these clauses, since the second clause gives the reason for the result that the first clause describes. Alternate translation: “since you do not look at the face of men, it is not a concern to you about anyone”
12:14	cp3x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	οὐ μέλει σοι περὶ οὐδενός	1	The Herodians and the Pharisees use this clause to say that Jesus does not care what others think and say about him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “you do not concern yourself with the opinions of others” or “you are not influenced by what others think of you”
12:14	r2f3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	οὐ μέλει σοι περὶ οὐδενός	1	The words translated **not** and **anyone** are two negative words. In this construction, the second negative does not cancel the first to create a positive meaning. Instead, it gives greater emphasis to the negative. If your language can use two negatives that do not cancel one another to create a positive meaning, you could use a double negative here. If your language does not use two negatives in that way, you could translate with one negative, as the ULT does. Alternate translation: “it is a concern to you about no one”
12:14	no9y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	οὐ μέλει σοι	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of concern, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “nothing concerns you”

Alternate translation: “for you do not judge men by appearances” or “for you do not treat people based on what they look like”
12:14	brm3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	ἀνθρώπων	1	Although the term **men** is masculine, the Herodians and the Pharisees are using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a phrase that makes this clear. Alternate translation: “of humans”
12:14	weaf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τὴν ὁδὸν τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Here, the Herodians and the Pharisees are using the possessive form to describe a **way** that **God** desires or approves of. If this is not clear in your language, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: “the way that pleases God”
12:14	yfnc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τὴν ὁδὸν τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Here the Pharisees and Herodians use the word **way** to refer to behavior in life.

Alternate translation: “behavior that pleases God”
12:14	ap2q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐπ’ ἀληθείας	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **truth**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “based on what is true”
12:14	k0tw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἔξεστιν	1	Here, the word **lawful** could be referring to: (1) whether something is permitted by the Jewish law that God gave to Moses.

12:14	puhe		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	οὔ	1	The Herodians and the Pharisees are leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You could supply these words from earlier in the sentence if it would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “is it not lawful to do so”
12:14	y8lv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	δῶμεν ἢ μὴ δῶμεν	1	Here the Pharisees and the Herodians are asking about whether they should **give** or **not give** poll taxes **to Caesar**.

12:15	g48w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	αὐτῶν τὴν ὑπόκρισιν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **hypocrisy**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “that they were acting hypocritically” or “that they were being hypocritical”
12:15	c7nj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τί με πειράζετε?	1	Jesus is using the question form to rebuke the Herodians and the Pharisees.

Alternate translation: “I know that you are testing me.” or “Stop testing me!”
12:15	wl34		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney	δηνάριον	1	A **denarius** was a silver coin equivalent to about one day’s wage for a hired worker. You could try to express this amount in terms of current monetary values, but that might cause your Bible translation to become outdated and inaccurate, since those values can change over time. So instead you might state something more general or give the equivalent in wages. Alternate translation: “a silver coin” or “a coin worth one day’s wage”
12:16	ev6s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	οἱ	1	The pronoun **they** refers to the people who were there, more specifically the Herodians and the disciples of the Pharisees. If this is not clear for your readers, you could refer to these people more directly. Alternate translation: “the disciples of the Pharisees and the Herodians” or “the people there”
12:16	ljeo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἡ εἰκὼν αὕτη καὶ ἡ ἐπιγραφή	1	In Jesus’ culture, when governments made coins, they would usually put the face of the king or leader on one side, and they would usually have writing on the coin that honored that king or leader. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this practice more explicit. Alternate translation: “face and words of honor did the Roman government stamp on this coin”
12:16	l2tc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ἡ ἐπιγραφή	1	Here, the word **inscription** refers to a few words carved or pressed into a hard surface.

12:16	gi96		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	Καίσαρος	1	The Herodians and the Pharisees are leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You could supply these words from earlier in the verse if it would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “The image and inscription are Caesar’s”
12:16	z45k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	Καίσαρος	1	Here the fact that the image and inscription on the coin are **Caesar’s** implies that they were created by the empire that Caesar ruled, the Roman empire. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “They are of Caesar, the man who rules the Roman empire”
12:17	fl4l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τὰ Καίσαρος ἀπόδοτε Καίσαρι	1	Here, **Caesar** represents the Roman leaders and government in general. See how you translated this word in [12:14](../12/14.md), but make sure that the connection to the answer “Caesar’s” in [12:16](../12/16.md) is clear. Alternate translation: “The things of the Roman leaders, give back to the Roman leaders” or “The things of the Roman empire, give back to the Roman empire”
12:17	la16		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	καὶ τὰ τοῦ Θεοῦ τῷ Θεῷ	1	Jesus is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete. If it would be helpful in your language, you could supply these words from the context. Alternate translation: “and give to God the things that belong to God”
12:18	y8yo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	καὶ ἔρχονται Σαδδουκαῖοι πρὸς αὐτόν, οἵτινες λέγουσιν ἀνάστασιν μὴ εἶναι; καὶ ἐπηρώτων αὐτὸν λέγοντες	1	Mark is here introducing the **Sadducees** as new participants in the story. If your language has its own way of introducing new participants, you could use it here in your translation. Alternate translation: “And some people approached him. They were Sadducees, who are a group who say that there is no resurrection. They were questioning him, saying”
12:18	edcn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	καὶ ἔρχονται Σαδδουκαῖοι πρὸς αὐτόν, οἵτινες λέγουσιν ἀνάστασιν μὴ εἶναι	1	Here Mark provides background information about the **Sadducees** that will help readers understand what happens next.

If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces the next event, or you could leave **And** untranslated. Alternate translation: “Then”
12:18	ss09		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish	Σαδδουκαῖοι & οἵτινες λέγουσιν ἀνάστασιν μὴ εἶναι	1	This phrase is identifying the **Sadducees** as a group of Jews that said no one would rise from the dead. It is not identifying the Sadducees who came to question Jesus as members of that group who held that belief, as if other members did not. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that makes that more explicit. Alternate translation: “Sadducees, men who believe that no one will rise from the dead”
12:18	rdl7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἀνάστασιν μὴ εἶναι	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **resurrection**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “that people do not resurrect”\n

12:19	e8x2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	Μωϋσῆς ἔγραψεν ἡμῖν	1	Here, the Sadducees introduce a summary of a section of an important text, in this case, the Old Testament book of Deuteronomy (see [Deuteronomy 25:5–6](../deu/25/05.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase that indicates that the Sadducees are summarizing an important text. Alternate translation: “Moses wrote to us in the book of Deuteronomy” or “Moses declared to us in the Law”
12:19	hhmi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	ἔγραψεν ἡμῖν, ὅτι ἐάν τινος ἀδελφὸς ἀποθάνῃ, καὶ καταλίπῃ γυναῖκα καὶ μὴ ἀφῇ τέκνον, ἵνα λάβῃ ὁ ἀδελφὸς αὐτοῦ τὴν γυναῖκα, καὶ ἐξαναστήσῃ σπέρμα τῷ ἀδελφῷ αὐτοῦ	1	It may be more natural in your language to have a direct quotation here. Alternate translation: “wrote to us, ‘If someone’s brother dies and leaves behind a wife but does not leave a child, his brother should take the wife and raise up seed for his brother’”
12:19	m8fh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἔγραψεν ἡμῖν	1	Here, the word **us** would be inclusive, if your language marks that distinction. The Sadducees mean “us Jews,” and they are speaking to Jesus, who is also a Jew.

The first child that they had would be considered offspring of the man’s deceased brother. That way, the deceased brother’s family line could continue. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit in your translation, or you could include some of this information in a footnote. Alternate translation: “his brother should marry the widow and raise up seed with her. The first child will continue the dead man’s family line”

12:33	ekfy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ὡς ἑαυτὸν	1	The scribe is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete. If it would be helpful in your language, you could supply these words from the context. See how you expressed the similar idea in [12:31](../12/31.md). Alternate translation: “as one love oneself”
12:33	mje6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	ὡς ἑαυτὸν	1	See how you expressed this idea in [12:31](../12/31.md). Alternate translation: “as deeply as oneself”
12:33	ll9t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	περισσότερόν ἐστιν	1	Here the scribe means that keeping these two commandments is **more** important or significant than offering **burnt offerings and sacrifices**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “is even more important than” or “is more significant than”
12:33	sgbu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	πάντων τῶν ὁλοκαυτωμάτων καὶ θυσιῶν	1	The terms **whole burnt offerings** and **sacrifices** mean similar things. The scribe is using the two terms together to include **all** the different kinds of sacrifices and offerings in his claim. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “all the various offerings” or “all sacrifices that anyone might offer”
12:34	hkf7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἰδὼν αὐτὸν ὅτι	1	Here, Mark is using the word **seen** to mean “observed” or “knew.” He is describing something a person would perceive with their mind by association with their eyes. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “having understood that” or “having observed that”
12:34	is4c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	οὐ μακρὰν εἶ ἀπὸ τῆς Βασιλείας τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Here, Jesus speaks as if the man was physically **not far from the kingdom of God**. He means that the man is almost part of God’s kingdom. Jesus is speaking of **the kingdom of God** as if it were a physical place. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable figure of speech or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “You are almost in the kingdom of God” or “You almost belong to the kingdom of God”
12:34	b144		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes	οὐ μακρὰν & ἀπὸ	1	Jesus is using a figure of speech here that expresses a strongly positive meaning by using a negative word, **not**, together with an expression that is the opposite of the intended meaning, **far**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the positive meaning. Alternate translation: “very close to”
12:34	rgh8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	οὐδεὶς οὐκέτι ἐτόλμα	1	The words translated **no one** and **any longer** are two negative words. In this construction, the second negative does not cancel the first to create a positive meaning. Instead, it gives greater emphasis to the negative. If your language can use two negatives that do not cancel one another to create a positive meaning, you could use a double negative here. If your language does not use two negatives in that way, you could translate with one negative, as the ULT does. Alternate translation: “people no longer were daring”
12:35	ptc8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	ἱερῷ	1	See how you translated the word **temple** in [11:11](../11/11.md), where it is used with the same meaning.
12:35	q6e4			πῶς λέγουσιν οἱ γραμματεῖς ὅτι ὁ Χριστὸς, υἱὸς Δαυείδ ἐστιν?	1	This is not a rhetorical question. Rather, Jesus’ listeners had asked him some difficult questions, and they had admitted that he answered them well. Now, in return, he is asking them a difficult question. None of them will be able to answer it, and this will demonstrate his wisdom even further. His question actually will teach something to those who are able to recognize its implications. But it would be appropriate to leave it in question form and not translate it as a statement.
12:35	i6a4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	υἱὸς Δαυείδ	1	Here, Jesus is using the term **son** to mean “descendant.” If your readers would not understand what **son** means in this context, you could express its meaning using plain language. Alternate translation: “a descendant of David”
12:36	e1zq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns	αὐτὸς Δαυεὶδ	1	Jesus uses the word **himself** here to emphasize that it was David, the very person whom the scribes call the father of the Christ, who spoke the words in the quotation that follows. Use a natural way in your language to indicate this emphasis. Alternate translation: “None other than David” or “David, the very person whom you call the father of the Christ”
12:36	jlbd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	εἶπεν ἐν τῷ Πνεύματι τῷ ἁγίῳ, εἶπεν ὁ Κύριος τῷ Κυρίῳ μου, κάθου ἐκ δεξιῶν μου, ἕως ἂν θῶ τοὺς ἐχθρούς σου ὑποκάτω τῶν ποδῶν σου	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation and then another quotation within that one. Alternate translation: “said, by inspiration of the Holy Spirit, that the Lord told his Lord to sit at his right side until he put his enemies under his feet”
12:36	ejy2			ἐν τῷ Πνεύματι τῷ ἁγίῳ	1	Alternate translation: “inspired by the Holy Spirit” or “by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit”
12:36	dv7b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	εἶπεν ὁ Κύριος τῷ Κυρίῳ μου	1	Here, the term **Lord** does not refer to the same person in both instances. The first instance is representing the name Yahweh, which David actually uses in this psalm. In order to honor the commandment not to misuse God’s name, Jewish people often avoided saying that name and said Lord instead. The second instance is the regular term for “lord” or “master.” The ULT and UST capitalize the word because it refers to the Messiah. Alternate translation: “The Lord God said to my Lord” or “God said to my Lord”
12:36	v53p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	κάθου ἐκ δεξιῶν μου	1	The seat at the right side of a ruler was a position of great honor and authority. By telling the Messiah to sit there, God was symbolically conferring honor and authority on him. Alternate translation: “Sit in the place of honor beside me”
12:36	k2j1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	κάθου ἐκ δεξιῶν μου	1	In this quotation, Yahweh is using the adjective **right** as a noun in order to indicate his right side. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could state that specifically. Alternate translation: “Sit at my right side”
12:36	rfy9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	ἕως ἂν θῶ τοὺς ἐχθρούς σου ὑποκάτω τῶν ποδῶν σου	1	Placing an enemy under one’s feet represents conquering them and making them submit. Here, it means that Yahweh would make His enemies stop resisting the Messiah and force them to submit to him. Alternate translation: “until I conquer your enemies for you”
12:37	j7wn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	αὐτὸς Δαυεὶδ λέγει αὐτὸν, Κύριον	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “David himself calls the Messiah his Lord”
12:37	ka5u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	λέγει αὐτὸν	1	Here, the word **him** refers to the Messiah. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express that explicitly, as the UST does.
12:37	ssq3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns	αὐτὸς Δαυεὶδ	1	See how you translated the word **himself** in [12:36](../12/36.md), where it is used with the same meaning. Alternate translation: “None other than David” or “David, the very person” or “David, whom we all respect”
12:37	qpdy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	αὐτὸς Δαυεὶδ λέγει αὐτὸν, Κύριον, καὶ πόθεν υἱός αὐτοῦ ἐστιν?	1	In this culture, an ancestor was more respected than a descendant. But to call someone **Lord** was to address that person as the more respected one. As the General Notes to this chapter describe, this is a paradox. That is, it is a statement that describes two things that seem as if they cannot both be true at the same time but which actually are both true. Jesus is calling attention to this paradox to get his listeners to think more deeply about who the Messiah is. If it would be helpful in your language, you could indicate explicitly what makes this a paradox. Alternate translation: “David respectfully addresses the Messiah as his Lord, but David should be more respected than his descendant. So why does David address him that way?”
12:37	rh2t			καὶ πόθεν υἱός αὐτοῦ ἐστιν	1	Like the question in [12:35](../12/35.md), this seems to be a question that Jesus wanted his listeners to try to answer, even though he is also using it to teach. It is a difficult question, like the ones they asked him, which he answered well. They will not be able to answer his question, and this should give them a further appreciation for his wisdom, in addition to what they might learn from reflecting on the question later. So it would be appropriate to leave it in question form and not translate it as a statement. Alternate translation: “So why do people say that the Messiah is David’s descendant”
12:37	qucc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ	1	Jesus is using the word **and** to show that a conclusion should be made as a result of what he has just said, and that this conclusion would be different from what his listeners had previously believed. Use a natural form in your language for showing this. Alternate translation: “so”
12:37	tjp6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	υἱός	1	Jesus is using the term **son** to mean “descendant,” as he did in [12:35](../12/35.md). See how you translated the term **son** there. Alternate translation: “descendant”
12:38	bh8w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential	καὶ	1	Mark uses the word **And** to indicate that Jesus is still sitting in the temple area taking to the people, as he was in the previous verse. Alternate translation: “Then”
12:38	rwxq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	βλέπετε	1	In the original language in which Mark wrote this Gospel, the phrase **Watch out** is a command or instruction written in the plural form. Use the most natural form in your language to give direction to a group of people. Alternate translation: “All of you watch out for” or “Every one of you watch out for”
12:38	yhfv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	βλέπετε ἀπὸ τῶν γραμματέων	1	Jesus says **Watch out** to warn about the influence of certain people. He is not saying that the scribes themselves are physically dangerous, but that it would be dangerous spiritually to follow their example. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “Be careful not to follow the example of the scribes”
12:38	nxy9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	τῶν θελόντων ἐν στολαῖς περιπατεῖν	1	In this culture, **long robes** were a symbol of wealth and status. To walk around in public in **long robes** was to assert one’s right to high status. If it would be helpful in your language, you could indicate this explicitly. Alternate translation: “who like to walk around looking important in their long robes”
12:38	mu5a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀσπασμοὺς	1	The implication is that these would be respectful **greetings** in which the scribes would be addressed by important titles. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “respectful greetings”
12:39	mwmf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	πρωτοκαθεδρίας & πρωτοκλισίας	1	Both uses of the word **first** here mean “best.” Alternate translation: “the best seats … the best places”
12:40	jtw4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	οἱ κατεσθίοντες τὰς οἰκίας τῶν χηρῶν	1	Jesus speaks of the **houses** of widows to mean their wealth and possessions, which they would have in their houses. If it would be helpful in your language, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “They defraud widows of everything they own”
12:40	j27b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	οἱ κατεσθίοντες τὰς οἰκίας τῶν χηρῶν	1	Jesus says that the scribes are **devouring** or eating up the possessions of widows. He means that they continually ask the widows for money until the widows have none left. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or use plain language to express the meaning. Alternate translation: “They defraud widows of everything they own”
12:40	r3ht			καὶ προφάσει μακρὰ προσευχόμενοι	1	Here, **pretext** refers to something that someone would do in order to appear a certain way. Alternate translation: “in order to seem godly, they are offering long prayers”
12:40	qm52		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	οὗτοι λήμψονται περισσότερον κρίμα	1	Jesus is using the word **condemnation** to mean the punishment that a person would receive after being condemned (found guilty) for doing something wrong. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or use plain language to express the meaning. Alternate translation: “These scribes will receive greater punishment”
12:40	h36x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οὗτοι λήμψονται περισσότερον κρίμα	1	The implication seems to be that these proud and greedy scribes will receive **greater** punishment than they would have if they had not pretended to be so godly. It is also implicit that God will be the one who punishes them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use plain language to express the meaning. Alternate translation: “God will punish these scribes more severely because they do all these wrong things while pretending to be godly”
12:41	r69x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	καὶ	1	# Connecting Statement:\n\nMark uses the word **And** to introduce background information that will help his readers understand what happens next in the story. Alternate translation: “Now”
12:41	nohd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	καθίσας κατέναντι τοῦ γαζοφυλακίου, ἐθεώρει πῶς ὁ ὄχλος βάλλει χαλκὸν εἰς τὸ γαζοφυλάκιον; καὶ πολλοὶ πλούσιοι ἔβαλλον πολλά	1	This background information introduces a new event in the story. Alternate translation: “after Jesus sat down he was watching the crowd put money into the offering box and noticing that there were many rich people who were placing gifts of money in the offering boxes”
12:41	p2kp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τοῦ γαζοφυλακίου & τὸ γαζοφυλάκιον	1	Mark is speaking of the boxes in the temple courtyard where people put money that they were giving to God. He associates the boxes with **the treasury**, the name of the place where this money would be kept until it was needed. Alternate translation: “the offering boxes … the offering boxes”
12:41	w4xc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	ὁ ὄχλος	1	The word **crowd** is a singular noun that refers to a group of people. If your language does not use singular nouns in that way, you can use a different expression such as “many people,” as modeled by the UST.
12:41	jgkw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	πλούσιοι	1	Mark is using the adjective **rich** as a noun in order to indicate a type of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this with an equivalent expression such as “rich people,” as the UST does. Alternate translation: “wealthy people”
12:41	rl1l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	πολλά	1	Mark is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete. If it would be helpful in your language, you could supply these words from the context. Alternate translation: “much money”
12:42	g6ry		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney	λεπτὰ δύο, ὅ ἐστιν κοδράντης	1	The word **lepta** is the plural of “lepton.” A lepton was a small bronze or copper coin used by the Jews. It was equivalent to a few minutes’ wages. It was the least valuable coin that people used in this culture. You could try to express this amount in terms of current monetary values, but that might cause your Bible translation to become outdated and inaccurate, since those values can change over time. So instead, you might use the name of the least valuable coin in your culture, or use a general expression. Alternate translation: “two pennies” or “two small coins of little value”
12:42	n29e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney	ὅ ἐστιν κοδράντης	1	A **quadrans** was the smallest Roman coin. Mark is seeking to help his readers, who are Roman, understand the value of **two leptas** in their own currency. You could clarify in your translation that a **quadrans** is a Roman coin, as the UST does, or you can leave this information untranslated.
12:43-44	ipl1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge		0	# General Information:\n\nIn verse 43 Jesus says that the widow put more money in the offering than the rich people put in, and in verse 44 he gives his reason for saying that. If your language would put the reason before the result, you could create a verse bridge by moving this verse to the end of the following verse. You would then present the combined verses as 43–44, as the UST does.
12:43	q124			ἀμὴν, λέγω ὑμῖν	1	See how you translated the statement **Truly I say to you** in [3:28](../03/28.md).
12:43	ih0m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἡ χήρα αὕτη ἡ πτωχὴ	1	Even though it is not literally true that the widow has put more money into the offering box than all the rich people, this is still not figurative language. As Jesus explains in the next verse, he means that she has put in proportionately more than all the others, relative to her means, and that is literally true. But Jesus makes the seemingly untrue statement first, using it to get his disciples to reflect on how it can be true. So it would be appropriate to translate Jesus’ words directly and not interpret them as if they were figurative. For example, it would be a figurative interpretation to say, “God considers what this poor widow has given to be more valuable than the gifts of all the others”
12:43	n8z5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πάντων & τῶν βαλλόντων	1	In context, **all** means specifically all of the rich people who were putting large monetary gifts in the collection boxes. Alternate translation: “all of those rich people putting”

12:44	c7jj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	Here, the word **For** introduces the reason for what Jesus said in [12:43](../12/43.md). Use a natural way in your language for introducing a contrast. Alternate translation: “Because”
12:44	ihuq			ἐκ τοῦ περισσεύοντος αὐτοῖς ἔβαλον	1	Alternate translation: “had a lot of money but only gave a small portion of it”
12:44	ui9a			αὕτη δὲ, ἐκ τῆς ὑστερήσεως αὐτῆς, πάντα ὅσα εἶχεν ἔβαλεν, ὅλον τὸν βίον αὐτῆς	1	Alternate translation: “but she who had only had a very little money gave everything she had to live on”
12:44	l4tp			τῆς ὑστερήσεως αὐτῆς	1	Alternate translation: “her lack” or “the little she had”

13:intro	ti7d				0	# Mark 13 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 13:24–25, which are words from the Old Testament.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### The return of Christ\n\nJesus said much about what would happen before he returned ([Mark 13:6–37](./06.md)). He told his followers that bad things would happen to the world and bad things would happen to them before he returned, but they needed to be ready for him to return at any time.\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### The historic present\n\nTo call attention to a development in the story, Mark uses the present tense in past narration. In this chapter, the historic present occurs in verse 13. If it would not be natural to do that in your language, you could use the past tense in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense]])

If it would be helpful in your language, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “How wonderful these huge stones are and how wonderful these buildings are”
13:2	rez6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	βλέπεις ταύτας τὰς μεγάλας οἰκοδομάς?	1	Jesus is not asking for information, but is using the question form here to draw attention to the buildings and to emphasize what he is about to say. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “Look at these great buildings!”

Alternate translation: “And as Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew were privately asking him”

13:4	lw1n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ὅταν μέλλῃ ταῦτα συντελεῖσθαι πάντα	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Jesus implies that “God” will do it. Alternate translation: “when God is about to complete all these things”
13:5	fe42		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	λέγειν αὐτοῖς	1	The pronoun **them** refers to Peter, James, John, and Andrew, who are mentioned in [13:3](../13/03.md).

13:6	pbz4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πολλοὶ & πολλοὺς	1	Here both uses of the word **Many** refer to “many people.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could say that explicitly, as the UST does.

13:7	fl5h			πολέμους καὶ ἀκοὰς πολέμων	1	The phrase **wars and rumors of wars** could mean: (1) reports of wars that are currently happening and reports of wars that might happen in the future. (2) reports of wars that are already taking place near by and reports of wars that are happening in distant places. Alternate translation: “reports of wars that are close by and of wars that are far away”
13:7	d1k9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ἀλλ’ οὔπω τὸ τέλος	1	Jesus is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete.

Alternate translation: “Different groups of people will attack each other”
13:8	rlxf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	ἐγερθήσεται & ἔθνος ἐπ’ ἔθνος	1	The word **nation** represents nations in general, not one particular nation. Alternate translation: “The people of some nations will attack the people of other nations”

13:8	dz8g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἀρχὴ ὠδίνων ταῦτα	1	Jesus uses the metaphor of **birth pains** because, in the same way that the pain of childbirth is eventually replaced by joy when the child is born, so the suffering that is experienced by true believers will eventually be replaced by joy when Christ returns. Because childbirth occurs in all cultures, you should retain this metaphor in your translation. Alternate translation: “These events will be like the first pains a woman suffers when she is about to bear a child” or “These events will be like the first pains a woman suffers when she is about to give birth to a child”
13:9	nuti		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	βλέπετε & ἑαυτούς	1	Jesus uses a word for seeing to indicate the need for paying attention or being ready.

13:9	ulws		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns	βλέπετε δὲ ὑμεῖς ἑαυτούς	1	Jesus uses the word **yourselves** to draw the disciples’ attention to themselves, because he now transitions away from telling them about general signs and begins telling them about specific trials that they will personally encounter. Use a way that is natural in your language to indicate this. Alternate translation: “But give heed to yourselves personally”
13:9	mbr5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	παραδώσουσιν ὑμᾶς	1	The pronoun **They** refers to people in general who will persecute Jesus’ followers. If this might confuse your readers, you could say the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “People will deliver you”

13:11	nr2r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐν ἐκείνῃ τῇ ὥρᾳ	1	Jesus is using the term **hour** to refer to a specific time. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning in plain language, as the UST models.
13:11	q2o3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οὐ γάρ ἐστε ὑμεῖς οἱ λαλοῦντες, ἀλλὰ τὸ Πνεῦμα τὸ Ἅγιον	1	The phrase **for you are not be the ones speaking, but the Holy Spirit** implicitly means that it is the Holy Spirit who will give the disciples the words to say. This does not mean that the Holy Spirit audibly speaks for the disciples. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express that explicitly. Alternate translation: “for the Holy Spirit will give you the words to say” or “for the Holy Spirit will instruct you what to say”
13:11	a9b6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ἀλλὰ τὸ Πνεῦμα τὸ Ἅγιον	1	Jesus is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete.

13:12	py9u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	παραδώσει ἀδελφὸς ἀδελφὸν εἰς θάνατον, καὶ πατὴρ τέκνον; καὶ ἐπαναστήσονται τέκνα ἐπὶ γονεῖς	1	Here, Jesus is explaining to his disciples what “some” brothers and “some” fathers and “some” children will do to their family members. He is speaking in general terms and is not saying that “all” brothers or fathers or children will do this. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express that explicitly, as modeled by the UST.
13:12	m6iq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	παραδώσει ἀδελφὸς ἀδελφὸν	1	Although the term **brother** is masculine, Jesus is using the word here in a generic sense that includes both men and women.

13:12	utyk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	θάνατον & θανατώσουσιν αὐτούς	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **death**, you can express the same idea with a verb form. Alternate translation: “be killed … have them killed”

13:12	hrhw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	πατὴρ τέκνον	1	Although the term **father** is masculine, Jesus is probably using the word here in a generic sense that includes both fathers and mothers. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “parents, their children” or “fathers and mothers will deliver their children to the authorities to be killed”
13:12	vjcw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐπαναστήσονται τέκνα ἐπὶ γονεῖς καὶ θανατώσουσιν αὐτούς	1	Here, **children will rise up against parents and put them to death** probably does not mean that children will directly murder their parents. Rather, this probably means that children will deliver their parents to people in positions of authority and then these people will have their parents killed. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express that explicitly, as modeled by the UST.
13:12	r66s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	ἐπαναστήσονται τέκνα ἐπὶ γονεῖς	1	Here, **rise up** means to stand up.

13:13	w8pz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	ἔσεσθε μισούμενοι ὑπὸ πάντων	1	Here, **all** is an exaggeration which Jesus uses to emphasize to his disciples the fact that many people will hate them because they believe in him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your language or use plain language, as modeled by the UST.
13:13	jhp6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	διὰ τὸ ὄνομά μου	1	Here, **name** is a way of referring to a person by reference to something associated with that person, their name. Jesus is using the phrase **my name** to refer to himself. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “because of me”
13:13	w28q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ὁ & ὑπομείνας εἰς τέλος, οὗτος σωθήσεται	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

This meaning means that believers must endure and keep on enduring until the time when Christ returns. Alternate translation: “who keeps on enduring to the very end” (3) to the end of that time of hardship and persecution. Alternate translation: “who endures until the time of testing is over”
13:14	d4nw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὸ βδέλυγμα τῆς ἐρημώσεως	1	The phrase **the abomination of desolation** is from the book of Daniel. Jesus’ audience would have been familiar with this passage and the prophecy about **the abomination** entering the temple and defiling it. If it would be helpful in your language, you could indicate the meaning explicitly, as modeled by the UST. Alternate translation: “the shameful thing that defiles the temple”

13:14	ck7a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks	ὁ ἀναγινώσκων νοείτω	1	The phrase **let the one reading understand** is not Jesus speaking. Mark added this to get the readers’ attention so that they would pay attention to this warning. If it would be helpful in your language, you could show that this is not part of Jesus’ direct speech by putting brackets around this phrase, as the UST and ULT do, or you could show your readers in some other way that is natural in your language.
13:15	m1hq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὁ & ἐπὶ τοῦ δώματος, μὴ καταβάτω, μηδὲ εἰσελθάτω ἆραί τι ἐκ τῆς οἰκίας αὐτοῦ	1	Where Jesus lived, the tops of houses were flat. People would eat and do other activities on top of their houses.

If it would be helpful in your language, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “the person who is on top of their roof should escape immediately and not enter their house to get anything”

13:18	w47v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge	προσεύχεσθε δὲ ἵνα μὴ γένηται χειμῶνος	1	If your language would put the reason before the result, you could create a verse bridge by moving all of this verse to the end of the next verse, since in the next verse Jesus gives the reason for praying this prayer. You would then present the combined verses as 18–19.
13:18	w91r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	χειμῶνος	1	In the location to which Jesus is referring, **winter** is the time of year when it is cold, and travel is difficult.

13:19	zs4g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἡμέραι ἐκεῖναι	1	See how you translated the word **days** in [13:17](../13/17.md), where it is used with the same meaning. Alternate translation: “at that time”

13:20	q8hm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οὐκ ἂν ἐσώθη πᾶσα σάρξ	1	Here, the phrase **be saved** refers to being saved from physical death. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express that explicitly. Alternate translation: “everyone would die” or “no one would survive”
13:20	fz5f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	τοὺς ἐκλεκτοὺς, οὓς ἐξελέξατο	1	These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The repetition is used for emphasis.

13:20	af7n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	τοὺς ἐκλεκτοὺς	1	Jesus is using the adjective **elect** as a noun in order to describe a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this with a noun phrase as modeled by the UST.
13:21-22	d9gr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge		0	# General Information:\n\nIn verse 21 Jesus gives a command, and in verse 22 he gives the reason for the command. If your language would put the reason before the result, you could create a verse bridge by moving this verse to the end of the following verse. You would then present the combined verses as 21–22 as the UST does.

Alternate translation: “And do not believe anyone who says to you that the Christ is either here or there” or “And do not believe anyone who says to you that the Christ is in this location or that location”
13:21	yfd3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ἴδε, ἐκεῖ	1	Jesus is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete.

13:24	n2rr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential	μετὰ	1	The word **after** indicates that the events Jesus will describe in [13:24–27](../013/24.md) will come after the events just described in [13:14–23](../013/14.md). The word **after** does not express how long it will be before the events of [13:24–27](../013/24.md) take place so you should choose a word or phrase in your language that communicates the sequential meaning of the word **after** but does not limit the time frame.
13:24	mfy8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	θλῖψιν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **tribulation**, you can express the same idea with a verbal form such as “suffer” as modeled by the UST.

The term **glory** describes what kind of **power** Jesus will have. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning with an equivalent phrase.

14:intro	uk36				0	# Mark 14 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 14:27, 62, which are words from the Old Testament.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### The meaning of the “body” and “blood” of Jesus\n\n[Mark 14:22–25](./22.md) describes Jesus’ last meal with his followers. During this meal, Jesus said of the bread, “This is my body,” and of the wine, “This is my blood of the covenant, which is being poured out for many.” As Jesus instructed, Christian churches around the world re-enact this meal regularly, calling it “the Lord’s Supper,” the “Eucharist”, or “Holy Communion.” But they have different understandings of what Jesus meant by these sayings. Some churches believe that Jesus was speaking and that he meant that the bread and wine represented his body and blood. Other churches believe that he was speaking literally and that the actual body and blood of Jesus are really present in the bread and wine of this ceremony. Translators should be careful not to let how they understand this issue affect how they translate this passage.\n\n### The new covenant\n\nSome people think that Jesus established the new covenant during the supper. Others think he established it after he went up to heaven. Others think it will not be established until Jesus comes again. Your translation should say no more about this than ULT does. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/covenant]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### The historic present\n\nTo call attention to a development in the story, Mark uses the present tense in past narration. In this chapter, the historic present occurs in verses 12, 13, 17, 27, 30, 32, 33, 34, 37, 41, 43, 45, 51, 53, 61, 63, 66, 67. If it would not be natural to do that in your language, you could use the past tense in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense]])\n\n### Abba, Father\n\n“Abba” is an Aramaic word that the Jews used to speak to their fathers. Mark writes it as it sounds and then translates it. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate]])\n\n### “Son of Man”\n\nJesus refers to himself as the “Son of Man” in this chapter ([Mark 14:20](../mrk/14/20.md)). Your language may not allow people to speak of themselves as if they were speaking about someone else. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sonofman]] and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
14:1	hwb4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	δὲ	1	# Connecting Statement:\n\nMark uses the word **Now** to introduce background information that will help readers understand what happens next in the story. Use a natural way in your language for introducing background information.

The Greek word that Mark used is a negative word that can be used to turn a negative statement into a question that expects a negative answer.

Alternate translation: “For the Son of Man will die just as it has been written about him”
14:21	hl6z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καθὼς γέγραπται	1	Here, Mark uses **it has been written** to mean that it is prophesied in the Old Testament Scriptures.

14:22	ne53		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ἄρτον	1	The term **bread** refers to a loaf of bread, which is a lump of flour dough that a person has shaped and baked.

14:22	ukuc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἄρτον	1	Since Jews did not eat **bread** made with yeast during this festival, this bread would not have had any yeast in it and it would have been flat. If it would be helpful in your language, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “a loaf of unleavened bread”
14:22	oqv3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	εὐλογήσας	1	Mark assumes that his readers will know that the phrase **having blessed {it}** means that Jesus prayed to God before they ate the bread. Jewish people would have known that at the beginning of the Passover meal the host would begin the meal by praying a prayer of praise to God for the bread. If it would be helpful in your language, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “and having prayed and given thanks to God for it” or “and having prayed a prayer of praise to God for it”
14:22	ula2			ἔκλασεν	1	Jesus may have divided the loaf of **bread** into many pieces, as the UST says, or he may have divided it into two pieces and given those to the apostles to divide among themselves. If possible, use an expression in your language that would apply to either situation.
14:22	amg7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτοῖς	1	The implication of the phrase **and gave {it} to them** is that Jesus **gave** the bread to the disciples to eat.

14:24	q5hn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τοῦτό ἐστιν τὸ αἷμά μου τῆς διαθήκης, τὸ ἐκχυννόμενον ὑπὲρ πολλῶν	1	In the Hebrew culture, covenants were customarily ratified through animal sacrifices that involved shedding the **blood** of the animals. Here Jesus is likely alluding to that practice in light of his impending sacrificial death. If it would be helpful in your language, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “This is my blood which ratifies the covenant, and my blood is being poured out for many people”
14:24	nj85		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	τοῦτό ἐστιν τὸ αἷμά μου τῆς διαθήκης, τὸ ἐκχυννόμενον ὑπὲρ πολλῶν	1	The phrase **of the** introduces the purpose for Jesus shedding his **blood**. Jesus is stating that the purpose for him shedding his blood is to establish the new **covenant**. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a purpose. Alternate translation: “This is my blood which is being poured out for many for the purpose of establishing God’s covenant” or “This is my blood which is being poured out for many for the purpose of making God’s covenant with his people”
14:24	hs24		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τοῦτό ἐστιν τὸ αἷμά μου τῆς διαθήκης, τὸ ἐκχυννόμενον ὑπὲρ πολλῶν	1	See the discussion in the General Notes to this chapter about how to translate the phrase **This is my blood**.

14:24	pt5q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τὸ ἐκχυννόμενον ὑπὲρ πολλῶν	1	Jesus is referring to the way his **blood** is going to be **poured out** when he dies.

If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate it as a positive statement. Alternate translation: “that you can know for certain that the next time I drink wine will be when I drink it new” or “that you could know for certain that I will only drink wine again when I drink it new”
14:25	t7ai		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐκ τοῦ γενήματος τῆς ἀμπέλου	1	Jesus is referring to the juice (which is fermented and becomes wine) that people squeeze from grapes that grow on grapevines as if it were the **fruit** or the grapes themselves.

14:25	qyf8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	τῆς ἡμέρας	1	Here Jesus uses the term **day** to refer to a particular period of time. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent idiom or use plain language, as modeled by the UST.
14:25	y1pf			αὐτὸ πίνω καινὸν, ἐν τῇ Βασιλείᾳ τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	The word **new** could be referring to: (1) Jesus, and therefore would mean “again” or “in a new way.” See the parallel account in [Luke 22:18](../luk/022/18.md) where Jesus seems to mean this. Alternate translation: “I drink it in a new way in the kingdom of God” or “I drink it anew in the kingdom of God” or “I drink it again when I celebrate the Passover after it is fulfilled when God’s kingdom is consummated” (2) the wine and thus would be referring to drinking a new type or quality of wine. Alternate translation: “I drink new wine”
14:25	ue3j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐν τῇ Βασιλείᾳ τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	See how you decided to translate the phrase **the kingdom of God** in [1:15](../01/15.md). If it would be helpful in your language to understand the abstract noun **kingdom**, you could express the idea behind it with a verb such as “rule” as modeled by the UST.
14:26	l996		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ὑμνήσαντες	1	A **hymn** is a song or poem that is sung to praise God. The Jews would traditionally sing a psalm from Psalms 113–118 at the end of the Passover meal, so the **hymn** that Jesus and his disciples sang was likely one of these psalms. If your readers would not be familiar with a **hymn**, you could use the name for religious songs in your culture, if you have them, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “having sung a psalm” or “having sung a song of praise to God”
14:27	pu4s			λέγει αὐτοῖς ὁ Ἰησοῦς	1	Alternate translation: “Jesus said to his disciples”
14:27	lty4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	πάντες σκανδαλισθήσεσθε	1	Here Jesus speaks as if his disciples were going to **stumble**. He means that they will reject and desert him because of what will happen to him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “You all will desert me” or “You all will run away from me”
14:27	gkb5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	γέγραπται	1	Here, Mark uses **it is written** to introduce a quotation from an Old Testament passage of Scripture, ([Zechariah 13:7](../zec/13/07.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase that indicates that Mark is quoting from an important text. Alternate translation: “it is written in God’s Word” or “it is written by Zechariah the prophet”
14:27	jp51		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	γέγραπται	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can express the idea in active form, as modeled by the UST, or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Jesus implies that “Zechariah” did it. Alternate translation: “regarding what would happen to the Messiah and his followers, Zechariah wrote”
14:27	qzzv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	ὅτι γέγραπται, πατάξω τὸν ποιμένα καὶ τὰ πρόβατα διασκορπισθήσονται	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “because Zechariah the prophet wrote that God would strike the shepherd and the sheep would be scattered” or “because Zechariah the prophet predicted in the Scriptures that God would strike the shepherd and the sheep would be scattered”
14:27	cv7z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	πατάξω τὸν ποιμένα καὶ τὰ πρόβατα διασκορπισθήσονται	1	Jesus is quoting a prophecy from ([Zechariah 13:7](../zec/13/07.md)) in which the prophet Zechariah speaks of the Messiah as if he were a **shepherd** and of the Messiah’s followers as if they were **sheep**. Since this is a quotation from Scripture, translate the words directly rather than providing an explanation of them, even if your language does not customarily use such figures of speech. If you want to explain the meaning of the metaphor, we recommend that you do that in a footnote rather than in the Bible text.
14:27	w2az		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τὰ πρόβατα διασκορπισθήσονται	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can express the idea behind the phrase **the sheep will be scattered** in another way that is natural in your language. The phrase **the sheep will be scattered** does not necessarily imply that there is someone making the action of scattering happen, so try to translate this phrase in a way that simply shows that **the sheep will be scattered** without saying who will make the action happen. Alternate translation: “the sheep will run away in different directions”
14:28	dm1q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐγερθῆναί με	1	The phrase **raised up** means to having become alive again after having died. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express that explicitly. Alternate translation: “I am made alive again”
14:28	qi4g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τὸ ἐγερθῆναί με	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Jesus implies that God will do it. Alternate translation: “God raises me from the dead”
14:29	op1t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πάντες	1	By using the word **all** in this context, the implication is that **Peter** is referring to “all the other disciples.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could express that explicitly. Alternate translation: “all the other disciples”

14:29	div5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	οὐκ ἐγώ	1	In the phrase **not I**, Peter is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete. If it would be helpful in your language, you could supply these words from the context. Alternate translation: “I will not fall away” or “I will not forsake you”
14:30	z2q9			ἀμὴν, λέγω σοι	1	See how you translated the statement **Truly I say to you** in [3:28](../03/28.md).

If it would be helpful in your language, you could express that explicitly, as modeled by the UST.
14:32	deg7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἔρχονται	1	The pronoun **they** refers to Jesus and his disciples. If this might confuse your readers, you could say the meaning explicitly, as modeled by the UST.
14:32	ni66		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	ἔρχονται	1	# Connecting Statement:\n\nYour language may say “went” rather than **come** or “came” in contexts such as this. Use whichever is more natural. Alternate translation: “they went” or “they go”
14:34	eyw3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	ἐστιν ἡ ψυχή μου	1	By using the phrase **My soul**, Jesus is speaking of his entire self by referring to one part of himself, his **soul**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your culture or use plain language, as modeled by the UST.
14:34	krj1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ψυχή μου	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **soul**, you can express the same idea in another way, as modeled by the UST.
14:34	ic1g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	ἕως θανάτου	1	Jesus is using the phrase **to death** to describe the extent of his grief. Jesus is exaggerating in order to show the depth of the distress and sorrow that he feels. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your language that expresses great sorrow, or you could turn the phrase **to death** into a simile, as modeled by the UST. Alternate translation: “and I have so much grief that it makes me feel like I am near death”
14:35	nk8l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	εἰ δυνατόν ἐστιν	1	Alternate translation: “if possible”
14:35	wc6d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	παρέλθῃ & ἡ ὥρα	1	Jesus is using the term **hour** to refer to a specific time at which an event or events would take place. Here, the phrase **the hour** refers specifically to the time of Jesus’ suffering. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning in plain language, as the UST models.
14:35	gj74		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	παρέλθῃ ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ ἡ ὥρα	1	Here, Jesus is referring to the events that would take place during the upcoming hours as if they were the **hour** itself. Because Jesus is associating the upcoming events with the time of the events themselves, by asking that **the hour might pass**, Jesus is actually asking that the events themselves would not happen. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or use plain language. Alternate translation: “the upcoming events would pass from him” or “he would not have to experience the upcoming things which he knew he was going to have to suffer”
14:36	c11w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate	Ἀββά	1	The word **Abba** is an Aramaic word meaning **Father** and which the Jews used to address their fathers. Mark writes it as it sounds in Aramaic (he transliterates it) and then translates its meaning into Greek for his readers, who did not know Aramaic. Since the Aramaic word **Abba** is followed by the Greek word **Father**, it is best to transliterate **Abba** and then give its meaning in your language as Mark does.
14:36	t9r2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	ὁ Πατήρ	1	The word **Father** is an important title for God.
14:36	jk6a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	παρένεγκε τὸ ποτήριον τοῦτο ἀπ’ ἐμοῦ	1	Jesus is referring to the sufferings he will soon experience as if they were a **cup** of bitter-tasting liquid that he would have to drink. If your readers would not understand what **cup** means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Please spare me from these sufferings”
14:36	s1r5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	παρένεγκε τὸ ποτήριον τοῦτο ἀπ’ ἐμοῦ	1	The statement **Remove this cup from me** is an imperative, but it should be translated as a request rather than as a command. It may be helpful to add an expression such as “please” to make this clear. Alternate translation: “Please spare me from these sufferings”
14:37	ja6d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	εὑρίσκει αὐτοὺς καθεύδοντας	1	The pronoun **them** refers to Peter, James, and John. If it would be helpful in your language, you could indicate that in a way that would be natural in your language. Alternate translation: “finds the three disciples sleeping”
14:37	kp33		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	Σίμων, καθεύδεις? οὐκ ἴσχυσας μίαν ὥραν γρηγορῆσαι?	1	Jesus is not asking for information, but is using the question form here to rebuke **Peter** for falling asleep. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate Jesus’ words as a statement, as modeled by the UST.
14:38	hi36		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	προσεύχεσθε, ἵνα μὴ ἔλθητε εἰς πειρασμόν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **temptation**, you can express the idea behind it with a verb such as “tempt.” Alternate translation: “pray, so that nothing will tempt you to sin”
14:38	zrp4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	προσεύχεσθε, ἵνα μὴ ἔλθητε εἰς πειρασμόν	1	The implications are that the disciples will soon experience the **temptation** to abandon Jesus in order to save themselves. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “pray that when the Jewish leaders come to arrest me and you are tempted to try to save yourselves by running away or denying that you know me, you will not sin by doing that”
14:38	c1je		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τὸ & πνεῦμα	1	Jesus is describing the inner part of a person (which includes their desires and will) by association with their **spirit**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your culture or use plain language. See how you translated **spirit** in [2:8](../02/08.md), where **spirit** is used with a similar meaning. Alternate translation: “The inner self” or “The inner person”
14:38	djxc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τὸ & πνεῦμα	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **spirit**, you can express the same idea in another way, as modeled by the UST.

If it would be helpful in your language, you could supply these words from the context. Alternate translation: “is willing to do what is right” or “is willing to do what pleases God” or “is willing to obey me”
14:38	b909			ἡ & σὰρξ ἀσθενής	1	Here, the word **flesh** could: (1) include the meaning of both option 2 and option 3 and therefore **flesh** would refer to both the weakness of the human body and also to the deficiency of human desire and ability to do what is right. Alternate translation: “the body and your spiritual strength is weak” (2) refer to the human “body.” Alternate translation: “the body is weak” (3) refer to the sinful part of human nature that prefers to seek comfort and seek what it desires rather than obey God and do the things that please him. Alternate translation: “the sinful human nature is weak”
14:39	l9nj			τὸν αὐτὸν λόγον εἰπών	1	Alternate translation: “and said the same thing he had prayed the first time”
14:40	zkb2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	εὗρεν αὐτοὺς καθεύδοντας, ἦσαν γὰρ αὐτῶν οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ καταβαρυνόμενοι	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes.

If this is the case, then Jesus is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete. If it would be helpful in your language, you could supply these words. Matthew, in his parallel account in [Matt 26:56](../mat/26/56.md), supplies the words “all this has happened” between the words **But** and **so that**, so if this is an ellipsis these are the words that should be supplied. Alternate translation: “But all this has happened so that the Scriptures might be fulfilled” or “But, so that the Scriptures might be fulfilled, all this has happened” (2) instead be translated with an imperatival meaning as “But let the Scriptures be fulfilled.” Alternate translation: “But let the Scriptures be fulfilled”

Jesus implies that both God and sinful humans are acting to fulfill Scripture. God is intentionally acting to fulfill Scripture by leading Jesus to be willing to die and not flee from those trying to kill him. Sinful humans are also acting to fulfill Scripture even though they do not know that they are fulfilling what God had foretold in the Old Testament would happen to the Messiah. Because of this, if you must state who did the action, it would be best to translate this in a way that includes both or allows for both. Alternate translation: “God might fulfill through the acts of sinful men what has been foretold in the Scriptures”

15:intro	d823				0	# Mark 15 General Notes\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### “The curtain of the temple was split in two”\n\nThe curtain in the temple was an important symbol that showed that people needed to have someone speak to God for them. They could not speak to God directly, because all people are sinful and God hates sin. God split the curtain to show that Jesus’ people can now speak to God directly because Jesus has paid for their sins.\n\n### The tomb\n\nThe tomb in which Jesus was buried ([Mark 15:46](../mrk/15/46.md)) was the kind of tomb in which wealthy Jewish families buried their dead. It was an actual room cut into a rock. It had a flat place on one side where they could place the body after they had put oil and spices on it and wrapped it in cloth. Then they would roll a large rock in front of the tomb so no one could see inside or enter.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Sarcasm\n\nThe soldiers were insulting Jesus when they put a “purple robe” on him and placed a “crown of thorns” on his head (See Mark 15:17) and said, “Hail, King of the Jews” (See Mark 15:18) and bent their knees and bowed down to him (See Mark 15:19). These actions were symbolic of things that people would do to a king, but the soldiers did not really believe that Jesus was a king. By pretending that they thought Jesus was a king, and by putting a “crown of thorns” on Jesus’ head instead of a regular crown, and by “striking his head with a staff and spitting on him” (See Mark 15:19) the soldiers showed that they did not believe that Jesus was the Son of God. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]] and (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]]) and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/mock]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### The historic present\n\nTo call attention to a development in the story, Mark uses the present tense in past narration. In this chapter, the historic present occurs in verses 2, 16, 17, 20, 21, 22, and 27. If it would not be natural to do that in your language, you could use the past tense in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense]])\n\n### Golgotha\n\nThe word “Golgotha” is an Aramaic word. Mark used Greek letters to express the sound of this Aramaic word so that his readers would know how it sounded, and then he told them it meant “Place of a Skull.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate]])\n\n### Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?\n\nThis is an Aramaic phrase. Mark transliterates the sounds of this phrase by writing them with Greek letters. Mark used Greek letters to express the sound of this Aramaic phrase so that his readers would know how it sounded, and then he told them that it meant “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate]])
15:1	xz7c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	δήσαντες τὸν Ἰησοῦν, ἀπήνεγκαν	1	The Jewish religious leaders commanded that Jesus should be **bound** but did not bind him themselves. It would have been the guards who actually bound Jesus and **led {him} away**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could indicate this in your translation, as modeled by the UST. Alternate translation: “commanded the guards to bind Jesus and then the guards bound him and led him away”
15:1	v2yf			παρέδωκαν Πειλάτῳ	1	Alternate translation: “delivered him over to Pilate” or “transferred control of Jesus to Pilate”
15:2	kn7i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	ἀποκριθεὶς αὐτῷ λέγει	1	Together the two words **answering** and **says** mean that Jesus responded to what Pilate asked him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent idiom or use plain language. Alternate translation: “responding to him, says”
15:2	dh6n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	σὺ λέγεις	1	**You say {it}** is an idiom. Jesus is using it to acknowledge that what Pilate has said is true. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent idiom or use plain language. Alternate translation: “Yes, it is as you say”

Use a natural way in your language for introducing background information. Alternate translation: “Now the chief priests were accusing Jesus of many things”
15:3	ue18			κατηγόρουν αὐτοῦ & πολλά	1	Alternate translation: “were accusing Jesus of many things” or “were saying that Jesus had done many wrong things”

15:6	ul19		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	κατὰ δὲ ἑορτὴν, ἀπέλυεν αὐτοῖς ἕνα δέσμιον, ὃν παρῃτοῦντο	1	The word **Now** is used here to mark a break in the main story line as Mark shifts to telling background information about Pilate’s tradition of releasing a prisoner at feasts. Mark is providing background information in this verse to help readers understand what happens next. Use a natural way in your language for introducing background information. Alternate translation: “It was Pilate’s custom to release to them a prisoner of their choice at the festival”
15:7	pdy3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	δὲ	1	The word **Now** is used here to mark a continuation of the break in the main story line which began in the preceding verse. Mark introduces more background information, this time about Barabbas, to help readers understand what happens next. Use a natural way in your language for introducing background information. Alternate translation: “And”
15:7	lx8n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	λεγόμενος	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “who bore the name”
15:7	wvzq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	δεδεμένος	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Mark implies that “the Roman authorities” had soldiers do it. Alternate translation: “whom the Roman soldiers had bound”
15:7	iofn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	φόνον πεποιήκεισαν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **murder**, you can express the same idea with a verbal form, as modeled by the UST.
15:8	a4xb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	ἀναβὰς	1	Your language may say “having gone up” rather than **having come up** in contexts such as this. Use whichever is more natural. Alternate translation: “having gone up”
15:9	o3j4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	ἀπεκρίθη αὐτοῖς λέγων	1	When translating the phrase **answered them, saying** see how you translated the similar phrase “answering him, says” in [15:2](../15/02.md). Alternate translation: “responded to them”
15:10	i4ib		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	ἐγίνωσκεν γὰρ ὅτι διὰ φθόνον παραδεδώκεισαν αὐτὸν οἱ ἀρχιερεῖς	1	Mark provides this background information about why Jesus was **handed over** in order to help readers understand why Pilate asked the question in [15:9](../15/09.md). Mark introduces the background information in this verse with the word **For**. Use the natural form in your language for expressing background information.
15:10	u647		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	διὰ φθόνον παραδεδώκεισαν αὐτὸν οἱ ἀρχιερεῖς	1	The **chief priests** envied Jesus because so many people were following him and becoming his disciples. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express that explicitly. If you decide to express this information explicitly, consider beginning a new sentence. Alternate translation: “the chief priests were envious of Jesus because so many people were becoming his disciples. Pilate knew that this was why they had handed him over” or “the chief priests were envious of Jesus’ popularity among the people. This is why they had handed him over”
15:10	yjp3			παραδεδώκεισαν αὐτὸν	1	Alternate translation: “had handed Jesus over”
15:11	y5w3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἀνέσεισαν τὸν ὄχλον	1	Mark speaks of the **chief priests** as if they had **stirred** a pot and put into motion things that had been lying quietly on the bottom. Mark means that the **chief priests** encouraged the crowd to ask Pilate to release Barabbas. If your readers would not understand what **stirred up** means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “encouraged the crowd” or “incited the crowd”
15:11	pvu6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	ἵνα	1	The phrase **so that** introduces what the **chief priests stirred up the crowd** to request of Pilate. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a purpose clause. Alternate translation: “in order that”
15:12	keq2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	Πειλᾶτος πάλιν ἀποκριθεὶς ἔλεγεν αὐτοῖς	1	# Connecting Statement:\n\nSee how you translated the similar statement in [15:9](../15/09.md). Alternate translation: “Pilate again responded to them, saying”
15:12	p94y			πάλιν	1	Mark uses the word **again** here because Pilate had already spoken to them regarding this matter in [15:9](../15/09.md). Use a natural form in your language for expressing the meaning of **again** as it is used here.
15:12	vlm3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τί οὖν ποιήσω λέγετε τὸν Βασιλέα τῶν Ἰουδαίων?	1	Pilate uses the word **therefore** because, as [15:11](../15/11.md) indicates, the chief priests had “stirred up the crowd” to request that Pilate “release Barabbas” to them. So Pilate is asking what he should **therefore** do with Jesus if Barabbas is the prisoner to be released at their request. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express that explicitly. Alternate translation: “If I release Barabbas, what then should I do with the one you call the King of the Jews”
15:12	r7ge			οὖν	1	Alternate translation: “then”
15:13	n6jb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	σταύρωσον αὐτόν	1	The Romans executed some criminals by nailing them to a wooden beam with a crossbar and setting the beam upright so that the criminals would slowly suffocate. That was what it meant to **Crucify** someone. Alternate translation: “Nail him to a cross! Execute him!”
15:13	nwms		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	σταύρωσον αὐτόν	1	Here, the word **Crucify** is an imperative, but since the crowd cannot command Pilate to do this, you could translate the phrase **Crucify him** as an expression of what they want. Alternate translation: “We want you to nail him to a cross to execute him”
15:14	e55i			σταύρωσον αὐτόν	1	See how you translated the phrase **Crucify him** in [15:13](../15/13.md).
15:15	qt8y			τῷ ὄχλῳ τὸ ἱκανὸν ποιῆσαι	1	Alternate translation: “to make the crowd happy by doing what they wanted him to do”
15:15	fwg6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	φραγελλώσας	1	Mark assumes that his readers will know that Pilate did not actually flog **Jesus**, and he assumes his readers will know that Pilate ordered his soldiers to do it. If it would be helpful in your language, you could indicate that explicitly, as modeled by the UST.
15:15	yzn5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	φραγελλώσας	1	If your readers would not be familiar with this form of punishment, you could explain explicitly what flogging was. Flogging was a Roman penalty in which they whipped a person with a whip to which were attached pieces of bone and metal to increase the whip’s capacity to do harm to the person being flogged. Alternate translation: “having whipped Jesus with a whip with pieces of bone and metal attached to it” or “having whipped Jesus with a whip to which was attached pieces of bone and metal”
15:15	w1sl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	καὶ παρέδωκεν τὸν Ἰησοῦν φραγελλώσας, ἵνα σταυρωθῇ	1	The phrase **so that** introduces a purpose clause. With the phrase **so that he might be crucified**, Mark is stating the purpose for which Pilate **handed Jesus over**. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a purpose clause. Alternate translation: “and after having Jesus flogged, he handed Jesus over to them in order that they might crucify him”
15:15	r9id		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	σταυρωθῇ	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Mark implies that Pilate’s “soldiers” did it. Alternate translation: “his soldiers might take him away and crucify him”
15:16	eg6x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	ὅ ἐστιν πραιτώριον	1	By clarifying **(that is, the Praetorium)**, Mark explains that **the courtyard** is part of the official residence of the Roman governor. This background information is given to help his readers understand exactly what he means by using the word **courtyard**. Use the natural form in your language for expressing background information. Alternate translation: “which is, the Praetorium”
15:16	lb2x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πραιτώριον	1	The **Praetorium** was where the Roman governor stayed when he was in Jerusalem and where the soldiers in Jerusalem lived. Mark assumes that his readers will know what the **Praetorium** is. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express that explicitly. Alternate translation: “the palace where the governor and his soldiers lived” or “the Roman governor’s residence”
15:16	b5gs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὅλην τὴν σπεῖραν	1	Mark assumes that his readers will know that a **cohort** was a unit of Roman soldiers. A **cohort** normally numbered around 600 men but could sometimes refer to a number as small as 200 men. Here, by saying **the whole cohort**, Mark most likely means all the soldiers from the **cohort** who were on duty at that time. If it would be helpful in your language, you could indicate explicitly that a **cohort** was a unit of Roman soldiers. Additionally, you could also say explicitly that it was only the soldiers who were on duty who were called together, as modeled by the UST. Alternate translation: “the whole unit of soldiers” or “the whole unit of soldiers who were on duty there”
15:17	tn33		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐνδιδύσκουσιν αὐτὸν πορφύραν, καὶ περιτιθέασιν αὐτῷ πλέξαντες ἀκάνθινον στέφανον	1	In Roman culture, a **purple robe** and a **crown** were worn by kings. The soldiers put a **crown** made from **thorns** and a **purple robe** on Jesus in order to mock him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning explicitly. It may be helpful to your readers to make this a separate sentence. Alternate translation: “they put a purple robe on him and placed on his head a crown that they had made by twisting thorns together. They did these things in order to mock him by pretending that they believed he really was a king”
15:17	ly5a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	πορφύραν	1	The word **purple** denotes a color. If your readers would be unfamiliar with the color **purple**, you could use the closest equivalent color that your readers would be familiar with such as “crimson” or “scarlet” (“crimson” and “scarlet” are two different names for the same color) since Matthew records in [Matt 27:28](../mat/27/28.md) that the color of the robe was “scarlet.” The fact that Matthew and Mark use a different color to describe the color of the same robe probably means that its color closely resembled both “scarlet” and **purple**. If your readers would be unfamiliar with these colors, you could use the closest equivalent color that they would be familiar with, such as “red” or “dark red.” Alternate translation: “dark red” or “red” or “crimson” or “scarlet”
15:17	xfk8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	πλέξαντες ἀκάνθινον στέφανον	1	Mark uses the word **thorns** to refer to small branches with **thorns** on them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “having twisted it together from thorny branches, a crown”
15:18	ft1j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony	ἀσπάζεσθαι αὐτόν, Χαῖρε, Βασιλεῦ τῶν Ἰουδαίων	1	The word **Rejoice** was a common greeting, but the soldiers used this greeting in order to mock Jesus. They did not believe that Jesus was really the **King of the Jews**. They actually meant to communicate the opposite of the literal meaning of their words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could provide a brief explanation. Alternate translation: “to salute him by saying in a mocking manner: ‘Rejoice, King of the Jews’”
15:19	gz3b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony	καλάμῳ, καὶ	1	Matthew records in [Matt 27:19](../mat/27/19.md) that the soldiers placed a **reed** in Jesus’ “right hand” and that “they mocked him” by saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!” At this time in history, kings used scepters. The **reed** would have resembled a scepter, so the soldiers are using a **reed** here to mock Jesus. If it would be helpful in your language, you could provide a brief explanation. Alternate translation: “with a reed that they were using as a pretend scepter, and they were”
15:19	muvw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	ἐνέπτυον αὐτῷ	1	In this culture, the action of **spitting on** a person was a way to show thorough disgust. It expressed strong contempt for someone. If your readers would not understand the meaning of **spitting on** someone in this context and there is a gesture with a similar meaning in your culture, you could use it here in place of this action.
15:19	a8a9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony	τιθέντες τὰ γόνατα, προσεκύνουν αὐτῷ	1	The acts of **bending the knee** and **bowing down** were things normally done as a way of honoring kings. The soldiers actually mean to communicate the opposite of the literal meaning of their actions. These soldiers do not really believe that Jesus is a king, but rather, they are doing these things to express mockery. If it would be helpful in your language, you could provide a brief explanation. Also see the discussion about this idea in the General Notes for this chapter. Alternate translation: “bending the knee, they were bowing down to him in order to mock him”
15:20	styv			πορφύραν	1	See how you translated the word **purple** in [15:17](../15/17.md).

15:20	euk7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	ἵνα	1	The phrase **so that** introduces the purpose for which Jesus was **led** out, namely that **they might crucify him**. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a purpose clause. Alternate translation: “in order that”
15:21	cj4l			ἀγγαρεύουσιν & ἵνα ἄρῃ τὸν σταυρὸν αὐτοῦ	1	According to Roman law, a solider could force a man he came upon along the road to carry a load. In this case, they forced Simon to carry Jesus’ cross.

Use the natural form in your language for expressing background information.
15:21	d3i2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	ἵνα	1	The phrase **so that** introduces the purpose for which **they pressed into service a certain passerby, Simon of Cyrene**, namely **so that** they could require him to **carry** Jesus’ **cross**. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a purpose clause. Alternate translation: “in order that”

Mark used Greek letters to express the sound of this Aramaic word so that his readers would know how it sounded, and then he told them that it meant **Place of a Skull**. In your translation you could spell it the way it sounds in your language and then explain its meaning.
15:22	e49p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	Γολγοθᾶν & Κρανίου Τόπος	1	Matthew says in [Matt 27:33](../mat/27/33.md) that **Golgotha** was “a place called Golgotha,” so it is clear that this was the name of a location, but the reason why this place was called **Place of a Skull** is not known. It could have been called **Place of a Skull** because the appearance of this place resembled a skull or because it was the site of so many executions, in which case the name **Skull** is being used as metonymy to refer to death. Because the reason that this location was called **Place of a Skull** is unknown, you should translate this phrase in a way that allows for either meaning, as modeled by the ULT and UST.
15:22	m1dd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐστιν μεθερμηνευόμενον	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language, as modeled by the UST.

Instead, Jesus refused to drink it. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a contrast.
15:24	s5m6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	βάλλοντες κλῆρον ἐπ’ αὐτὰ	1	The term **lot** refers to an object with different markings on various sides that would be used to decide randomly among several possibilities. It would be tossed onto the ground to see which marked side would come up on top. If your readers would not be familiar with **a lot**, you could state that it was “something like dice,” as UST does. But if your readers would also not be familiar with dice, then you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “and the Roman soldiers gambled for them”
15:24	mn6x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	τίς τί ἄρῃ	1	Mark is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from earlier in the sentence if it would be helpful in your language. Alternate translation: “to decide who would take what”
15:25	dzbr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	δὲ	1	Mark uses the word **Now** to introduce the background information of the time of day when Jesus was crucified. Use the natural form in your language for expressing background information. Alternate translation: “And”
15:25	q1ze		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal	ὥρα τρίτη	1	The Jews and the Romans divided the day into a 12-hour time period and the night into a 12-hour period. Here the phrase **the third hour** refers to **the third hour** of the day, which was approximately three hours after sunrise. Here, **third** is an ordinal number. If your language does not use ordinal numbers, you can translate the phrase **the third hour** as “nine o’clock in the morning”, as modeled by the UST, since this is what time the phrase **the third hour** is referring to. Alternately, you can express the meaning of the phrase **the third hour** in some other way that is natural in your culture. Alternate translation: “nine o’clock in the morning”

If your readers would not understand what it means to shake one’s head at someone in this context and there is a gesture with a similar meaning in your culture, you could consider using it here in your translation.
15:29	a7ft		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	οὐὰ	1	**Aha** is an exclamation word that communicates triumph, usually over an enemy. Use an exclamation that is natural in your language for communicating this. Alternate translation: “Take that!”

15:31	o9qv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἄλλους ἔσωσεν	1	In context, the Jewish leaders are implicitly referring to how Jesus **saved others** by healing their diseases, releasing them from demon-possession, and helping saving them from other physical problems. They did not think that Jesus saved them from sin or divine judgment. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “He supposedly saved other people by doing miracles for them”
15:32	t1vm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony	ὁ Χριστὸς, ὁ Βασιλεὺς Ἰσραὴλ καταβάτω	1	Here, the Jewish leaders are using irony.

If it would be helpful in your language, you could indicate plainly that the Jewish leaders are using this as a hypothetical situation. Use whatever form in your language would be most natural to communicate this. Alternate translation: “If he really is the Christ, the King of Israel, let him come down now from the cross.

15:32	f8yw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	ἵνα	1	The phrase **so that** introduces the purpose for which they said that Jesus should **come down now from the cross**, which was in order that **they might see and might believe**. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a purpose clause. Alternate translation: “in order that”
15:32	r6c4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πιστεύσωμεν	1	The phrase **might believe** means to believe in Jesus. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “believe in him”
15:32	dcb9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	συνεσταυρωμένοι	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Mark implies in [15:20](../15/20.md) that “soldiers” are the ones who are crucifying Jesus and the two other men. Alternate translation: “whom the soldiers had crucified”
15:33	q1gh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal	ὥρας ἕκτης	1	The Jews and the Romans divided the day into a 12-hour time period and the night into a 12-hour period. Here, the phrase **the sixth hour** refers to the sixth hour of the day, often called “twelve o’clock” or “noon” in some parts of the world. The **the sixth hour** of the day was approximately six hours after sunrise. The term **sixth** is an ordinal number. If your language does not use ordinal numbers, you can translate the phrase **the sixth hour** as “noon”, as modeled by the UST, or as “twelve o’clock.” Alternately, you can translate it in some other way that is natural in your language. See how you translated the phrase “the third hour” in [15:25](../15/25.md). Alternate translation: “the hour of twelve o’clock”
15:33	m67d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal	ἕως ὥρας ἐνάτης	1	The phrase **the ninth hour** refers to “three o’clock in the afternoon”, approximately nine hours after sunrise. The term **ninth** is an ordinal number. If your language does not use ordinal numbers, you can translate the phrase **the ninth hour** as “three o’clock in the afternoon,” as modeled by the UST, or in some other way that is natural in your language. See how you translated the phrase “the third hour” in [15:25](../15/25.md), and the phrase “the sixth hour” earlier in this verse. Alternate translation: “until three hours after noon” or “for three hours”

Jesus is quoting from [Psalm 22:1](../psa/22/01.md). Mark uses Greek letters to express the sounds of this Aramaic phrase so that his readers would know how it sounded, and then he told them that it meant **My God, my God, why did you forsake me**. In your translation you could spell this phrase the way it sounds in your language and then explain its meaning.

You would then present the combined verses as 40–41, as modeled by the UST.
15:40	zc9b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	Μαριὰμ ἡ Μαγδαληνὴ & Μαρία ἡ Ἰακώβου τοῦ μικροῦ καὶ Ἰωσῆ μήτηρ	1	Because **Mary** was a very common name at this time and because Mark refers to two different women with the name **Mary** in this verse, he provides this background information to help readers know to which **Mary** he is referring in each case. Use the natural form in your language for expressing background information.
15:40	z5ra		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ἰακώβου τοῦ μικροῦ	1	The word **James** is the name a man. This man is probably referred to as **the younger** here to distinguish him from other men named **James**, since he is not James the brother of Jesus, James son of Zebedee, or James son of Alphaeus.
15:40	wdrq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ἰωσῆ	1	The word **Joses** is the name a man. This **Joses** was not the same person as the younger brother of Jesus. See how you translated the same name in [6:3](../06/03.md).

Use the natural form in your language for expressing background information.
15:41	a3qk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	αἱ συναναβᾶσαι	1	**Jerusalem** was higher than almost any other place in Israel, so it was normal for people to speak of going **up** to Jerusalem and going down from it. Your language may say “gone up” rather than **come up** in contexts such as this. Use whichever is more natural. Alternate translation: “who had gone up with”
15:42	ekbl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge	ἐπεὶ ἦν παρασκευή, ὅ ἐστιν προσάββατον	1	If it would be more natural in your language to introduce Joseph of Arimathea and what he did before giving the reason for what he did, you could create a verse bridge by moving this sentence to verse 43 and taking the information about Joseph of Arimathea from verse 43 and placing it after the phrase **And when evening had already come** in this verse. You would then present the combined verses as 42–43, as modeled by the UST.
15:42	lxm5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	ἤδη ὀψίας γενομένης, ἐπεὶ ἦν παρασκευή, ὅ ἐστιν προσάββατον	1	# Connecting Statement:\n\nMark provides this background information about what day it was to help readers understand what happens in this episode. God commanded in Deuteronomy 21:22–23 that any person who was put to death by hanging on a wooden object should be buried on the same day that they were put to death. Because of this and the fact that **evening already having come** and because the following day was the **Sabbath**, on which Jews did not work, the people involved wanted to bury Jesus’ body quickly. Use the natural form in your language for expressing background information.
15:42	ug97		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	παρασκευή, ὅ ἐστιν προσάββατον	1	The phrase **the Day of Preparation** refers to the day on which Jews would make preparations for the **Sabbath** so that they would not have to do work on the **Sabbath**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could indicate explicitly what the Day of Preparation was. It may be helpful to make this a separate sentence. Alternate translation: “the Day of Preparation, on which Jews prepared for the Sabbath. The Day of Preparation is the day before the Sabbath”

Use the natural form in your language for introducing a new character.

If it would be helpful in your language, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “Joseph and the people who helped him took Jesus’ body down, wrapped the body in the linen cloth, and put it in a tomb that was cut from a rock.

16:intro	j5yz				0	# Mark 16 General Notes\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### The tomb\n\nThe tomb in which Jesus was buried ([Mark 15:46](../mrk/15/46.md)) was the kind of tomb in which wealthy Jewish families buried their dead. It was an actual room cut into a rock. It had a flat place on one side where they could place the body after they had put oil and spices on it and wrapped it in cloth. Then they would roll a large rock in front of the tomb so no one could see inside or enter.\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### The historic present\n\nTo call attention to a development in the story, Mark uses the present tense in past narration. In this chapter, the historic present occurs in verses 2, 4, and 6. If it would not be natural to do that in your language, you could use the past tense in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense]])\n\n### A young man dressed in a white robe\n\nMatthew, Mark, Luke, and John all wrote about angels in white clothing with the women at Jesus’ tomb. Two of the authors called them men, but that is only because the angels were in human form. Two of the authors wrote about two angels, but the other two authors wrote about only one of them. It is best to translate each of these passages as it appears in the ULT without trying to make the passages all say exactly the same thing. (See: [Matthew 28:1–2](../mat/28/01.md) and [Mark 16:5](../mrk/16/05.md) and [Luke 24:4](../luk/24/04.md) and [John 20:12](../jhn/20/12.md))
16:1	p61n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	διαγενομένου τοῦ Σαββάτου	1	By using the phrase **the Sabbath having passed**, Mark is explaining that the Jewish day of rest, called the **Sabbath**, had ended and that it was now permissible, according to Jewish law, for these women to buy spices. The phrase **the Sabbath having passed** does not mean that the actual day on which the **Sabbath** occurred was over. The Jewish **Sabbath** ended at sunset on Saturday evening. If it would be helpful in your language, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “when the sun had set on Saturday evening”
16:1	cw1b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	ἡ Μαρία ἡ Μαγδαληνὴ	1	# Connecting Statement:\n\nSee how you translated **Mary Magdalene** in [15:40](../15/40.md).

Much as in [15:40](../15/40.md), this man is probably referred to as **the younger** to distinguish him from other men named **James**, since he is not James the brother of Jesus, James son of Zebedee, or James son of Alphaeus.

16:1	zrcf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	ἵνα	1	The phrase **so that** introduces a purpose clause. The women **bought spices** for the purpose of anointing Jesus’ body with them. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a purpose clause. Alternate translation: “in order that”
16:2	qcmt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τῇ μιᾷ	1	Here, the word **first** refers to the “first day” of the week. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express that explicitly. Alternate translation: “on the first day”

If you must state who did the action, Mark implies in chapter 15 that Pilate’s “soldiers” did it. Alternate translation: “who Pilate’s soldiers crucified”
16:6	x9m8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἠγέρθη	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, it is implied that “God” did it. Alternate translation: “God raised him from the dead!” or “He has risen!”
16:7	x3u1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καὶ τῷ Πέτρῳ	1	The phrase **and Peter** is not making a distinction between **Peter** and the disciples by indicating that **Peter** is not part of the group of Jesus’ 12 **disciples**. Rather, the phrase **and Peter** is being used to emphasize that of all of the 12 disciples of Jesus, these women should take special care to tell Peter the information that follows this phrase. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express that explicitly. Alternate translation: “and especially Peter”
16:7	axgu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	Πέτρῳ, ὅτι προάγει ὑμᾶς εἰς τὴν Γαλιλαίαν; ἐκεῖ αὐτὸν ὄψεσθε, καθὼς εἶπεν ὑμῖν	1	If the direct quotation inside a direct quotation would be confusing in your language, you could translate the second direct quotation as an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: “to Peter that he is going before them to Galilee and that they will see him there, just as he said to them”
16:8	dlji		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	ἐξελθοῦσαι	1	Your language may say “come” rather than **gone** in contexts such as this. Use whichever is more natural. Alternate translation: “having come out”
16:8	sh40		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	εἶχεν γὰρ αὐτὰς τρόμος καὶ ἔκστασις	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **amazement**, you can express the same idea with a verbal form such as “amazed.” Alternate translation: “for they were greatly amazed, and they trembled”
16:8	bdgb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	εἶχεν γὰρ αὐτὰς τρόμος καὶ ἔκστασις	1	Here, the word **gripping** is an idiom which means “overcoming.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent idiom or use plain language. Alternate translation: “for they were overcome by trembling and amazement” or “for they were overcome with trembling and amazement”
16:8	ydb0			καὶ οὐδενὶ οὐδὲν εἶπον	1	Alternate translation: “And they told no one anything”
