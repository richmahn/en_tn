front:intro	r2f2				0	# Introduction to the Gospel of Mark\n\n## Part 1: General Introduction\n\n### Outline of the book of Mark\n\n1. Introduction (1:1–13)\n2. The ministry of Jesus in Galilee (1:14–8:26)\n      * Early ministry (1:14–3:6)\n      * Becoming more popular among the people (3:7–5:43)\n      * Moving away from Galilee and then returning (6:1–8:26)\n3. Progress toward Jerusalem; Jesus repeatedly predicts his own death; the disciples misunderstand, and Jesus teaches them how difficult it will be to follow him (8:27–10:52)\n4. Last days of ministry and preparation for final conflict in Jerusalem (11:1–13:37)\n5. The death of Christ and the empty tomb (14:1–16:8)\n\n### What is the book of Mark about?\n\nThe Gospel of Mark is one of four books in the New Testament that describe some of the life of Jesus Christ. The authors of the Gospels wrote about who Jesus was and what he did during his lifetime. Mark wrote much about how Jesus suffered and died on the cross. He did this to encourage his readers who were being persecuted. Mark also explained Jewish customs and some Aramaic words. This may indicate that Mark expected most of his first readers to be Gentiles.\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nTranslators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “The Gospel of Mark,” or “The Gospel According to Mark.” They may also choose a title that may be clearer, such as, “The Good News about Jesus that Mark Wrote.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])\n\n### Who wrote the book of Mark?\n\nThe book does not give the name of the author. However, since early Christian times, most Christians have thought that the author was Mark. Mark was also known as John Mark. He was a close friend of Peter. Mark may not have witnessed what Jesus said and did. Many experts think that Peter the Apostle was the source of what Mark wrote about Jesus.\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### What were Jesus’ teaching methods?\n\nThe people regarded Jesus as a rabbi. A rabbi is a teacher of God’s law. Jesus taught in ways similar to the ways other religious teachers in Israel. He had students who followed him wherever he went. These students were called disciples. Jesus often taught by telling parables, stories that teach moral lessons. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/disciple]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/parable]])\n\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\n\n### What are the Synoptic Gospels?\n\nThe Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke are called the Synoptic Gospels because they have many similar passages. The word “synoptic” means to “see together.”\n\nThe texts are considered “parallel” when they are the same or almost the same among two or three of the Gospels. When translating parallel passages, translators should use the same wording and make them as similar as possible.\n\n### Why does Jesus refer to himself as the “Son of Man”?\n\nIn the Gospels, Jesus calls himself the “Son of Man.” This phrase could mean a few things:\n* The phrase “son of man” can simply be describing that someone’s father is also a human being. Therefore, the person being described is literally a son of a man, a human being.\n* The phrase sometimes is a reference to Daniel 7:13–14. In this passage there is a person described as a “Son of Man.” This description tells us that the person ascending to the throne of God looked like a human being. This description is different than the first because God gives this Son of Man authority forever. Therefore, the title “Son of Man” became a title for the Messiah.\n\nTranslating the title “Son of Man” can be difficult in many languages. Readers may misunderstand a literal translation. Translators can consider alternatives, such as “The Human One.” It may also be helpful to include a footnote to explain the title.\n\n### Why does Mark frequently use terms indicating short periods of time?\n\nThe Gospel of Mark uses the word “immediately” 42 times. Mark does this to make the events more exciting and vivid. It moves the reader quickly from one event to the next.\n\n### Sabbath/Sabbaths\n\nOften in the culture of the Bible, religious festivals would be written in the plural form of the word instead of a singular form. This occurs in Mark as well. In the ULT, the word should be kept plural, “Sabbaths.” This is simply for the sake of rendering the translated text as close to the original text as possible. In the UST, Sabbaths is changed to singular, Sabbath, to make more sense of the use of the word in its context.\n\n### What are the major issues in the text of the book of Mark?\n\nSome verses found in older versions of the Bible are not included in most modern versions. Translators are advised not to include these verses. However, if there are older versions of the Bible in the translator’s region that include one or more of these verses, the translators can include them. If they are included, they should be surrounded by square brackets ([]) to indicate that they were probably not original to Mark’s Gospel.\n* “If any man has ears to hear, let him hear.” (7:16)\n* “where their worm never dies and the fire is never quenched” (9:44)\n* “where their worm never dies and the fire is never quenched” (9:46)\n* “And the scripture was fulfilled that says, ‘He was counted with the lawless ones’” (15:28)\n\nThe following passage is not found in the earliest manuscripts. Most Bibles include this passage, but modern Bibles put it in brackets ([]) or indicate in some way that this passage may not have been original to Mark’s Gospel. Translators are advised to do something similar to the modern versions of the Bible.\n* “Early on the first day of the week, after he arose, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven demons. She went and told those who were with him, while they were mourning and weeping. They heard that he was alive and that he had been seen by her, but they did not believe. After these things he appeared in a different form to two of them, as they were walking out into the country. They went and told the rest of the disciples, but they did not believe them. Jesus later appeared to the eleven as they were reclining at the table, and he rebuked them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they did not believe those who saw him after he rose from the dead. He said to them, ‘Having gone into all the world, and preach the gospel to the entire creation. The one having believed and having been baptized will be saved, and the one not having believed will be condemned. These signs will go with the ones believing: In my name they will cast out demons. They will speak in new languages. They will pick up snakes with their hands, and if they drink anything deadly, it will not hurt them. They will lay hands on the sick, and they will get well.’ After the Lord had spoken to them, he was taken up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God. The disciples left and preached everywhere, while the Lord worked with them and confirmed the word by the signs that went with them.” (16:9–20)\n\n(See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
1:intro	c6ep				0	# Mark 1 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n1. Introduction (1:1–13)\n      * Opening (1:1–3)\n      * The ministry of John the Baptist (1:4–8)\n      * Jesus is baptized and tempted (1:9–13)\n2. The ministry of Jesus in Galilee (1:14–8:26)\n      * Early ministry (1:14–3:6)\n        * Jesus calls four disciples (1:14–20)\n        * Jesus teaches and casts out a demon (1:21–28)\n        * Jesus heals Simon’s mother-in-law and many others (1:29–34)\n        * Jesus teaches and heals people throughout Galilee (1:35–39)\n        * Jesus heals a leper (1:40–45)\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in [1:2–3](../01/02.md), which is made up of quotations from [Malachi 3:1](../mal/03/01.md) and [Isaiah 40:3](../isa/40/03.md).\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Baptism\n\nThe word “baptism” refers to a ritual washing, usually with water. John’s baptism is similar to Christian baptism, but it does not mean exactly the same thing (see [Acts 18:24–26](../act/18/24.md)). Mark writes that John’s baptism is “of repentance” (see [1:4](../01/04.md)). Most likely, it symbolized the removal of the sins that people were repenting of and the beginning of a new way of living. However, even Jesus received this baptism despite the fact that he did not need to repent of any sins. In this case, the baptism may symbolize complete dedication to God. Consider how you might refer to this kind of ritual washing in your language.\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Singular and plural forms of “you”\n\nMany of the forms of “you” in this chapter appear in speeches that John the Baptist delivers to groups of people. Because of this, most forms of “you” in this chapter are plural. You should assume forms of “you” are plural unless a note specifies that the form is singular. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])\n\n### The historic present\n\nTo call attention to a development in the story, Mark uses the present tense in past narration. In this chapter, the historic present occurs in verses 12, 21, 30, 37, 38, 40, 41, and 44. If it would not be natural to do that in your language, you could use the past tense in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense]])
1:1-4	ewhd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀρχὴ τοῦ εὐαγγελίου Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ, Υἱοῦ Θεοῦ & καθὼς γέγραπται ἐν τῷ Ἠσαΐᾳ τῷ προφήτῃ: ἰδοὺ, ἀποστέλλω τὸν ἄγγελόν μου πρὸ προσώπου σου, ὃς κατασκευάσει τὴν ὁδόν σου & φωνὴ βοῶντος ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ, ἑτοιμάσατε τὴν ὁδὸν Κυρίου, εὐθείας ποιεῖτε τὰς τρίβους αὐτοῦ & ἐγένετο Ἰωάννης	1	Here, the phrase **Just as it is written in Isaiah the prophet** and the quotation that follows could go with: (1) verse 1: **The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God**. In this case, Mark means that the**gospel** had its **beginning** just as Isaiah prophesied. Alternate translation: “The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, happened just as it is written in Isaiah the prophet, “Behold, I am sending my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way; a voice crying out in the wilderness, ‘Make ready the way of the Lord; make his paths straight.’” And so John came” (2) verse 4: **John came**. In this case, Mark means that **John came** as Isaiah had prophesied. Alternate translation: “This is the beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. Just as it is written in Isaiah the prophet, “Behold, I am sending my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way; a voice crying out in the wilderness, ‘Make ready the way of the Lord; make his paths straight,’” John came”
1:1	ybv6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἀρχὴ τοῦ εὐαγγελίου	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **beginning**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “Here begins the gospel”
1:1	kpq1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τοῦ εὐαγγελίου Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	Here, Mark is using the possessive form to describe a **gospel** that is about **Jesus Christ**. If this is not clear in your language, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: “of the gospel concerning Jesus Christ”
1:1	i3bc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	Υἱοῦ Θεοῦ	1	**Son of God** is an important title for Jesus that describes his relationship with God the Father.
1:1	et9o		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	Υἱοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Many ancient manuscripts include the phrase **the Son of God**. The ULT follows that reading. A few ancient manuscripts do not include these words. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of the ULT.
1:2	e3by		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	καθὼς γέγραπται ἐν τῷ Ἠσαΐᾳ τῷ προφήτῃ	1	In Mark’s culture, **Just as it has been written in Isaiah the prophet** is a normal way to introduce quotations from important texts, in this case, the Old Testament books written by the prophet Malachi and by **Isaiah the prophet** (see [Malachi 3:1](../mal/03/01.md) and [Isaiah 40:3](../isa/40/03.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase that indicates that Mark is quoting from important texts. Alternate translation: “Just as you can read in what Isaiah the prophet wrote” or “Just as it says in the Scriptures connected with Isaiah the prophet”\n
1:2	fc4t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	καθὼς γέγραπται ἐν τῷ Ἠσαΐᾳ τῷ προφήτῃ	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “Just as Isaiah the prophet wrote”
1:2	z8b7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐν τῷ Ἠσαΐᾳ τῷ προφήτῃ	1	Here, **Isaiah the prophet** represents the book written by Isaiah. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your language or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “in the scroll of Isaiah the prophet”
1:2	br10		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	ἰδοὺ	1	Here, the word **Behold** draws the attention of the audience and asks them to listen carefully. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express **Behold** with a word or phrase that asks the audience to listen, or you could draw the audience’s attention in another way. Alternate translation: “See” or “Pay attention”
1:2	gu7i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	πρὸ προσώπου σου	1	Here, the phrase **before your face** means before or in front of the person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “in front of you” or “before I send you”
1:2	kl12		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	κατασκευάσει τὴν ὁδόν σου	1	Here the author of the quotation speaks of helping people to get ready for the coming of the Messiah as if it were preparing the **way** or road for the Messiah. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable figure of speech or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “will help people get ready for you to arrive”
1:3	cf0e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	φωνὴ βοῶντος	1	The author of the quotation is using **voice** to represent a person speaking.

1:3	lkm3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	βοῶντος ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ,	1	Consider natural ways of introducing direct quotations in your language. Alternate translation: “of one calling out in the wilderness and saying” or “of one calling out in the wilderness, declaring”
1:3	dqi9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ, ἑτοιμάσατε τὴν ὁδὸν Κυρίου, εὐθείας ποιεῖτε τὰς τρίβους αὐτοῦ	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. If you do, you will need to delete the single quotation mark at the end of this quotation. Alternate translation: “the wilderness that people must make ready the way of the Lord, that they must make his paths straight”
1:3	v3n3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	ἑτοιμάσατε τὴν ὁδὸν Κυρίου, εὐθείας ποιεῖτε τὰς τρίβους αὐτοῦ	1	These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if it would be helpful to your readers, you could connect the phrases with a connecting word in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: “Make ready the way of the Lord, yes, make his paths straight”
1:3	peh5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἑτοιμάσατε τὴν ὁδὸν Κυρίου, εὐθείας ποιεῖτε τὰς τρίβους αὐτοῦ	1	Here the author of the quotation speaks as if people should build or maintain roads for **the Lord** to travel on as he comes to visit his people. He means that people need to be living and acting in proper ways when **the Lord** appears to his people.

Alternate translation: “Live and behave in a way that pleases God, as if you were making a road ready for him to travel on”
1:3	tz2g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	ἑτοιμάσατε & ποιεῖτε	1	Because the person who is **crying out** is speaking to many people, the commands **Make ready** and **make** are plural.
1:4	pmse		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐγένετο Ἰωάννης, ὁ βαπτίζων ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ, καὶ κηρύσσων	1	Here, the phrase translated **the one baptizing** could be: (1) a description of what John did, in parallel with the word **preaching**. Alternate translation: “John came. He was baptizing in the wilderness and preaching” (2) a title (“the Baptist”) that people called **John**. Alternate translation: “John the Baptist came in the wilderness, preaching”
1:4	je3t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	ἐγένετο Ἰωάννης	1	This phrase introduces a new character into the story. If your language has an expression of its own that serves this purpose, you could use it here. Alternate translation: “There was a man named John” or “A man called John appeared”
1:4	q9np		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	κηρύσσων βάπτισμα μετανοίας εἰς ἄφεσιν ἁμαρτιῶν	1	It may be more natural in your language to have a direct quotation here. Alternate translation: “preaching, ‘Receive a baptism of repentance for forgiveness of sins.’”
1:4	s05n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	κηρύσσων βάπτισμα μετανοίας	1	Here Mark implies that John was **preaching** that people should undergo **a baptism of repentance**.

Alternate translation: “preaching that people should receive a baptism of repentance” or “preaching that people should ask to receive a baptism of repentance”
1:4	dtqv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	βάπτισμα μετανοίας εἰς ἄφεσιν ἁμαρτιῶν	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **repentance** and **forgiveness**, you could express the same ideas in another way. Alternate translation: “that people should be baptized to show that they had repented, so that their sins would be forgiven”\n
1:4	vz74		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	βάπτισμα μετανοίας	1	Here, Mark is using the possessive form to describe a **baptism** that shows or expresses **repentance**. If this is not clear in your language, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: “a baptism that expresses repentance” or “a baptism that demonstrates repentance”
1:4	p86z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	εἰς ἄφεσιν ἁμαρτιῶν	1	Here, the phrase **for the forgiveness of sins** indicates the goal of the **baptism of repentance**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different word or phrase that indicates the goal of an action. Alternate translation: “that would lead to forgiveness of sins”
1:5	cf75		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	πᾶσα ἡ Ἰουδαία χώρα καὶ οἱ Ἱεροσολυμεῖται πάντες	1	Mark twice writes **all** as a generalization for emphasis.

If it would be helpful in your language, you could rearrange the elements so that these events are in sequential order, or you could use another form to indicate the sequence. Alternate translation: “confessing their sins, they were being baptized by him in the Jordan River” or “were being baptized by him in the Jordan River after they confessed their sins”
1:5	h8h7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐβαπτίζοντο ὑπ’ αὐτοῦ	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “he was baptizing them”
1:5	yezj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐξομολογούμενοι	1	Here it is the people who are **confessing**, not John. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “as they confessed”
1:6	n3rk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	καὶ & ὁ Ἰωάννης	1	Here Mark uses the word **And** to introduce background information that will help readers understand what happens next.

Alternate translation: “Concerning this John, he”
1:6	kyy3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἦν & ἐνδεδυμένος	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “clothed himself with”
1:6	j141		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἦν & ἐνδεδυμένος τρίχας καμήλου	1	Here Mark implies that John wore clothes made from **camel hair**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “wore clothing made from the hair of camels”
1:6	h518		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ζώνην δερματίνην	1	A **leather belt** is a thin strap made out of animal skin that holds clothing in place. If your readers would not be familiar with this type of clothing, you could use the name of something similar in your area or you could use a more general term. Alternate translation: “an animal skin strap” or “a band made from animal skin”
1:7	p7tl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	λέγων	1	Consider natural ways of introducing direct quotations in your language. Alternate translation: “and he said”
1:7	bk1j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἔρχεται & ὀπίσω μου	1	Here John speaks as if someone is walking behind him. He means that soon someone will continue what he has started doing.

Alternate translation: “I am not worthy to be the slave who, stooping down, unties the strap of his sandals” or “I am not worthy to act as his slave”
1:7	lyjx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	ἱκανὸς, κύψας λῦσαι	1	The expression **stooping down** contains extra information that would be unnatural to express in some languages. If this is true of your language, you could shorten the expression. Alternate translation: “worthy to untie”
1:7	nnbj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	λῦσαι τὸν ἱμάντα τῶν ὑποδημάτων αὐτοῦ	1	In Jesus’ culture, people wore **sandals** on their feet by tying them on with a **strap**. To take off the **sandals**, someone had to **untie the strap**.

Alternate translation: “to help him remove his sandals by untying the strap” or “to remove his sandals”
1:8	rtdf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense	ἐβάπτισα	1	Here John could be using the past tense: (1) to refer generally to how he baptizes people. Alternate translation: “always baptize” (2) to refer specifically to how he just baptized some people. Alternate translation: “I have baptized”

If possible, preserve the baptism metaphor or express the idea in simile form. Alternate translation: “but he will baptize you, as it were, with the Holy Spirit” or “and he also will perform something like baptism, but he will use the Holy Spirit”
1:8	r1j9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	δὲ	1	Here, the word **but** introduces what the one coming after John will use for baptism in contrast to what John uses. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different word or phrase that introduces a contrast. Alternate translation: “and, in contrast,”
1:9	u65k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	καὶ ἐγένετο	1	The phrase **And it happened that** marks the beginning of a new event in the story. Use a natural form in your language for introducing a new event. Alternate translation: “Then,” or “Next,”
1:9	arc9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐν ἐκείναις ταῖς ἡμέραις	1	Here, Matthew uses the term **days** to refer to a particular period of time.

1:9	gi39		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐβαπτίσθη & ὑπὸ Ἰωάννου	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “John baptized him”
1:10	stwh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	εὐθὺς ἀναβαίνων ἐκ τοῦ ὕδατος, εἶδεν	1	Here, the word **immediately** indicates that as soon as John baptized Jesus, Jesus **saw the heavens being split open** as he was **coming up out of the water**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “right away, as he was coming up out of the water, he saw”
1:10	jeof		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀναβαίνων ἐκ τοῦ ὕδατος	1	Here Mark implies that Jesus was in the Jordan River when he was baptized. Afterwards, he came up out of the river.

1:30	dxak		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship	ἡ & πενθερὰ	1	The word **mother-in-law** refers to the mother of Simon’s wife. In your translation, you could use the term or expression in your own language for this relationship.
1:30	vnp5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	πυρέσσουσα	1	A **fever** is a symptom of an illness in which the temperature of the body temporarily increases.

1:30	i5lk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense	λέγουσιν	1	To call attention to a development in the story, Mark uses the present tense in past narration. If it would not be natural to do that in your language, you could use the past tense in your translation. Alternate translation: “they spoke”
1:31	bzd2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-events	ἤγειρεν αὐτὴν, κρατήσας τῆς χειρός	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these clauses, since the second clause describes what Jesus did before what the first clause describes.

1:36	sy21		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οἱ μετ’ αὐτοῦ	1	Here Mark is referring to other people who were there with **Simon** in the house, including Andrew, James, and John and probably other people who were staying there. If it would be helpful in your language, you could refer more explicitly to people who were staying at the house of **Simon**. Alternate translation: “the other people staying in his house”
1:36	emic		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	κατεδίωξεν	1	Here Mark speaks as if **Simon and the ones with him** were hunting Jesus down or trying to capture him. He uses the word **pursued** as an overstatement to emphasize how urgently they were looking for Jesus. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different way to express the emphasis. Alternate translation: “looked everywhere” or “diligently looked”
1:37	ol9b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense	λέγουσιν	1	To call attention to a development in the story, Mark uses the present tense in past narration. If it would not be natural to do that in your language, you could use the past tense in your translation. Alternate translation: “said”

1:38	eof0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense	λέγει	1	To call attention to a development in the story, Mark uses the present tense in past narration. If it would not be natural to do that in your language, you could use the past tense in your translation. Alternate translation: “he said”

Alternate translation: “Because I went out to preach in many places, let us go elsewhere, into the surrounding towns, so that I may preach there also”
1:38	plm9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἄγωμεν ἀλλαχοῦ	1	Here Jesus implies that he will not go back to Capernaum to meet all the people who were looking for him.

1:38	z53z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	ἐξῆλθον	1	Here Jesus does not start where he **went out** from. He may be referring to how he left Capernaum, or he may be referring to how he came to the world as a human being, or he may be implying to both of these meanings.

1:38	jh2z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	εἰς τοῦτο	1	The pronoun **this** refers to Jesus preaching in **the surrounding towns**.

1:40	kq50		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	γονυπετῶν	1	In the this man’s culture, **kneeling down** before a person was a way to honor a greater person.

1:40	uotm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	με καθαρίσαι	1	The man talks about becoming **clean** ceremonially, but it is implicit that he has become unclean because of his leprosy, so he is primarily asking Jesus to heal him of this disease.

1:41	l9jg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	σπλαγχνισθεὶς	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **compassion**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “having sympathized with him”
1:41	jz24		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	σπλαγχνισθεὶς	1	Many ancient manuscripts read **having had compassion**. The ULT follows that reading. A few ancient manuscripts read “having become angry.” If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of the ULT.
1:41	flc0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense	λέγει	1	To call attention to a development in the story, Mark uses the present tense in past narration. If it would not be natural to do that in your language, you could use the past tense in your translation. Alternate translation: “said”
1:41	qjz4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	θέλω	1	Here Jesus implies that he is **willing** to cleanse or heal the man. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “I am willing to cleanse you”
1:42	lc7b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	ἀπῆλθεν ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ ἡ λέπρα	1	Here, Mark speaks of the man’s **leprosy** as if it were a person who **departed from him**. He means that the man no longer had **leprosy**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “his leprosy was gone” or “he was no longer a leper”
1:42	lkks		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐκαθερίσθη	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who did the action, it is clear from the context that it was Jesus. Alternate translation: “he was clean” or “Jesus had made him clean”
1:43-44	iw7t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-events	καὶ ἐμβριμησάμενος αὐτῷ, εὐθὺς ἐξέβαλεν αὐτόν & καὶ λέγει αὐτῷ, ὅρα μηδενὶ, μηδὲν εἴπῃς; ἀλλὰ ὕπαγε, σεαυτὸν δεῖξον τῷ ἱερεῖ, καὶ προσένεγκε περὶ τοῦ καθαρισμοῦ σου ἃ προσέταξεν Μωϋσῆς, εἰς μαρτύριον αὐτοῖς	1	Jesus **strictly warned** the man using the words recorded in [1:44](../01/44.md) before he **sent him away**. It might be helpful to make it clear that Jesus **strictly warned** the man before he **sent him away**. Alternate translation: “While he was immediately sending him away, he strictly warned him by saying to him, ‘See that you say nothing to anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing what Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.’” or “He immediately sent him away. Before he went, Jesus strictly warned him, saying to him, ‘See that you say nothing to anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing what Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.’”
1:44	p8cu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense	λέγει	1	To call attention to a development in the story, Mark uses the present tense in past narration. If it would not be natural to do that in your language, you could use the past tense in your translation. Alternate translation: “he said”
1:44	xc4d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	μηδενὶ, μηδὲν εἴπῃς	1	The implication is that the man is not to tell **anyone** that Jesus healed him. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “you tell no one that I healed you”
1:44	k2e0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	μηδενὶ, μηδὲν εἴπῃς	1	The words translated **nothing** and **anyone** are two negative words. In this construction, the second negative does not cancel the first to create a positive meaning. Instead, it gives greater emphasis to the negative. If your language can use two negatives that do not cancel one another to create a positive meaning, you could use a double negative here. If your language does not use two negatives in that way, you could translate with one strong negative, as the ULT does. Alternate translation: “you certainly do not say anything to anyone”
1:44	xhu8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	σεαυτὸν δεῖξον τῷ ἱερεῖ	1	Jesus told the man to **show** himself **to the priest** so that the priest could look at his skin to see if his leprosy was really gone. The law of Moses required people to present themselves to the priest for inspection if they had been unclean but were now clean. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “ask to be inspected by the priest” or “let yourself be examined by the priest”
1:44	he7v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	προσένεγκε περὶ τοῦ καθαρισμοῦ σου ἃ προσέταξεν Μωϋσῆς	1	Jesus assumes that the man will know that the law required a person who had been healed from a skin disease to make a specific sacrifice. This made the person ceremonially clean and they could participate once again in community religious activities. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “offer the sacrifice that Moses commanded so that you could become ceremonially clean once again”
1:44	w6b2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	εἰς μαρτύριον αὐτοῖς	1	Here Jesus means that the man should show himself to the priest and offer the gift to prove or provide **testimony** that he had been healed. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “for a testimony to them that you have been cleansed”
1:44	plof		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	εἰς μαρτύριον αὐτοῖς	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **testimony**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “so that it testifies to them”
1:44	a6tj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	αὐτοῖς	1	The pronoun **them** could refer to: (1) Jewish people in general. Alternate translation: “to people” (2) the priests specifically. Alternate translation: “to the priests”
1:45	yjjc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	ἐξελθὼν	1	In a context such as this, your language might say “come” instead of **gone**. Alternate translation: “having come out”
1:45	i91a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	κηρύσσειν πολλὰ καὶ διαφημίζειν τὸν λόγον	1	The phrases **to proclaim often** and **to report the word** mean similar things. Mark is using the two phrases together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single clause. Alternate translation: “to proclaim the word often” or “to report the word often”
1:45	ov5c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τὸν λόγον	1	Here, **word** represents what the man said about how Jesus healed him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your language or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “what Jesus had done for him”
1:45	b9n2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὥστε μηκέτι αὐτὸν δύνασθαι φανερῶς εἰς πόλιν εἰσελθεῖν	1	Here Mark implies that Jesus **was able no longer to enter into a town openly** because people who had heard about him would crowd around him so much. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “so that, because so many people would crowd around him, he was able no longer to enter into a town openly”
1:45	tq0w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	ἤρχοντο	1	In a context such as this, your language might say “going” instead of **coming**. Alternate translation: “they were going”
1:45	z363		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	πάντοθεν	1	The phrase **from all sides** is an overstatement for emphasis. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different way to express the emphasis. Alternate translation: “from all over the region” or “from very many places”
2:intro	zhb5				0	# Mark 2 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n2. The ministry of Jesus in Galilee (1:14–8:26)\n      * Early ministry (1:14–3:6)\n        * Jesus heals a paralytic (2:1–12)\n        * Jesus calls Levi and dines at his house (2:13–17)\n        * Jesus brings something new (2:18–22)\n        * Picking heads of grain on the Sabbath (2:22–28)\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### “Sinners”\n\nWhen Mark uses the word “sinners,” he is describing a group of people whom many Jewish religious groups would have considered to be living in ways that were improper for those who were part of God’s people. Some of these people may have committed significant sins, while others may have disagreed with many of the Jewish religious groups about how Jews could properly behave. If possible, use a word or phrase that identifies people who are not living as many religious groups think that people should live. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])\n\n### Fasting and feasting\n\nIn Jesus’ culture, people would “fast,” or abstain from eating for a period of time, in order to honor God or to repent of their sins. They would “feast,” or eat a lot of food, when they were celebrating some important event, such as a wedding. Consider how you will refer to these behaviors in [2:15–22](../02/15.md), in which Jesus feasts and teaches about why he and his disciples do not fast. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/fast]])\n\n### The Sabbath\n\nIn the law that God gave to Moses, God commanded the Israelites to rest on the seventh day, which was called the Sabbath. The Jewish religious leaders disagreed with each other about what kinds of things a person could do on the Sabbath and still rest as God had commanded. In [2:22–28](../02/22.md), the Pharisees and Jesus engage in these kinds of debates about the Sabbath. Jesus disagrees with how the Pharisees understand the Sabbath, and he argues for a different view. If your readers may not understand what the Sabbath is and why Jesus and the Pharisees are debating about it, you may need to include some information in a footnote. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sabbath]])\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### The short parables in [2:19–22](../02/19.md)\n\nIn these verses, Jesus gives three short parables that emphasize how certain things do not go well together. Fasting does not happen during a wedding celebration. An unshrunk piece of cloth does not make a good patch for an old garment. Old wineskins do not make good containers for fresh wine that still needs to ferment. Jesus tells these parables to illustrate how his ministry and preaching do not match well with how people had previously done things. In other words, Jesus wants people to expect what he does to be new, and this may require thinking and doing many new things. You should preserve these parables, since they are not direct metaphors. If necessary, you could introduce them in such a way that your readers recognize that they are parables or illustrations. See the notes on each verse for possible translation options. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Singular and plural forms of “you”\n\nMany of the forms of “you” in this chapter appear in dialogues between Jesus and other individuals. Because of this, most forms of “you” in this chapter are singular. You should assume forms of “you” are singular unless a note specifies that the form is plural. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])\n\n### The historic present\n\nTo call attention to a development in the story, Mark uses the present tense in past narration. In this chapter, the historic present occurs in verses 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 12, 14, 17, 18, 25. If it would not be natural to do that in your language, you could use the past tense in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense]])
2:1	j6pa		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	δι’ ἡμερῶν	1	Here, the phrase **after {some} days** indicates that the events Mark is about to narrate occurred a few, but not very many, days after the event he just narrated, the healing of the leper. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable word or phrase that indicates that a few **days** passed between the previous event and this event. Alternate translation: “a few days later”
2:1	ir5j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἠκούσθη	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

2:1	jmtf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense	ἐστίν	1	To call attention to a development in the story, Mark uses the present tense in past narration. If it would not be natural to do that in your language, you could use the past tense in your translation. Alternate translation: “he was”
2:1	afvi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐν οἴκῳ	1	Here Mark implies that this **house** was Jesus’ home while he was in Capernaum. This **house** could belong to: (1) Simon and Andrew, since he stayed at their house previously (see [1:29](../01/29.md)). Alternate translation: “in Simon and Andrew’s house” (2) Jesus and his relatives, who may have moved to Capernaum. Alternate translation: “in his house”
2:2	zja1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	πολλοὶ	1	Mark is using the adjective **many** as a noun to mean many people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “many men and women”

If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation.

2:19-20	l0f0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables	μὴ δύνανται οἱ υἱοὶ τοῦ νυμφῶνος ἐν ᾧ ὁ νυμφίος μετ’ αὐτῶν ἐστιν νηστεύειν? ὅσον χρόνον ἔχουσιν τὸν νυμφίον μετ’ αὐτῶν, οὐ δύνανται νηστεύειν & ἐλεύσονται δὲ ἡμέραι ὅταν ἀπαρθῇ ἀπ’ αὐτῶν ὁ νυμφίος, καὶ τότε νηστεύσουσιν ἐν ἐκείνῃ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ	1	To help the people who asked him the question understand why his disciples do not fast, Jesus offers a brief illustration. He wants them to think of him as if he were a **bridegroom** and of his disciples as if they were the **sons of the bridal chamber**. You should preserve the form of the parable, but if it would be helpful in your language, you could state explicitly that Jesus is like the **bridegroom**, and his disciples are like the the **sons of the bridal chamber**. Alternate translation: “The sons of the bridal chamber are not able to fast while the bridegroom is still with them, are they? As much time as they have the bridegroom with them, they are not able to fast. But days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and in those days, then they will fast. I am like the bridegroom, and my disciples are like the sons of the bridal chamber.”
2:19	eke3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	μὴ δύνανται οἱ υἱοὶ τοῦ νυμφῶνος ἐν ᾧ ὁ νυμφίος μετ’ αὐτῶν ἐστιν νηστεύειν?	1	Jesus is using the question form to teach the people who asked him the question. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “The sons of the bridal chamber are certainly not able to fast while the bridegroom is still with them.” or “The sons of bridal chamber cannot fast while the bridegroom is still with them!”
2:19	wetb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	οἱ υἱοὶ τοῦ νυμφῶνος	1	The expression **sons of** describes people who share the qualities of something. In this case, Jesus is describing people who share the quality of being an integral part of a wedding. These are the male friends who attend the groom during the ceremony and the festivities. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “The groom’s attendants”\n
2:20	y79o		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐλεύσονται & ἡμέραι ὅταν & ἐν ἐκείνῃ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ	1	Here Jesus is using the word **days** to refer to a particular time. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a similar form or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “a time will come when … in that time” or “there will be a time when … at that time”
2:20	vg2u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἀπαρθῇ & ὁ νυμφίος	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who does the action, you could use an indefinite subject. Alternate translation: “someone will take the bridegroom away”
2:20	vfc8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	τότε & ἐν ἐκείνῃ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ	1	The expression **in those days, then** contains extra information that would be unnatural to express in some languages. If this is true of your language, you could shorten the expression. Alternate translation: “in those days”
2:21	vdza		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables	οὐδεὶς ἐπίβλημα ῥάκους ἀγνάφου ἐπιράπτει ἐπὶ ἱμάτιον παλαιόν; εἰ δὲ μή αἴρει τὸ πλήρωμα ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ, τὸ καινὸν τοῦ παλαιοῦ, καὶ χεῖρον σχίσμα γίνεται.	1	To help the people who asked the question understand why his disciples do not fast, Jesus offers another brief illustration. He wants them to think of the new things that he teaches and does as **a patch of unshrunk cloth** and of the current ways of doing things as if they were **an old garment**. You should preserve the form of the parable, but if it would be helpful in your language, you could state explicitly that what Jesus does and teaches is like the **patch of unshrunk cloth**, and the normal way of doing things is like **an old garment**. Alternate translation: “no one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, but if not, the patch tears away from it, the new from the old, and a worse tear happens. What I say and do is like the unshrunk cloth, and the normal way of doing things is like an old garment.”\n
2:21	v6xc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οὐδεὶς ἐπίβλημα ῥάκους ἀγνάφου ἐπιράπτει ἐπὶ ἱμάτιον παλαιόν	1	Here Jesus refers to the practice of patching a hole or tear in a **garment** by sewing or attaching a **patch** to the **garment** to cover the hole or tear. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “no one patches an old garment with a patch of unshrunk cloth”
2:21	vzsf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo	εἰ δὲ μή	1	Jesus is using a hypothetical situation to teach. Use a natural method in your language for introducing a hypothetical situation. Alternate translation: “but if someone actually did” or “but were a person to do that”
2:21	opbt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	αἴρει τὸ πλήρωμα ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ	1	Here Jesus implies that **the patch** will tear away when the garment is washed, because **the patch** will shrink and rip the old garment. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “when the garment is washed, the patch shrinks and tears away from it”
2:21	m3sx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	τὸ καινὸν τοῦ παλαιοῦ	1	Jesus is using the adjectives **new** and **old** as nouns to mean new and old cloth.

2:22	q5fg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables	καὶ οὐδεὶς βάλλει οἶνον νέον εἰς ἀσκοὺς παλαιούς; εἰ δὲ μή ῥήξει ὁ οἶνος τοὺς ἀσκούς, καὶ ὁ οἶνος ἀπόλλυται καὶ οἱ ἀσκοί; ἀλλὰ οἶνον νέον εἰς ἀσκοὺς καινούς	1	To help the people who asked the question understand why his disciples do not fast, Jesus offers another brief illustration. He wants them to think of the new things that he teaches and does as **new wine** and of the current ways of doing things as if they were **old wineskins**. You should preserve the form of the parable, but if it would be helpful in your language, you could state explicitly that what Jesus does and teaches is like the **new wine**, and the normal way of doing things is like **old wineskins**. Alternate translation: “And no one puts new wine into old wineskins, but if not, the wine will burst the wineskins and the wine and the wineskins are destroyed, but new wine into new wineskins. What I say and do is like the new wine, and the normal way of doing things is like the old wineskins.”
2:22	fk15		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo	εἰ δὲ μή ῥήξει ὁ οἶνος τοὺς ἀσκούς, καὶ ὁ οἶνος ἀπόλλυται καὶ οἱ ἀσκοί	1	Jesus is using a hypothetical situation to teach.

2:22	alse		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ῥήξει ὁ οἶνος τοὺς ἀσκούς	1	Here Jesus implies that the new **wine**, when it ferments, will expand and burst the **wineskins**, which are old and so no longer able to stretch. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “when the wine ferments, the wineskins cannot stretch and will burst”
2:22	n0iy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ὁ οἶνος ἀπόλλυται καὶ οἱ ἀσκοί	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

2:22	dgcz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ἀλλὰ οἶνον νέον εἰς ἀσκοὺς καινούς	1	Jesus is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete.

2:23	bb93		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	καὶ ἐγένετο	1	Here, the phrase **And it happened {that}** introduces the next event in the story.

2:23	u6ud		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐν τοῖς Σάββασιν	1	Here Mark uses the phrase **on the Sabbaths** to indicate that this event occurred on one specific Sabbath day. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “on one of the Sabbath days” or “during a Sabbath day”
2:23	gwir		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	αὐτὸν & παραπορεύεσθαι	1	Mark is referring to Jesus to represent both Jesus and his disciples, who traveled with Jesus.

2:23	ko42		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τῶν σπορίμων	1	The word **grainfields** refers to places where grain is grown and harvested. This grain is usually ground and made into bread. If your readers would not be familiar with this type of field, you could use the name of something similar in your area or you could use a more general term. Alternate translation: “fields where grain is grown”
2:23	s8rg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἤρξαντο ὁδὸν ποιεῖν	1	Here, the phrase **to make a way** means that the disciples were traveling or walking along.

2:23	jya1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τίλλοντες τοὺς στάχυας	1	Here Mark implies that the disciples ate the **heads of grain** after **picking** them.

Alternate translation: “the tops of the grain plants” or “the edible parts of the grain plants”
2:24	qybi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	ἴδε	1	Here, the word **Behold** is meant to draw the attention of Jesus.

Alternate translation: “they are doing what is not lawful on the Sabbaths.” or “they should certainly not be doing what is not lawful on the Sabbaths!”
2:24	ec3u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ποιοῦσιν τοῖς Σάββασιν ὃ οὐκ ἔξεστιν	1	The Pharisees considered even the small action of picking heads of grain to be harvesting, and therefore work.

If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “You have not understood what you have read about what David did when he had need and was hungry, he and the ones with him—how he went into the house of God in the time of Abiathar the high priest and ate the bread of the presence, which is not lawful to eat except for the priests, and he also gave to the ones being with him.”

The current king, Saul was trying to kill David. So, David ran away to the priest who was serving God at the time, **Abiathar**. David and the men who ran away with him were very hungry, so they asked the Abiathar for food. Abiathar gave them the special bread that was laid out in God’s presence every day, and David and his men ate this bread. You can read this story in [1 Samuel 21:1–6](../1sa/21/01.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could include some extra information in your translation or in a footnote. Alternate translation: “Have you never read what David did when he had need and was hungry after he and the ones with him escaped from King Saul, who wanted to kill him? He visited the high priest Abiathar, went into the house of God, and ate the bread of the presence, which was not lawful to eat except for the priests. He also gave some of it to the ones being with him.”
2:25	wxd7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	οὐδέποτε ἀνέγνωτε	1	Because Jesus is speaking to the Pharisees, the word **you** is plural.
2:25	cjzx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	χρείαν ἔσχεν	1	Here Jesus is implying that David did not have everything that he needed, especially food. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “he had need of something to eat”
2:26	nion		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	εἰσῆλθεν	1	In a context such as this, your language might say “came” instead of **went**. Alternate translation: “he came”

2:27	fse5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-proverbs	τὸ Σάββατον διὰ τὸν ἄνθρωπον ἐγένετο, καὶ οὐχ ὁ ἄνθρωπος διὰ τὸ Σάββατον	1	Here, Jesus uses or invents a proverb in order to teach that God set up the **Sabbath** for the sake of people. Translate this proverb in a way that will be recognized as a proverb and be meaningful in your language and culture. Alternate translation: “Humans were made first, and then the Sabbath was set up because of them. It is not true that the Sabbath was set up first, and then humans were made because of it”
2:27	i374		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τὸ Σάββατον διὰ τὸν ἄνθρωπον ἐγένετο	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

2:27	v3mb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	τὸν ἄνθρωπον & ὁ ἄνθρωπος	1	The word **man** represents men and women in general, not one particular man. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: “people … people”

3:intro	x969				0	# Mark 3 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n2. The ministry of Jesus in Galilee (1:14–8:26)\n      * Early ministry (1:14–3:6)\n        * Healing a man on the Sabbath\n      * Becoming more popular among the people (3:7–5:43)\n        * Jesus ministers to many people (3:7–12)\n        * Jesus appoints the twelve apostles (3:13–19)\n        * Jesus and his family, part one (3:20–21)\n        * Jesus and the scribes debate whether he has a demon (3:22–30)\n        * Jesus and his family, part two (3:31–35)\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Sabbath\n\nIn this chapter, just as in chapter 2, the Pharisees and Jesus are in conflict about the Sabbath. For more information about the Sabbath, see the General Notes to chapter 2.\n\n### Blaspheming against the Spirit\n\nIn [3:29](../03/29.md), Jesus speaks about blaspheming against the Spirit. He indicates that God will forgive all kinds of sins, but he will not forgive people who blaspheme against the Holy Spirit. Jesus says these things because the Pharisees said that he cast out demons by the power of Beelzebul. Jesus implies that he actually cast out demons by the power of the Holy Spirit. So, since the Pharisees have called the Holy Spirit Beelzebul, they have blasphemed or spoken against the Spirit. Christians debate what counts as this kind of blasphemy and why God will not forgive people for it. In your translation, you should not be more specific than Jesus is. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/blasphemy]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/holyspirit]])\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### The parable about the strong man\n\nIn [3:27](../03/27.md), Jesus describes how thieves must subdue and tie up a strong man before they can steal things from his house. Jesus does not directly state how to apply this proverb. However, most Christians think that Satan is like the strong man, and the demons that Jesus casts out are like the strong man’s things. In this case, Jesus is like the thieves who tie up the strong man. Jesus is saying that, since he can cast out demons, it proves that he has subdued and conquered Satan, just as thieves can only steal things after they have subdued the strong man. You should not include this extra information in your translation, but if it would be helpful for your readers, you could include it in a footnote. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])\n\n### Jesus’ mother and brothers\n\nIn [3:31–35](../03/31.md), Jesus’ mother and brothers arrive and want to talk with Jesus. In response, Jesus says that his disciples, those who do God’s will, are his mother and brother and sister. In other words, Jesus calls his disciples, who are those who do God’s will, his family members. He means that they are as close and important to him as his own family. This is an important metaphor that appears throughout the Bible, so preserve the metaphor or express the idea in simile form. See the notes on these verses for translation options. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### The 12 disciples\n\nThe following are the lists of the 12 disciples in Matthew, Mark, and Luke:\n\nIn [Matthew 10:2–4](../mat/10/02.md):\n\nSimon (Peter), Andrew, James son of Zebedee, John son of Zebedee, Philip, Bartholomew, Thomas, Matthew, James son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot.\n\nIn [Mark 3:16–19](../mrk/03/16.md):\n\nSimon (Peter), James son of Zebedee, John son of Zebedee, Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot.\n\nIn [Luke 6:14](../luk/06/14.md):\n\nSimon (Peter), Andrew, James, John, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot, Judas son of James, and Judas Iscariot.\n\nThese lists do not always follow the same order or use the same names for the disciples. In that culture, people often had two or three names. For example, it is likely that that Thaddaeus was also named Judas or Jude. So, do not harmonize these lists by using the same sequence or names in each case. You should translate Mark’s list as Mark presents it.\n\n### Singular and plural forms of “you”\n\nMany of the forms of “you” in this chapter appear in dialogues between Jesus and other individuals. Because of this, most forms of “you” in this chapter are singular. You should assume forms of “you” are singular unless a note specifies that the form is plural. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])\n\n### The historic present\n\nTo call attention to a development in the story, Mark uses the present tense in past narration. In this chapter, the historic present occurs in verses 3, 4, 5, 13, 20, 31, 32, 33, and 34. If it would not be natural to do that in your language, you could use the past tense in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense]])
3:1	bm6z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	καὶ	1	Here, the word **And** introduces the next major event in the story. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces the next event, or you could leave **And** untranslated. Alternate translation: “After that,”
3:1	mjfa		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πάλιν εἰς συναγωγήν	1	Here Mark implies that this is a **synagogue** that Jesus has already visited, most likely the one in Capernaum (see [1:21](../01/21.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “again into the synagogue in Capernaum”
3:1	rn8y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	ἦν ἐκεῖ ἄνθρωπος, ἐξηραμμένην ἔχων τὴν χεῖρα	1	Here Mark introduces a **man** with **a withered hand** as a new participant in the story. If your language has its own way of introducing new participants, you could use it here in your translation. Alternate translation: “a certain man was in the synagogue, and he had a withered hand”
3:1	ye6d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ἐξηραμμένην ἔχων τὴν χεῖρα	1	This means that the man’s **hand** was damaged in such a way that he could not stretch it out. It was probably bent almost into a fist, making it look smaller. Use a word or phrase that expresses this idea clearly. Alternate translation: “having a shriveled hand” or “whose hand was atrophied”

Alternate translation: “And they wanted to accuse him. So, they were watching him closely, if he will heal him on the Sabbaths”
3:2	vr25		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	παρετήρουν αὐτὸν & κατηγορήσωσιν	1	The pronouns **they** and **they** refer to the Pharisees who were there, as [3:6](../03/06.md) shows.

3:2	dw2w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	τοῖς Σάββασιν	1	See how you translated this phrase in [2:23](../02/23.md). Alternate translation: “on a Sabbath day” or “during a Sabbath day”
3:2	q35x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	κατηγορήσωσιν αὐτοῦ	1	Here Mark implies that they would **accuse** Jesus of breaking the Sabbath commandments. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “they might accuse him of wrongdoing” or “they might accuse him of breaking the law of Moses”\n
3:3	ie14		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense	λέγει	1	To call attention to a development in the story, Mark uses the present tense in past narration. If it would not be natural to do that in your language, you could use the past tense in your translation. Alternate translation: “he said”

3:27	i7tr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	μὴ πρῶτον & δήσῃ & διαρπάσει	1	Although the term **he** in both these places is masculine, Jesus is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women.

If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Since Jesus answers the question in [3:34–35](../03/34.md), you should not include an implied answer here.

4:intro	f5ua				0	# Mark 4 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n2. The ministry of Jesus in Galilee (1:14–8:26)\n      * Becoming more popular among the people (3:7–5:43)\n        * The parable of the sower (4:1–9)\n        * Jesus explains the parable of the sower (4:10–20)\n        * Jesus teaches about secrets and knowledge (4:21–25)\n        * The parable of the seeds growing by themselves (4:26–29)\n        * The parable of the mustard seed (4:30–32)\n        * Summary statement (4:33–34)\n        * Jesus calms a storm (4:35–41)\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in [4:12](../04/12.md), which is a quotation from [Isaiah 6:9–10](../isa/06/09.md).\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Farming\n\nJesus refers to several different farming practices in this chapter. In his culture, farmers often threw seeds over their fields, a process called sowing. After throwing the seeds, they would use a tool called a plow to cover the seeds with dirt. Then, they would water and take care of the seeds until they sprouted and grew. Finally, when the plants produced grain or other kinds of crops, they would cut down the plants, separate the edible parts from the inedible parts, and store the edible parts in a safe place. See the notes on the verses in which Jesus discusses farming practices for specific information and translation options.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Parables\n\nThroughout this chapter, Jesus uses several parables to teach the crowds and his disciples. Each parable is a short story that includes a specific lesson. Jesus uses parables to teach so that people who already know his message will learn more but people who do not know his message will not learn anything (see [4:11–12](../04/11.md)). Jesus explains one of the parables, but he does not explain any of the others. Possible explanations for each parable are included below, but only for help in translation. Your translation should not directly explain the meaning of any parable more than Jesus does. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])\n\n* The parable of the sower—In [4:3–9](../04/03.md), Jesus tells a story about a man who sows seed and about what happens to the seed. Jesus explains this parable in [4:14–20](../04/14.md). Even with this explanation, Christians debate who the sower is, what the seed represents, and what the different areas in the field represent. The sower could be Jesus himself, God, or anyone who preaches the gospel. The seed could be the gospel or the person who hears the gospel. The different areas in the field could be regions or areas where people hear the gospel, different kinds of people, or different ways of responding to the gospel. Most likely, the seed and the area in the field together describe what happens when people respond to the gospel in these four ways.\n\n* The parable of the seeds growing by themselves—In [4:26–29](../04/26.md), Jesus tells a story about a farmer who sows seed. The seed sprouts, grows, and produces a crop all by itself, and the farmer does not know how it happens. However, when the crop is ready, he harvests it. Most likely, Jesus is describing how God’s kingdom grows and expands, even without help from people. By the time God judges everyone, which is like a harvest, the kingdom will be very large and productive, even though people do not always know how that happens.\n\n* The parable of the mustard seed—In [4:30–32](../04/30.md), Jesus tells a story about how a very small seed (a mustard seed) grows into a very large plant. Most likely, he is describing how his group of followers was very small but will eventually become very large. Jesus mentions that birds nest in the shadow of this large plant. Some people think that Jesus is referring to passages like [Ezekiel 17:23](../ezk/17/23.md), which could suggest that the birds represent Gentiles who become part of God’s kingdom. Others think that the detail about the birds simply illustrates how large the plant is. If possible, your translation should allow for all of these interpretations.\n\n### Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Singular and plural forms of “you”\n\nMost of the forms of “you” in this chapter appear in teaching that Jesus gives to his disciples and to the crowds. Because of this, most forms of “you” in this chapter are plural. You should assume forms of “you” are plural unless a note specifies that the form is singular. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])\n\n### The historic present\n\nTo call attention to a development in the story, Mark uses the present tense in past narration. In this chapter, the historic present occurs in verses 1, 13, 35, 36, 37 and 38. If it would not be natural to do that in your language, you could use the past tense in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense]])

4:7	pj8b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	καρπὸν	1	Here, the word **fruit** is singular in form, but it refers to many fruits as a group. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this plainly. Alternate translation: “fruits”

If it would be helpful in your language, you could make those ideas more explicit. Alternate translation: “some plants were producing 30 seeds, and some plants were producing 60 seeds, and other plants were producing 100 seeds” or “they were bearing many times more than the farmer planted: one group of plants 30 times more, and one group of plants 60 times more, and one group of plants 100 times more”

4:12	p9yr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐπιστρέψωσιν	1	The author of the quotation is speaking of the people of Israel as if they had been traveling somewhere and had taken the wrong way and needed to **turn back** onto the right way.

4:19	r7ez		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	αἱ μέριμναι τοῦ αἰῶνος	1	Here, Jesus is using the possessive form to describe **worries** that are related to **this age**.

Alternate translation: “which these people start to experience” or “which characterize these people’s lives”
4:19	s7s7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	συνπνίγουσιν τὸν λόγον καὶ ἄκαρπος γίνεται	1	Here Jesus continues to speak about what happens to these people as if it were what happened in the parable when the seeds were sown into the thorns. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in simile form.

4:19	zg3c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τὸν λόγον	1	Just as in [4:14](../04/14.md), Jesus is using the term **word** to mean the gospel, which people preach using words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the gospel”

You could supply these words from earlier in the sentence if it would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “one was bearing 30, and one was bearing 60, and one was bearing 100”
4:20	a9yb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	ἓν τριάκοντα, καὶ ἓν ἑξήκοντα, καὶ ἓν ἑκατόν	1	Jesus is using the number **one** as a noun to mean one of the plants. Your language may use numbers in the same way. If not, you could translate these words with equivalent phrases. Alternate translation: “one plant, 30, and one plant, 60, and one plant, 100”

If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate these as statements or exclamations. Alternate translation: “The lamp does not come so that it might be put under a basket or under the bed but so that it might be put on the lampstand.” or “The lamp certainly does not come so that it might be put under a basket or under the bed!

Is it not so that they might be put on lampstands”
4:21	zzw7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	μήτι ἔρχεται ὁ λύχνος	1	Here Jesus speaks as if the **lamp** were a person who could **come**.

4:21	dkq7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τεθῇ & οὐχ ἵνα & τεθῇ	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

4:21	u7lq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ὑπὸ τὸν μόδιον	1	A **basket** is a large circular container that stores food or other items.

Alternate translation: “in a box” or “under a container that hides its light”
4:21	y7f9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ὑπὸ τὴν κλίνην	1	A **bed** is a piece of furniture that people would lie on when they were eating or sleeping. Most likely, this kind of **bed** had short legs that raised it off the floor. If someone put a lamp under this kind of furniture, it would hide the light from the lamp. If your readers would not be familiar with this type of container, you could use the name of something similar in your area or you could use a more general term. Alternate translation: “under a couch” or “under furniture”
4:21	gc4s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐπὶ τὴν λυχνίαν	1	Here Jesus implies that the lamp can illuminate a large area when it is on a **lampstand**.

The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could connect the clauses with a word other than and in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternatively, you could combine the two clauses into one. Alternate translation: “it is not hidden except so that it might be revealed; yes, it has not become secret except so that it might come into visibility” or “it is not hidden except so that it will come into visibility”

Alternate translation: “it is only hidden so that it might be revealed, and it has only become secret so that it might come into visibility”
4:22	hou4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	οὐ & ἐστιν κρυπτὸν, ἐὰν μὴ ἵνα φανερωθῇ; οὐδὲ ἐγένετο ἀπόκρυφον, ἀλλ’ ἵνα ἔλθῃ εἰς φανερόν	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the ideas in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who did the actions, you could: (1) use indefinite subjects.

4:22	x0dp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	οὐ & ἐστιν & οὐδὲ ἐγένετο	1	The pronoun **it** in both places refers generally to any thing.

He could be using it to teach: (1) that people learn and understand only whatever they chose to listen carefully to. Alternate translation: “Whatever you pay attention to is what you will learn and know” or “How you listen shows what you will know and understand” (2) that people eventually experience for themselves how they have treated other people. Alternate translation: “what you give to others is what you will get and acquire in return” or “what you do to others will be done to you”
4:24	zis1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐν ᾧ μέτρῳ μετρεῖτε	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **measure**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “In the manner that you measure”
4:24	c4xp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	μετρηθήσεται ὑμῖν, καὶ προστεθήσεται ὑμῖν	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

4:24	lqor		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	μετρηθήσεται ὑμῖν, καὶ προστεθήσεται ὑμῖν	1	In both places, the word **it** refers to what **you measure**. Jesus is speaking in general about anything that people **measure**, so you should avoid making the phrase specific. Alternate translation: “the same thing will be measured to you, and it will be added to you” or “that very thing will be measured to you, and it will be added to you”
4:24	sbmk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	προστεθήσεται ὑμῖν	1	Here Jesus uses the phrase **will be added to you** to indicate that God will give all what is **measured**.

Translate this proverb in a way that will be recognized as a proverb and be meaningful in your language and culture. Alternate translation: “people who have things receive more, and people who do not have things lose what they used to have”

If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “he who has understanding, it will be given to him, and he who does not have understanding, even what he has will be taken away from him” or “he who has knowledge about the gospel, more will be given to him, and he who does not have knowledge about the gospel, even what knowledge he has will be taken away from him”

4:25	emrz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	ὃς οὐκ ἔχει	1	Jesus says **he who does not have** here as a generalization for emphasis.

Alternate translation: “he who has almost nothing” or “he who does not have much”
4:26	n1mq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables	οὕτως ἐστὶν ἡ Βασιλεία τοῦ Θεοῦ: ὡς ἄνθρωπος βάλῃ τὸν σπόρον ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς	1	To teach his audience, Jesus offers a story or illustration.

4:26	in2l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	βάλῃ τὸν σπόρον ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς	1	While there are many ways to sow or plant seeds, here Jesus is describing a practice in which a farmer pick sup handfuls of **seed** and **throws** them so that they are scattered all over the top of the soil.

4:27	yqr9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns	αὐτός	1	Jesus uses the word **himself** to emphasize how significant it was that the farmer **does not know**. Use a way that is natural in your language to indicate this significance. Alternate translation: “he indeed”

Jesus uses this form because he wants his audience to be involved in thinking about how parables can help explain the kingdom of God. Alternate translation: “What would be a good comparison for us to use for the kingdom of God, or what parable could we use for it”
4:30	lj2f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	ἢ	1	Here, the word **or** introduces another similar question. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a related question, or you could leave **or** untranslated. Alternate translation: “and” or “or again,”
4:30	jduf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐν τίνι αὐτὴν παραβολῇ θῶμεν	1	Here Jesus speaks as if **the kingdom of God** were an object that he could **put** in a **parable**, which he speaks about as if it were a container. He means that he can explain **the kingdom of God** by using a **parable**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable figure of speech or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “with what parable will we describe it” or “what parable can we use to explain it”
4:31	qvr0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables	ὡς κόκκῳ σινάπεως	1	To teach his audience, Jesus offers a story or illustration. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “Listen to this story: It is like a mustard seed”
4:31	l8gh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	κόκκῳ σινάπεως	1	A **mustard seed** is a very small seed that grows into a large plant.

This was a natural way in his language to describe the seed and the action. If repeating this clause would be redundant in your language, you could rearrange the clauses and only include the repeated clause once. Alternate translation: “which, being the smallest of all the seeds on the earth, when it has been sown, grows”
4:31	w4l5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	σπαρῇ	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who did the action, you could use an indefinite subject. Alternate translation: “a person has sown it” or “they have sown it”
4:31	jf5b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	μικρότερον & πάντων τῶν σπερμάτων	1	Jesus says **smallest of all the seeds** here as a generalization for emphasis. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different way to express the emphasis. Alternate translation: “one of the smallest seeds” or “smaller than most seeds”
4:32	osdk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	σπαρῇ	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

4:32	tyok		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	τὰ πετεινὰ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ	1	In your language, it might seem that this phrase expresses unnecessary extra information. If so, you could abbreviate it. Alternate translation: “the birds”
4:32	lu6u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	κατασκηνοῦν	1	Here, the word **nest** could indicate that: (1) the birds are building nests in the **shadow** of the mustard plant.

Use a natural form in your language for expressing the conclusion of a speech. Alternate translation: “Before he stopped teaching them, he used many such parables to speak the word to them, just as they were able to hear; but he did not speak to them without a parable, but by himself he explained everything to his own disciples”
4:33	nfck		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τὸν λόγον	1	Mark is using the term **word** to mean the gospel, which Jesus preached using words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the gospel”

Alternate translation: “teaching them all the things that they were able to hear” (2) Jesus spoke to his audience in a way that he knew they could **hear**. Alternate translation: “teaching them in a way that they could hear”
4:33	kol8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀκούειν	1	Here Mark uses the word **hear** to refer to both hearing and understanding. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “to realize what he meant”
4:34	oo4t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	χωρὶς & παραβολῆς οὐκ ἐλάλει αὐτοῖς	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a positive expression to translate this double negative that consists of the negative word **not** and the negative preposition **without**. Alternate translation: “he was only speaking to them with a parable”\n
4:34	gp99		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πάντα	1	Here, the word **everything** refers to every parable that Jesus spoke to the people. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “every parable”
4:35	fzew		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense	λέγει	1	To call attention to a development in the story, Mark uses the present tense in past narration. If it would not be natural to do that in your language, you could use the past tense in your translation. Alternate translation: “he said”
4:35	jz5x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	εἰς τὸ πέραν	1	Here Jesus implies that he wants to go with the disciples **to the other side** of the Sea of Galilee.

4:37	oad8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἤδη γεμίζεσθαι τὸ πλοῖον	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

4:38	hw93		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense	ἐγείρουσιν αὐτὸν καὶ λέγουσιν	1	To call attention to a development in the story, Mark uses the present tense in past narration.

4:38	b4xb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	οὐ μέλει σοι ὅτι ἀπολλύμεθα?	1	The disciples are using the question form to show Jesus that they are afraid and to convince him to do something to help them. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “it should be a concern to you that we are perishing.” or “it is clearly not a concern to you that we are perishing!”
4:38	viz2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	οὐ μέλει σοι	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **concern**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “does it not concern you”
4:38	fu0n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	σοι	1	Because the disciples are speaking to Jesus, the word **you** here is singular.
4:38	qtb3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἀπολλύμεθα	1	Here, the word **we** includes both Jesus and the disciples. Your language may require you to mark this form.
4:39	yym6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	σιώπα, πεφίμωσο	1	The terms **Be silent** and **Be still** mean similar things. Jesus is using the two terms together for emphasis.

Alternate translation: “Who then is this? Even the wind and the sea obey him!”
4:41	biog			τίς ἄρα οὗτός ἐστιν, ὅτι καὶ ὁ ἄνεμος καὶ ἡ θάλασσα ὑπακούει αὐτῷ	1	This is a genuine question, not a statement in question form.

5:intro	lh25				0	# Mark 5 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n2. The ministry of Jesus in Galilee (1:14–8:26)\n      * Becoming more popular among the people (3:7–5:43)\n        * Casting demons out of a man (5:1–20)\n        * Healing a woman and resurrecting a girl (5:21–43)\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Resurrecting the dead\n\nIn [5:21–24](../05/21.md) and [5:35–43](../05/35.md), Mark narrates how Jesus raised a girl from the dead. While Jesus describes her as only “sleeping,” he uses this word to indicate that the girl will “wake up” from being dead. The story clearly indicates that the girl had died and that Jesus raises her from the dead by touching her.\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### How to refer to the demons and the demon-possessed man\n\nIn [5:1–20](../05/01.md), Jesus encounters a man whom demons had possessed. As Jesus interacts with this man, it becomes clear that there are three different entities who are involved. First, there is the man himself, but what he says and does is only what the demons want him to do. Second, there is a specific demon who seems to act as the spokesperson or leader for multiple demons. Third, there are the other demons, of whom there are so many that the man is called “Legion.” As Mark narrates the story, he sometimes refers to the man, sometimes to the individual demon, and sometimes to all the demons. Further, it is not always clear which of these three entities speaks and is spoken to by Jesus. Consider how you might refer to a demon-possessed person in this situation. If possible, preserve Mark’s switches between singular and plural, since learning that there are many demons is an important part of the story. Further, Mark implies that the man and the demons are so closely connected that referring to what the man did is the same as referring to what the demons did, and vice versa.\n\n### Singular and plural forms of “you”\n\nMany of the forms of “you” in this chapter appear in dialogues between Jesus and other individuals. Because of this, most forms of “you” in this chapter are singular. You should assume forms of “you” are singular unless a note specifies that the form is plural. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])\n\n### The historic present\n\nTo call attention to a development in the story, Mark uses the present tense in past narration. In this chapter, the historic present occurs in verses 7, 9, 15, 19, 22, 23, 35, 36, 38, 39, 40 and 41. If it would not be natural in your language, you could use the past tense in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense]])
5:1	fix1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	καὶ	1	Here, the word **And** introduces the next major event in the story. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces the next event, or you could leave **And** untranslated. Alternate translation: “After that,”
5:1	gt8a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	ἦλθον	1	In a context such as this, your language might say “went” instead of **came**. Alternate translation: “they came”
5:1	vsc7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	τῶν Γερασηνῶν	1	The name **Gerasenes** refers to the people who lived in and near the town of Gerasa.
5:1	dzc1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	τῶν Γερασηνῶν	1	Many ancient manuscripts read **Gerasenes**. The ULT follows that reading. Some ancient manuscripts read “Gadarenes,” and other ancient manuscripts read “Gergesenes.” If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of the ULT.
5:2	pf16		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	ἐξελθόντος	1	In a context such as this, your language might say “come” instead of **gone**. Alternate translation: “having come out”
5:2	zwtq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	ὑπήντησεν αὐτῷ ἐκ τῶν μνημείων ἄνθρωπος ἐν πνεύματι ἀκαθάρτῳ	1	Here Mark introduces **a man with an unclean spirit** as a new participant in the story. If your language has its own way of introducing new participants, you could use it here in your translation. Alternate translation: “a certain man came from the tombs to meet him. This man had an unclean spirit”
5:3	pinm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	ὃς τὴν κατοίκησιν εἶχεν ἐν τοῖς μνήμασιν	1	Here Mark provides background information that will help readers understand what happens next. This background information continues in [5:4](../05/04.md) and [5:5](../05/05.md). Use a natural form in your language for introducing background information. Alternate translation: “and here is what that man was like. He had his dwelling in the tombs”
5:3-4	nll4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge	καὶ οὐδὲ ἁλύσει οὐκέτι οὐδεὶς ἐδύνατο αὐτὸν δῆσαι & διὰ τὸ αὐτὸν πολλάκις πέδαις καὶ ἁλύσεσι δεδέσθαι, καὶ διεσπάσθαι ὑπ’ αὐτοῦ τὰς ἁλύσεις καὶ τὰς πέδας συντετρῖφθαι, καὶ οὐδεὶς ἴσχυεν αὐτὸν δαμάσαι	1	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could combine [5:3](../05/03.md) and [5:4](../05/04.md) into a verse bridge in order to include the basis for the claim that **no one was able to bind him anymore** before the claim. Alternate translation: “and he had often been bound with shackles and chains, and the chains had been torn apart by him and the shackles had been shattered. So, no one was strong enough to subdue him or to bind him anymore, not even with a chain”
5:3	pjsx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οὐκέτι οὐδεὶς ἐδύνατο αὐτὸν δῆσαι	1	Here Mark implies that people tried to **bind** this man to keep him from hurting people and breaking things. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “no one was able to bind him anymore to keep him from hurting others” or “no one was able to use bonds to restrain him anymore”
5:3	dryi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	οὐκέτι οὐδεὶς ἐδύνατο	1	The words translated **no one** and **anymore** are two negative words. In this construction, the second negative does not cancel the first to create a positive meaning. Instead, it gives greater emphasis to the negative. If your language can use two negatives that do not cancel one another to create a positive meaning, you could use a double negative here. If your language does not use two negatives in that way, you could translate with one strong negative, as the ULT does. Alternate translation: “people were able … no longer”\n
5:3	nsol		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ἁλύσει	1	A **chain** is a long, flexible fastener that is made out of multiple rings of metal connected together. Chains are usually used to secure objects or bind things together. If your readers would not be familiar with chains, you could use the name of something similar in your area or you could use a more general term. Alternate translation: “with metal links connected together”
5:4	da4x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	αὐτὸν πολλάκις & δεδέσθαι	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who did the action, it is clear from the context that it was the people who lived nearby. Alternate translation: “the people who lived there had often bound him”
5:4	fk7t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	πέδαις & τὰς πέδας	1	The word **shackles** refers to pieces of metal that are fastened around the ankles of prisoners. These pieces of metal are connected together by ropes or chains, which prevent the prisoners from moving quickly or far. If your readers would not be familiar with shackles, you could use the name of something similar in your area or you could use a more general term. Alternate translation: “with leg irons … the leg irons” or “with strong restraints … the restraints”
5:4	dk1l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ἁλύσεσι & τὰς ἁλύσεις	1	See how you translated the word **chains** in [5:3](../05/03.md). Alternate translation: “metal links connected together … the metal links”
5:4	rjo3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	καὶ	2	Here, the word **and** introduces what the demon-possessed man did in contrast to what the people who tied him up wanted him to do. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces this kind of contrast. Alternate translation: “but”
5:4	nep6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	διεσπάσθαι ὑπ’ αὐτοῦ τὰς ἁλύσεις καὶ τὰς πέδας συντετρῖφθαι	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “he had torn apart the chains and had shattered the shackles”
5:5	ohvk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	διὰ παντὸς νυκτὸς καὶ ἡμέρας	1	Here, the phrase **throughout every night and day** indicates that this man was **crying out and cutting himself with stones** during both the day and the night. This means that he was doing those things very often every day. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “all the time” or “during every day and every night”
5:6	y6c2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καὶ ἰδὼν τὸν Ἰησοῦν ἀπὸ μακρόθεν	1	Here Mark stops giving background information and returns to the events in the story that he is telling. He implies that the man saw Jesus when he arrived in the boat from the other side of the Sea of Galilee (see [5:1–2](../05/01.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “Now, having seen Jesus from a distance when he got out of the boat”
5:6	w9zd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	προσεκύνησεν αὐτῷ	1	In the Jesus’ culture, bowing down to a person was a way to honor a greater person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could refer to a similar action from your culture, or you could explain what bowing down means. Alternate translation: “prostrated himself before him” or “bowed down to him in respect”
5:7-8	ux6u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge	καὶ κράξας φωνῇ μεγάλῃ λέγει, τί ἐμοὶ καὶ σοί Ἰησοῦ, Υἱὲ τοῦ Θεοῦ τοῦ Ὑψίστου? ὁρκίζω σε τὸν Θεόν, μή με βασανίσῃς & ἔλεγεν γὰρ αὐτῷ, ἔξελθε, τὸ πνεῦμα τὸ ἀκάθαρτον ἐκ τοῦ ἀνθρώπου	1	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could combine [5:7](../05/07.md) and [5:8](../05/08.md) into a verse bridge, as the UST does, in order to include the reason why the man cried out as he did before stating that the man cried out. Alternate translation: “And Jesus was saying to him, ‘Come out from the man, unclean spirit.’ So, crying out with a loud voice, he says, ‘What to me and to you, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I make you swear by God, do not torment me.’”
5:7	x6qj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	κράξας φωνῇ μεγάλῃ	1	Here, the phrase **crying out with a loud voice** means that the demon raised the volume of its voice. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “having yelled loudly”
5:7	zfo5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense	λέγει	1	To call attention to a development in the story, Mark uses the present tense in past narration. If it would not be natural to do that in your language, you could use the past tense in your translation. Alternate translation: “he said”
5:7	ppu5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τί ἐμοὶ καὶ σοί Ἰησοῦ, Υἱὲ τοῦ Θεοῦ τοῦ Ὑψίστου?	1	The man, controlled by the demon, is using the question form to insist on something urgently. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “There is nothing to me and to you, Jesus, Son of the Most High God!”

5:39	t35h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	θορυβεῖσθε	1	Because Jesus is speaking to many people in the house, the word **you** is plural.

6:intro	kl7n				0	# Mark 6 General Notes\n\nMatthew: 14\nLuke: 4, 9\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n2. The ministry of Jesus in Galilee (1:14–8:26)\n      * Moving away from Galilee and then returning (6:1–8:26)\n        * Jesus teaches in his hometown (6:1–6)\n        * Jesus sends out the Twelve (6:7–13)\n        * Herod hears about Jesus (6:14–16)\n        * Flashback: Herod executes John the Baptist (6:17–29)\n        * Jesus feeds 5,000 men (6:30–44)\n        * Jesus walks on water (6:45–52)\n        * Jesus heals people in the region of Gennesaret (6:53–56)\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Jesus’ instructions on how to travel\n\nJesus instructs the disciples not to bring money, food, or extra clothing with them when they travel and preach the good news. Instead, he wants the disciples to rely on the hospitality of people they visit. Make sure that your translation indicates that the disciples should not pack money, food, or extra clothing because they will be staying with people who welcome and provide for them.\n\n### Herod and Herodias\n\nThe man named “King Herod” ([6:14](../06/14.md)) ruled over the area to the northwest of the Sea of Galilee, which is where Jesus spent much of his ministry. Herodias was married to Herod’s brother Philip, and the two of them had a daughter. However, Herodias divorced Philip and married Herod, who had also divorced his previous wife. Since the Jewish law condemned anyone who married his brother’s wife while his brother was still alive (see [Leviticus 20:21](../lev/20/21.md)), John the Baptist rebuked Herod for doing this. It was in response to this rebuke that Herod had John the Baptist put in prison and eventually executed. Make sure that your translation accurately refers to the relationships between Herod, Herodias, and Herodias’ daughter.\n\n### The miracle of multiplying food\n\nIn [6:30–44](../06/30.md), Mark tells a story in which Jesus provides 5,000 men with food. They were in a place where no people lived, and all the food that Jesus and his disciples had were five loaves of bread and two fish. Despite that, Jesus used the five loaves of bread and the two fish to feed everyone who was there. Mark does not tell us exactly how Jesus did this, but he does say that there were more leftovers than what they started with. Your translation should not explain how Jesus multiplied the food, but it should be clear that he did a miracle.\n\n### The miracle of walking on water\n\nIn [6:45–52](../06/45.md), Mark tells a story in which Jesus walks on top of the Sea of Galilee, even though there was a storm. When Jesus climbs into the boat that the disciples were in, the storm miraculously stops. Your translation should not explain exactly how Jesus walked on the water, but it should be clear that Jesus walking on the water and the storm stopping were both miracles.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### The flashback to John’s death\n\nIn this chapter, Mark includes a story that happened before the stories that appear before and after it in his narrative. Previously, Mark narrates how Jesus sent out the Twelve ([6:7–13](../06/07.md)). Then, he describes how people, and especially Herod Antipas, respond to Jesus (see [6:14–16](../06/14.md)). Then, to explain how Herod responded to Jesus, Mark includes a story that happened earlier. This type of storytelling is called a flashback. Here, the flashback tells about how John the Baptist died (see [6:17–29](../06/17.md)). In [6:30](../06/30.md), Mark returns to the main narrative and tells what happened after the events recorded in [6:7–13](../06/07.md). Make sure that you use a form that shows your readers that [6:17–29](../06/17.md) is a flashback that describes something that happened previously, and [6:30](../06/30.md) continues with the main narrative. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])\n\n### Singular and plural forms of “you”\n\nMany of the forms of “you” in this chapter appear when Jesus is talking to his disciples. Because of this, most forms of “you” in this chapter are plural. You should assume forms of “you” are plural unless a note specifies that the form is singular. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])\n\n### The historic present\n\nTo call attention to a development in the story, Mark uses the present tense in past narration. In this chapter, the historic present occurs in verses 1, 7, 30, 31, 37, 38, 45, 48, and 50. If it would not be natural to do that in your language, you could use the past tense in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture]])

6:2	qu8w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	οἱ πολλοὶ ἀκούοντες ἐξεπλήσσοντο λέγοντες	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation.

6:2	s2jg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	πόθεν τούτῳ ταῦτα	1	Here, the phrase **From where to this one {are} these things** asks about the source from which **this one**, Jesus, was able to do **these things**.

They mean that Jesus is just an ordinary person. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate these questions as statements or exclamations. Alternate translation: “He is only a carpenter, the son of Mary and a brother of James, Joseph, Judas, and Simon. His sisters are here with us.” or “He is only a carpenter!

6:3	i9qi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship	ἀδελφὸς	1	Jesus was the older **brother** of these men. They were sons of Mary and Joseph.

6:4	l436		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	οὐκ ἔστιν & ἄτιμος	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a positive expression to translate this double negative that consists of the negative particle **not** and the negative preposition **without**. Alternate translation: “has honor” or “is always honored”\n
6:4	yg9c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἄτιμος	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **honor**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “dishonored” or “treated dishonorably”

In this construction, the second negative does not cancel the first to create a positive meaning. Instead, it gives greater emphasis to the negative. If your language can use two negatives that do not cancel one another to create a positive meaning, you could use a double negative here. If your language does not use two negatives in that way, you could translate with one strong negative, as the ULT does. Alternate translation: “he was able to do not even one miracle there”
6:6-7	swqh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	καὶ ἐθαύμασεν διὰ τὴν ἀπιστίαν αὐτῶν.\nκαὶ περιῆγεν τὰς κώμας, κύκλῳ διδάσκων & καὶ προσκαλεῖται τοὺς δώδεκα, καὶ ἤρξατο αὐτοὺς ἀποστέλλειν δύο δύο, καὶ ἐδίδου αὐτοῖς ἐξουσίαν τῶν πνευμάτων τῶν ἀκαθάρτων	1	Here, the clause **he was going around the villages teaching** could be: (1) the end of the story about Jesus visiting his hometown.

6:8	rm8z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	εἰς τὴν ζώνην	1	In Jesus’ culture, people would often wrap their money up in long strips of cloth and then tie them around their waists as belts.

6:16	a5hb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	ὃν ἐγὼ ἀπεκεφάλισα, Ἰωάννην οὗτος ἠγέρθη	1	Here, the phrase **this one** refers directly back to **{The one} whom I beheaded, John**. Herod expresses the idea in this way to introduce the person he is talking about and then explain what he thinks has happened to that person. If stating the topic and then referring back to it with the phrase **this one** would be redundant in your language, you could omit the redundant information. Alternate translation: “The one whom I beheaded, John, has been raised”

6:16	n6nq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	οὗτος ἠγέρθη	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

Alternate translation: “For Herod had married Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip. Then, John was saying to Herod, ‘It is not lawful for you to have the wife of your brother.’ So, because of Herodias, Herod himself, having sent, seized John and bound him in prison.”
6:17	ojtd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background	γὰρ	1	Here, the word **For** introduces background information that tells about how John died. This background information continues in [6:18–29](../06/18.md).

Alternate translation: “Now sometime earlier,” or “By this time, John had already died. Here is what happened:”

6:17	szok		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship	τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ αὐτοῦ	1	It is not certain whether **Philip** was older or younger than Herod, but it is slightly more likely that he was older. So, if you have to use a form that refers to an older or younger brother, you could state that **Philip** was older. Alternate translation: “his older brother”
6:18	a46w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	Here, the word **For** introduces a reason why Herod put John in prison.

Alternate translation: “But Herodias was angry with him and was wanting to kill him. But Herod was fearing John, knowing him {to be} a righteous and holy man, and he was keeping him safe, and having heard him, he was greatly perplexed, yet he was listening to him gladly. So, Herodias was not able to kill him”
6:19	x35v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἤθελεν αὐτὸν ἀποκτεῖναι	1	Here Mark implies that Herodias wanted to send someone to **kill** John.

6:30	u01i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	καὶ	1	Here, the word **And** introduces the next major event in the story.

The ULT does this with the poetry in 7:6–7, which are words quoted from the Old Testament.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Hand washing\n\nThe Pharisees washed many things that were not dirty, because they were trying to make God think that they were good. They washed their hands before they ate, even when their hands were not dirty. and even though the law of Moses did not say that they had to do it. Jesus told them that they were wrong and that people please God by trusting and obeying him.

8:intro	ry56				0	# Mark 8 General Notes\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Bread\n\nWhen Jesus worked a miracle and provided bread for a large crowd of people, they probably thought about when God miraculously provided food for the people of Israel when they were in the wilderness.\n\nYeast is the ingredient that causes bread to expand before it is baked. In this chapter, Jesus uses yeast as a metaphor for things that change the way people think, speak, and act. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n### “Adulterous generation”\n\nWhen Jesus called the people an “adulterous generation,” he was telling them that they were not faithful to God. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/faithful]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/peopleofgod]])\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### The historic present\n\nTo call attention to a development in the story, Mark uses the present tense in past narration. In this chapter, the historic present occurs in verses 1, 2, 6, 12, 17, 19, 20, 22, 29 and 33. If it would not be natural to do that in your language, you could use the past tense in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture]])\n\n### Rhetorical questions\n\nJesus used many rhetorical questions as a way of both teaching the disciples [Mark 8:17–21](./17.md) and rebuking the people [Mark 8:12](../mrk/08/12.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Paradox\n\nA paradox is a true statement that appears to describe something impossible.

9:intro	n92j				0	# Mark 9 General Notes\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### “Transfigured”\n\nScripture often speaks of God’s glory as a great, brilliant light. When people see this light, they are afraid. Mark says in this chapter that Jesus’ clothing shone with this glorious light so that his followers could see that Jesus truly was God’s Son. At the same time, God told them that Jesus was his Son. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/glory]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/fear]])\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Hyperbole\n\nJesus said things that he did not expect his followers to understand literally. When he said, “If your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off” ([Mark 9:43](../mrk/09/43.md)), he was exaggerating so that his hearers would pay close attention to what he was saying and realize how important it is to avoid sin.\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Elijah and Moses\n\nElijah and Moses suddenly appear to Jesus, James, John, and Peter, and then they disappear. All four of them saw Elijah and Moses, and because Elijah and Moses spoke with Jesus, the reader should understand that Elijah and Moses appeared physically.\n\n### “Son of Man”\n\nJesus refers to himself as the “Son of Man” in this chapter ([Mark 9:31](../mrk/09/31.md)). Your language may not allow people to speak of themselves as if they were speaking about someone else. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sonofman]] and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])\n\n### Paradox\n\nA paradox is a true statement that appears to describe something impossible. Jesus uses a paradox when he says, “If anyone wants to be first, he must be last of all and servant of all” ([Mark 9:35](../mrk/09/35.md)).

If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this plainly.

Alternate translation: “O unbelieving generation. You test my patience” or “O unbelieving generation. Your unbelief tires me!

9:22	f5yu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	βοήθησον ἡμῖν, σπλαγχνισθεὶς ἐφ’ ἡμᾶς	1	In the sentence **help us, having compassion on us**, Mark records the father using a figure of speech in which the logical flow of events is altered in order to put what is most important in the mind of the speaker first (here the speaker is the father). The normal way of saying this would be, “having compassion on us, help us”, because it shows the natural order of events, since **having compassion** on someone normally precedes helping them. Mark records the father saying **help us** first because receiving help was what was most important to the father. If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases. Alternate translation: “have compassion on us and help us”

If it would be helpful in your language, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “receives not just me, but also receives God who has sent me” or “receives not only me, but receives God who sent me to represent him”
9:37	y24n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὸν ἀποστείλαντά με	1	Jesus assumes that his disciples will know that **the one** refers to God. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “God, who has sent me”

If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a similar expression from your language or say this using plain language. Alternate translation: “gives you a cup of water because you are working for me” or “helps you on my account”

9:41	bpz5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐν ὀνόματι, ὅτι Χριστοῦ ἐστε	1	Here, **in the name because** is an idiom which means to do something for the sake of someone.

9:41	wnb2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	οὐ μὴ ἀπολέσῃ τὸν μισθὸν αὐτοῦ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **reward**, you can express the idea behind the abstract noun **reward** by using a verb phrase. Alternate translation: “he will certainly be rewarded” or “God will certainly reward that person”
9:41	jjq5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	οὐ μὴ ἀπολέσῃ τὸν μισθὸν αὐτοῦ	1	Although the pronouns **he** and **his** are masculine, they are being used here in a generic sense that includes both men and women. Alternate translation: “that person will certainly not lose their reward”
9:42	cj0l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἕνα τῶν μικρῶν τούτων	1	The phrase **these little ones** could be: (1) a reference to children who love Jesus and who are physically little compared to adults.

Alternate translation: “one of these new believers” or (3) a reference to people who are not important from a human perspective. Alternate translation: “one of these common people”
9:42	gef5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo	καλόν ἐστιν αὐτῷ μᾶλλον εἰ	1	Jesus is using a hypothetical situation to teach. Here, Jesus is making a comparison to the punishment that people will receive from God for causing other people to sin. Jesus means that the person’s punishment from God for causing people to sin will be worse than if that person had drowned in the sea. He is not saying that someone would actually put a stone around a person’s neck and throw them into the sea as an alternative to being punished by God. Use the natural form in your language for expressing a hypothetical situation. Alternate translation: “The punishment he will receive will be worse than if”
9:42	z6k5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	μύλος ὀνικὸς	1	A **millstone of a donkey** was a round stone used for grinding grain into flour. It was so heavy that it required a donkey or an ox to turn it.

9:43	ifcv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	ἐὰν σκανδαλίσῃ σε ἡ χείρ σου, ἀπόκοψον αὐτήν	1	When Jesus says, **if your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off**, he is using exaggeration in order to emphasize the seriousness of sin and the importance of avoiding it. Jesus is not being literal when he says to cut off **your hand**, because Judaism taught against harming one’s body, and Jesus taught in [Mark 7:14–23](../mrk/07/14.md), and elsewhere that the human heart is what causes people to sin. If it would be helpful in your language, you could clarify this in a footnote if you are using footnotes.

9:43	h9lh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	κυλλὸν εἰσελθεῖν εἰς τὴν ζωὴν	1	When Jesus speaks of entering into eternal **life crippled**, he is not being literal, but rather, he is using hyperbole in order to emphasize the importance of striving against sin and things that could prevent one from receiving eternal life. The Bible teaches that when people enter into eternal life with God, he will restore their bodies of any physical defects. If it would be helpful in your language, you could clarify this in a footnote if you are using footnotes.
9:43	l5bf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	εἰσελθεῖν εἰς τὴν ζωὴν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **life**, you can express the idea behind the abstract noun **life** in another way.

9:45	hbt9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	βληθῆναι εἰς τὴν Γέενναν	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can express the phrase **to be thrown** in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Jesus implies that “God” is the one who will do it. Alternate translation: “for God to throw you into Gehenna”
9:47	okc3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐὰν ὁ ὀφθαλμός σου σκανδαλίζῃ σε, ἔκβαλε αὐτόν	1	Being the organ of vision, the **eye** substitutes for looking at something. In this case, the person looks at something which God has prohibited, which in turn can cause the person to sin. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning in plain language. Alternate translation: “if you want to sin because of looking at something, tear your eye out” or “if you want to do something sinful because of what you look at, tear your eye out”
9:47	h4dv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	μονόφθαλμον εἰσελθεῖν εἰς τὴν Βασιλείαν τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Here, the phrase **enter into the kingdom of God** is referring to living eternally with God after one’s life on earth has ended. This phrase has a similar meaning to the phrase “to enter into life” which was used in [Mark 9:43](../mrk/09/43.md) and [Mark 9:45](../mrk/09/45.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning of this phrase explicitly. Alternate translation: “to enter into God’s kingdom and live with him forever with only one eye”

The Bible teaches that when people enter into eternal life with God, he will restore their bodies of any physical defects. If it would be helpful in your language, you could clarify this in a footnote if you are using footnotes.

9:49	mr5y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	πᾶς & πυρὶ ἁλισθήσεται	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can express the phrase **will be salted** in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Jesus implies that “God” is the one who will do it. Alternate translation: “God will salt everyone with fire”
9:49	ma3s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	πυρὶ ἁλισθήσεται	1	Here, **fire** is a metaphor for suffering, and putting salt on people is a metaphor for purifying them, so **will be salted with fire** is a metaphor for being purified through suffering.

9:50	fqb8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	ἐν τίνι αὐτὸ ἀρτύσετε?	1	By using the question **with what will you season it?**, Jesus is not asking for information, but rather, he is using the question form to emphasize a truth that he wants his listeners to understand. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “you cannot make it salty again.”
9:50	t76n			αὐτὸ ἀρτύσετε	1	Alternate translation: “will you make it taste salty again”
9:50	f34y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἔχετε ἐν ἑαυτοῖς ἅλα	1	Jesus speaks of doing good things for one another as if good things were **salt**. If it would be helpful in your language to understand what **salt** means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture or you could use plain language. Alternate translation: “Do good to each other, like salt adds flavor to food”
9:50	syc9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns	ἔχετε ἐν ἑαυτοῖς ἅλα	1	The plural reflexive pronoun **yourselves** is used here to emphasize that Jesus wanted his 12 disciples to apply what he was saying to themselves.

10:intro	bq25				0	# Mark 10 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nSome translations set quotations from the Old Testament farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text. The ULT does this with the quoted material in [Mark10:7–8](../mrk/10/07.md).\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Jesus’ teaching about divorce\n\nThe Pharisees wanted to find a way to make Jesus say that it is good to break the law of Moses, so they asked him about divorce. As Jesus tells how God originally designed marriage, he shows that the Pharisees taught wrongly about divorce.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Metaphor\n\nMetaphors are mental pictures of visible objects that speakers use to explain invisible truths. When Jesus spoke of “the cup which I will drink,” he was speaking of the pain he would suffer on the cross as if it were a bitter, poisonous liquid in a cup.\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Paradox\n\nA paradox is a true statement that appears to describe something impossible. Jesus uses a paradox when he says, “Whoever wishes to become great among you must be your servant” ([Mark 10:43](../mrk/10/43.md)).

10:5	xqzb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	τὴν σκληροκαρδίαν ὑμῶν	1	The phrase **hardness of heart** is an idiom which describes stubbornly choosing to resist God’s will and desires and instead choosing one’s own will and desires. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent idiom or use plain language. See how you translated the phrase “the hardness of their heart” in [Mark 3:5](../mrk/03/05.md). Alternate translation: “your stubbornness”

Jesus’ entire address is enclosed with double quotation marks. His quotation of the Old Testament is enclosed with single quotation marks, because it is a quote within a quote. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate Jesus’ direct quotation as an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: “But from the beginning of creation, the Scriptures tell us that God made people male and female”

10:12	sn1m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	μοιχᾶται	1	Here, the phrase **she commits adultery** means that a woman who divorces her husband and marries another man commits adultery against her previous husband.

10:14	qj7i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	μὴ κωλύετε	1	If the double negative **do not forbid** would be misunderstood in your language, you could translate it as a positive statement. Alternate translation: “allow”

10:18	lw1f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τί με λέγεις ἀγαθόν?	1	Jesus’ statement “Why are you calling me good?” is a rhetorical question which Jesus is using in order to make a point and not to obtain information. If you would not use a rhetorical question to make a point in your language, you could translate Jesus’ words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “You do not understand what you are saying when you call me good!”
10:18	gyod		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τί με λέγεις ἀγαθόν? οὐδεὶς ἀγαθὸς, εἰ μὴ εἷς ὁ Θεός	1	By saying, **Why are you calling me good? No one is good except one—God**, Jesus is correcting the man’s misunderstanding regarding eternal life and about what it takes to please God. In the previous verse, the man called Jesus “Good Teacher,” thinking that Jesus was a good man but not knowing that Jesus was God. In this verse, Jesus redirects the man’s focus away from people and towards God. As evidenced by the man’s question to Jesus in the previous verse, the man thinks that in order to merit God’s approval and “inherit eternal life,” a person simply needs to know the right things and do them. Jesus’ words in this verse are meant to correct the man’s thinking and show the man that only God is fully good and that to please God, a person must focus on God and put their trust in God. If it would be helpful in your language, you could indicate that explicitly.

11:intro	xg3t				0	# Mark 11 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in [Mark 11:9–10](../mrk/11/09.md) and [Mark 11:17](../mrk/11/17.md), which are words from the Old Testament.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### The donkey and the colt\n\nJesus rode into Jerusalem on an animal. In this way he was like a king who came into a city after he had won an important battle. Also, the kings of Israel in the Old Testament rode on a donkeys. Other kings rode on horses. So Jesus was showing that he was the king of Israel and that he was not like other kings.\n\nMatthew, Mark, Luke, and John all wrote about this event. Matthew and Mark wrote that the disciples brought Jesus a donkey. John wrote that Jesus found a donkey. Luke wrote that they brought him a colt. Only Matthew wrote that there were both; the donkey had a colt. No one knows for sure whether Jesus rode the donkey or the colt. It is best to translate each of these accounts as it appears in the ULT without trying to make them all say exactly the same thing. (See: [Matthew 21:1–7](../mat/21/01.md) and [Mark 11:1–7](../mrk/11/01.md) and [Luke 19:29–36](../luk/19/29.md) and [John 12:14–15](../jhn/12/14.md))

11:32	z93u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ἀλλὰ εἴπωμεν, ἐξ ἀνθρώπων?	1	The religious leaders do not finish their statement, since they all understand what would happen if they said John’s baptism was not from God.

Use a natural way in your language for introducing background information. Alternate translation: “They said this to each other because they were afraid of the crowd, for all the people in the crowd believed that John really was a prophet” or “They did not want to say that John’s baptism was from men because they were afraid of the crowd, since all the people in the crowd believed that John truly was a prophet”
11:32	dqlt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	ἐφοβοῦντο τὸν ὄχλον	1	The word **crowd** is a singular noun that refers to a group of people. If your language does not use singular nouns in that way, you can use a different expression.

11:32	x4bo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἅπαντες γὰρ εἶχον	1	Here, the word **all** refers to the people in the crowd. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “for everyone in the crowd held” or “for all those who were in the crowd believed”
11:33	rmbd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ	1	Here, Mark uses the word **And** to introduce the results of what the previous sentences described. Use a natural form in your language for introducing a reason-and-result relationship. Alternate translation: “So”
11:33	us4a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	οὐκ οἴδαμεν	1	The reply **We do not know** leaves out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete.

Alternate translation: “We do not know where the baptism of John came from” or “We do not know where John’s authority to baptize came from”
11:33	av5y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	οὐδὲ ἐγὼ λέγω ὑμῖν	1	With the words **Nor do I tell you**, Jesus is indicating that this is the result of what the Jewish leaders told him. Alternate translation: “Then I will not tell you”
11:33	arpm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐξουσίᾳ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **authority**, you can express the same idea with a verbal form such as “authorized,” as modeled by the UST, or you can express the meaning some other way.
12:intro	ne55				0	# Mark 12 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 12:10–11, 36, which are words from the Old Testament.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Hypothetical situations\n\nHypothetical situations are situations that have not actually happened. People describe these situations so their listeners can imagine them happening and learn lessons from them. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### The son of David as Lord\n\nA paradox is a statement that describes two things that seem as if they cannot both be true at the same time, but which actually are both true. In this chapter, Jesus quotes a Psalm that records David calling his son “Lord,” that is, “master.” However, to the Jews, ancestors were greater than their descendants, so a father would not call his son “master.” In this passage, Mark 12:35–37, Jesus is trying to help his hearers understand that the Messiah will be divine, and that he himself is the Messiah. So, David is speaking to his son, that is, his descendant, as the Messiah, and it is appropriate for him to address him as his “Lord.”
12:1	w2hb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables	καὶ ἤρξατο αὐτοῖς ἐν παραβολαῖς λαλεῖν	1	# Connecting Statement:\n\nTo help the people understand what the Jewish leaders were doing by rejecting him and John the Baptist, Jesus tells a brief story that provides an illustration. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “Jesus told the people stories to help them understand better. He began”
12:1	qa93		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	ἀμπελῶνα ἄνθρωπος ἐφύτευσεν	1	Jesus uses the phrase **A man planted a vineyard** to introduce the main character in the story. Use a natural form in your language for introducing the main character in a story. Alternate translation: “There once was a man who planted a vineyard”
12:1	l2i2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ἐξέδετο αὐτὸν γεωργοῖς	1	As the rest of the story shows, the man rented the vineyard not for regular cash payments, but under an arrangement that entitled him to a share of the crop in exchange for the use of the land. If an arrangement like that would not be familiar to your readers, you could translate this in a way that explains it. Alternate translation: “allowed some grape farmers to use his vineyard in exchange for a share of the crop”
12:1	fd71			γεωργοῖς	1	While **farmers** is a general term for anyone who farms the ground, in this context it refers to people who tend grape vines and grow grapes. Alternate translation: “vine dressers” or “grape farmers”
12:2	s83v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τῷ καιρῷ	1	This refers to the time of harvest. If it would be helpful in your language, this could be made clear, as modeled by the UST.

12:3	c321		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἀπέστειλαν κενόν	1	Jesus speaks of this servant as if he were a container with nothing in it. Here, the word **empty** means that they did not give him any of the fruit from the vineyard. If it would be helpful in your language to understand what it means to be **empty** in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture or use plain language. Alternate translation: “sent him away without giving him anything”
12:4	jhi3			καὶ ἠτίμασαν	1	Alternate translation: “and humiliated” or “badly mistreated”
12:6	z5hz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	λέγων, ὅτι ἐντραπήσονται τὸν υἱόν μου	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation.

12:7	m63e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐκεῖνοι δὲ οἱ γεωργοὶ πρὸς ἑαυτοὺς εἶπαν, ὅτι οὗτός ἐστιν ὁ κληρονόμος; δεῦτε, ἀποκτείνωμεν αὐτόν, καὶ ἡμῶν ἔσται ἡ κληρονομία	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state explicitly that this happened after the owner sent his son and the son arrived, as the UST does.

12:7	s5dc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἡ κληρονομία	1	By **inheritance**, the farmers mean “the vineyard”, which the son would inherit. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “this vineyard, which he would inherit”
12:8	gx6l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ	1	Jesus uses the word **And** to introduce the results of what the previous sentence described, specifically that the farmers carried out the plan that they had decided on. Use a natural form in your language for introducing a reason-and-result relationship. Alternate translation: “So”
12:9	r4md		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τί οὖν ποιήσει ὁ κύριος τοῦ ἀμπελῶνος?	1	Jesus does not want the people to tell him what the owner of the vineyard will do. Rather, he is using the question form to get his listeners to pay attention to what he says the owner will do. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “So now, listen to what the lord of the vineyard will do to them:” or “So I will tell you what the owner of the vineyard will do.”

12:10	v6ta		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	οὐδὲ τὴν Γραφὴν ταύτην ἀνέγνωτε: λίθον ὃν ἀπεδοκίμασαν οἱ οἰκοδομοῦντες, οὗτος ἐγενήθη εἰς κεφαλὴν γωνίας	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “And surely you have read the scripture that says that a stone that the builders rejected became the cornerstone”
12:10	xj9j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	οὐδὲ τὴν Γραφὴν ταύτην ἀνέγνωτε:	1	Jesus does not want the Jewish leaders to tell him whether or not they have read the scripture he quotes to them. He knows that they have read the scripture. He is using the question form for emphasis and to rebuke them. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “And surely you have read this scripture!” or “And you should remember this scripture!” or “And you should pay attention to this scripture!”
12:10	mzr2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	λίθον ὃν ἀπεδοκίμασαν οἱ οἰκοδομοῦντες, οὗτος ἐγενήθη εἰς κεφαλὴν γωνίας	1	This quotation from Psalm 118 is a metaphor. It speaks of the Messiah as if he were a stone that builders chose not to use. This means that people will reject the Messiah. The Psalm says that this stone became the cornerstone, which is the most important stone in the building. This means that God will make the Messiah the ruler of these people. However, since this is a quotation from Scripture, translate the words directly rather than providing an explicit explanation of them, even if your language does not customarily use such figures of speech. If you want to explain the meaning of the metaphor, we recommend that you do that in a footnote rather than in the Bible text.
12:10	kv7t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	λίθον ὃν ἀπεδοκίμασαν οἱ οἰκοδομοῦντες	1	This Psalm refers implicitly to the way people in this culture used stones to build the walls of houses and other buildings. Alternate translation: “A stone that the builders thought was not good enough to use for building”
12:10	l5ma		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	κεφαλὴν γωνίας	1	The phrase the **head of the corner** is an idiom that refers to a large stone with straight edges that builders would place down first and use as a reference to make sure that the walls of a stone building were straight and that the building was oriented in the right direction. Your language may have its own term for such a stone. You could also use a general expression. Alternate translation: “the cornerstone” or “the reference stone for the whole building”
12:11	r8z8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	παρὰ Κυρίου ἐγένετο αὕτη, καὶ ἔστιν θαυμαστὴ ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς ἡμῶν	1	This entire verse is a continuation of Jesus’ quotation from Psalm 118. If you chose not to translate [12:10](../12/10.md) as a quotation within a quotation, then you should do the same with this verse. Alternate translation: “and which says that it was the Lord who did it and those who saw it marveled as they looked at it” or “and that it was the Lord who did it and those who saw it marveled when they saw what the Lord had done”
12:11	k5w6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἔστιν θαυμαστὴ ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς ἡμῶν	1	Here, **eyes** represent “seeing,” so the expression **in our eyes** refers to the perspective of the person seeing the event. Alternate translation: “from our perspective, it is marvelous” or “we see that it is wonderful”
12:12	b1vz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἐζήτουν	1	Here, the pronoun **they** refers to the chief priests, scribes, and elders mentioned in [11:27](../11/27.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could refer to this group as “the Jewish leaders.”
12:12	lx62		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background	καὶ ἐφοβήθησαν τὸν ὄχλον	1	Mark is providing this background information to help readers understand what happens next. The religious leaders fear of the crowd is why they **left** Jesus and **went away**. Use a natural way in your language for introducing background information. Alternate translation: “and because they were afraid of the crowd, they did not seize him” or “and they did not seize him, because they feared the crowd”
12:12	v9wb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	καὶ ἐζήτουν αὐτὸν κρατῆσαι, καὶ ἐφοβήθησαν τὸν ὄχλον; ἔγνωσαν γὰρ ὅτι πρὸς αὐτοὺς τὴν παραβολὴν εἶπεν. καὶ ἀφέντες αὐτὸν, ἀπῆλθον	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could change the order of these phrases to show the logical sequence of events, as modeled by the UST.
12:12	v5wv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	καὶ ἐφοβήθησαν τὸν ὄχλον	1	Here, Mark uses the word **and** to introduce a contrast between what the Jewish leaders wanted to do and the reason why they were not able to do so. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a contrast. Alternate translation: “yet they were afraid of what the people might do”
12:13	z2sf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	καὶ ἀποστέλλουσιν	1	Here, the pronoun **they** refers to the chief priests, scribes, and elders mentioned in [11:27](../11/27.md).

12:13	pj3c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τῶν Ἡρῳδιανῶν	1	The term **the Herodians** means those who supported the Roman Empire and Herod Antipas. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say that explicitly, as modeled by the UST.
12:13	kuy5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἵνα αὐτὸν ἀγρεύσωσιν	1	Here, Mark describes tricking Jesus as trapping him. If it would be helpful in your language to understand what **to trap him** means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “to trick him”
12:13	s1hb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	λόγῳ	1	# Connecting Statement:\n\nHere, Mark uses the term **word** to mean something Jesus might say by using words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “in something he might say” or “with something he might say”
12:14	dh3d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	λέγουσιν	1	Mark could mean that one person spoke to Jesus on behalf of the whole group. So instead of **they**, you could say “one of them says,” as the UST does.

12:14	awv5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	οἴδαμεν	1	The spies are speaking only of themselves, so **we** would be exclusive, if your language marks that distinction.

12:14	xptc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	οὐ γὰρ βλέπεις εἰς πρόσωπον ἀνθρώπων	1	The phrase **not look at the face of men** is a Hebrew expression that means “to not give attention to people’s outward appearances.” “Outward appearance” in this context refers to social position and whether or not a person was wealthy or influential or had a high social and/or religious position. This phrase, taken as a whole here, means that Jesus was impartial in his judgement and teaching and did not show favoritism. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent idiom or use plain language. Alternate translation: “for you pay no attention to external things when you speak” or “for you do not regard people’s position or status when you teach”
12:14	qvpo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	πρόσωπον ἀνθρώπων	1	Here, the term **face** means “external status and position.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or use plain language. Alternate translation: “the status and social position of people”
12:14	brm3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	ἀνθρώπων	1	Although the term **men** is masculine, the word is used here in a generic sense that includes both men and women. Alternate translation: “of people”
12:14	yfnc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τὴν ὁδὸν τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Here, the Jewish leaders speak of how God wants people to live as if it were a **way** or path that people should follow. If it would help your readers to understand what **way** means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture or you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “how God wants people to live”
12:14	ap2q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐπ’ ἀληθείας	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **truth**, you can express the same idea with an adverb such as “truthfully,” as modeled by the UST or in some other way that is natural in your language.
12:14	k0tw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἔξεστιν	1	The Jewish leaders are asking about God’s law, not the law of the Roman government. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “Does God’s law permit us”
12:14	gtsk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	Καίσαρι	1	The Jewish leaders were referring to the Roman government by Caesar’s name, since he was its ruler. If it would be helpful in your language, you could indicate that explicitly, as modeled by the UST.
12:15	g48w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ὁ δὲ εἰδὼς αὐτῶν τὴν ὑπόκρισιν, εἶπεν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **hypocrisy**, you can express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “But Jesus knew that they were not being sincere, so he said” or “But Jesus realized that they were trying to trick him, and so he said”
12:15	c7nj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τί με πειράζετε?	1	Jesus is not asking for information, but is using the question form here as a rebuke and for emphasis.

Alternate translation: “I know that you are trying to make me say something wrong so you can accuse me!”
12:15	wl34		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney	δηνάριον	1	A **denarius** was a silver coin equivalent to a day’s wage for a laborer. Alternate translation: “a Roman coin”

12:17	la16		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	καὶ τὰ τοῦ Θεοῦ τῷ Θεῷ	1	Jesus is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete.

12:18	edcn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	οἵτινες λέγουσιν ἀνάστασιν μὴ εἶναι	1	Mark provides this background information about the Sadducees to help readers understand what happens in this episode.

It may be helpful to introduce them more fully in your translation. Alternate translation: “Some members of the group of Jews called the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, then came to Jesus”
12:18	ss09		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish	Σαδδουκαῖοι & οἵτινες λέγουσιν ἀνάστασιν μὴ εἶναι	1	This phrase is identifying the Sadducees as a group of Jews that said no one would rise from the dead. It is not identifying the Sadducees who came to question Jesus as members of that group who held that belief, as if other members did not. If it would be helpful in your language, you could begin a new sentence here to clarify this. Alternate translation: “Sadducees, men who believe that no one will rise from the dead”

12:20	pj71		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	ὁ πρῶτος	1	Jesus is using the adjective **first** as a noun in order to indicate a particular person.

12:21	tbzw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καὶ ὁ τρίτος ὡσαύτως	1	The Sadducees are speaking in a compact way in order to keep the story short. If it would be helpful in your language, you could supply the information they leave out from the context. It may be helpful to make this a separate sentence. Alternate translation: “In the same way, the third brother married this widow but also died before they had any children”
12:21	l1ds		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	ὁ τρίτος	1	Jesus is using the adjective **third** as a noun in order to indicate a particular person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could specify the person. Alternate translation: “the third brother” or “the next oldest brother”
12:21	hx1q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal	ὁ τρίτος	1	If your language does not use ordinal numbers, you can use a cardinal number here. Alternate translation: “brother number three” or “the next oldest brother”
12:22	wjq8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	οἱ ἑπτὰ	1	The Sadducees are leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete.

12:23	w4wu			ἐν τῇ ἀναστάσει	1	The Sadducees did not actually believe that there would be a **resurrection**. Your language may have a way of showing this. Alternate translation: “in the supposed resurrection” or “when people supposedly rise from the dead”
12:23	c4p5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	οἱ & ἑπτὰ	1	The Sadducees are leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete. If it would be helpful in your language, you could supply these words from the context. Alternate translation: “the seven brothers”
12:24	zp2p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	οὐ διὰ τοῦτο πλανᾶσθε, μὴ εἰδότες τὰς Γραφὰς, μηδὲ τὴν δύναμιν τοῦ Θεοῦ?	1	Jesus is not asking for information, but is using the question form here to emphasize the fact that the Sadducees do not correctly understand the Scriptures or God’s power. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “You are greatly misunderstanding this matter because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God!”
12:24	sie3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	οὐ διὰ τοῦτο πλανᾶσθε, μὴ εἰδότες τὰς Γραφὰς, μηδὲ τὴν δύναμιν τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “You are greatly mistaken because you do not know the Scriptures or God’s power”
12:24	i8il			τὴν δύναμιν τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Alternate translation: “how powerful God is”
12:25	nvh6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ὅταν γὰρ ἐκ νεκρῶν ἀναστῶσιν, οὔτε γαμοῦσιν οὔτε γαμίζονται	1	Both uses of the pronoun **they** refer to men and women in general. If it would be helpful in your language, you could clarify this in your translation. Alternate translation: “For when men and women rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage” or “For when people rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage”
12:25	ox82		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	ἐκ νεκρῶν	1	Jesus is using the adjective **dead** as a noun in order to indicate a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this with an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “the people who have died”
12:25	y8vz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	οὔτε γαμοῦσιν οὔτε γαμίζονται	1	If your language does not use passive verbal forms, but your culture does use different expressions for men and women when they marry, you can use two different active verbal forms here, and you can say who does the action in the second case. Alternate translation: “men marry wives and parents give their daughters in marriage to husbands”
12:25	ensg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	οὔτε γαμοῦσιν οὔτε γαμίζονται	1	In this culture, the idiom was to say that men married their wives and that women were given in marriage to their husbands by their parents. If your culture does not use different expressions like that, you could use a single term here. Alternate translation: “they do not get married”
12:25	asw4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀλλ’ εἰσὶν ὡς ἄγγελοι ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς	1	Jesus assumes that his listeners will know that angels do not marry. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “because they will be like the angels, who do not marry”
12:25	pi8l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	ἀλλ’	1	What follows the word **but** here is in contrast to what is currently the case on earth. Jesus is using this contrast to show the Sadducees that the were mistaken to think that the existence of men and women in heaven would follow the same pattern or order of things as had their former lives on earth. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a contrast. Alternate translation: “but rather”
12:26	mffe		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	τῶν νεκρῶν	1	Jesus is using the adjective **dead** as a noun in order to indicate a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this with an equivalent expression. See how you translated the phrase **the dead** in [12:25](../12/25.md). Alternate translation: “people who have died”
12:26	z36n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τῶν νεκρῶν, ὅτι ἐγείρονται	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who does the action. Alternate translation: “the matter of God bringing back to life people who have died”
12:26	eod4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	οὐκ ἀνέγνωτε ἐν τῇ βίβλῳ Μωϋσέως	1	Jesus is not asking for information, but is using the question form here for emphasis in order to rebuke the Sadducees for not correctly understanding the Scriptures. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “you have surely read in the book of Moses”
12:26	jc5a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τῇ βίβλῳ Μωϋσέως	1	Here, Jesus is using the possessive form to describe **the book** that **Moses** wrote, the Pentateuch. Jesus is not using the possessive form to indicate a book that Moses owned. If this is not clear in your language, you could clarify this in your translation, as modeled by the UST.
12:26	w2lj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐπὶ τοῦ βάτου	1	Jesus assumes that his listeners will know that he means the **bush** in the desert that was burning without being consumed, the place at which Moses first encountered God. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “at the burning bush”
12:26	y35v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-verbs	λέγων	1	In many languages, it is conventional to use the present tense to describe what a writer does within a composition. However, if that would not be natural in your language, you could use the past tense here. Alternate translation: “and he called out”
12:26	re82		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὁ Θεὸς Ἀβραὰμ, καὶ ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσαὰκ, καὶ ὁ Θεὸς Ἰακώβ	1	The implication is that God would not have identified himself as the God of these men if they were not alive. This must mean that God brought them back to life after they died. If it would be helpful in your language, you could indicate that explicitly, as UST does.
12:27	dgc9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	νεκρῶν	1	Jesus is using the adjective **dead** as a noun in order to indicate a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way.

12:27	v7ui		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	πολὺ πλανᾶσθε	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “You misunderstand”
12:28	zqy4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	καὶ & εἷς τῶν γραμματέων	1	Mark uses the statement **And one of the scribes** to introduce this new character into the story. Use the natural form in your language for introducing a new character. The expression “one of the scribes” identifies him as a teacher who had carefully studied the law of Moses. Since he is a new participant, if it would be helpful in your language, you could refer to him as something like “A man who taught the Jewish laws,” as the UST does.
12:28	b3yh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἰδὼν	1	Here, Mark is using the word **seen** to mean “observed” or “knew.” He is describing something a person would perceive with their mind by association with their eyes.

12:28	q1u5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ποία ἐστὶν ἐντολὴ πρώτη πάντων	1	Here, the scribe is using the word **first** to mean “most important.” If your readers would not understand the use of **first** in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture or state the meaning using plain language, as the UST does.
12:28	kftz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal	ποία ἐστὶν ἐντολὴ πρώτη πάντων	1	If your language does not use ordinal numbers such as **first**, you can express the meaning behind the word **first** in a way that would be natural in your language.

12:29	euim		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	πρώτη	1	Jesus is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete.

12:29	n74y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	πρώτη	1	If your language does not use ordinal numbers such as **first**, you can express the meaning behind the word **first** in a way that would be natural in your language.

12:29	mq92		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	Ἰσραήλ	1	Jesus is citing a scripture from Deuteronomy in which God addresses all of the people of Israel by the name of their ancestor, **Israel**. Alternate translation: “O Israelites” or “descendants of Israel”
12:29	mmtb			Κύριος εἷς ἐστιν	1	The phrase **the Lord our God, the Lord is one** could be: (1) an affirmation of the exclusiveness of the Lord as Israel’s God for the purpose of reminding Israel that the Lord was to be the only God they should worship. Alternate translation: “the Lord alone is our God” (2) an affirmation of the uniqueness of the Lord. Alternate translation: “the Lord our God, the Lord is special”
12:30	thj7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative	ἀγαπήσεις	1	Here, Jesus is quoting a scripture in which a future statement is used to give an instruction. If it would be helpful in your language, you can use a more natural form for instruction.

If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “with the entirety of your being” or “completely, with your entire person”
12:30	q49v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐξ ὅλης τῆς καρδίας σου	1	Here, the **heart** represents the desires and motives. Alternate translation: “with all your desires” or “zealously”

12:30	x3n5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ψυχῆς	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **soul**, you can express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “essence” or “being”

12:31	eu8b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	δευτέρα αὕτη	1	Jesus is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete. If it would be helpful in your language, you could supply these words from the context. Alternate translation: “The second commandment is this”
12:31	fz8g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	δευτέρα	1	Here, Jesus is using the word **second** to mean “second most important.” If your readers would not understand the use of **second** in this context, you could use an equivalent expression from your culture or state the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “The second most important commandment”

12:34	b144		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	οὐ μακρὰν εἶ ἀπὸ τῆς Βασιλείας τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a positive expression to translate this double negative that consists of the negative particle **not** and the negative adverb **far**. Alternate translation: “You are very close to the kingdom of God”
12:34	is4c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	οὐ μακρὰν εἶ ἀπὸ τῆς Βασιλείας τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Here, Jesus speaks of the man being almost ready to submit to God as being physically close to **the kingdom of God**. Jesus is speaking of **the kingdom of God** as if it were a physical place. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “You are close to submitting to God as king”
12:34	lfti		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	Βασιλείας τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **kingdom**, you can express the same idea in another way, as the UST does.
12:34	rgh8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	οὐδεὶς οὐκέτι ἐτόλμα	1	If this double negative would be misunderstood in your language, you could translate it as a positive statement. Alternate translation: “everyone was afraid”
12:35	ptc8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	ἱερῷ	1	See how you translated the word **temple** in [11:11](../11/11.md), where it is used with the same meaning.
12:35	q6e4			πῶς λέγουσιν οἱ γραμματεῖς ὅτι ὁ Χριστὸς, υἱὸς Δαυείδ ἐστιν?	1	This is not a rhetorical question. Rather, Jesus’ listeners had asked him some difficult questions, and they had admitted that he answered them well. Now, in return, he is asking them a difficult question. None of them will be able to answer it, and this will demonstrate his wisdom even further. His question actually will teach something to those who are able to recognize its implications. But it would be appropriate to leave it in question form and not translate it as a statement.
12:35	i6a4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	υἱὸς Δαυείδ	1	Here, Jesus is using the term **son** to mean “descendant.” If your readers would not understand what **son** means in this context, you could express its meaning using plain language. Alternate translation: “a descendant of David”
12:36	e1zq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns	αὐτὸς Δαυεὶδ	1	Jesus uses the word **himself** here to emphasize that it was David, the very person whom the scribes call the father of the Christ, who spoke the words in the quotation that follows. Use a natural way in your language to indicate this emphasis. Alternate translation: “None other than David” or “David, the very person whom you call the father of the Christ”
12:36	jlbd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	εἶπεν ἐν τῷ Πνεύματι τῷ ἁγίῳ, εἶπεν ὁ Κύριος τῷ Κυρίῳ μου, κάθου ἐκ δεξιῶν μου, ἕως ἂν θῶ τοὺς ἐχθρούς σου ὑποκάτω τῶν ποδῶν σου	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation and then another quotation within that one. Alternate translation: “said, by inspiration of the Holy Spirit, that the Lord told his Lord to sit at his right side until he put his enemies under his feet”
12:36	ejy2			ἐν τῷ Πνεύματι τῷ ἁγίῳ	1	Alternate translation: “inspired by the Holy Spirit” or “by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit”
12:36	dv7b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	εἶπεν ὁ Κύριος τῷ Κυρίῳ μου	1	Here, the term **Lord** does not refer to the same person in both instances. The first instance is representing the name Yahweh, which David actually uses in this psalm. In order to honor the commandment not to misuse God’s name, Jewish people often avoided saying that name and said Lord instead. The second instance is the regular term for “lord” or “master.” The ULT and UST capitalize the word because it refers to the Messiah. Alternate translation: “The Lord God said to my Lord” or “God said to my Lord”
12:36	v53p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	κάθου ἐκ δεξιῶν μου	1	The seat at the right side of a ruler was a position of great honor and authority. By telling the Messiah to sit there, God was symbolically conferring honor and authority on him. Alternate translation: “Sit in the place of honor beside me”
12:36	k2j1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	κάθου ἐκ δεξιῶν μου	1	In this quotation, Yahweh is using the adjective **right** as a noun in order to indicate his right side. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could state that specifically. Alternate translation: “Sit at my right side”
12:36	rfy9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	ἕως ἂν θῶ τοὺς ἐχθρούς σου ὑποκάτω τῶν ποδῶν σου	1	Placing an enemy under one’s feet represents conquering them and making them submit. Here, it means that Yahweh would make His enemies stop resisting the Messiah and force them to submit to him. Alternate translation: “until I conquer your enemies for you”
12:37	j7wn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	αὐτὸς Δαυεὶδ λέγει αὐτὸν, Κύριον	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “David himself calls the Messiah his Lord”
12:37	ka5u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	λέγει αὐτὸν	1	Here, the word **him** refers to the Messiah. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express that explicitly, as the UST does.
12:37	ssq3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns	αὐτὸς Δαυεὶδ	1	See how you translated the word **himself** in [12:36](../12/36.md), where it is used with the same meaning. Alternate translation: “None other than David” or “David, the very person” or “David, whom we all respect”
12:37	qpdy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	αὐτὸς Δαυεὶδ λέγει αὐτὸν, Κύριον, καὶ πόθεν υἱός αὐτοῦ ἐστιν?	1	In this culture, an ancestor was more respected than a descendant. But to call someone **Lord** was to address that person as the more respected one. As the General Notes to this chapter describe, this is a paradox. That is, it is a statement that describes two things that seem as if they cannot both be true at the same time but which actually are both true. Jesus is calling attention to this paradox to get his listeners to think more deeply about who the Messiah is. If it would be helpful in your language, you could indicate explicitly what makes this a paradox. Alternate translation: “David respectfully addresses the Messiah as his Lord, but David should be more respected than his descendant. So why does David address him that way?”
12:37	rh2t			καὶ πόθεν υἱός αὐτοῦ ἐστιν	1	Like the question in [12:35](../12/35.md), this seems to be a question that Jesus wanted his listeners to try to answer, even though he is also using it to teach. It is a difficult question, like the ones they asked him, which he answered well. They will not be able to answer his question, and this should give them a further appreciation for his wisdom, in addition to what they might learn from reflecting on the question later. So it would be appropriate to leave it in question form and not translate it as a statement. Alternate translation: “So why do people say that the Messiah is David’s descendant”
12:37	qucc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ	1	Jesus is using the word **and** to show that a conclusion should be made as a result of what he has just said, and that this conclusion would be different from what his listeners had previously believed. Use a natural form in your language for showing this. Alternate translation: “so”
12:37	tjp6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	υἱός	1	Jesus is using the term **son** to mean “descendant,” as he did in [12:35](../12/35.md). See how you translated the term **son** there. Alternate translation: “descendant”
12:38	bh8w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential	καὶ	1	Mark uses the word **And** to indicate that Jesus is still sitting in the temple area taking to the people, as he was in the previous verse. Alternate translation: “Then”
12:38	rwxq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	βλέπετε	1	In the original language in which Mark wrote this Gospel, the phrase **Watch out** is a command or instruction written in the plural form. Use the most natural form in your language to give direction to a group of people. Alternate translation: “All of you watch out for” or “Every one of you watch out for”
12:38	yhfv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	βλέπετε ἀπὸ τῶν γραμματέων	1	Jesus says **Watch out** to warn about the influence of certain people. He is not saying that the scribes themselves are physically dangerous, but that it would be dangerous spiritually to follow their example. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “Be careful not to follow the example of the scribes”
12:38	nxy9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	τῶν θελόντων ἐν στολαῖς περιπατεῖν	1	In this culture, **long robes** were a symbol of wealth and status. To walk around in public in **long robes** was to assert one’s right to high status. If it would be helpful in your language, you could indicate this explicitly. Alternate translation: “who like to walk around looking important in their long robes”
12:38	mu5a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀσπασμοὺς	1	The implication is that these would be respectful **greetings** in which the scribes would be addressed by important titles. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “respectful greetings”
12:39	mwmf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	πρωτοκαθεδρίας & πρωτοκλισίας	1	Both uses of the word **first** here mean “best.” Alternate translation: “the best seats … the best places”
12:40	jtw4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	οἱ κατεσθίοντες τὰς οἰκίας τῶν χηρῶν	1	Jesus speaks of the **houses** of widows to mean their wealth and possessions, which they would have in their houses. If it would be helpful in your language, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “They defraud widows of everything they own”
12:40	j27b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	οἱ κατεσθίοντες τὰς οἰκίας τῶν χηρῶν	1	Jesus says that the scribes are **devouring** or eating up the possessions of widows. He means that they continually ask the widows for money until the widows have none left. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or use plain language to express the meaning. Alternate translation: “They defraud widows of everything they own”
12:40	r3ht			καὶ προφάσει μακρὰ προσευχόμενοι	1	Here, **pretext** refers to something that someone would do in order to appear a certain way. Alternate translation: “in order to seem godly, they are offering long prayers”
12:40	qm52		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	οὗτοι λήμψονται περισσότερον κρίμα	1	Jesus is using the word **condemnation** to mean the punishment that a person would receive after being condemned (found guilty) for doing something wrong. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or use plain language to express the meaning. Alternate translation: “These scribes will receive greater punishment”
12:40	h36x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οὗτοι λήμψονται περισσότερον κρίμα	1	The implication seems to be that these proud and greedy scribes will receive **greater** punishment than they would have if they had not pretended to be so godly. It is also implicit that God will be the one who punishes them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use plain language to express the meaning. Alternate translation: “God will punish these scribes more severely because they do all these wrong things while pretending to be godly”
12:41	r69x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	καὶ	1	# Connecting Statement:\n\nMark uses the word **And** to introduce background information that will help his readers understand what happens next in the story. Alternate translation: “Now”
12:41	nohd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	καθίσας κατέναντι τοῦ γαζοφυλακίου, ἐθεώρει πῶς ὁ ὄχλος βάλλει χαλκὸν εἰς τὸ γαζοφυλάκιον; καὶ πολλοὶ πλούσιοι ἔβαλλον πολλά	1	This background information introduces a new event in the story. Alternate translation: “after Jesus sat down he was watching the crowd put money into the offering box and noticing that there were many rich people who were placing gifts of money in the offering boxes”
12:41	p2kp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τοῦ γαζοφυλακίου & τὸ γαζοφυλάκιον	1	Mark is speaking of the boxes in the temple courtyard where people put money that they were giving to God. He associates the boxes with **the treasury**, the name of the place where this money would be kept until it was needed. Alternate translation: “the offering boxes … the offering boxes”
12:41	w4xc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	ὁ ὄχλος	1	The word **crowd** is a singular noun that refers to a group of people. If your language does not use singular nouns in that way, you can use a different expression such as “many people,” as modeled by the UST.
12:41	jgkw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	πλούσιοι	1	Mark is using the adjective **rich** as a noun in order to indicate a type of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this with an equivalent expression such as “rich people,” as the UST does. Alternate translation: “wealthy people”
12:41	rl1l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	πολλά	1	Mark is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete. If it would be helpful in your language, you could supply these words from the context. Alternate translation: “much money”
12:42	g6ry		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney	λεπτὰ δύο, ὅ ἐστιν κοδράντης	1	The word **lepta** is the plural of “lepton.” A lepton was a small bronze or copper coin used by the Jews. It was equivalent to a few minutes’ wages. It was the least valuable coin that people used in this culture. You could try to express this amount in terms of current monetary values, but that might cause your Bible translation to become outdated and inaccurate, since those values can change over time. So instead, you might use the name of the least valuable coin in your culture, or use a general expression. Alternate translation: “two pennies” or “two small coins of little value”
12:42	n29e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney	ὅ ἐστιν κοδράντης	1	A **quadrans** was the smallest Roman coin. Mark is seeking to help his readers, who are Roman, understand the value of **two leptas** in their own currency. You could clarify in your translation that a **quadrans** is a Roman coin, as the UST does, or you can leave this information untranslated.
12:43-44	ipl1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge		0	# General Information:\n\nIn verse 43 Jesus says that the widow put more money in the offering than the rich people put in, and in verse 44 he gives his reason for saying that. If your language would put the reason before the result, you could create a verse bridge by moving this verse to the end of the following verse. You would then present the combined verses as 43–44, as the UST does.
12:43	q124			ἀμὴν, λέγω ὑμῖν	1	See how you translated the statement **Truly I say to you** in [3:28](../03/28.md).
12:43	ih0m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἡ χήρα αὕτη ἡ πτωχὴ	1	Even though it is not literally true that the widow has put more money into the offering box than all the rich people, this is still not figurative language. As Jesus explains in the next verse, he means that she has put in proportionately more than all the others, relative to her means, and that is literally true. But Jesus makes the seemingly untrue statement first, using it to get his disciples to reflect on how it can be true. So it would be appropriate to translate Jesus’ words directly and not interpret them as if they were figurative. For example, it would be a figurative interpretation to say, “God considers what this poor widow has given to be more valuable than the gifts of all the others”
12:43	n8z5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πάντων & τῶν βαλλόντων	1	In context, **all** means specifically all of the rich people who were putting large monetary gifts in the collection boxes. Alternate translation: “all of those rich people putting”

12:44	c7jj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	Here, the word **For** introduces the reason for what Jesus said in [12:43](../12/43.md). Use a natural way in your language for introducing a contrast. Alternate translation: “Because”
12:44	ihuq			ἐκ τοῦ περισσεύοντος αὐτοῖς ἔβαλον	1	Alternate translation: “had a lot of money but only gave a small portion of it”
12:44	ui9a			αὕτη δὲ, ἐκ τῆς ὑστερήσεως αὐτῆς, πάντα ὅσα εἶχεν ἔβαλεν, ὅλον τὸν βίον αὐτῆς	1	Alternate translation: “but she who had only had a very little money gave everything she had to live on”
12:44	l4tp			τῆς ὑστερήσεως αὐτῆς	1	Alternate translation: “her lack” or “the little she had”
12:44	p3as			ὅλον τὸν βίον αὐτῆς	1	Alternate translation: “all she had to survive on”
13:intro	ti7d				0	# Mark 13 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 13:24–25, which are words from the Old Testament.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### The return of Christ\n\nJesus said much about what would happen before he returned ([Mark 13:6–37](./06.md)). He told his followers that bad things would happen to the world and bad things would happen to them before he returned, but they needed to be ready for him to return at any time.

13:1	ql81		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ποταποὶ λίθοι καὶ ποταπαὶ οἰκοδομαί	1	Here, **stones** refers to the very large stones with which the temple walls were built. If it would be helpful in your language, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “How wonderful these huge stones are and how wonderful these buildings are”
13:2	rez6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	βλέπεις ταύτας τὰς μεγάλας οἰκοδομάς?	1	Jesus is not asking for information, but is using the question form here to draw attention to the buildings and to emphasize what he is about to say. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “Look at these great buildings!”
13:2	xdhj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	οὐ μὴ ἀφεθῇ ὧδε λίθος ἐπὶ λίθον, ὃς οὐ μὴ καταλυθῇ	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who will do the action.

If it would be helpful in your language, you could say explicitly what the phrase **these things** refers to, as the UST models.
13:4	lw1n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ὅταν μέλλῃ ταῦτα συντελεῖσθαι πάντα	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Jesus implies that “God” will do it. Alternate translation: “when God is about to complete all these things”
13:5	fe42		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	λέγειν αὐτοῖς	1	The pronoun **them** refers to Peter, James, John, and Andrew, who are mentioned in [13:3](../13/03.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could clarify this in a way that would be natural in your language. Alternate translation: “to say to these four disciples”
13:5	qekc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	βλέπετε	1	In the original language in which Mark wrote this Gospel, the phrase **Be careful** is a command or instruction written in the plural form. Use the most natural form in your language to give direction to a group of people. Alternate translation: “All of you be careful that”
13:6	z63u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματί μου	1	Here Jesus uses the word **name** to mean identity and the authority that comes with the identity. The people he is talking about will likely not say that their name is Jesus, but they will claim to be the Messiah. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “claiming to be me”
13:6	cee7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	πολλοὶ ἐλεύσονται ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματί μου λέγοντες, ὅτι ἐγώ εἰμι	1	If the direct quotation inside a direct quotation would be confusing in your language, you could translate the second direct quotation as an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: “Many will come in my name claiming to be me”
13:6	pbz4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πολλοὶ & πολλοὺς	1	Here both uses of the word **Many** refer to “many people.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could say that explicitly, as the UST does.
13:6	wv12		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐγώ εἰμι	1	The implication is that **he** means the Messiah. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “I am the Messiah”
13:7	fl5h			πολέμους καὶ ἀκοὰς πολέμων	1	The phrase **wars and rumors of wars** could mean: (1) reports of wars that are currently happening and reports of wars that might happen in the future. (2) reports of wars that are already taking place near by and reports of wars that are happening in distant places. Alternate translation: “reports of wars that are close by and of wars that are far away”
13:7	d1k9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ἀλλ’ οὔπω τὸ τέλος	1	Jesus is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete.

13:7	mi4d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὸ τέλος	1	Here, **the end** implicitly means “the end of the world.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could express that explicitly, as the UST models.
13:8	ydrb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	ἐγερθήσεται & ἔθνος ἐπ’ ἔθνος, καὶ βασιλεία ἐπὶ βασιλείαν	1	These two phrases mean basically the same thing. Jesus is likely using repetition for emphasis. If it would be helpful in your language, you could combine these two phrases into one phrase. Alternate translation: “Different groups of people will attack each other”
13:8	rlxf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	ἐγερθήσεται & ἔθνος ἐπ’ ἔθνος	1	The word **nation** represents nations in general, not one particular nation. Alternate translation: “The people of some nations will attack the people of other nations”
13:8	oyrd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐγερθήσεται & ἔθνος ἐπ’ ἔθνος	1	The term **nation** refers to the people of one nationality or ethnic group. Alternate translation: “The people of some nations will attack the people of other nations”

13:8	dz8g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἀρχὴ ὠδίνων ταῦτα	1	Jesus uses the metaphor of **birth pains** because, in the same way that the pain of childbirth is eventually replaced by joy when the child is born, so the suffering that is experienced by true believers will eventually be replaced by joy when Christ returns. Because childbirth occurs in all cultures, you should retain this metaphor in your translation. Alternate translation: “These events will be like the first pains a woman suffers when she is about to bear a child” or “These events will be like the first pains a woman suffers when she is about to give birth to a child”
13:9	nuti		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	βλέπετε & ἑαυτούς	1	Jesus uses a word for seeing to indicate the need for paying attention or being ready.

13:9	mbr5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	παραδώσουσιν ὑμᾶς	1	The pronoun **They** refers to people in general who will persecute Jesus’ followers. If this might confuse your readers, you could say the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “People will deliver you”

He is speaking in general terms and is not saying that “all” brothers or fathers or children will do this.

13:12	m6iq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	παραδώσει ἀδελφὸς ἀδελφὸν	1	Although the term **brother** is masculine, Jesus is using the word here in a generic sense that includes both men and women.

13:12	hrhw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	πατὴρ τέκνον	1	Although the term **father** is masculine, Jesus is probably using the word here in a generic sense that includes both fathers and mothers. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “parents, their children” or “fathers and mothers will deliver their children to the authorities to be killed”
13:12	vjcw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐπαναστήσονται τέκνα ἐπὶ γονεῖς καὶ θανατώσουσιν αὐτούς	1	Here, **children will rise up against parents and put them to death** probably does not mean that children will directly murder their parents. Rather, this probably means that children will deliver their parents to people in positions of authority and then these people will have their parents killed. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express that explicitly, as modeled by the UST.
13:12	r66s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	ἐπαναστήσονται τέκνα ἐπὶ γονεῖς	1	Here, **rise up** means to stand up.

13:13	jhp6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	διὰ τὸ ὄνομά μου	1	Here, **name** is a way of referring to a person by reference to something associated with that person, their name. Jesus is using the phrase **my name** to refer to himself. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “because of me”

This meaning means that believers must endure and keep on enduring until the time when Christ returns. Alternate translation: “who keeps on enduring to the very end” (3) to the end of that time of hardship and persecution. Alternate translation: “who endures until the time of testing is over”
13:14	d4nw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὸ βδέλυγμα τῆς ἐρημώσεως	1	The phrase **the abomination of desolation** is from the book of Daniel. Jesus’ audience would have been familiar with this passage and the prophecy about **the abomination** entering the temple and defiling it. If it would be helpful in your language, you could indicate the meaning explicitly, as modeled by the UST. Alternate translation: “the shameful thing that defiles the temple”

13:14	ck7a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks	ὁ ἀναγινώσκων νοείτω	1	The phrase **let the one reading understand** is not Jesus speaking. Mark added this to get the readers’ attention so that they would pay attention to this warning. If it would be helpful in your language, you could show that this is not part of Jesus’ direct speech by putting brackets around this phrase, as the UST and ULT do, or you could show your readers in some other way that is natural in your language.
13:15	m1hq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὁ & ἐπὶ τοῦ δώματος, μὴ καταβάτω, μηδὲ εἰσελθάτω ἆραί τι ἐκ τῆς οἰκίας αὐτοῦ	1	Where Jesus lived, the tops of houses were flat. People would eat and do other activities on top of their houses. Jesus assumes that his hearers know this and that they know that the roofs were accessed by an exterior staircase at the back of the house, distant from the entry at the front. If it would be helpful in your language, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “the person who is on top of their roof should escape immediately and not enter their house to get anything”
13:16	y1e9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ὁ εἰς τὸν ἀγρὸν, μὴ ἐπιστρεψάτω εἰς τὰ ὀπίσω	1	The word **cloak** refers to an outer garment.

You would then present the combined verses as 18–19.
13:18	w91r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	χειμῶνος	1	In the location to which Jesus is referring, **winter** is the time of year when it is cold, and travel is difficult.

13:20	q8hm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οὐκ ἂν ἐσώθη πᾶσα σάρξ	1	Here, the phrase **be saved** refers to being saved from physical death. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express that explicitly. Alternate translation: “everyone would die” or “no one would survive”
13:20	fz5f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	τοὺς ἐκλεκτοὺς, οὓς ἐξελέξατο	1	These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The repetition is used for emphasis. If your language does not use repetition to do this, you can use one phrase to express the idea and provide emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “the people whom he chose”
13:20	af7n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	τοὺς ἐκλεκτοὺς	1	Jesus is using the adjective **elect** as a noun in order to describe a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this with a noun phrase as modeled by the UST.
13:21-22	d9gr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge		0	# General Information:\n\nIn verse 21 Jesus gives a command, and in verse 22 he gives the reason for the command. If your language would put the reason before the result, you could create a verse bridge by moving this verse to the end of the following verse.

13:21	yfd3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ἴδε, ἐκεῖ	1	Jesus is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete.

The word **after** does not express how long it will be before the events of [13:24–27](../013/24.md) take place so you should choose a word or phrase in your language that communicates the sequential meaning of the word **after** but does not limit the time frame.

The term **glory** describes what kind of **power** Jesus will have. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning with an equivalent phrase.

14:intro	uk36				0	# Mark 14 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 14:27, 62, which are words from the Old Testament.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### The meaning of the “body” and “blood” of Jesus\n\n[Mark 14:22–25](./22.md) describes Jesus’ last meal with his followers. During this meal, Jesus said of the bread, “This is my body,” and of the wine, “This is my blood of the covenant, which is being poured out for many.” As Jesus instructed, Christian churches around the world re-enact this meal regularly, calling it “the Lord’s Supper,” the “Eucharist”, or “Holy Communion.” But they have different understandings of what Jesus meant by these sayings. Some churches believe that Jesus was speaking and that he meant that the bread and wine represented his body and blood. Other churches believe that he was speaking literally and that the actual body and blood of Jesus are really present in the bread and wine of this ceremony. Translators should be careful not to let how they understand this issue affect how they translate this passage.\n\n### The new covenant\n\nSome people think that Jesus established the new covenant during the supper. Others think he established it after he went up to heaven. Others think it will not be established until Jesus comes again. Your translation should say no more about this than ULT does. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/covenant]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Abba, Father\n\n“Abba” is an Aramaic word that the Jews used to speak to their fathers. Mark writes it as it sounds and then translates it.

14:25	y1pf			αὐτὸ πίνω καινὸν, ἐν τῇ Βασιλείᾳ τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	The word **new** could be referring to: (1) Jesus, and therefore would mean “again” or “in a new way.” See the parallel account in [Luke 22:18](../luk/022/18.md) where Jesus seems to mean this. Alternate translation: “I drink it in a new way in the kingdom of God” or “I drink it anew in the kingdom of God” or “I drink it again when I celebrate the Passover after it is fulfilled when God’s kingdom is consummated” (2) the wine and thus would be referring to drinking a new type or quality of wine. Alternate translation: “I drink new wine”
14:25	ue3j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐν τῇ Βασιλείᾳ τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	See how you decided to translate the phrase **the kingdom of God** in [1:15](../01/15.md). If it would be helpful in your language to understand the abstract noun **kingdom**, you could express the idea behind it with a verb such as “rule” as modeled by the UST.
14:26	l996		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ὑμνήσαντες	1	A **hymn** is a song or poem that is sung to praise God. The Jews would traditionally sing a psalm from Psalms 113–118 at the end of the Passover meal, so the **hymn** that Jesus and his disciples sang was likely one of these psalms. If your readers would not be familiar with a **hymn**, you could use the name for religious songs in your culture, if you have them, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “having sung a psalm” or “having sung a song of praise to God”
14:27	pu4s			λέγει αὐτοῖς ὁ Ἰησοῦς	1	Alternate translation: “Jesus said to his disciples”
14:27	lty4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	πάντες σκανδαλισθήσεσθε	1	Here Jesus speaks as if his disciples were going to **stumble**. He means that they will reject and desert him because of what will happen to him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “You all will desert me” or “You all will run away from me”
14:27	gkb5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	γέγραπται	1	Here, Mark uses **it is written** to introduce a quotation from an Old Testament passage of Scripture, ([Zechariah 13:7](../zec/13/07.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase that indicates that Mark is quoting from an important text. Alternate translation: “it is written in God’s Word” or “it is written by Zechariah the prophet”
14:27	jp51		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	γέγραπται	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can express the idea in active form, as modeled by the UST, or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Jesus implies that “Zechariah” did it. Alternate translation: “regarding what would happen to the Messiah and his followers, Zechariah wrote”
14:27	qzzv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	ὅτι γέγραπται, πατάξω τὸν ποιμένα καὶ τὰ πρόβατα διασκορπισθήσονται	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “because Zechariah the prophet wrote that God would strike the shepherd and the sheep would be scattered” or “because Zechariah the prophet predicted in the Scriptures that God would strike the shepherd and the sheep would be scattered”
14:27	cv7z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	πατάξω τὸν ποιμένα καὶ τὰ πρόβατα διασκορπισθήσονται	1	Jesus is quoting a prophecy from ([Zechariah 13:7](../zec/13/07.md)) in which the prophet Zechariah speaks of the Messiah as if he were a **shepherd** and of the Messiah’s followers as if they were **sheep**. Since this is a quotation from Scripture, translate the words directly rather than providing an explanation of them, even if your language does not customarily use such figures of speech. If you want to explain the meaning of the metaphor, we recommend that you do that in a footnote rather than in the Bible text.
14:27	w2az		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τὰ πρόβατα διασκορπισθήσονται	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can express the idea behind the phrase **the sheep will be scattered** in another way that is natural in your language. The phrase **the sheep will be scattered** does not necessarily imply that there is someone making the action of scattering happen, so try to translate this phrase in a way that simply shows that **the sheep will be scattered** without saying who will make the action happen. Alternate translation: “the sheep will run away in different directions”
14:28	dm1q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐγερθῆναί με	1	The phrase **raised up** means to having become alive again after having died. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express that explicitly. Alternate translation: “I am made alive again”
14:28	qi4g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τὸ ἐγερθῆναί με	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Jesus implies that God will do it. Alternate translation: “God raises me from the dead”
14:29	op1t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πάντες	1	By using the word **all** in this context, the implication is that **Peter** is referring to “all the other disciples.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could express that explicitly. Alternate translation: “all the other disciples”
14:29	j961		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	σκανδαλισθήσονται	1	See how you translated the phrase **will be caused to stumble** in [14:27](../14/27.md). Alternate translation: “leave you”
14:29	div5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	οὐκ ἐγώ	1	In the phrase **not I**, Peter is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete. If it would be helpful in your language, you could supply these words from the context. Alternate translation: “I will not fall away” or “I will not forsake you”
14:30	z2q9			ἀμὴν, λέγω σοι	1	See how you translated the statement **Truly I say to you** in [3:28](../03/28.md).

14:31	z9le		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὡσαύτως & καὶ πάντες ἔλεγον	1	The phrase **they all also were speaking in the same manner** means that all of the disciples were saying the same thing that Peter said. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express that explicitly, as modeled by the UST.
14:32	deg7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἔρχονται	1	The pronoun **they** refers to Jesus and his disciples. If this might confuse your readers, you could say the meaning explicitly, as modeled by the UST.
14:32	ni66		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	ἔρχονται	1	# Connecting Statement:\n\nYour language may say “went” rather than **come** or “came” in contexts such as this. Use whichever is more natural. Alternate translation: “they went” or “they go”
14:34	eyw3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	ἐστιν ἡ ψυχή μου	1	By using the phrase **My soul**, Jesus is speaking of his entire self by referring to one part of himself, his **soul**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your culture or use plain language, as modeled by the UST.
14:34	krj1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ψυχή μου	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **soul**, you can express the same idea in another way, as modeled by the UST.
14:34	ic1g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	ἕως θανάτου	1	Jesus is using the phrase **to death** to describe the extent of his grief. Jesus is exaggerating in order to show the depth of the distress and sorrow that he feels. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your language that expresses great sorrow, or you could turn the phrase **to death** into a simile, as modeled by the UST. Alternate translation: “and I have so much grief that it makes me feel like I am near death”
14:35	nk8l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	εἰ δυνατόν ἐστιν	1	Alternate translation: “if possible”
14:35	wc6d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	παρέλθῃ & ἡ ὥρα	1	Jesus is using the term **hour** to refer to a specific time at which an event or events would take place. Here, the phrase **the hour** refers specifically to the time of Jesus’ suffering. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning in plain language, as the UST models.
14:35	gj74		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	παρέλθῃ ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ ἡ ὥρα	1	Here, Jesus is referring to the events that would take place during the upcoming hours as if they were the **hour** itself. Because Jesus is associating the upcoming events with the time of the events themselves, by asking that **the hour might pass**, Jesus is actually asking that the events themselves would not happen. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or use plain language. Alternate translation: “the upcoming events would pass from him” or “he would not have to experience the upcoming things which he knew he was going to have to suffer”
14:36	c11w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate	Ἀββά	1	The word **Abba** is an Aramaic word meaning **Father** and which the Jews used to address their fathers. Mark writes it as it sounds in Aramaic (he transliterates it) and then translates its meaning into Greek for his readers, who did not know Aramaic. Since the Aramaic word **Abba** is followed by the Greek word **Father**, it is best to transliterate **Abba** and then give its meaning in your language as Mark does.
14:36	t9r2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	ὁ Πατήρ	1	The word **Father** is an important title for God.
14:36	jk6a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	παρένεγκε τὸ ποτήριον τοῦτο ἀπ’ ἐμοῦ	1	Jesus is referring to the sufferings he will soon experience as if they were a **cup** of bitter-tasting liquid that he would have to drink. If your readers would not understand what **cup** means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Please spare me from these sufferings”
14:36	s1r5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	παρένεγκε τὸ ποτήριον τοῦτο ἀπ’ ἐμοῦ	1	The statement **Remove this cup from me** is an imperative, but it should be translated as a request rather than as a command. It may be helpful to add an expression such as “please” to make this clear. Alternate translation: “Please spare me from these sufferings”
14:37	ja6d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	εὑρίσκει αὐτοὺς καθεύδοντας	1	The pronoun **them** refers to Peter, James, and John. If it would be helpful in your language, you could indicate that in a way that would be natural in your language. Alternate translation: “finds the three disciples sleeping”
14:37	kp33		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	Σίμων, καθεύδεις? οὐκ ἴσχυσας μίαν ὥραν γρηγορῆσαι?	1	Jesus is not asking for information, but is using the question form here to rebuke **Peter** for falling asleep. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate Jesus’ words as a statement, as modeled by the UST.
14:38	hi36		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	προσεύχεσθε, ἵνα μὴ ἔλθητε εἰς πειρασμόν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **temptation**, you can express the idea behind it with a verb such as “tempt.” Alternate translation: “pray, so that nothing will tempt you to sin”
14:38	zrp4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	προσεύχεσθε, ἵνα μὴ ἔλθητε εἰς πειρασμόν	1	The implications are that the disciples will soon experience the **temptation** to abandon Jesus in order to save themselves. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “pray that when the Jewish leaders come to arrest me and you are tempted to try to save yourselves by running away or denying that you know me, you will not sin by doing that”
14:38	c1je		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τὸ & πνεῦμα	1	Jesus is describing the inner part of a person (which includes their desires and will) by association with their **spirit**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your culture or use plain language. See how you translated **spirit** in [2:8](../02/08.md), where **spirit** is used with a similar meaning. Alternate translation: “The inner self” or “The inner person”
14:38	djxc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τὸ & πνεῦμα	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **spirit**, you can express the same idea in another way, as modeled by the UST.
14:38	gt2n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	πρόθυμον	1	Jesus is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete. If it would be helpful in your language, you could supply these words from the context. Alternate translation: “is willing to do what is right” or “is willing to do what pleases God” or “is willing to obey me”
14:38	b909			ἡ & σὰρξ ἀσθενής	1	Here, the word **flesh** could: (1) include the meaning of both option 2 and option 3 and therefore **flesh** would refer to both the weakness of the human body and also to the deficiency of human desire and ability to do what is right. Alternate translation: “the body and your spiritual strength is weak” (2) refer to the human “body.” Alternate translation: “the body is weak” (3) refer to the sinful part of human nature that prefers to seek comfort and seek what it desires rather than obey God and do the things that please him. Alternate translation: “the sinful human nature is weak”
14:39	l9nj			τὸν αὐτὸν λόγον εἰπών	1	Alternate translation: “and said the same thing he had prayed the first time”
14:40	zkb2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	εὗρεν αὐτοὺς καθεύδοντας, ἦσαν γὰρ αὐτῶν οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ καταβαρυνόμενοι	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “because the three disciples’ eyes were weighed down, he found them sleeping”
14:40	bgyj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	αὐτοὺς	1	Here, the pronoun **them** refers to Peter, James, and John. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning in a way that would make that clear in your language. Alternate translation: “the three disciples”
14:40	vwlx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1	Here, the word **for** indicates that what follows is the reason that Jesus found the disciples sleeping. Use a natural way in your language to show this connection. Alternate translation: “because”

14:41	x7qd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal	ἔρχεται τὸ τρίτον	1	If your language does not use ordinal numbers, you can translate the phrase **the third time** in a way that would be natural in your language. Alternate translation: “he comes yet again”

14:41	lw7w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	καθεύδετε τὸ λοιπὸν καὶ ἀναπαύεσθε	1	Jesus is not asking for information, but is using the question form here to rebuke his disciples for falling asleep and resting.

14:41	wxmq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀπέχει	1	The phrase **It is enough** most likely refers to the apostles sleeping. They need to wake up and prepare for what is about tot happen. Alternate translation: “It is enough sleep” or “That is enough sleep”

Here Mark uses the word **Now** to introduce the background information which he gives in the rest of this verse. Use the natural form in your language for expressing background information. Alternate translation: “Now Judas, who was going to hand Jesus over, gave this signal to those who were going to arrest Jesus. Judas said, ‘Whomever I may kiss, he it is.

14:48	gv6e			ἀποκριθεὶς ὁ Ἰησοῦς εἶπεν αὐτοῖς	1	Alternate translation: “Jesus said to the crowd”
14:48	eq25		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	ὡς ἐπὶ λῃστὴν ἐξήλθατε μετὰ μαχαιρῶν καὶ ξύλων συνλαβεῖν με?	1	Jesus is not asking for information, but is using the question form here as an emphatic way to rebuke the crowd. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way, as modeled by the UST. Alternate translation: “It is ridiculous that you come here to seize me with swords and clubs as if I were a robber!”
14:48	djp0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	ἐξήλθατε	1	Your language may say “gone” rather than **come** in contexts such as this. Use whichever is more natural. Alternate translation: “have you gone out”
14:49	my05		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	τῷ ἱερῷ	1	Only priests were allowed to enter the temple building, so by saying **the temple**, Jesus means the temple courtyard. He is using the word for the entire building to refer to one part of it. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this explicitly, as modeled by the UST.
14:49	t9d8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ἀλλ’ ἵνα πληρωθῶσιν αἱ Γραφαί	1	Jesus’ words **But so that the Scriptures might be fulfilled** could: (1) be an ellipsis. If this is the case, then Jesus is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete. If it would be helpful in your language, you could supply these words. Matthew, in his parallel account in [Matt 26:56](../mat/26/56.md), supplies the words “all this has happened” between the words **But** and **so that**, so if this is an ellipsis these are the words that should be supplied. Alternate translation: “But all this has happened so that the Scriptures might be fulfilled” or “But, so that the Scriptures might be fulfilled, all this has happened” (2) instead be translated with an imperatival meaning as “But let the Scriptures be fulfilled.” Alternate translation: “But let the Scriptures be fulfilled”
14:49	d8wh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	πληρωθῶσιν αἱ Γραφαί	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Jesus implies that both God and sinful humans are acting to fulfill Scripture. God is intentionally acting to fulfill Scripture by leading Jesus to be willing to die and not flee from those trying to kill him. Sinful humans are also acting to fulfill Scripture even though they do not know that they are fulfilling what God had foretold in the Old Testament would happen to the Messiah. Because of this, if you must state who did the action, it would be best to translate this in a way that includes both or allows for both. Alternate translation: “God might fulfill through the acts of sinful men what has been foretold in the Scriptures”
14:50	pk0i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	αὐτὸν	1	The pronoun **him** refers to Jesus. If it would be helpful in your language, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “Jesus”

It may be helpful to make this a separate sentence. Alternate translation: “Peter followed Jesus, staying some distance away so that he himself would not be recognized and arrested. He followed as far as going”

14:55	wlp4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐζήτουν κατὰ τοῦ Ἰησοῦ μαρτυρίαν, εἰς τὸ θανατῶσαι αὐτόν	1	The phrase **seeking testimony against** means that the chief priests and the Sanhedrin was seeking evidence against Jesus that they could bring to the Roman authorities and use it to accuse Jesus. This was not an official trial. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express that explicitly. Alternate translation: “were looking for evidence against Jesus so that they could have him put to death”

See how you translated the word **testimonies** in [14:55](../14/55.md).

14:58	e94y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	τὸν χειροποίητον & ἀχειροποίητον	1	Here, Jesus uses the word **hands** to mean “men”. Jesus uses one part of a person to refer to the entire person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your culture or plain language. Alternate translation: “made by men … made without man’s help” or “built by men … which will be built without man’s help”
14:58	hm5e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ἄλλον	1	By saying **another**, Jesus is leaving out a word that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete. If it would be helpful in your language, you could supply the word “temple” from the context, as modeled by the UST.

The repetition is used to emphasize that Jesus did not respond to any of the false accusations that were being made against him. If your language does not use repetition to do this, you can use one phrase and provide emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “he did not reply to anything that was said against him at all!” or “Jesus did not reply to a single thing that was said against him!”
14:61	o27t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὁ Υἱὸς τοῦ Εὐλογητοῦ	1	Here, the title **the Blessed One** is a way of referring to God, so when the **high priest** asks Jesus if he is **the Son of the Blessed One**, he is asking Jesus if he is “the Son of God.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could indicate that explicitly, as modeled by the UST.

If there is a gesture with a similar meaning in your culture, you could consider using it here in your translation, or you could use plain language to express what **sitting at the right hand** of someone meant in Jesus’ culture. Alternate translation: “sitting in a place of honor beside the all-powerful God” or “sitting in a place of honor next to the all-powerful God”
14:62	e1xd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐκ δεξιῶν καθήμενον τῆς δυνάμεως	1	By using the phrase **of power**, Jesus is referring to God by association with his **power**.

Alternate translation: “having torn his tunics in outrage”
14:63	afd3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τί ἔτι χρείαν ἔχομεν μαρτύρων?	1	By saying **Why do we still have need of witnesses?**, the high priest is not asking for information but is using the question form here for emphasis. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “We certainly do not need any more people who will testify against this man!”
14:64	zwf9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἠκούσατε τῆς βλασφημίας	1	This refers to what Jesus had said, which the high priest labelled as blasphemy.

14:65	gvq3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	προφήτευσον	1	The implication is that God would have to tell Jesus who struck him, since Jesus had his eyes covered and could not see who was striking him.

14:65	dg7u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony	προφήτευσον	1	The guards did not believe that Jesus was a real prophet and could **Prophesy**. When they demanded that Jesus should **Prophesy**, they were challenging him to do something they believed he could not do. They were only asking Jesus to **Prophesy** in order to mock him. If it would be helpful in your language, consider expressing the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Prove that you really are a prophet and prophesy” or “Prophesy, if you really are a prophet” or “Prophesy and tell us who hit you, if you really are a prophet”
14:68	l5i1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	οὔτε οἶδα, οὔτε ἐπίσταμαι σὺ τί λέγεις	1	The phrase **Neither have I known** and the phrase **nor do I understand what you are saying** mean basically the same thing. Peter is using the repetition for emphasis. If your language does not use repetition to do this, you can use one phrase and provide emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “I surely do not know what you are talking about” or “I have no idea what you are talking about” or “I know nothing about this man from Nazareth whom you are speaking about”

15:intro	d823				0	# Mark 15 General Notes\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### “The curtain of the temple was split in two”\n\nThe curtain in the temple was an important symbol that showed that people needed to have someone speak to God for them. They could not speak to God directly, because all people are sinful and God hates sin. God split the curtain to show that Jesus’ people can now speak to God directly because Jesus has paid for their sins.\n\n### The tomb\n\nThe tomb in which Jesus was buried ([Mark 15:46](../mrk/15/46.md)) was the kind of tomb in which wealthy Jewish families buried their dead. It was an actual room cut into a rock. It had a flat place on one side where they could place the body after they had put oil and spices on it and wrapped it in cloth. Then they would roll a large rock in front of the tomb so no one could see inside or enter.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Sarcasm\n\nThe soldiers were insulting Jesus when they put a “purple robe” on him and placed a “crown of thorns” on his head (See Mark 15:17) and said, “Hail, King of the Jews” (See Mark 15:18) and bent their knees and bowed down to him (See Mark 15:19). These actions were symbolic of things that people would do to a king, but the soldiers did not really believe that Jesus was a king. By pretending that they thought Jesus was a king, and by putting a “crown of thorns” on Jesus’ head instead of a regular crown, and by “striking his head with a staff and spitting on him” (See Mark 15:19) the soldiers showed that they did not believe that Jesus was the Son of God. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]] and (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]]) and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/mock]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Golgotha\n\nThe word “Golgotha” is an Aramaic word. Mark used Greek letters to express the sound of this Aramaic word so that his readers would know how it sounded, and then he told them it meant “Place of a Skull.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate]])\n\n### Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?\n\nThis is an Aramaic phrase. Mark transliterates the sounds of this phrase by writing them with Greek letters. Mark used Greek letters to express the sound of this Aramaic phrase so that his readers would know how it sounded, and then he told them that it meant “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate]])
15:1	xz7c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	δήσαντες τὸν Ἰησοῦν, ἀπήνεγκαν	1	The Jewish religious leaders commanded that Jesus should be **bound** but did not bind him themselves. It would have been the guards who actually bound Jesus and **led {him} away**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could indicate this in your translation, as modeled by the UST. Alternate translation: “commanded the guards to bind Jesus and then the guards bound him and led him away”
15:1	v2yf			παρέδωκαν Πειλάτῳ	1	Alternate translation: “delivered him over to Pilate” or “transferred control of Jesus to Pilate”
15:2	kn7i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	ἀποκριθεὶς αὐτῷ λέγει	1	Together the two words **answering** and **says** mean that Jesus responded to what Pilate asked him.

15:2	dh6n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	σὺ λέγεις	1	**You say {it}** is an idiom. Jesus is using it to acknowledge that what Pilate has said is true.

Mark is providing background information in this verse to help readers understand what happens next. Use a natural way in your language for introducing background information. Alternate translation: “It was Pilate’s custom to release to them a prisoner of their choice at the festival”
15:7	pdy3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	δὲ	1	The word **Now** is used here to mark a continuation of the break in the main story line which began in the preceding verse. Mark introduces more background information, this time about Barabbas, to help readers understand what happens next. Use a natural way in your language for introducing background information. Alternate translation: “And”

If you must state who did the action, Mark implies that “the Roman authorities” had soldiers do it. Alternate translation: “whom the Roman soldiers had bound”
15:7	iofn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	φόνον πεποιήκεισαν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **murder**, you can express the same idea with a verbal form, as modeled by the UST.
15:8	a4xb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	ἀναβὰς	1	Your language may say “having gone up” rather than **having come up** in contexts such as this. Use whichever is more natural. Alternate translation: “having gone up”
15:9	o3j4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	ἀπεκρίθη αὐτοῖς λέγων	1	When translating the phrase **answered them, saying** see how you translated the similar phrase “answering him, says” in [15:2](../15/02.md). Alternate translation: “responded to them”

15:10	u647		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	διὰ φθόνον παραδεδώκεισαν αὐτὸν οἱ ἀρχιερεῖς	1	The **chief priests** envied Jesus because so many people were following him and becoming his disciples. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express that explicitly. If you decide to express this information explicitly, consider beginning a new sentence. Alternate translation: “the chief priests were envious of Jesus because so many people were becoming his disciples. Pilate knew that this was why they had handed him over” or “the chief priests were envious of Jesus’ popularity among the people. This is why they had handed him over”
15:10	yjp3			παραδεδώκεισαν αὐτὸν	1	Alternate translation: “had handed Jesus over”
15:11	y5w3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἀνέσεισαν τὸν ὄχλον	1	Mark speaks of the **chief priests** as if they had **stirred** a pot and put into motion things that had been lying quietly on the bottom. Mark means that the **chief priests** encouraged the crowd to ask Pilate to release Barabbas. If your readers would not understand what **stirred up** means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “encouraged the crowd” or “incited the crowd”
15:11	pvu6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	ἵνα	1	The phrase **so that** introduces what the **chief priests stirred up the crowd** to request of Pilate. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a purpose clause. Alternate translation: “in order that”

15:12	p94y			πάλιν	1	Mark uses the word **again** here because Pilate had already spoken to them regarding this matter in [15:9](../15/09.md). Use a natural form in your language for expressing the meaning of **again** as it is used here.
15:12	vlm3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τί οὖν ποιήσω λέγετε τὸν Βασιλέα τῶν Ἰουδαίων?	1	Pilate uses the word **therefore** because, as [15:11](../15/11.md) indicates, the chief priests had “stirred up the crowd” to request that Pilate “release Barabbas” to them. So Pilate is asking what he should **therefore** do with Jesus if Barabbas is the prisoner to be released at their request. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express that explicitly. Alternate translation: “If I release Barabbas, what then should I do with the one you call the King of the Jews”

15:13	n6jb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	σταύρωσον αὐτόν	1	The Romans executed some criminals by nailing them to a wooden beam with a crossbar and setting the beam upright so that the criminals would slowly suffocate. That was what it meant to **Crucify** someone. Alternate translation: “Nail him to a cross! Execute him!”
15:13	nwms		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	σταύρωσον αὐτόν	1	Here, the word **Crucify** is an imperative, but since the crowd cannot command Pilate to do this, you could translate the phrase **Crucify him** as an expression of what they want. Alternate translation: “We want you to nail him to a cross to execute him”
15:14	e55i			σταύρωσον αὐτόν	1	See how you translated the phrase **Crucify him** in [15:13](../15/13.md).

If it would be helpful in your language, you could indicate that explicitly, as modeled by the UST.
15:15	yzn5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	φραγελλώσας	1	If your readers would not be familiar with this form of punishment, you could explain explicitly what flogging was. Flogging was a Roman penalty in which they whipped a person with a whip to which were attached pieces of bone and metal to increase the whip’s capacity to do harm to the person being flogged. Alternate translation: “having whipped Jesus with a whip with pieces of bone and metal attached to it” or “having whipped Jesus with a whip to which was attached pieces of bone and metal”
15:15	w1sl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	καὶ παρέδωκεν τὸν Ἰησοῦν φραγελλώσας, ἵνα σταυρωθῇ	1	The phrase **so that** introduces a purpose clause.

15:15	r9id		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	σταυρωθῇ	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Mark implies that Pilate’s “soldiers” did it. Alternate translation: “his soldiers might take him away and crucify him”
15:16	eg6x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	ὅ ἐστιν πραιτώριον	1	By clarifying **(that is, the Praetorium)**, Mark explains that **the courtyard** is part of the official residence of the Roman governor. This background information is given to help his readers understand exactly what he means by using the word **courtyard**. Use the natural form in your language for expressing background information. Alternate translation: “which is, the Praetorium”
15:16	lb2x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πραιτώριον	1	The **Praetorium** was where the Roman governor stayed when he was in Jerusalem and where the soldiers in Jerusalem lived. Mark assumes that his readers will know what the **Praetorium** is. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express that explicitly. Alternate translation: “the palace where the governor and his soldiers lived” or “the Roman governor’s residence”
15:16	b5gs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὅλην τὴν σπεῖραν	1	Mark assumes that his readers will know that a **cohort** was a unit of Roman soldiers. A **cohort** normally numbered around 600 men but could sometimes refer to a number as small as 200 men. Here, by saying **the whole cohort**, Mark most likely means all the soldiers from the **cohort** who were on duty at that time. If it would be helpful in your language, you could indicate explicitly that a **cohort** was a unit of Roman soldiers. Additionally, you could also say explicitly that it was only the soldiers who were on duty who were called together, as modeled by the UST. Alternate translation: “the whole unit of soldiers” or “the whole unit of soldiers who were on duty there”

The soldiers put a **crown** made from **thorns** and a **purple robe** on Jesus in order to mock him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning explicitly. It may be helpful to your readers to make this a separate sentence. Alternate translation: “they put a purple robe on him and placed on his head a crown that they had made by twisting thorns together. They did these things in order to mock him by pretending that they believed he really was a king”
15:17	ly5a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	πορφύραν	1	The word **purple** denotes a color. If your readers would be unfamiliar with the color **purple**, you could use the closest equivalent color that your readers would be familiar with such as “crimson” or “scarlet” (“crimson” and “scarlet” are two different names for the same color) since Matthew records in [Matt 27:28](../mat/27/28.md) that the color of the robe was “scarlet.” The fact that Matthew and Mark use a different color to describe the color of the same robe probably means that its color closely resembled both “scarlet” and **purple**. If your readers would be unfamiliar with these colors, you could use the closest equivalent color that they would be familiar with, such as “red” or “dark red.” Alternate translation: “dark red” or “red” or “crimson” or “scarlet”
15:17	xfk8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	πλέξαντες ἀκάνθινον στέφανον	1	Mark uses the word **thorns** to refer to small branches with **thorns** on them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “having twisted it together from thorny branches, a crown”
15:18	ft1j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony	ἀσπάζεσθαι αὐτόν, Χαῖρε, Βασιλεῦ τῶν Ἰουδαίων	1	The word **Rejoice** was a common greeting, but the soldiers used this greeting in order to mock Jesus. They did not believe that Jesus was really the **King of the Jews**. They actually meant to communicate the opposite of the literal meaning of their words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could provide a brief explanation. Alternate translation: “to salute him by saying in a mocking manner: ‘Rejoice, King of the Jews’”
15:19	gz3b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony	καλάμῳ, καὶ	1	Matthew records in [Matt 27:19](../mat/27/19.md) that the soldiers placed a **reed** in Jesus’ “right hand” and that “they mocked him” by saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!” At this time in history, kings used scepters. The **reed** would have resembled a scepter, so the soldiers are using a **reed** here to mock Jesus. If it would be helpful in your language, you could provide a brief explanation. Alternate translation: “with a reed that they were using as a pretend scepter, and they were”
15:19	muvw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	ἐνέπτυον αὐτῷ	1	In this culture, the action of **spitting on** a person was a way to show thorough disgust. It expressed strong contempt for someone. If your readers would not understand the meaning of **spitting on** someone in this context and there is a gesture with a similar meaning in your culture, you could use it here in place of this action.
15:19	a8a9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony	τιθέντες τὰ γόνατα, προσεκύνουν αὐτῷ	1	The acts of **bending the knee** and **bowing down** were things normally done as a way of honoring kings. The soldiers actually mean to communicate the opposite of the literal meaning of their actions. These soldiers do not really believe that Jesus is a king, but rather, they are doing these things to express mockery. If it would be helpful in your language, you could provide a brief explanation. Also see the discussion about this idea in the General Notes for this chapter. Alternate translation: “bending the knee, they were bowing down to him in order to mock him”

Mark used Greek letters to express the sound of this Aramaic word so that his readers would know how it sounded, and then he told them that it meant **Place of a Skull**. In your translation you could spell it the way it sounds in your language and then explain its meaning.
15:22	e49p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	Γολγοθᾶν & Κρανίου Τόπος	1	Matthew says in [Matt 27:33](../mat/27/33.md) that **Golgotha** was “a place called Golgotha,” so it is clear that this was the name of a location, but the reason why this place was called **Place of a Skull** is not known. It could have been called **Place of a Skull** because the appearance of this place resembled a skull or because it was the site of so many executions, in which case the name **Skull** is being used as metonymy to refer to death. Because the reason that this location was called **Place of a Skull** is unknown, you should translate this phrase in a way that allows for either meaning, as modeled by the ULT and UST.

It would be tossed onto the ground to see which marked side would come up on top. If your readers would not be familiar with **a lot**, you could state that it was “something like dice,” as UST does. But if your readers would also not be familiar with dice, then you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “and the Roman soldiers gambled for them”
15:24	mn6x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	τίς τί ἄρῃ	1	Mark is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete.

Here the phrase **the third hour** refers to **the third hour** of the day, which was approximately three hours after sunrise. Here, **third** is an ordinal number. If your language does not use ordinal numbers, you can translate the phrase **the third hour** as “nine o’clock in the morning”, as modeled by the UST, since this is what time the phrase **the third hour** is referring to. Alternately, you can express the meaning of the phrase **the third hour** in some other way that is natural in your culture. Alternate translation: “nine o’clock in the morning”

If your readers would not understand what it means to shake one’s head at someone in this context and there is a gesture with a similar meaning in your culture, you could consider using it here in your translation.
15:29	a7ft		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	οὐὰ	1	**Aha** is an exclamation word that communicates triumph, usually over an enemy. Use an exclamation that is natural in your language for communicating this. Alternate translation: “Take that!”

15:31	o9qv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἄλλους ἔσωσεν	1	In context, the Jewish leaders are implicitly referring to how Jesus **saved others** by healing their diseases, releasing them from demon-possession, and helping saving them from other physical problems. They did not think that Jesus saved them from sin or divine judgment. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “He supposedly saved other people by doing miracles for them”
15:32	t1vm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony	ὁ Χριστὸς, ὁ Βασιλεὺς Ἰσραὴλ καταβάτω	1	Here, the Jewish leaders are using irony.

Jesus is quoting from [Psalm 22:1](../psa/22/01.md). Mark uses Greek letters to express the sounds of this Aramaic phrase so that his readers would know how it sounded, and then he told them that it meant **My God, my God, why did you forsake me**.

You would then present the combined verses as 40–41, as modeled by the UST.
15:40	zc9b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	Μαριὰμ ἡ Μαγδαληνὴ & Μαρία ἡ Ἰακώβου τοῦ μικροῦ καὶ Ἰωσῆ μήτηρ	1	Because **Mary** was a very common name at this time and because Mark refers to two different women with the name **Mary** in this verse, he provides this background information to help readers know to which **Mary** he is referring in each case. Use the natural form in your language for expressing background information.
15:40	z5ra		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ἰακώβου τοῦ μικροῦ	1	The word **James** is the name a man.

Use the natural form in your language for expressing background information.

You would then present the combined verses as 42–43, as modeled by the UST.

God commanded in Deuteronomy 21:22–23 that any person who was put to death by hanging on a wooden object should be buried on the same day that they were put to death. Because of this and the fact that **evening already having come** and because the following day was the **Sabbath**, on which Jews did not work, the people involved wanted to bury Jesus’ body quickly.

15:47	m782		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ἰωσῆτος	1	See how you translated the name **Joses** in [6:3](../06/03.md). This **Joses** was not the same person as the younger brother of Jesus mentioned in [6:3](../06/03.md), although they share the same name.

16:intro	j5yz				0	# Mark 16 General Notes\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### The tomb\n\nThe tomb in which Jesus was buried ([Mark 15:46](../mrk/15/46.md)) was the kind of tomb in which wealthy Jewish families buried their dead. It was an actual room cut into a rock. It had a flat place on one side where they could place the body after they had put oil and spices on it and wrapped it in cloth. Then they would roll a large rock in front of the tomb so no one could see inside or enter.\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### A young man dressed in a white robe\n\nMatthew, Mark, Luke, and John all wrote about angels in white clothing with the women at Jesus’ tomb. Two of the authors called them men, but that is only because the angels were in human form. Two of the authors wrote about two angels, but the other two authors wrote about only one of them. It is best to translate each of these passages as it appears in the ULT without trying to make the passages all say exactly the same thing. (See: [Matthew 28:1–2](../mat/28/01.md) and [Mark 16:5](../mrk/16/05.md) and [Luke 24:4](../luk/24/04.md) and [John 20:12](../jhn/20/12.md))
16:1	p61n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	διαγενομένου τοῦ Σαββάτου	1	By using the phrase **the Sabbath having passed**, Mark is explaining that the Jewish day of rest, called the **Sabbath**, had ended and that it was now permissible, according to Jewish law, for these women to buy spices. The phrase **the Sabbath having passed** does not mean that the actual day on which the **Sabbath** occurred was over. The Jewish **Sabbath** ended at sunset on Saturday evening. If it would be helpful in your language, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “when the sun had set on Saturday evening”
16:1	cw1b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	ἡ Μαρία ἡ Μαγδαληνὴ	1	# Connecting Statement:\n\nSee how you translated **Mary Magdalene** in [15:40](../15/40.md).
16:1	fm8u			Μαρία ἡ Ἰακώβου	1	See how you translated the phrase **Mary the mother of** in [15:40](../15/40.md).
16:1	m7qt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ἰακώβου	1	The word **James** is the name a man. Much as in [15:40](../15/40.md), this man is probably referred to as **the younger** to distinguish him from other men named **James**, since he is not James the brother of Jesus, James son of Zebedee, or James son of Alphaeus.
16:1	nmvs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Σαλώμη	1	See how you translated the name **Salome** in [15:40](../15/40.md).
16:1	zrcf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	ἵνα	1	The phrase **so that** introduces a purpose clause. The women **bought spices** for the purpose of anointing Jesus’ body with them. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a purpose clause. Alternate translation: “in order that”
16:2	qcmt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τῇ μιᾷ	1	Here, the word **first** refers to the “first day” of the week. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express that explicitly. Alternate translation: “on the first day”
16:4	kld9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἀποκεκύλισται ὁ λίθος	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form, as modeled by the UST, or you can translate it in another way that is natural in your language.
16:5	oaqk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	νεανίσκον	1	Here, the **young man** is actually an angel who looked like a young man. See the discussion of this under the General Notes section for this chapter. You should translate the phrase **young man** as it appears in the ULT.
16:6	mo0d			ἐκθαμβεῖσθε	1	See how you translated the word **alarmed** in [16:5](../16/05.md).
16:6	ie57		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τὸν ἐσταυρωμένον	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form, as modeled by the UST, or you can translate it in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Mark implies in chapter 15 that Pilate’s “soldiers” did it. Alternate translation: “who Pilate’s soldiers crucified”
16:6	x9m8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἠγέρθη	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, it is implied that “God” did it. Alternate translation: “God raised him from the dead!” or “He has risen!”
16:7	x3u1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καὶ τῷ Πέτρῳ	1	The phrase **and Peter** is not making a distinction between **Peter** and the disciples by indicating that **Peter** is not part of the group of Jesus’ 12 **disciples**. Rather, the phrase **and Peter** is being used to emphasize that of all of the 12 disciples of Jesus, these women should take special care to tell Peter the information that follows this phrase. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express that explicitly. Alternate translation: “and especially Peter”
16:7	axgu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	Πέτρῳ, ὅτι προάγει ὑμᾶς εἰς τὴν Γαλιλαίαν; ἐκεῖ αὐτὸν ὄψεσθε, καθὼς εἶπεν ὑμῖν	1	If the direct quotation inside a direct quotation would be confusing in your language, you could translate the second direct quotation as an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: “to Peter that he is going before them to Galilee and that they will see him there, just as he said to them”
16:8	dlji		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	ἐξελθοῦσαι	1	Your language may say “come” rather than **gone** in contexts such as this. Use whichever is more natural. Alternate translation: “having come out”
16:8	sh40		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	εἶχεν γὰρ αὐτὰς τρόμος καὶ ἔκστασις	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **amazement**, you can express the same idea with a verbal form such as “amazed.” Alternate translation: “for they were greatly amazed, and they trembled”
16:8	bdgb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	εἶχεν γὰρ αὐτὰς τρόμος καὶ ἔκστασις	1	Here, the word **gripping** is an idiom which means “overcoming.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent idiom or use plain language. Alternate translation: “for they were overcome by trembling and amazement” or “for they were overcome with trembling and amazement”
16:8	ydb0			καὶ οὐδενὶ οὐδὲν εἶπον	1	Alternate translation: “And they told no one anything”
