## translationNotes

* Yahweh continued to speak to Abram while Abram dreamed.
* **that they will serve** - "that your descendants will serve"
* **abundant possessions** - "many possessions" or "great wealth"
* **you will go to your fathers** - "you will go to your ancestors." This means "you will die." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
* **you will be buried in a good old age** - This can be translated as "you will be very old when you die and your family buries your body."
* **In the fourth generation** - In this verse, one generation apparently refers to a lifespan of 100 years. Therefore it could be translated as "After four hundred years."
* **they will come here again** - "your descendants will come back here." Abraham's descendants would come to the land where Abram was then living, the land that Yahweh had promised to give to him.
* **has not reached its limit** - "is not yet complete." It can also be translated as "will get much worse before I punish them."
