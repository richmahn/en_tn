# Then, behold

The word "behold" emphasizes the fact that the word of Yahweh came to Abraham again.

# the word of Yahweh came to him, saying,

The idiom "The word of Yahweh came to" is used to introduce a special message from God. See how you translated this idiom in [Genesis 15:1](./01.md). AT: "Yahweh gave him a message. He said," or "Yahweh spoke this message to him:" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# This man

This refers to Eliezer of Damascus.

# the one who will come from your own body

"the one that you will father" or "your very own son." Abram's own son would become his heir.

# number the stars

"count the stars"

# So will your descendants be

Just as Abram would not be able to count all the stars, he would not be able to count all his descendants because there would be so many.
