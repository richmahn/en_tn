# Will you really reign over us? Will you actually rule over us?

Both of these phrases mean basically the same thing. Joseph's brothers are using questions to mock Joseph. They can be written as statements. Alternate translation: "You will never be our king, and we will never bow down to you!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# reign over us

The word "us" refers to Joseph's brothers but not Joseph. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

# for his dreams and for his words

"because of his dreams and what he said"
