# Genesis 48 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 48:15-16, 20, which are important quotations.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Blessing #####
The blessing of Jacob is given to Joseph, and his sons Manasseh and Ephraim. It is probably distinct from inheriting the promises Yahweh gave to Abraham because Scripture talks about all of Israel's descendants inheriting those promises. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/bless]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/inherit]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/promise]])
