# protected me

"delivered me"

# May my name be named in them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac

Here "name" stands for the person. The phrase "my name be named in them" is an idiom that means a person is remembered because of another person. This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "May people remember Abraham, Isaac, and me because of Ephraim and Manasseh" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# May they grow into a multitude on the earth

Here "they" refers to Ephraim and Manasseh, but it stands for their descendants. Alternate translation: "May they have many descendants who will live all over the earth" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
