# Israel blessed Joseph

Here "Joseph" also stands for Ephraim and Manasseh. Since Joseph is the father, he is the only one mentioned here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked

Serving God is spoken of as if it were walking before God. Alternate translation: "The God who my grandfather Abraham and father Isaac served" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# who has cared for me

God has taken care of Israel like a shepherd takes care of his sheep. Alternate translation: "who has cared for me like a shepherd cares for his animals" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
