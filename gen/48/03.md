## Luz ##

See how you translated the name of this city in [Genesis 28:18](../28/18.md).

## in the land of Canaan. He blessed me and said to me ##

This can be translated with the new sentence starting in a different place: "in the land of Canaan, and he blessed me. And he said to me"

## Behold ##

“Look” or “Listen” or “Pay attention to what I am about to tell you.”

## make you fruitful, and multiply you ##

The words "fruitful" and "multiply" say the same thing for emphasis. Alternate translation: "I will give you very many descendants." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

## multiply you. I will make of you an assembly ##

"multiply you, and I will make many nations come from you"

## an everlasting possession  ##

"a permanent possession"
