Verses 8 and 9 repeat what was said in [Genesis 14:3](./03.md) and continues to tell what happened when the kings came together to fight.

## they turned and came ##

The word "they" refers to the four foreign kings who were attacking the region of Canaan. Their names were Amraphel, Arioch, Chedorlaomer, and Tidal.

## the Amorites that lived in Hazazaon-Tamar ##

This phrase tells which Amorite people were defeated. There were other Amorite people who lived in other places.

## prepared for battle ##

"joined battle" or "drew up battle lines." Some translators may need to also say that the armies fought, as the UDB does in verse 9. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

## the king of Bela (also called Zoar) ##

The city of Bela was also called Zoar. This information could also be put at the end of the the sentence: "and the king of Bela went out and prepared for battle. Bela is also called Zoar."

## four kings against the five ##

Since the five kings were listed first, some languages might prefer to translate this as "five kings against four."
