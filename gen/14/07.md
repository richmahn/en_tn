# General Information:

Verses 8 and 9 repeats what was said in [Genesis 14:3](./03.md) and continues to tell what happened when the kings came together to fight.

# they turned and came

The word "they" refers to the four foreign kings who were attacking the region of Canaan. Their names were Amraphel, Arioch, Chedorlaomer, and Tidal. AT: "they turned and went" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])

# the Amorites who lived in Hazezon Tamar

This phrase tells which Amorite people were defeated. There were other Amorite people who lived in other places.

# the king of Bela (also called Zoar)

The city of Bela was also called Zoar. This information could also be put at the end of the sentence. "the king of Bela went out and prepared for battle. Bela is also called Zoar."

# prepared for battle

"joined battle" or "drew up battle lines." Some translators may need to also say that the armies fought, as the UDB does in verse 9. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# four kings against the five

Since the five kings were listed first, some languages might prefer to translate this as "five kings against four."
