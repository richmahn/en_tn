## Give me the people ##

The phrase "the people" may refer to the people of Sodom that the enemies had captured. Abram rescued them when he rescued Lot

## I have lifted up my hand ##

This means "I have taken an oath" or "I have made a promise."

## I will take nothing except what the young men have eaten ##

This can be translated as "I take from you only what my young men have already eaten." Abram was refusing to accept anything for himself, but acknowledged that the soldiers had eaten some of the supplies during the journey back to Sodom after the battle.

## the share of the men that went with me ##

This can be made more explicit: "the share of the recovered property that belongs to the men who helped me get it back." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

## Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre ##

These are the allies of Abram (See: [Genesis 14:13](./13.md)). Because they were Abram's allies they fought battles alongside him. You can make this more explicit: "my allies Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre."
