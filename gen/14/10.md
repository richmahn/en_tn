## translationNotes

* **Now** - This word introduces background information about the valley of Siddim. Your language may have another way of introducing background information (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]]).
* **was full of tar pits** - "had many tar pits." These were holes in the ground that had tar in them. See how you translated "tar" in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:11:03]].
* **the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah** - This is a figure of speech that refers to the kings and their armies. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
* **they fell in there** - Possible meanings are 1) some of their soldiers fell in the tar pits (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]]) or 2) the kings themselves fell in the tarpits. Since [[:en:bible:notes:gen:14:17]] says that the king of Sodom went to meet Abram, the first meaning is more likely correct.
* **Those who were left** - "those who did not die in battle and did not fall in the pits"
* **the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah** - "the wealth of Sodom and Gomorrah" or "the property of Sodom and Gomorrah"
* **the enemy** - This refers to King Chedorlaomer and the other kings and their armies with him who were attacking Sodom and Gomorrah.
* **their provisions** - "their food and drink"
* **went their way** - "they went away"
* **they also took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who was living in Sodom, along with all his possessions** - The phrases "Abram's brother's son" and "who was living in Sodom" remind the reader of things that were written earlier about Lot. You can translate this differently if necessary: "they also took Lot along with all his possessions. Lot was Abram's brother's son and was living in Sodom at that time." (See the section on clauses in [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_sentences#clause]].)
