This is a figure of speech that refers to the kings and their armies. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## they fell in there ##

Possible meanings are 1) some of their soldiers fell in the tar pits (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]]) or 2) the kings themselves fell in the tarpits. Since [Genesis 14:17](./17.md) says that the king of Sodom went to meet Abram, the first meaning is more likely correct.

The phrases "Abram's brother's son" and "who was living in Sodom" remind the reader of things that were written earlier about Lot. You can translate this differently if necessary: "they also took Lot along with all his possessions. Lot was Abram's brother's son and was living in Sodom at that time."
