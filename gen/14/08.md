# the king of Bela (also called Zoar)

The city of Bela was also called Zoar. This information could also be put at the end of the sentence. "the king of Bela went out and prepared for battle. Bela is also called Zoar."

# prepared for battle

"joined battle" or "drew up battle lines." Some translators may need to also say that the armies fought, as the UDB does in verse 9. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
