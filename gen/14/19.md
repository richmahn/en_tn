## He blessed him ##

King Melchizedek blessed Abram.

## Blessed be Abram by God Most High, Creator of heaven and earth ##

This can also be translated with an active clause: "May God Most High, the Creator of heaven and earth, bless Abram" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]]).

## God Most High, who has delivered ##

The phrase starting with "who has delivered" tells us something more about God Most High. You can also translate this as "God Most High, because he has delivered."

## Blessed be God Most High ##

This is a way of praising God. See how you translated "Blessed be" in [Genesis 9:26](../09/26.md).

## into your hand ##

"into your control" or "into your power"
