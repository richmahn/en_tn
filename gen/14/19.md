## translationNotes

* **He blessed him** - King Melchizedek blessed Abram.
* **Blessed be Abram by God Most High, Creator of heaven and earth** - This can also be translated with an active clause: "May God Most High, the Creator of heaven and earth, bless Abram" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]]).
* **God Most High, who has delivered** - The phrase starting with "who has delivered" tells us something more about God Most High. You can also translate this as "God Most High, because he has delivered."
* **Blessed be God Most High** - This is a way of praising God. See how you translated "Blessed be" in [[en:bible:notes:gen:09:26]].
* **into your hand** - "into your control" or "into your power"
