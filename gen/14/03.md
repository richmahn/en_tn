## translationNotes

* **These latter five kings joined together** - The information that their armies were with them can be made explicit: "These latter five kings and their armies joined together." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
* **Twelve years they had served** - The events in verses 4-7 happened before verse 3. Your language may have a way of showing this.
* **they had served Chedorlaomer** - This could be translated as "they had been under the control of Chedorlaomer." They probably had to pay him taxes and serve in his army.
* **they rebelled** - This can also be translated as "they refused to serve him" or "they stopped serving him."
* **came and struck** - "came and attacked." They did this because the other kings rebelled.
* **Rephaim…, Zuzim…, Emim…, Horites** - These are the names of people groups. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
* **Ashteroth-karnaim, …Ham, …Shaveh-kiriathaim, …Seir, …El-paran** - These are the names of places.
* **as far as El-paran, which is near the desert** - The phrase "which is near the desert" tells us something more about El-paran. You can translate this relative clause with two sentences if necessary: "as far as El-paran. El-paran is near the desert." (See the section on clauses in [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_sentences]].)
