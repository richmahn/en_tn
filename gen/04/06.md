# Why are you angry and why are you scowling?

God used these rhetorical questions to tell [Cain](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/cain) that he was wrong to be angry and scowl. They may also have been intended to give [Cain](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/cain) an opportunity to confess that he was wrong. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
