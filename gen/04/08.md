## Cain spoke to Abel his brother ##

Some languages will need to add the implicit information that Cain spoke to his brother about going to the fields. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

## brother ##

Abel was Cain's younger brother. Some languages would need to use the word for "younger brother."

## Where is Abel your brother? ##

God knew that Cain had killed his brother, but he asked Cain this question so that Cain would have to answer.

## Am I my brother's keeper? ##

Cain used this rhetorical question in order to avoid telling the truth. He was implying that God should know that Cain was not his brother's keeper. This can be translated as "Is it my responsibility to watch my brother?" or "I don't have to take care of my brother." (See [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]]).
