## I will be hidden from your face ##

"I will not be able to come before your face" or "I will not be able to go to you." Cain thought that if he moved to a different place, he would not be able to worship God. It does not mean that God would not be able to see Cain.

## a fugitive and a wanderer ##

These words could be joined together and translated as “a homeless wanderer,” which means "a person who roams because he does not have a home."

## vengeance will be taken on him sevenfold ##

This can be translated with an active verb. "I will take vengeance on him seven times" or "I will punish that person seven times as severely as I am punishing you." (UDB) (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## would not attack him ##

"would not kill Cain"
