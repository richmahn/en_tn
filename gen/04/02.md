# Then she gave birth

We do not know how much time passed between the births of [Cain](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/cain) and [Abel](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/abel). They may have been twins, or [Abel](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/abel) may have been born after [Eve](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/eve) became pregnant again. If possible, use an expression that does not tell how much time passed.

# cultivated

This means he did [eve](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/eve)rything he needed to do so that the plants would grow well. See how "cultivate" is translated in [Genesis 2:5](../02/04.md).
