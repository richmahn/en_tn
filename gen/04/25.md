## translationNotes

* **had marital relations** - “had sex with.” Your language may have a way of saying this politely. Some languages say “knew” or “slept with.” (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]]). See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:04:01]].
* **and said, "God has given me another son** - This is the reason that she named Seth. This implicit information could be made explicit: "and explained, 'God has given me another child.'" (See [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]]).
* **Seth** - Translators may add a footnote that says "This name sounds like the Hebrew word that means 'has given'."
* **A son was born to Seth** - This can be translated as "Seth had a son."
* **to call on the name of Yahweh** - “to pray in the name of Yahweh” or “to trust in the name of Yahweh” or “to worship Yahweh." This is the first time in Genesis that people addressed God by the name Yahweh. This could also be translated as "to worship God by using the name Yahweh."
