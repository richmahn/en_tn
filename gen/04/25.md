# slept with

Your language may have a way of saying this politely. Some older versions say "knew." See how you translated this in [Genesis 4:1](./01.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])

# said, "God has given me another son

This is the reason that she named him Seth. This can be made explicit. AT: "explained, 'God has given me another child" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# Seth

Translators may add a footnote that says "This name sounds like the Hebrew word that means 'has given.'" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
