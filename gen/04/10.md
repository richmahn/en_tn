## translationNotes

* **God said** - The text does not say "God," but "God" was added to clarify who is speaking.
* **What have you done?** - God used this rhetorical question to rebuke Cain. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **The voice of your brother's blood cries to me** - This personification can be translated as a simile. The implicit information is what the voice was calling out for. "Your brother's blood is like a person who is calling out to me to punish the person who killed him."  (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]] and [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]] and  [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
* **which has opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood** - This is figurative language that says that the blood soaked into the ground. It can be translated as "which is soaked with your brother's blood."
* **from your hand** - This can also be translated as "that spilled when you killed him." Cain did not literally pour blood from his hand into the earth.
* **it will not yield to you its strength** - This is a figure of speech that means "the ground will not produce much food for you."
* **a fugitive and a wanderer** - These words could be joined together and translated as "a homeless wanderer," which means "a person who roams around because he does not have a home."
