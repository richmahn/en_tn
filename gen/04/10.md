## What have you done? ##

God used this rhetorical question to rebuke Cain. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## Your brother's blood is calling out to me ##

This personification can be translated as a simile. The implicit information is what the voice was calling out for. "Your brother's blood is like a person who is calling out to me to punish the person who killed him." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

## which has opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood ##

This is figurative language that says that the blood soaked into the ground. It can be translated as "which is soaked with your brother's blood."

## from your hand ##

This can also be translated as "that spilled when you killed him." Cain caused his brother's blood to flow onto the ground.

## it will not yield to you its strength ##

This is a figure of speech that means "the ground will not produce much food for you."

## A fugitive and a wanderer ##

These words could be joined together and translated as "a homeless wanderer," which means "a person who roams around because he does not have a home."
