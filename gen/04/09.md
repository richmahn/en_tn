# Where is [Abel](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/abel) your brother

God knew that [Cain](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/cain) had killed [Abel](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/abel), but he asked [Cain](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/cain) this question so that [Cain](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/cain) would have to answer. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Am I my brother's keeper?

[Cain](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/cain) used this rhetorical question so that he would not have to tell the truth. This can be translated as a statement. AT: "I am not my brother's keeper!" or "You know that taking care of my brother is not my job!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
