# If you ... will you not be accepted?

God used this rhetorical question to remind [Cain](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/cain) of something [Cain](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/cain) should have already known. AT: "You know that if you do what is right, I will accept you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# But if you do not ... you must rule over it

God speaks of sin as if it were a person. AT: "But if you do not do what is right, you will desire to sin even more, and then you will do sinful things. You must refuse to obey it" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# sin crouches ... to control you

Here sin is spoken of as a dangerous wild animal that is waiting for the chance to attack [Cain](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/cain). AT: "you will become so angry that you will not be able to stop sin" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# sin

Languages that do not have a noun that means "sin" could translate this as "your desire to sin" or "the bad things you want to do."

# you must rule over it

Yahweh speaks of [Cain](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/cain)'s desire to sin as if it were a person over whom [Cain](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/cain) should rule. AT: "you must control it so you do not sin" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
