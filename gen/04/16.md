# went out from the presence of Yahweh

Even though Yahweh is everywhere, this idiom speaks of Cain as though he went far away. AT: "went away from where Yahweh spoke to him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# Nod

Translators may add a footnote saying "The word Nod means 'wandering.'"
