# The man

"the human being" or "Adam"

# slept with

Your language may have a way of saying this politely. Some older versions say "knew." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])

# I have produced a man

The word for "man" typically describes an adult male, rather than a baby or child. If that would cause confusion, it could be translated as "manchild" or "boy" or "baby boy" or "son."

# Cain

Translators may want to include a footnote that says "The name Cain sounds like the Hebrew word that means 'produce.' Eve named him Cain because she produced him." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# Then she gave birth

We do not know how much time passed between the births of Cain and Abel. They may have been twins, or Abel may have been born after Eve became pregnant again. If possible, use an expression that does not tell how much time passed.

# cultivated

This means he did everything he needed to do so that the plants would grow well. See how "cultivate" is translated in [Genesis 2:5](../02/04.md).
