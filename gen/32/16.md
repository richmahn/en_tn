# These he gave these into the hand of his servants, every herd by itself

Here "into the hand" means to give control over them. AT: "He divided them into small herds, and gave each of his servants control over one herd" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# put a space between each of the herds

"let each herd travel at a distance from the other herds"
