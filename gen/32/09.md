## translationNotes

* **God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, Yahweh** - This does not refer to different gods, but to the one God they all worship. Alternate translation: "O Yahweh, who is God of my father Abraham and my father Isaac."
* **and to your kindred** - "and to your family"
* **I will prosper you** - “I will do good for you” or “I will treat you well.”
* **I am not worthy of all your acts of covenant faithfulness and of all the trustworthiness that you have done for your servant** - "I do not deserve for you to remain faithful to your covenant or for you to show loyalty to your servant."
* **your servant** - This is a polite way of saying "me."
