# for the dawn is breaking

"the sun will rise soon"

# bless

Here "bless" means to pronounce a formal blessing on someone and to cause good things to happen to that person.

# I will not let you go unless you bless me

This can be stated in positive form. AT: "Absolutely not! You must bless me first, then I will let you go" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
