## there is none so discerning ##

See how you translated "discerning" in [Genesis 41:33](./33.md).

## You shall be over my house ##

"You will have authority over my kingdom"

## according to your word will all my people be ruled ##

"you will rule over my people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## Only in the throne ##

"Only in my role as king"

## See, I have put you ##

"Look, I have put you"

## I have put you over all the land ##

"I have given you authority over my kingdom"
