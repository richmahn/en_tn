# chief cupbearer

The most important person who brings drinks to the king. See how you translated this in [Genesis 40:2](../40/02.md).

# Today I am thinking about my offenses

The word "Today" is used for emphasis. His "offenses" are that he should have told Pharaoh something much earlier but he did not. Alternate translation: "I just realized that I forgot to tell you something"
