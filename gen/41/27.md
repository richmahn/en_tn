Joseph continues his interpretation of Pharaoh's dreams

## thin and undesirable cows that came up ##

See how you translated a similar phrase in [Genesis 41:1](./01.md).

## seven thin heads scorched by the east wind ##

See how you translated a similar phrase in [Genesis 41:4](./04.md).

## That is the thing which I spoke to Pharaoh ##

Here Joseph uses Pharaoh's title as a way of speaking respectfully to him. Alternate translation: “These events will happen just as I have told you.”

## he has revealed ##

"he has made known"

## Look ##

"Pay attention to what I am saying"
