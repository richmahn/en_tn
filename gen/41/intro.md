# Genesis 41 General Notes #

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### God's power #####
The account of Joseph focuses on the power of God. God is able to protect his people despite the evil actions of some. He also is able to continue to bless them despite their circumstances. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/peopleofgod]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/bless]])

##### Interpretation of dreams #####
The interpretation of dreams was important in the ancient Near East. It was seen as possible only through divine power. Yahweh gave Joseph the power to interpret dreams in order to bring himself glory and to protect Joseph and the Hebrew people. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/glory]])

##### Joseph's character #####
Genesis just recorded a period of time where Joseph's ancestors and brothers struggled with sin. Joseph's character in this chapter is upright. It gained him great favor in the eyes of Pharaoh and helped to save his people. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]]l, [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/upright]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/save]])
