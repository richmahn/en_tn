# behold, seven heads

Pharaoh uses the word "Behold" to make Joseph pay attention to surprising information.

# seven heads

The words "of grain" are understood. Alternate translation: "seven heads of grain" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# came up upon one stalk

"grew up on one stem." The stalk is the thick or tall part of a plant. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Genesis 41:5](./05.md).
