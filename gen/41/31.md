# The abundance will not be remembered ... because of the famine that will follow

Joseph expresses an idea in two ways to emphasize its importance. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# because of the famine that will follow

This speaks about the famine as if it were a thing that travels and follows behind something else. Alternate translation: "because of the time of famine that will happen afterwards" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
