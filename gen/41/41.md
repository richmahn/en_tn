# See, I have put you

The word "See" adds emphasis to what Pharaoh says next. Alternate translation: "Look, I have put you"

# I have put you over all the land of Egypt

The phrase "put you over" means to give authority. Here "land" refers to the people. Alternate translation: "I put you in charge of everyone in Egypt" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
