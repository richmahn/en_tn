Here "hand" and "foot" stand for a person's actions. Alternate translation: "no person in Egypt will do anything without your permission" or "every person in Egypt must ask your permission before they do anything" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# no man

Here "man" refers to any person in general, whether male or female. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
