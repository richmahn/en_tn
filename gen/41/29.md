# Look, seven

"Pay attention, because what I am about to say is both true and important: seven"

# seven years of great abundance will come throughout all the land of [Egypt](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/egypt)

This speaks about the years of abundance as if time is something that travels and comes to a place. AT: "there will be seven years in which there will be plenty of food throughout the land of [Egypt](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/egypt)" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
