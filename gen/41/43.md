# He had him ride in the second chariot which he possessed

This act makes clear to the people that Joseph is second only to [Pharaoh](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/pharaoh). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])

# Bend the knee

"Bow down and honor Joseph." To bend the knee and bow down was a sign of honor and respect. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])

# [Pharaoh](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/pharaoh) put him over all the land

The phrase "put you over" means to give authority. Here "land" refers to the people. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Genesis 41:41](./39.md). AT: "I put you in charge of everyone in [Egypt](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/egypt)"(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
