# General Information:

The chief cupbearer continues to speak to Pharaoh.

# There was with us there

"In prison there was with the chief baker and me"

# the captain of the guard

The soldier in charge of the royal guards. See how you translated this in [Genesis 40:2-3](../40/02.md).

# We told him and he interpreted for us our dreams

"We told him our dreams and he explained their meanings to us"

# He interpreted for each of us according to his dream

Here "his" refers to the cupbearer and baker individually, not to the one interpreting the dream. Alternate translation: "He explained what was going to happen to both of us" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
