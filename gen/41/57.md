# All the earth was coming to Egypt

Here "earth" stands for the people from all regions. AT: "People were coming to Egypt from all the surrounding regions" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# in all the earth

"throughout the land." It is likely that all the different trading partners and nations that were part of the Egyptian trading routes effected by the drought came to Egypt for grain.
