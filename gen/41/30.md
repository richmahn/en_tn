Joseph continues interpreting Pharaoh's dreams.

## Seven years of famine will come after them ##

"Seven years of famine will follow the seven years of great abundance"

## all the abundance will be forgotten...and the famine will devastate the land. The abundance will not be remembered...because of the famine that will follow ##

Joseph expresses an idea in two ways to emphasize its importance. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## That the dream was repeated to Pharaoh is because the matter has established by God ##

"God gave you two dreams to show you that these events will happen" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
