## translationNotes

* Joseph continues interpreting Pharaoh's dreams.
* **Seven years of famine will come after them** - "Seven years of famine will follow the seven years of great abundance"
* **all the abundance will be forgotten...and the famine will devastate the land. The abundance will not be remembered...because of the famine that will follow** - Joseph expresses an idea in two ways to emphasize its importance. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
* **That the dream was repeated to Pharaoh is because the matter has established by God** - "God gave you two dreams to show you that these events will happen" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
