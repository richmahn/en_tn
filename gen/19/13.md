# we are about to destroy

The word "we" here is exclusive. Only the two angels would destroy the city; Lot would not destroy it. If your language has an exclusive form of "we," use it here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

# the accusations against it before Yahweh have become so loud

This can be reworded so that the abstract noun "accusations" is expressed as a verb. See how similar words are translated in [Genesis 18:20](../18/20.md). Alternate translation: "so many people have been telling Yahweh that the people of this city are doing evil things" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
