## translationNotes

* **The two angels** - Genesis 18 said that two men went to Sodom. Here we learn that they are really angels. (See: [[en:bible:notes:gen:18:22]])
* **the gate of Sodom** - "the entrance of the city Sodom." The city had a wall around it, and people had to go through a gate to get into it. This was a very important place in a city. Important people often spent time there.
* **I urge you to turn aside into your servants house** - This can be translated as "Please come and stay in your servant's house."
* **your servant's house** - Lot referred to himself as their servant in order to show them respect.
* **wash your feet** - People liked to wash their feet after traveling.
* **rise up early** - "wake up early"
* **we will spend the night** - When the two angels said this, they were referring only to themselves, not to Lot. The two of them planed to spend the night in the square. Some languages would use the exclusive form of "we" here. (See [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]]).
* **town square** - This is a public, outdoor place in the town.
* **they went with him** - "they turned and went with him"
