* **I cannot escape to the mountains, because the disaster will overtake me** - The implicit information about why the disaster would overtake him can be made explicit: "I cannot escape to those faraway mountains because the disaster will reach me before I can get there." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
