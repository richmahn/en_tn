## Then the men said ##

"Then the two men said" or "Then the angels said"

## Do you have anyone else here? ##

"Are there any other members of your family in the city?" or Do you have any other family members in this place?

## whoever you have in the city ##

"any other members of your family living in this city"

## we are about to destroy ##

The word "we" here is exclusive. Only the two angels would destroy the city; Lot would not destroy it. If your language has an exclusive form of "we," use it here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

## the outcry against its people has become so loud before Yahweh ##

This could also be translated as "people have cried out to Yahweh so loudly against the people of this city."
