"[Lot](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/lot)." The men are speaking to each other. If this would be unclear in your language, you may have the men speak to [Lot](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/lot) here, as in UDB.

Here "has become our judge" is an idiom that means [Lot](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/lot) is acting as if he can tell the men what actions are right or wrong. AT: "he acts as if he has the authority to tell us what is right and what is wrong" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

"Because you are telling us that what we are doing is wrong, we"

# we will deal worse with you than with them

The men are angry that [Lot](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/lot) said, "Do not act so wickedly" ([Genesis 19:7](./06.md)), so they are threatening to act more wickedly than [Lot](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/lot) had feared at first. AT: "we will act more wickedly with you than we will with them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
