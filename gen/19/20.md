# let me escape there (is it not a little one?), and my life will be saved

Lot used this rhetorical question to get the angels to notice that the city really is a small one. Alternate translation: "let me escape there. You can see how small it is. If you let us go there we will live" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# let me escape there

Lot's full request can be made explicit. Alternate translation: "instead of destroying that city, let me escape there" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# my life will be saved

It is implied that the lives of Lot's family will be saved along with his. This can also be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "so that we will live" or "so that we will survive" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
