# Lot went out

"So Lot left the house"

# his sons-in-law, the men who had promised to marry his daughters

The phrase "the men who had promised to marry his daughters" explains what "sons-in-law" means here. Alternate translation: "the men who were going to marry his daughters" or "his daughters' fianc√©s" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
