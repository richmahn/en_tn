"The sun had risen over the earth." The phrase "upon the earth" can be left implicit as it is in the UDB where it is not translated. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

"arrived at Zoar" or "entered Zoar"

“Yahweh caused sulfur and fire from Yahweh to rain down from the sky on Sodom and Gomorrah”

The phrase "from Yahweh" means that the sulfur and fire came from God's power. Some versions leave out "from Yahweh" since "Yahweh rained down" also shows that they came from his power.

## sulfur and fire ##

This can be translated as "burning sulfur" or "burning stones and fire" or "fiery rain."

## inhabitants of those cities ##

"people who lived in those cities"
