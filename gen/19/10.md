# But the men

"But Lot's two guests" or "But the two angels"

# the men reached out their hands and brought ... them and shut

Your language may need to add that the men opened the door first. Alternate translation: 'the men opened the door far enough so they could reach out their hands and pull ... them, and then they shut" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
