# cannot do anything

This can be made more explicit. AT: "cannot destroy the other cities" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# [Zoar](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/zoar)

Translators may add a footnote that says "The name [Zoar](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/zoar) sounds like the Hebrew word that means 'little.' Lot called this town 'little' in Genesis 19:20."
