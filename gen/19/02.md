# my masters

This was a term of respect [Lot](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/lot) used for the angels.

# I urge you to turn aside into your servant's house

"Please come and stay in your servant's house"

# your servant's house

[Lot](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/lot) refers to himself as their servant in order to show them respect. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# wash your feet

People liked to wash their feet after traveling.

# rise up early

"wake up early"

# we will spend the night

When the two angels said this, they were referring only to themselves, not to [Lot](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/lot). The two of them planned to spend the night in the square. Some languages would use the exclusive form of "we" here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

# town square

This is a public, outdoor place in the town.
