# Therefore the well was called Beer Lahai Roi

Translators may add a footnote that says "Beer Lahai Roi means 'the well of the living one who sees me.'" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# behold, it is between [Kadesh](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/kadesh) and Bered

The word "behold" here draws attention to the fact that the well was in a place that the author and his readers knew. AT: "in fact, it is between [Kadesh](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/kadesh) and Bered" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
