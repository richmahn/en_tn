#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 16:11-14, which is an extended quotation.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Plural marriage #####
Abram married Hagar while he was also married to Sarai. Even though Abram had his wife's permission, this was an immoral and sinful action. It also showed a lack of faith in God. Sarai quickly became jealous of Hagar.
