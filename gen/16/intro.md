# Genesis 16 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations set each line of poetry further to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetry in 16:11-12.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Plural marriage #####
Abram married Hagar while he was also married to Sarai. Even though Abram had his wife's permission, this was an immoral and sinful action. It also showed a lack of faith in God. Sarai quickly became jealous of Hagar. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/jealous]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
