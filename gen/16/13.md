## Yahweh who spoke to her ##

This can be translated as "Yahweh, because he spoke to her."

## Do I really continue to see, even after he has seen me? ##

Hagar used this rhetorical question to express her amazement that she was still alive even after she met God. People expected that if they met God, they would die. It can also be translated as an exclamation as in the UDB. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## Do I really continue to see ##

In this verse "see" is metonym that means "live." It can be translated as "Do I really continue to live?" ((See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## Therefore the well was called Beerlahairoi ##

Translators may add a footnote that says "Beerlahairoi means 'the well of the living one who sees me.'" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

## behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered ##

The word “behold” here draws attention to the fact that the well was in a place that the author and his readers knew. You can also translate it here as "it is between Kadesh and Bered" or "In fact, it is between Kadesh and Bered."
