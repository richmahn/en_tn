# Yahweh who spoke to her

"Yahweh, because he spoke to her"

# Do I really continue to see, ... me?

Hagar used this rhetorical question to express her amazement that she was still alive even after she met God. People expected that if they met God, they would die. Here seeing represents living. AT: "I am surprised that I am still alive, ... me." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# Therefore the well was called Beer Lahai Roi

Translators may add a footnote that says "Beer Lahai Roi means 'the well of the living one who sees me.'" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered

The word "behold" here draws attention to the fact that the well was in a place that the author and his readers knew. AT: "in fact, it is between Kadesh and Bered" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
