# Potiphar put everything that he had under Joseph's care

When something is "put under someone's care," it means that the person is responsible for its care and safe-keeping. Alternate translation: "So Potiphar put Joseph in charge of everything that he had" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# He did not have to think about anything except the food that he ate

He did not have to worry about anything in his household; he only had to make decisions about what he wanted to eat. This can be stated in positive form. Alternate translation: "Potiphar only had to think about what he wanted to eat. He did not have to worry about anything else in his house" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])

# Now

The word "now" marks a break in the story line as the author gives background information about Joseph. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])

# handsome and attractive

Both of the words have same meaning. They refer to Joseph's pleasing appearance. He was likely good-looking and strong. Alternate translation: "handsome and strong" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
