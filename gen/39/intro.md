# Genesis 39 General Notes #

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### God's power #####
The account of Joseph focuses on the power of God. God is able to protect his people despite the evil actions of some. He also is able to continue to bless them despite their circumstances. This is a sign of Yahweh's covenant faithfulness. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/peopleofgod]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/bless]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sign]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/covenantfaith]])

##### Joseph's character #####
Genesis just recorded a period of time where Joseph's ancestors and brothers struggled with sin. Joseph's character in this chapter is upright. He chose to do what was right, even when it could cause him harm. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])
