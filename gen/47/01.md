# Joseph went in and told Pharaoh

It is not clear whether Joseph went with his father and family from Canaan to Goshen and then alone from Goshen to see the Pharaoh, back to Goshen for his five brothers, and then back to Pharaoh, as the ULT implies, or whether he brought the five brothers with him the first time he went from Goshen to Pharaoh, as the UST states.
