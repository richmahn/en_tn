# Your servants are shepherds

"Your servants shepherd flocks"

# Your servants

Joseph's brothers refer to themselves as "your servants." This is a formal way of speaking to someone with more authority. This can be stated in first person. Alternate translation: "We, your servants" or "We" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# as our ancestors

"both we and our forefathers" or "both we and our ancestors"
