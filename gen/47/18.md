## translationNotes

* **they came to him** - "the people came to Joseph"
* **We will not hide from my lord** - The people refer to Joseph as "my lord." This is a formal way of speaking to someone with greater authority. Alternate translation: "We will not hide from you, our lord"
* **There is nothing left in the sight of my lord** - "We have nothing left to give you, our lord"
* **Why should we die before your eyes, both we and our land?** - The word "eyes" refers to Joseph's sight. The people use a question to emphasize how desperate they are to buy food. Alternate translation: "Please do not just watch as we die and our land is ruined." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
