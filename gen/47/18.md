# they came to him

"the people came to Joseph"

# We will not hide from my master

The people refer to Joseph as "my master." This is a formal way of speaking to someone with greater authority. It can be stated in second person. Alternate translation: "We will not hide from you, our master" or "We will not hide from you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# There is nothing left in the sight of my master

Here "sight" stands for Joseph himself. Alternate translation: "We have nothing left to give you, our master" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
