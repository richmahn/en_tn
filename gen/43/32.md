# The servants served Joseph by himself and the brothers by themselves. The [Egypt](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/egypt)ians there ate with him by themselves

This means that Joseph, the brothers, and the other [Egypt](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/egypt)ians are eating in three different places within the same room. AT: "The servants served Joseph by himself and the brothers by themselves and the [Egypt](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/egypt)ians, who were eating with him, by themselves"

# The [Egypt](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/egypt)ians there ate with him by themselves

These are probably other [Egypt](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/egypt)ian officials who ate with Joseph, but they still sat separately from him and the Hebrew brothers.

# because the [Egypt](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/egypt)ians could not eat bread with the Hebrews, for that is detestable to the [Egypt](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/egypt)ians

This can be translated as a new sentence: "They did this because the [Egypt](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/egypt)ians thought it was shameful to eat with the Hebrews"

# could not eat bread

Here "bread" stands for food in general. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
