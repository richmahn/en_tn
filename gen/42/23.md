## translationNotes

* **an interpreter** - An "interpreter" is someone who translates what one person says into another language. Joseph placed an interpreter between himself and his brothers to make it seem like he did not speak their language.
* **spoke to them** - Joseph was still speaking a different language and using the interpreter to speak to his brothers.
* **bound him before their eyes** - Here "eyes" refers to their sight. Alternate translation: "bound him in their sight" or "bound him as they watched." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
* **to give them provisions** - "to give them the supplies they needed"
* **It was done for them** - "The servants did for them everything that Joseph commanded"
