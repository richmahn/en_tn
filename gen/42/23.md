# They did not know ... an interpreter between them

This shifts from the main story line to background information that explains why the brothers thought Joseph could not understand them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])

# an interpreter

An "interpreter" is someone who translates what one person says into another language. Joseph placed an interpreter between himself and his brothers to make it seem like he did not speak their language.
