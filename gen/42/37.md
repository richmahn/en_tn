## translationNotes

* **Put him under my authority** - "Put me in charge of him"
* **My son will not go down with you** - "My son will not go with you to Egypt." In 42:8 the word "you" is plural and refers to Jacob's older sons. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
* **For his brother is dead and he alone is left** - The full meaning can be made explicit: "For my wife, Rachel, only had two children. Joseph is dead and Benjamin is the only one left." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
* **then you will bring down my gray hair with sorrow to Sheol** - Here "gray hair" refers to Jacob and emphasizes his old age. Also, "bring down...to Sheol" is another way of saying "cause to die." Alternate translation: "then you will cause me, an old man, to die of sorrow." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
