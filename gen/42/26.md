# As one of them opened his sack to give his donkey feed in the lodging place, he saw his money. Behold, it was in the opening of his sack

"When they stopped at a place for the night, one of the brothers opened his sack to get food for his donkey. In the sack he saw his money!"

# Behold

The word "behold" here alerts us to pay attention to the surprising information that follows.

# My money has been put back

This can be stated in active form. AT: "Someone has put my money back" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# Look at it

"Look in my sack!"

# Their hearts sank

To become afraid is spoken of as if their heart were sinking. Here "hearts" stands for courage. AT: "They became very afraid" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
