# The sons of Israel came to buy among those who came

The word "came" can be translated as "went." Also, the words "grain" and "Egypt" are understood. Alternate translation: "The sons of Israel went to by grain along with other people who went to Egypt" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-go]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
