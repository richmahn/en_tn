# all flesh

See how you translated these words in [Genesis 6:12](./11.md).

# the earth is filled with violence through them

"people everywhere on earth are violent"

# I will destroy them with the earth

"I will destroy both them and the earth" or "I will destroy them when I destroy the earth"

# an ark

This refers to a very large box that would be able to float on water even in a very bad storm. "a large boat" or "a ship" or "a barge"

# cypress wood

People do not know exactly what kind of tree this was. "wood used for building boats" or "good wood"

# cover it with pitch

The reason for doing this can be made explicit. AT: "spread pitch on it" or "paint tar on it" or "cover it with pitch to make it waterproof" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# pitch

This is a thick, sticky or oily liquid that people put on the outside of a boat to stop water from going through gaps in the wood into the boat.

# cubits

A cubit was a unit of measure, a little less than half a meter long. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bdistance]])

# three hundred cubits

"138 meters." You may use the Hebrew measuring units from the ULB or the metric units from the UDB or your own culture's units if you know how they compare to the metric units. You may also write a footnote that says: "Three hundred cubits is about 138 meters." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bdistance]])

# fifty cubits

"twenty-three meters" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bdistance]])
