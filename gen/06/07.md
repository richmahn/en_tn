# I will wipe away mankind ... from the surface of the earth

The writer speaks of God killing people as if God were wiping dirt off a flat surface. AT: "I will destroy mankind ... so that there will not be any people on the earth" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# I will wipe away mankind whom I have created

Some languages would need to translate this as two sentences. AT: "I created mankind. I will wipe them away" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish]])

# wipe away

"completely destroy." Here "wipe away" is used in a negative sense, for God is talking about destroying the people because of their sin.
