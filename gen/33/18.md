# General Information:

This starts a new part of the story. The author describes what Jacob did after he rested in Succoth.

# When Jacob came from Paddan Aram

"After Jacob left Paddan Aram"

# When Jacob ... he arrived ... He camped

This only mentions Jacob because he is the leader of the family. It is implied that his family was with him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# He camped near

"He set up his camp near"
