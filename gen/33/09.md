## I have enough ##

This can be made more explicit: "I have enough property." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]]).

## if I have found favor in your sight ##

"if you are pleased with me." Alternate translation: "since you are pleased with me."

## my gift from my hand ##

"this gift that I am giving to you"

## for, indeed ##

This can be translated as a new sentence: "For, certainly"

## I have seen your face, and it is like seeing the face of God ##

Jacob compares Esau's face to God's face. The meaning of this is unclear. Possible meanings are 1) Jacob is happy that Esau has forgiven him like God has forgiven him or 2) Jacob is amazed to see his brothers again like he was amazed to see God or 3) Jacob is humbled to be in Esau's presence like he was humbled to be in God's presence.

## God has dealt graciously with me ##

"God has treated me very well" or "God has blessed me very much"

## Thus Jacob urged him, and Esau accepted it ##

It was customary to refuse a gift first, but then to accept the gift before the giver was offended.
