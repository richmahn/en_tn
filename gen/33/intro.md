# Genesis 33 General Notes #

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Jacob's fear #####
Jacob feared his brother. He showed Esau great respect and sought to protect his family from Esau's power. He did not fear and trust Yahweh. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/fear]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/trust]])

##### Favoritism #####
Jacob showed favoritism towards Rachel and Joseph. He arranged the family according to those he loved the most. Rachel and Joseph were the most protected from a potential attack by Esau. He would have rather had everyone else die, in order to spare their lives. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/favor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
