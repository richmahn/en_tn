# if I have found favor in your eyes

The phrase "found favor" is an idiom which means to be approved of by someone. Here "eyes" are a metonym for sight, and  sight is a metaphor representing his evaluation. AT: "if you are pleased with me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# my gift from my hand

Here "hand" refers to [Jacob](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/jacob). AT: "this gift that I am giving to you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# my hand, for indeed

This can be translated as a new sentence: "my hand. For certainly"

# I have seen your face, and it is like seeing the face of God

The meaning of this simile is unclear. Possible meanings are 1) [Jacob](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/jacob) is happy that [Esau](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/esau) has forgiven him like God has forgiven him or 2) [Jacob](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/jacob) is amazed to see his brother again like he was amazed to see God or 3) [Jacob](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/jacob) is humbled to be in [Esau](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/esau)'s presence like he was humbled to be in God's presence. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# I have seen your face

Here "face" stands for [Esau](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/esau). It may be best to translate as "face" because of the importance of the word "face" here with "face of God" and "face to face" in [Genesis 32:30](../32/29.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
