# if I have found favor in your eyes

The phrase "found favor" is an idiom which means to be approved of by someone. Here "eyes" are a metonym for sight, and  sight is a metaphor representing his evaluation. Alternate translation: "if you are pleased with me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# my gift from my hand

Here "hand" refers to Jacob. Alternate translation: "this gift that I am giving to you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# my hand, for indeed

This can be translated as a new sentence: "my hand. For certainly"

# I have seen your face, and it is like seeing the face of God

The meaning of this simile is unclear. Possible meanings are 1) Jacob is happy that Esau has forgiven him like God has forgiven him or 2) Jacob is amazed to see his brother again like he was amazed to see God or 3) Jacob is humbled to be in Esau's presence like he was humbled to be in God's presence. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# I have seen your face

Here "face" stands for Esau. It may be best to translate as "face" because of the importance of the word "face" here with "face of God" and "face to face" in [Genesis 32:30](../32/30.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
