# Genesis 08 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations indent each line of poetry to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetry in  8:22, which is part of what Yahweh was telling Noah.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Flood waters #####
The waters receded after this great flood. Because there was so much water, and it came from God, it is described in a unique way. 

##### The mountains of Ararat #####
It is unclear where Ararat was located. Many people believe it is located in the modern country of Turkey.
