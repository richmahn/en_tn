# Genesis 08 General Notes

#### Structure and formatting

Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 8:22, which is part of what Yahweh was telling Noah.

#### Special concepts in this chapter

##### Flood waters
The waters receded after this great flood. Because there was so much water, and it came from God, it is described in a unique way.

##### The mountains of Ararat
It is unclear where Ararat was located. Many people believe it is located in the modern country of Turkey.
