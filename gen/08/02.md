# The fountains of the deep and the windows of heaven were closed

"The water stopped coming out of the ground and the rain stopped falling." This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "God closed the fountains of the deep and the windows of heaven" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# fountains of the deep

"water from under the earth." See how this is translated in [Genesis 7:11](../07/11.md).

# the windows of heaven were closed

This refers to the rain stopping. It describes the sky as a ceiling that keeps the waters above it from falling down to the earth. When the windows, or doors, in the sky were closed, the water stopped coming through them. See how "the windows of heaven" is translated in [Genesis 7:11](../07/11.md). Alternate translation: "the sky closed" or "the doors in the sky closed"
