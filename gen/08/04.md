# came to rest

"landed" or "stopped on solid ground"

# in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month ... tenth month

Because Moses wrote this book, it is possible he is referring to the seventh month and tenth month of the Hebrew calendar, but this is uncertain. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-hebrewmonths]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
