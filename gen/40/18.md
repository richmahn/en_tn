"Here is what the dream means"

Joseph also used the phrase "will lift up your head" when he spoke to the cupbearer in [Genesis 40:12](./12.md). Here it has a different meaning. Possible meanings are 1) "will lift up your head to put a rope around your neck and hang you from a tree" or 2) "will lift up your head to cut it off."
