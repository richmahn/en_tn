# The chief of the cupbearers

The most important person who brings drinks to the king. See how you translated this in [Genesis 40:2](./01.md).

# In my dream, behold, a vine was in front of me

"In my dream, I saw a vine in front of me!" The cupbearer uses word "behold" here to show that he was surprised by what he saw in his dream and to alert Joseph to pay attention.
