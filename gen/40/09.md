## The chief cupbearer ##

See how you translated this in [Genesis 40:1](./01.md).

## In my dream, behold, a vine was in front of me ##

The word “behold” here shows that the cupbearer was surprised by what he saw. Alternate translation: "In my dream, I saw a vine in front of me!"

## the clusters of grapes ripened ##

"its clusters ripened into grapes"
