See how this was translated in [Genesis 40:1](./01.md).

## that the interpretation was favorable  ##

<b>that the interpretation was favorable <b>- "that the meaning of the dream was good"

## I also had a dream, and ##

“Also in my dream,”

## behold, three baskets of bread were on my head ##

The word “behold” here shows that the baker was surprised by what he saw. Alternate translation: "there were three baskets of bread on my head!"
