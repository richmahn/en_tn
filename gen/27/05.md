# Now

The word "now" shows a change of emphasis to Rebekah and Jacob. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])

# Rebekah heard it when Isaac spoke to Esau his son

"Rebekah heard Isaac speaking to his son Esau"

# Esau went ... bring it back. Rebekah spoke to Jacob

After Esau leaves, Rebekah speaks to Jacob because of what she heard. Alternate translation: "So when Esau went ... bring it back, Rebekah spoke to Jacob" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-connectingwords]])

# to Esau his son ... to Jacob her son

Esau and Jacob were both sons of Isaac and Rebekah. They are called "his son" and "her son" to emphasize that one parent preferred one son over the other son.
