## translationNotes

* **I am a smooth man** - "I am a man with smooth skin" or "I am not hairy"
* **Perhaps my father will touch me** - This can also be translated as a rhetorical question: "What if my father touches me?" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **and I will seem to him as a deceiver** - "and he will think that I am a liar." This can be a new sentence: "He will know that I am deceiving him."
* **I will bring a curse upon me and not a blessing** - Alternate translation: "Then because of what I do, he will curse me and not bless me."
