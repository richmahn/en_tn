Rebekah continues to speak to her younger son Jacob.

## obey my voice as I command you ##

Rebekah said "my voice" to refer to what she was saying. This could be translated as "obey me and do what I tell you." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## I will make delicious food from them for your father, just like he loves ##

See how a similar sentence was translated in [Genesis 27:3](./03.md).

## You will take it to your father ##

"Then you will bring it to your father." This can also be translated as a command: "Then take it to your father."

## so that he may eat it, so that he may bless you ##

"and after he eats it, he will bless you"

## before his death ##

"before he dies"
