# Is he not rightly named Jacob?

Esau uses a question to emphasize his anger at Jacob. Alternate translation: "Jacob is certainly the right name for my brother!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Jacob

Translators may also add a footnote that says: "The name Jacob means 'he grasps the heel.' In the original language the name 'Jacob' also sounds like the word for 'he deceives.'"

# He took away my birthright

This speaks about a birthright as if it were an object that a person could take away. Alternate translation: "What was once my birthright is now his because he tricked me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# now he has taken away my blessing

This speaks about a blessing as if it were an object that person could take away. Alternate translation: "now he has tricked you into blessing him instead of me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Have you not reserved a blessing for me

Esau knows that his father cannot bless him with the same things that he blessed Jacob. Esau is asking if there is anything left to say to him that Isaac did not say while blessing Jacob.
