## translationNotes

* **Is he not rightly named Jacob?** - Esau uses a question to emphasize his anger at Jacob. Alternate translation: "Jacob is certainly the right name for my brother." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **Jacob** - Translators may also add a footnote that says “The name Jacob means 'he grasps the heel.' This is a way of saying 'he deceives.'”
* **my birthright** - "my right as firstborn to inherit most of our father's wealth"
* **What more can I do for you, my son?** - Isaac uses a question for emphasis. Alternate translation: "There is nothing else I can do for you."
