# Is he not rightly named [Jacob](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/jacob)?

[Esau](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/esau) uses a question to emphasize his anger at [Jacob](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/jacob). AT: "[Jacob](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/jacob) is certainly the right name for my brother!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# [Jacob](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/jacob)

Translators may also add a footnote that says: "The name [Jacob](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/jacob) means 'he grasps the heel.' In the original language the name '[Jacob](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/jacob)' also sounds like the word for 'he deceives.'"

# He took away my birthright

This speaks about a birthright as if it were an object that a person could take away. AT: "What was once my birthright is now his because he tricked me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# now he has taken away my blessing

This speaks about a blessing as if it were an object that person could take away. AT: "now he has tricked you into blessing him instead of me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Have you not reserved a blessing for me

[Esau](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/esau) knows that his father cannot bless him with the same things that he blessed [Jacob](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/jacob). [Esau](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/esau) is asking if there is anything left to say to him that Isaac did not say while blessing [Jacob](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/jacob).
