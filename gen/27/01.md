# his eyes were dim

This speaks about being nearly blind as if the eyes were a lamp and the light has nearly gone out. Alternate translation: "he was nearly blind" or "he was almost blind" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Here I am

"I am here" or "I am listening." See how you translated this in [Genesis 22:1](../22/01.md).
