## translationNotes

* This is Isaac's blessing. He thought he was speaking to Esau, but he was speaking to Jacob.
* **you** - Here "you" is singular and refers to Jacob. But the blessing would also apply to Jacob's descendants. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
* **dew from heaven** - "mist in the air" or "rain from the sky"
* **and of the fatness of the earth** - The word "fatness of the earth" refers to "fertile land" or "a land that produces plenty." This could be translated as "and good soil for producing crops." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
