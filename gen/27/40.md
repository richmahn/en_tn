# your ... you

In 27:39-40 these pronouns are singular and refer to Esau, but what Isaac says also applies to Esau's descendants (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# By your sword you will live

Here "sword" stands for violence. Alternate translation: "You will rob and kill people in order to get what you need to live" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# you will shake his yoke from off your neck

This speaks about someone having a master as if the master's control over the person were a yoke that the person had to carry. Alternate translation: "you will free yourself from his control" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
