## translationNotes

* **the people that they had acquired** - "the people that they had bought" or "the people that they had gathered to be with them." This would include servants and slaves.
* **all their possessions** - the Hebrew, "Nephesh," for "possessions" may be referring to the living animals they had in their flocks. It may also be taken as a reference to human beings.
