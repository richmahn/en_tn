# Pharaoh summoned Abram

"Pharaoh called Abram" or "Pharaoh ordered Abram to come to him"

# What is this that you have done to me?

Pharaoh used this rhetorical question to show how angry he was about what Abram had done to him. It can also be stated as an exclamation. Alternate translation: "You have done a terrible thing to me!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
