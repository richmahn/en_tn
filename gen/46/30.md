# Now let me die

"Now I am ready to die" or "Now I will die happy"

# since I have seen your face, that you are still alive

Here "face" stands for the entire person. [Jacob](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/jacob) was expressing joy at seeing Joseph. AT: "since I have seen you alive again" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
