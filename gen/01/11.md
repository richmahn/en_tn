## translationNotes

* **Let the earth sprout vegetation** - This can be translated as "Let vegetation sprout up on the earth" or "Let vegetation grow on the earth."
* **vegetation, plants yielding seed and fruit trees bearing fruit** - "vegetation" is used here as a general term that includes all plants and trees. This can be translated as "vegetation, each plant that bears seed and each tree that bears fruit" or "vegetation. Let them be plants that produce seeds and fruit trees that produce fruit."
* **plants** - These are kinds of vegetation that have soft stems, rather than woody stems.
* **fruit trees bearing fruit whose seed is in them** - This can also be translated as "trees that bear fruit with seeds in them."
* **after their kind** - The seeds would produce plants and trees that would be like the ones they came from. In this way, the plants and trees would "reproduce themselves" (UDB).
* **It was so** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:01:06]].
* **God saw that it was good** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:01:09]].
* **This was evening and morning** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:01:03]].
* **the third day** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:01:06]].
