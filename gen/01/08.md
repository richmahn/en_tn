# expanse

large empty space. The Jewish people thought of this space as being shaped like the inside of dome or the inside of a bowl that is turned upside down.

# evening and morning

This refers to the whole day. The writer speaks of the whole day as if it were these two parts. In the Jewish culture, a day begins when the sun sets. See how you translated this in [Genesis 1:5](./03.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])

# the second day

This refers to the second day that the universe existed. See how you translated "the first day" in [Genesis 1:5](./03.md) and decide if you should translate this the same way.
