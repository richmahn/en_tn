# General Information:

God continues speaking.

# every bird of the heavens

"all the birds that fly in the sky"

# that has the breath of life

"that breathes." This phrase emphasizes that these animals had a different kind of life than the plants. Plants do not breathe, and were to be used as food for the animals. Here "life" means physical life.

# It was so

"It happened like that" or "That is what happened." What God commanded happened just as he said it should. This phrase appears throughout the chapter and has the same meaning. See how you translated it in [Genesis 1:7](./06.md).

# Behold, it

"This is true and important: it"

# it was very good

Now when God looked at everything he had made, it was "very good. "See how you translated "it was good" in [Genesis 1:10](./09.md).

# evening and morning

This refers to the whole day. The writer speaks of the whole day as if it were these two parts. In the Jewish culture, a day begins when the sun sets. See how you translated this in [Genesis 1:5](./03.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])

# the sixth day

This refers to the sixth day that the universe existed. See how you translated "the first day" in [Genesis 1:5](./03.md) and decide if you should translate this the same way.
