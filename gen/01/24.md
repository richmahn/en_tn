## Let the earth produce living creatures ##

"Let the earth produce living things" or "Let many living animals live on the earth." See if you can translate "bring forth" here as you did in [Genesis 1:11](./11.md).

## after their kind ##

Possible meanings are 1) There would be many different kinds of animals, or 2) the animals would produce young animals like themselves. The UDB translates this with the first meaning in verse 24 (“various kinds of creatures”). It translates it with the second meaning in verse 24 (“They could all produce more animals of their same kind.”)

## livestock, creeping things, and beasts of the earth ##

This shows that God created all kinds of animals. If your language has another way of grouping all the animals, you can use that, or you can use these groups.

## livestock ##

This can be translated as "animals that people look after."

## creeping things ##

This can be translated as "small animals."

## beasts of the earth ##

This can be translated as "wild animals" or "dangerous animals."

## It was so ##

See how you translated this in [Genesis 1:6](./06.md).

## God made the beasts… ##

This can be translated as "In this way God made the beasts…."

## He saw that it was good ##

See how you translated this in [Genesis 1:9](./09.md).
