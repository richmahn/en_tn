## translationNotes

* **Let the earth produce living creatures** - "Let the earth produce living things" or "Let many living animals live on the earth." See if you can translate "bring forth" here as you did in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:01:11]].
* **each according to its own kind** - AT: “so that each kind of animal will produce more of its own kind.”
* **livestock, creeping things, and beasts of the earth** - This shows that God created all kinds of animals. If your language has another way of grouping all the animals, you can use that, or you can use these groups.
* **livestock** - This can be translated as "animals that people look after."
* **creeping things** - This can be translated as "small animals."
* **beasts of the earth** - This can be translated as "wild animals" or "dangerous animals."
* **It was so** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:01:06]].
* **God made the beasts…** - This can be translated as "In this way God made the beasts…."
