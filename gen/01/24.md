# Let the earth produce living creatures

"Let the earth produce living things" or "Let many living animals live on the earth." This is a command. By commanding that the earth should produce living creatures, God made the earth produce living creatures. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])

# each according to its own kind

"so that each kind of animal will produce more of its own kind"

# livestock, creeping things, and beasts of the earth

This shows that God created all kinds of animals. If your language has another way of grouping all the animals, you can use that, or you can use these groups.

# livestock

"animals that people look after"

# creeping things

"small animals"

# beasts of the earth

"wild animals" or "dangerous animals"

# It was so

"It happened like that" or "That is what happened." What God commanded happened just as he said it should. This phrase appears throughout the chapter and has the same meaning. See how you translated this in [Genesis 1:7](./06.md).

# God made the beasts

"In this way God made the beasts"

# He saw that it was good

Here "it" refers to the living creatures on the earth. See how you translated this in [Genesis 1:4](./03.md).
