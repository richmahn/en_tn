# This was evening and morning, the first day

God did these things on the first day that the universe existed.

# evening and morning

This refers to the whole day. The writer speaks of the whole day as if it were these two parts. In the Jewish culture, a day begins when the sun sets. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
