# God created man ... he created him

These two sentences mean the same thing and emphasize that God created people in his own image. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# God created man

The way that God created man was different from the way he created everything else. Do not specify that he created man by simply speaking, as in the preceding verses.
