## translationNotes

* **God blessed them** - The word "them" refers to the man and woman God had created.
* **Be fruitful, and multiply** - This is God's blessing. He told them to produce more people like themselves so that there would be many of them. See how you translated "Be fruitful and multiply" in [[en:bible:notes:gen:01:22]]. These two phrases, "Be fruitful" and "multiply," say basically the same thing for emphasis. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
* **Fill the earth** - Fill the earth with people.
