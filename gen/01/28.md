## Be fruitful, and multiply ##

This is God's blessing. He told them to produce more people like themselves so that there would be many of them. See how you translated "Be fruitful and multiply" in [Genesis 1:22](./22.md). These two phrases, "Be fruitful" and "multiply," say basically the same thing for emphasis. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
