# Let there be light

This is a command. By commanding that light should exist, God made it exist. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])

# God saw the light, that it was good

"God considered the light and was pleased with it." "Good" here means "pleasing" or "suitable."

# divided the light from the darkness

"separated the light and the darkness" or "made it light at one time and dark at another." This refers to God creating the daytime and the night time.

# This was evening and morning, the first day

God did these things on the first day that the universe existed.

# evening and morning

This refers to the whole day. The writer speaks of the whole day as if it were these two parts. In the Jewish culture, a day begins when the sun sets. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
