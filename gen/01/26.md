# Let us make

The word "us" here refers to God. God was saying what he intended to do. The pronoun "us" is plural. Possible reasons for the plural use are 1) the plural form suggests that God is discussing something with the angels that make up his heavenly court or 2) the plural form foreshadows the later New Testament implications that God exists in the form of the Holy Trinity. Some translate it as "Let me make" or "I will make." If you do this, consider adding a footnote to say that the word is plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pronouns]])

# man

"human beings" or "people." This word here does not mean males only.

# in our image, after our likeness

These two phrases mean the same thing and emphasize that God made mankind to be like him. This verse does not tell in what ways God made people to be like himself. God does not have a body, so it does not mean that people would look like God. AT: "to truly be like us" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pronouns]])

# have dominion over

"rule over" or "have authority over"

# God created man ... he created him

These two sentences mean the same thing and emphasize that God created people in his own image. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# God created man

The way that God created man was different from the way he created everything else. Do not specify that he created man by simply speaking, as in the preceding verses.
