# God created

"In this way God created"

# great sea creatures

"large animals that live in the sea"

# after its kind

Living things of the same "kind" are like the ones they came from. See how you translated "kind" in [Genesis 1:11,12](./11.md).

# every winged bird

"every flying thing that has wings." If the word for birds is used, it may be more natural in some languages to simply say "every bird," since all birds have wings.

# God saw that it was good

Here "it" refers to the birds and the fish. See how you translated this in [Genesis 1:4](../01/04.md).
