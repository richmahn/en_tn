## translationNotes

* **Let the waters…be gathered** - This can be translated with an active verb: "Let the waters…gather" or "Let the water…come together" (UDB) (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
* **let the dry land appear** - This can be translated as "let dry land become visible" or "let the dry land become clear" or "let the land be uncovered." The water had covered the land. Now the water would move aside and some of the land would be uncovered.
* **dry land** - This refers to land that is not covered with water. It does not refer to land that is too dry for farming.
* **It was so** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:01:06]].
* **earth** - "land" or "ground"
* **He saw that it was good** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:01:03]]. Here "it" refers to the land and the sea.
