# Joseph went up

It was common to use the phrase "went up" when speaking of traveling from Egypt to Canaan.

# All the officials ... the elders ... the senior officials

All of Pharaoh's most important leaders attended the burial procession.

# the elders of his household

Here "household" refers to Pharaoh's royal court.

# land of Egypt, with all Joseph's household and his brothers, and his father's household

This can be translated as a new sentence: "land of Egypt. Joseph's household, his brothers, and his father's household also went with him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-events]])
