# surely come to you

In [Genesis 50:24/26](./24.md) the word "you" refers to Joseph's brothers, but it also stands for their descendants. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# lead you up out of this land to the land

It was common to use the word "up" when speaking of traveling from Egypt to Canaan. Alternate translation: "bring you out of this land and take you to the land" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-events]])
