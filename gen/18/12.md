# After I am worn-out and my master is old, will I now have this pleasure?

You may want to add "of having a baby." [Sarah](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/sarah) used this rhetorical question because she did not believe that she could have a child. AT: "I cannot believe that I will experience the joy of having a child. My master is also too old" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# my master is old

This means "since my husband is also old."

# my master

This is a title of respect that [Sarah](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/sarah) gave to her husband [Abraham](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/abraham).
