# a little water ... a little food

"some water ... some food." Saying "little" was a polite way of showing generosity. Abraham would give them more than enough water and food.

# your ... you

Abraham speaks to all three of the men, so "you" and "your" are plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
