AT: "if you have evaluated me and approve" or "if you are pleased with me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# in your eyes

Abraham is speaking to one of the men. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# do not pass by

"please do not keep on going"

# your servant

"me." Abraham refers to himself this way in order to show respect to his guest.

# Let a little water be brought

This can be stated in active form. AT: "Let me bring you some water" or "My servant will bring you some water" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# a little water ... a little food

"some water ... some food." Saying "little" was a polite way of showing generosity. Abraham would give them more than enough water and food.

# wash your feet

This custom helped tired travelers to refresh themselves after walking long distances.

# your ... you

Abraham speaks to all three of the men, so "you" and "your" are plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
