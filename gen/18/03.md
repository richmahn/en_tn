# Lord

This is a title of respect. Possible meanings are 1) Abraham knew that one of these men was God or 2) Abraham knew that these men came on behalf of God.

# if I have found favor in your eyes

Here "found favor" is an idiom that means be approved of or that he is pleased with her. Here "eyes" are a metonym for sight, and  sight is a metaphor representing his evaluation. Alternate translation: "if you have evaluated me and approve" or "if you are pleased with me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# in your eyes

Abraham is speaking to one of the men. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# do not pass by

"please do not keep on going"

# your servant

"me." Abraham refers to himself this way in order to show respect to his guest.

# your ... you

Abraham speaks to all three of the men, so "you" and "your" are plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
