# the outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is so great

This can be reworded so that the abstract noun "outcry" is expressed as the verb "accuse." AT: "so many people have been accusing the people of Sodom and Gomorrah of doing evil things" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# their sin is so serious

"they have sinned so much"
