Yahweh speaks as if he knew about this matter because he had heard the cries and accusations coming from the people who had suffered. This can be reworded so that the abstract noun "outcry" is expressed as the verb "accuse." AT: "as wicked as those who are accusing them say that they are" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# If not

"If they are not as wicked as the outcry suggests"
