# the outcry against [Sodom](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/sodom) and [Gomorrah](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/gomorrah) is so great

This can be reworded so that the abstract noun "outcry" is expressed as the verb "accuse." AT: "so many people have been accusing the people of [Sodom](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/sodom) and [Gomorrah](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/gomorrah) of doing evil things" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# their sin is so serious

"they have sinned so much"
