* **Should I hide from Abraham what I am about to do** - God used this rhetorical question to say that he was going to talk to Abraham about something very important. "I will not hide from Abraham what I am about to do" or "I will tell Abraham what I am about to do." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **since Abraham will indeed become** - This tells why God planned to tell Abraham what he was going to do. It can be translated as a separate sentence after the rhetorical question.
* **all the nations of the earth will be blessed in him** - This can be translated with an active clause: "I will bless all the nations of the earth through Abraham." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
* **will be blessed in him** - This can be translated as "will be blessed because of Abraham" or "will be blessed because I have blessed Abraham." For translating "in him" see how you translated "through you" in [[en:bible:notes:gen:12:01]].
