Abraham continues talking to Yahweh.

## Perhaps there are ##

"Suppose there are"

## Will you sweep it away ##

Abraham was hoping that God would say "I will not sweep it away."

## sweep it away ##

"destroy it"

## and not spare the place for the sake of the fifty righteous that are there? ##

Abraham was hoping that God would say "I will spare the place for the sake of the fifty righteous people there."

## spare the place ##

This can be translated as "put up with" or "refrain from killing" or "let the people live."

## for the sake of ##

"because of"

## Far be it from you ##

"It is not like you" or "It seems far from your manner"

## such a thing, killing ##

"such a thing as killing" or "such a thing, that is, killing"

## Will not the Judge of all the earth do what is just? ##

Abraham used this a rhetorical question to say what he expected God to do: “The Judge of all the earth will certainly do what is just.” Since Abraham was speaking to the judge of all the earth, it may be more natural in some languages to say "you":  "Since you are the Judge of all the earth, you will surely do what is right."
