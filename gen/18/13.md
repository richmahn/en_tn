# Why did [Sarah](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/sarah) laugh and say, 'Will I really bear a child, when I am old'?

God used this rhetorical question to show that he knew what [Sarah](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/sarah) was thinking and that he was not pleased with it. He repeats [Sarah](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/sarah)'s rhetorical question ([Genesis 18:12](./11.md)) using different words. AT: "[Sarah](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/sarah) was wrong to laugh and say, 'I will not bear a child because I am too old!'"(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
