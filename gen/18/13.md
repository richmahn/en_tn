# Why did Sarah laugh and say, 'Will I really bear a child, when I am old'?

God used this rhetorical question to show that he knew what Sarah was thinking and that he was not pleased with it. He repeats Sarah's rhetorical question ([Genesis 18:12](./12.md)) using different words. Alternate translation: "Sarah was wrong to laugh and say, 'I will not bear a child because I am too old!'"(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
