## translationNotes

* **Why did Sarah laugh and say** - God used this rhetorical question to show that he knew what Sarah was thinking and that he was not pleased with it. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **Is anything too hard for Yahweh?** - "Is there anything too difficult for Yahweh to do?" or "Is there anything that Yahweh cannot do?" God used this rhetorical question to remind Abraham that God can do anything.
* **At the time appointed by me, in the spring** - "at the time I appointed." The phrase "in the spring" clarifies what time it was that God appointed.
* **Then Sarah denied it and said** - "The Sarah denied it by saying"
* **He replied** - "Yahweh replied"
* **No, you did laugh** - This means "No, that is not true; you did in fact laugh." In some languages, it would be better to translate this as "Yes, you did laugh."
