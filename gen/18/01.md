## oaks ##

See how you translated “oak” in [Genesis 12:6](../12/06.md).

## Mamre ##

This was the name of the man who owned the oak trees.

## in the tent doorway ##

"at the opening of the tent" or "at the entrance of the tent"

## heat of the day ##

"hottest time of day"

## He looked up and, behold, he saw three men standing ##

"He looked up and saw, and behold, three men were standing"

## behold ##

The word “behold” here shows us that what follows was surprising to Abraham. It can be translated here as "suddenly."

## across from him ##

"nearby" or "there." They were near him, but far enough away for him to run to them.
