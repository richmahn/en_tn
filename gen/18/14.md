# Is anything too hard for Yahweh?

"Is there anything that Yahweh cannot do?" Yahweh speaks of himself as if he were speaking of someone else to remind Abraham that he, Yahweh, is great and can do anything. Alternate translation: "There is nothing that I, Yahweh, cannot do!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# At the time appointed by me, in the spring

"At the time I have appointed, which is in the spring"
