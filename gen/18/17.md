# Should I hide from Abraham what I am about to do

God used this rhetorical question to say that he was going to talk to Abraham about something very important and that it was best for him to do so. Alternate translation: "I should not and will not hide from Abraham what I am about to do" or "I should and will tell Abraham what I am about to do" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
