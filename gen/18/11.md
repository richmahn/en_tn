## will I have this pleasure ##

You may want to add "of having a baby" (UDB). Sarah used this rhetorical question because she did not believe that she could have a child. This means "I cannot believe that I will experience the joy of having a child." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## my lord being old also ##

This means "since my husband is also old."

## my lord ##

This is a title of respect that Sarah gave to her husband Abraham.
