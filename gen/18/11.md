## translationNotes

* **will I have this pleasure** - You may want to add "of having a baby" (UDB). Sarah used this rhetorical question because she did not believe that she could have a child. This means "I cannot believe that I will experience the joy of having a child." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **my lord being old also** - This means "since my husband is also old."
* **my lord** - This is a title of respect that Sarah gave to her husband Abraham.
