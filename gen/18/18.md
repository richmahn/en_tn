# Connecting Statement:

The rhetorical question that begins with the words "Should I hide" in verse 17 ends here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# since Abraham ... in him? 

The rhetorical question that begins with the words "Should I hide" in verse 17 ends here. God uses this rhetorical question to say that he was going to talk to Abraham about something very important and that it was best for him to do so. "I should not and will not hide ... since Abraham in him." or "I should and will tell ... since Abraham in him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# since ... him?

"This is because ... him"

# all the nations of the earth will be blessed in him

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "I will bless all the nations of the earth through Abraham" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# will be blessed in him

"will be blessed because of Abraham" or "will be blessed because I have blessed Abraham." For translating "in him" see how you translated "through you" in [Genesis 12:3](../12/03.md).
