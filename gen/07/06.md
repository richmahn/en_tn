Verses 6-12 repeat for a second time and give more detail about how Noah went into the ark with his family and the animals in Genesis [Genesis 7:1](./01.md). This is not a new event.

## came upon the earth ##

This can be translated as "happened" or "came on the earth."

## because of the waters of the flood ##

This can be translated as "because of the flood that would come" or "to escape the flood water."
