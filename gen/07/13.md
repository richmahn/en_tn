# General Information:

Verses 13-18 repeat for a third time and give more detail about how Noah went into the ark with his family and the animals in [Genesis 7:1-5](./01.md). This is not a new event.

# On that very same day

"On that exact day." This refers to the day that the rain started. Verses 13-16 tell what Noah did immediately before the rain began.

# wild animal ... livestock ... creeping thing ... bird

These four groups are listed to show that every kind of animal was included. If your language has another way of grouping all the animals, you can use that, or you can use these groups. See how you translated this in [Genesis 1:24](../01/24.md).

# creeping thing

This refers to animals that crawl on the ground, like rodents, insects, lizards, and snakes.

# according to its kind

"so that each kind of animal will produce more of its own kind." See how you translated this in [Genesis 1:24](../01/24.md).
