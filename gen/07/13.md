# General Information:

Verses 13-18 repeat for a third time and give more detail about how Noah went into the ark with his family and the animals in [Genesis 7:1-5](./01.md). This is not a new event.

# On that very same day

"On that exact day." This refers to the day that the rain started. Verses 13-16 tell what Noah did immediately before the rain began.
