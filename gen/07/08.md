## translationNotes

* Verses 6-12 repeat for a second time and give more detail about how Noah went into the ark with his family and the animals in Genesis [[en:bible:notes:gen:07:01]]. This is not a new event.
* **clean animals** - These were animals that God allowed people to give to him as sacrifices.
* **unclean animals** - These were animals that God did not allow people to give to him as sacrifices.
* **two by two** - The animals entered the boat in pairs of one male and one female.
* **It came about that** - This phrase is used here to mark an important event in the story--the start of the flood. If your language has a way for doing this, you could consider using it here.
* **after the seven days** - "after seven days" or "seven days later"
* **the water of the flood came upon the earth** - The implicit information that it rained can be made explicit as it is in the UDB. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
