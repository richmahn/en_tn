Verses 13-18 repeat for a third time and give more detail about how Noah went into the ark with his family and the animals in Genesis [Genesis 7:1](./01.md). This is not a new event.

## two of all flesh in which was the breath of life ##

This refers to the animals that were listed in verse 14.

## in which was the breath of life ##

The phrase “in which was the breath of life” is a figurative way of saying “that lived.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## male and female of all flesh ##

This could be translated as "male and female of every kind of animal."

## after them ##

This could be made more explicit: "after they entered the ark" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]]).
