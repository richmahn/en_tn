## translationNotes

* Verses 13-18 repeat for a third time and give more detail about how Noah went into the ark with his family and the animals in Genesis [[en:bible:notes:gen:07:01]]. This is not a new event.
* **two of all flesh in which was the breath of life** - This refers to the animals that were listed in verse 14.
* **in which was the breath of life** - The phrase “in which was the breath of life” is a figurative way of saying “that lived.” (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
* **male and female of all flesh** - This could be translated as "male and female of every kind of animal."
* **after them** - This could be made more explicit: "after they entered the ark" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]]).
