# wild animal ... livestock ... creeping thing ... bird

These four groups are listed to show that every kind of animal was included. If your language has another way of grouping all the animals, you can use that, or you can use these groups. See how you translated this in [Genesis 1:24](../01/24.md).

# creeping thing

This refers to animals that crawl on the ground, like rodents, insects, lizards, and snakes.

# according to its kind

"so that each kind of animal will produce more of its own kind." See how you translated this in [Genesis 1:24](../01/24.md).
