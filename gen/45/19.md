# General Information:

Pharaoh continues to tell Joseph what to tell his brothers.

# Connecting Statement:

This is the beginning of a two-level quotation.

# Now

This does not mean "at this moment," but is used to draw attention to the important point that follows.

# you are commanded

This can be stated in active form. You may also need to add the words "to tell them," which the writer left out of this ellipsis. Alternate translation: "I also command you to tell them" or "also tell them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# take carts out

"Carts" are wagons with two or four wheels. Animals pull the carts.
