# there are still five years in which there will be neither plowing nor harvest

"there will be five more years without planting or harvesting." Here "neither plowing nor harvest" stands for the fact that the crops still will not grow because of the famine. Alternate translation: "and the famine will last five more years" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
