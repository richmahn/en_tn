# Connecting Statement:

The three-level quotation that began in verse 9 ends here.

# I will provide ... all that you have

The three-level quotation that began with the words "say to him" in verse 9 ends here. You may need to reduce the number of levels by making some levels indirect quotes. "say to him that his son Joseph says that God has made him master of all Egypt, so he must go down to Joseph and not delay. He will live in the land of Goshen, and he will be near Joseph, he and his children and his children's children, and his flocks and his herds, and all that he has. Joseph will provide for him there, for there are still five years of famine, so that he does not come to poverty, him, his household, and all that he has." or "say to him, 'Your son Joseph says that God has made him master of all Egypt, so he must go down to Joseph and not delay. He will live in the land of Goshen, and he will be near Joseph, he and his children and his children's children, and his flocks and his herds, and all that he has. Joseph will provide for him there, for there are still five years of famine, so that he does not come to poverty, him, his household, and all that he has.'"

# come to poverty

This speaks about "poverty" as if it were a destination. Alternate translation: "waste away" or "starve" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
