# I am about to die

Esau was exaggerating to emphasize how hungry he was. Alternate translation: "I am so hungry I feel like I could die" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# What good is the birthright to me?

Esau used a question to emphasize that eating was more important than a birthright. This can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: "My inheritance is no good to me if I die of hunger!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
