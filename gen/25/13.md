# These were Ishmael's sons, and these were their names, by their villages, and by their encampments; twelve princes according to their tribes

This can be stated as two sentences. "These were the names of Ishmael's twelve sons. They led tribes that were named after them, and they each had their own villages and campsites"

# twelve

"12" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])

# princes

Here the word "princes" means that the men were leaders or rules of the tribes; it does not mean that they were the sons of a king.
