# [Abraham](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/abraham) gave all that he owned to [Isaac](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/isaac)

"[Isaac](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/isaac) inherited all that [Abraham](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/abraham) owned." It was normal for the father to divide his wealth when he was old and not leave that for others to do after he died.
