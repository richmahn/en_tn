## translationNotes

* **birthright** - "right as firstborn to inherit most of our father's wealth" (UDB)
* **I am about to die** - Esau was exaggerating to emphasize how hungry he was. This could be translated as "I am so hungry I feel like I could die." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
* **What good is the birthright to me?** - Esau used a question to emphasize that eating was more important than a birthright. This could be translated as a statement: "My inheritance is no good to me if I die of hunger!" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **First swear to me** - What Jacob wanted Esau to swear can be stated explicitly: "First swear to me that you will sell me your birthright." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
* **lentils** - These are like beans, but their seeds are very small, round, and somewhat flat. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
* **Esau despised his birthright** - "Esau thought his birthright was not important." Alternate translation: "Esau showed that he did value his birthright."
