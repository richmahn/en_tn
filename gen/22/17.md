# surely bless

"certainly bless"

# I will greatly multiply your descendants

"I will cause your descendants to increase again and again" or "I will cause your descendants to be very many"

# as the stars of the heavens, and as the sand which is upon the seashore

God compared [Abraham](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/abraham)'s descendants to the stars and the sand. Just as people cannot count the huge number of stars or the grains of sand, so there would be so many of [Abraham](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/abraham)'s descendants that people would not be able to count them. AT: "beyond what you can count" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# as the stars of the heavens

Here the word "heavens" refers to everything we see above the earth, including the sun, moon, and stars.

# will possess the gate of their enemies

Here "gate" represents the whole city. To "possess the gate of their enemies" means destroying their enemies. AT: "will completely triumph over their enemies" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
