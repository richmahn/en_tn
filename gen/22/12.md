# Do not lay your hand upon the lad, nor do anything to harm him

The phrase "Do no lay your hand upon" is a way of saying "do not harm." God said basically the same thing twice to emphasize that Abraham should not hurt Isaac. AT: "Do not hurt the boy in any way" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# now I know ... from me

The words "I" and "me" refer to Yahweh. When translating what is in the quote, do it as the angel of Yahweh did and use the words "I" and "me" when referring to Yahweh.

# you fear God

This refers to deeply respecting God and showing that respect by obeying him.

# seeing that

"because I see that"

# you have not withheld your son ... from me

"you have not held back your son ... from me." This can be stated in positive form. AT: "you were willing to offer your son ... to me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])

# your son, your only son

It is implied that God knows that Abraham has another son, Ishmael. This emphasizes that Isaac is the son that God promised to give Abraham. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Genesis 22:2](./02.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
