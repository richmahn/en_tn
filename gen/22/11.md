## the angel of Yahweh ##

See the note about this phrase in [Genesis 16:7](../16/07.md).

## Here I am ##

See how you translated this in [Genesis 22:1](./01.md).

## Do not lay your hand upon the lad, nor do anything to harm him ##

Both of these phrases mean basically the same thing: "Do not hurt the boy in any way." God made sure that Abraham would hear and understand him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

## now I know … from me ##

The words "I" and "me" refer to Yahweh. When translating what is in the quote, do it as the angel of Yahweh did and use the words “I” and "me" when referring to Yahweh.

## seeing that ##

"because I see that"

## have not withheld your son…from me ##

"have not held back your son…from me" or "have not refused to give your son…to me"

## your son, your only son ##
