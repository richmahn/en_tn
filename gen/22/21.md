# They were Uz his firstborn, Buz his brother

"The name of his firstborn was Uz, and the names of the rest of his children were Buz his brother"

# Uz ... Buz ... Kemuel ... Aram ... Kesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel

These are all names of men. Translate this so that it is clear that all of these except Aram are the sons of Nahor and Milkah. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
