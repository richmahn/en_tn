# Who told you

God knew the answer to this question. He asked it in order to force Adam to confess that he had disobeyed God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Have you eaten ... from?

Again, God knew this had happened. Translate this question in a form that shows God was accusing Adam of disobedience. The sentence can be translated as a statement. AT: "You must have eaten ... from." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
