# Where are you?

"Why are you trying to hide from me?" God knew where the man was. When the man answered, he did not say where he was but why he was hiding.

# you

In verses 9 and 11, God was speaking to the man. Languages that have a singular form of "you" would use that here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# I heard you

"I heard the sound you were making"

# Who told you

God knew the answer to this question. He asked it in order to force Adam to confess that he had disobeyed God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Have you eaten ... from?

Again, God knew this had happened. Translate this question in a form that shows God was accusing Adam of disobedience. The sentence can be translated as a statement. AT: "You must have eaten ... from." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
