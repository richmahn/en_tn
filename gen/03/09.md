# Where are you?

"Why are you trying to hide from me?" God knew where the man was. When the man answered, he did not say where he was but why he was hiding.

# you

In verses 9 and 11, God was speaking to the man. Languages that have a singular form of "you" would use that here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
