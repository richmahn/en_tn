# but concerning the fruit ... garden, God said, 'You may not eat it, nor may you touch it, or you will die

These words are the end of Eve's description of God's command to them that begins with the words "We may eat" in verse 2. Eve told the serpent what God had permitted them to do first and then what God had told them not to do. Some languages would say what they were told not to do first and then say what they were allowed to do, as in the UST.

# You may not ... nor may you ... you will die

The word "you" is plural and refers to the man and the woman. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# You may not eat it

"You must not eat it" or "Do not eat it"

# nor may you touch it

"and you must not touch it" or "and do not touch it"
