# We may eat ... God said, 'You may not eat it

Eve told the serpent what God had permitted them to do first and then what God had told them not to do. Some languages would say what they were told not to do first and then say what they were allowed to do, as in the UDB.

# We may eat

"We are allowed to eat" or "We have permission to eat"
