# You ... you ... your ... you

These words refer to the man and the woman and so are dual or plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# your eyes will be opened

"your eyes will open." This idiom means "you will become aware of things" or "you will understand new things." This meaning can be stated clearly. Alternate translation: "It will be as though your eyes were opened" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# knowing good and evil

Here "good and evil" is a figure of speech that refers to both extremes and everything in between. See how you translated "knowledge of good and evil" in [Genesis 2:9](../02/09.md). Alternate translation: "knowing everything, including both good and evil" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
