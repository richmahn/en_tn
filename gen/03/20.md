# The man

Some translations say "[Adam](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/adam)."

# called his wife's name [Eve](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/eve)

"gave his wife the name [Eve](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/eve)" or "named his wife [Eve](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/eve)"

# [Eve](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/eve)

Translators may write a footnote saying "The name [Eve](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/eve) sounds like the Hebrew word that means 'living.'"

# all the living

The word "living" refers to people. AT: "all people" or "all living people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
