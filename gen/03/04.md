## translationNotes

* **You** - When the serpent said "you," he was referring to the man and the woman. Some languages will use the plural form, and some will use the dual form of "you." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
* **your eyes will be opened** - "your eyes will open." This figure of speech means "you will become aware of things" or "you will understand new things." This meaning can be stated clearly as it is in the UDB. It can also be expressed as a simile: "It will be as though your eyes were opened" (UDB). (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
* **knowing good and evil** - This can be translated as "Like God, you will know everything, whether good or bad." This is a figure of speech that refers to both extremes and everything in between. In this verse, it means "everything, including both good and evil." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
* **it was a delight to the eyes** - "the tree was delightful to look at" or "it was nice to look at" or "it was very beautiful" (UDB).
* **and that the tree was desirable to make one wise** - "and she wanted the tree's fruit because it could make a person wise." This can also be translated as "and she wanted its fruit because it could make her understand what was right and wrong just as God does."
