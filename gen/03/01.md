* **We may eat ... God said, 'You may not eat** - Eve told the serpent what God had permitted them to do and what God had told them not to do. Some languages would say what they were told not to do, and then say what they were allowed to do, as in the UDB.

* **nor may you touch it** - This can be translated as "and you must not touch it" or "and do not touch it."
