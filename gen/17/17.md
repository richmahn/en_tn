# said in his heart

"thought to himself" or "said to himself silently"

# Can a child be born to a man who is a hundred years old?

[Abraham](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/abraham) used this rhetorical question because he did not believe that this could happen. AT: "Surely a man who is a hundred years old cannot father a child!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# How can [Sarah](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/sarah), who is ninety years old, bear a son?

Again [Abraham](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/abraham) used a rhetorical question because he did not believe this could happen. The phrase "who is ninety years old" tells why [Abraham](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/abraham) did not believe that [Sarah](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/sarah) could bear a son. AT: "[Sarah](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/sarah) is ninety years old. Could she bear a son?" or "[Sarah](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/sarah) is ninety years old. Surely she could not bear a son!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish]])
