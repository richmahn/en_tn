# Can a child be born to a man who is a hundred years old?

Abraham used this rhetorical question because he did not believe that this could happen. AT: "Surely a man who is a hundred years old cannot father a child!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# How can Sarah, who is ninety years old, bear a son?

Again Abraham used a rhetorical question because he did not believe this could happen. The phrase "who is ninety years old" tells why Abraham did not believe that Sarah could bear a son. AT: "Sarah is ninety years old. Could she bear a son?" or "Sarah is ninety years old. Surely she could not bear a son!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish]])

# Oh that Ishmael might live before you

"Please let Ishmael inherit the covenant that you have made with me" or "Perhaps Ishmael could receive your covenant blessing." Abraham suggested something that he believed really could happen.
