# my covenant will be in your flesh

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "you will mark my covenant in your flesh" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# for an everlasting covenant

"as a permanent covenant." Because it was marked in flesh, no one could easily erase it.
