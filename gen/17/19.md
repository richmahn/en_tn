# No, but Sarah your wife will bear

God said this to correct Abraham's belief that Sarah could not have a son.

# you must name him

The word "you" refers to Abraham.

# As for Ishmael

The words "As for" show that God is switching from talking about the baby that would be born to talking about Ishmael.

# Behold

"Look" or "Listen" or "Pay attention to what I am about to tell you"

# will make him fruitful

This is an idiom that means "will cause him to have many children." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# will multiply him abundantly

"I will cause him to have many descendants"

# leaders of tribes

"chiefs" or "rulers." These leaders are not the twelve sons and grandsons of Jacob that will lead the twelve tribes of Israel.

# But my covenant I will establish with Isaac

God returns to talking about his covenant with Abraham and emphasizes that he would fulfill his promise with Isaac, not with Ishmael.
