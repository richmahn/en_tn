## translationNotes

* **No, but Sarah your wife will bear** - God said this to correct Abraham's belief that Sarah could not have a son.
* **you must name him** - The word "you" refers to Abraham.
* **As for Ishmael** - The words "As for" show that God is switching from talking about the baby that would be born to talking about Ishmael.
* **leaders of tribes** - "chiefs" or "rulers"
* **Behold** - This can be translated as “Look” or “Listen” or “Pay attention to what I am about to tell you."
* **I will make him fruitful** - This is figurative language that means "I will cause him to have many children."
* **and will multiply him abundantly** - "and I will cause him to have many descendants"
* **But my covenant I will establish with Isaac** - God returned to talking about his covenant and emphasized that it would be with Isaac, not with Ishmael.
