## translationNotes

* God continues speaking to Abraham.
* **Every male** - "Every human male"
* **throughout your generations** - "in every generation"
* **him who is bought with money** - "any male that you buy." This refers to slaves.
* **my covenant will be in your flesh** - "my covenant will be marked in your flesh"
* **for an everlasting covenant** - "as an permanent covenant." Because it was marked in flesh, it could not easily be erased.
* **uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin** - The word "uncircumcised" and the phrase following "male" mean the same thing. Hebrew often says the same thing twice. Translators will have to decide whether they can do that in their language.
* **will be cut off from his people** - This means either "will be separated from his people" or "will be destroyed from among his people."
* **He has broken my covenant** - "He has violated my covenant" or "He has not obeyed the rules of my covenant." This is the reason that he would be cut off from his people.
