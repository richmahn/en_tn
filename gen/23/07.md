# to the people of the land, to the sons of Heth

"to the sons of Heth who lived in the area"

# the sons of Heth

Here "sons" stands for those who descended from Heth. See how you translated this in [Genesis 23:3](./03.md). Alternate translation: "the descendants of Heth" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
