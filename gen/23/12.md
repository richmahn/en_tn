## translationNotes

* **people of the land** - "people who lived in that place"
* **in the hearing of the people of the land** - "while the people of the land were listening"
* **But if you will** - This can be translated as "No, but if you are willing" or "No, but if you agree with this." The word "but" shows that there is a contrast between what Ephron offered to do and what Abraham would do. Ephron said that he would give the field to Abraham. Abraham would pay for the field.
* **I will pay for the field** - This can also be translated as "I will give you money for the field."
