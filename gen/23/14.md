* **A piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver, what is that between me and you?** - "A piece of land that is worth only four hundred shekels of silver is nothing to you and me." This sentence can be divided in two. "The piece of land is worth only four hundred shekels of silver. For you and me, that is nothing."

* **Bury your dead** - "Go bury your dead."
* **Abraham weighed out to Ephron the amount of silver** - This can be translated as "Abraham weighed out for Ephron the amount of silver" or "Abraham weighed the silver and gave Ephron the amount" or "Abraham counted out to Ephron the amount of silver."

* **in the hearing in the hearing of the sons of Heth** - This can be translated as "in the presence of the sons of Heth" or "while the sons of Heth listened."
