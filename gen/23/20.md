# passed to [Abraham](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/abraham) as a property for a burial place from the sons of Heth

"became [Abraham](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/abraham)'s property for a burial ground when he bought it from the sons of Heth"

# the sons of Heth

Here "sons" stands for those who descended from Heth. See how you translated this in [Genesis 23:3](./03.md). AT: "the descendants of Heth" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
