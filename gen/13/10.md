## translationNotes

* **the whole plain of the Jordan** - This refers to the general region of the Jordan River.
* **was well watered** - "had supplies of clean water"
* **like the garden of Yahweh, like the land of Egypt** - "like the garden of Yahweh or like the land of Egypt". These were two different places.
* **garden** - Use the same word for "garden" as you used in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:02:07]].
* **This was before Yahweh destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah** - This anticipates something that would happen later and is told about in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:19:23]]. It is important here because it explains why Lot settled in a region that was later not fertile.
* **the relatives** - "the kinsmen" or "the families." This refers to Lot and Abram with their households.
