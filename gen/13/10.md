# the whole plain of the Jordan

This refers to the general region of the Jordan River.

# was well watered

"had much water"

# like the garden of Yahweh, like the land of [Egypt](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/egypt)

"like the garden of Yahweh or like the land of [Egypt](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/egypt)." These were two different places.

# the garden of Yahweh

This is another name for the garden of Eden.

# garden

Use the same word for "garden" as you used in [Genesis 2:8](../02/07.md).

# This was before Yahweh destroyed [Sodom](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/sodom) and [Gomorrah](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/gomorrah)

This anticipates something that would happen later. It is important here because it explains why [Lot](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/lot) settled in a region that later was not fertile.
