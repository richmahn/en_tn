"had supplies of clean water"

## This was before Yahweh destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah ##

This anticipates something that would happen later and is told about in [Genesis 19:23](../19/23.md). It is important here because it explains why Lot settled in a region that was later not fertile.

"the kinsmen" or "the families." This refers to Lot and Abram with their households.
