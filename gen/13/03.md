## He continued on his journey ##

"He traveled by stages" or "he continued traveling from place to place." Since Abram took his household along, this can also be translated as "They continued on their journey."

## to the place where his tent had been before ##

The time can be made explicit: "to the place where he had set up his tent before he went to Egypt" (See [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]]). Or translators may add a footnote that says "See Genesis 12:8."

## called on the name of Yahweh ##

"prayed in the name of Yahweh” or “worshiped Yahweh." See how you translated this in [Genesis 12:8](../12/08.md).
