## translationNotes

* **He continued on his journey** - "He traveled by stages" or "he continued traveling from place to place." Since Abram took his household along, this can also be translated as "They continued on their journey."
* **to the place where his tent had been before** - The time can be made explicit: "to the place where he had set up his tent before he went to Egypt" (See [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]]). Or translators may add a footnote that says "See Genesis 12:8."
* **called on the name of Yahweh** - "prayed in the name of Yahweh” or “worshiped Yahweh." See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:gen:12:08]].
