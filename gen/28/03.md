Isaac continues speaking to Jacob

## make you fruitful and multiply you ##

The word “multiply” explains how God would make Jacob “fruitful.” AT: "give you many children and descendants" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

## May he give you the blessing of Abraham ##

"May Yahweh give you the blessing he gave to Abraham"

## your descendants after you ##

“your offspring with you”

## the land where you have been living ##

"the land where you have been staying"

## which God gave to Abraham ##

"Which God promised to Abraham"
