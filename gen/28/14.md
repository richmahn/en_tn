God continues to talk to Jacob in a dream.

## Your descendants will be like the dust of the earth ##

God compares Jacob's descendants to the dust of the earth to emphasize their huge number. Alternate translation: "You will have more descendants than you can count." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

## and you will spread abroad to the west ##

Here the word "you" is singular but refers to Jacob's descendants. It only speaks of Jacob since he is the leader of the family. Alternate translation: "and your descendants will spread out to the west." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

## In you and in your descendants will all the families of the earth be blessed ##

This can be translated with an active verb: "I will bless all families on the earth through you and your descendants." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## Behold ##

This can be translated as “Look” or “Listen” or “Pay attention to what I am about to tell you.”

## for I will not leave you. I will do all... ##

“for I will not leave you until I have done all...”

## I will keep you ##

"I will keep you safe" or "I will protect you"

## I will bring you into this land again ##

"I will bring you back to this land"
