# Genesis 28 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Even though Jacob tricked his father in order to receive Esau's blessing, the chapter repeats the blessing, ensuring he inherits the blessings promised to Abraham. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/bless]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/inherit]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/promise]])

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Jacob's dream #####
Jacob had a dream or received a vision. The purpose of this dream is to show that, despite Jacob's sin, God is giving Abraham's covenant promises to Jacob and his descendants. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/covenant]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/promise]])

##### Bethel #####
This was an important city for Abraham and his descendants. It is possible that there is some theological significance to the city of Bethel.
