## Jacob said to him ##

"Jacob said to Laban"

## how your livestock have fared with me ##

"how well your livestock have done since I started taking care of them"

## For you had little before I came ##

"your herds were small before I worked for you"

## and it has increased abundantly ##

"but now your wealth has greatly increased"

## Now when will I provide for my own household also? ##

"Now when will I take care of my own family?" This can be translated as a statement: "Now I want to take care of my family."
