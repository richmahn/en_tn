# God called Rachel to mind and listened to her

The phrase "call to mind" means to remember. This does not mean God forgot about Rachel. It means he considered her request. Alternate translation: "God considered Rachel and granted to her what she wanted" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
