# the feebler animals

"the weaker animals"

# So the feebler animals were [Laban](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/laban)'s, and the stronger were [Jacob](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/jacob)'s

"So the weaker offspring belonged to [Laban](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/laban), while the stronger offspring belonged to [Jacob](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/jacob)." You can make this even more explicit. AT: "So the weaker offspring did not have stripes or spots and so belonged to [Laban](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/laban), while the stronger offspring did have stripes or spots and so belonged to [Jacob](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/jacob)" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
