# God has given me my wages

God rewarding Leah is spoken of as if he were a boss paying wages to someone who works for him. AT: "God has given my due" or "God has rewarded me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# She called his name Issachar

Translators may also add a footnote that says: "The name Issachar means 'there is a reward.'"
