# You must come in to me

Here "come in to" is a euphemism. Alternate translation: "You must have sexual intercourse with me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])

# with my son's mandrakes

"for the price of my son's mandrakes." See how you translated "mandrake" in [Genesis 30:14](./14.md).
