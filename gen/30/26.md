# and let me go

"so I can go"

# you know the service I have given you

Jacob is reminding Laban of their contract ([Genesis Gen 29:27](../29/26.md)). The abstract noun "service" can be stated as "served." Alternate translation: "you know that I have served you long enough" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
