# before the eyes of the flock

Here the flock's "eyes" represent the sheep and emphasize what they see. AT: "so that the flock could see them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# among the sticks

"in front of the sticks"

# the feebler animals

"the weaker animals"

# So the feebler animals were Laban's, and the stronger were Jacob's

"So the weaker offspring belonged to Laban, while the stronger offspring belonged to Jacob." You can make this even more explicit. AT: "So the weaker offspring did not have stripes or spots and so belonged to Laban, while the stronger offspring did have stripes or spots and so belonged to Jacob" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
