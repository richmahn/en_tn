* **might conceive** - "might breed" or "might mate"
* **among the sticks** - "in front of the sticks"
* **the feebler animals** - "the weaker animals"
* **so the feebler animals were Laban's, and the stronger were Jacob's.** - "So the weaker offspring belonged to Laban, while the stronger offspring belonged to Jacob." You can make this even more explicit: "So the weaker offspring did not have stripes or spots and so belonged to Laban, while the stronger offspring did have stripes or spots and so belonged to Jacob."
