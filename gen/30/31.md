# What will I pay you

"What can I pay you" or "What can I give you." This can be made more explicit. AT: "What can I pay you so that you stay and work for me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# If you will do this thing for me

The connecting word "But" can be used at the beginning to show that what Jacob is about to say contrasts with what he just said. AT: "But if you will do this thing for me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-connectingwords]])

# this thing

The phrase "this thing" refers to what Jacob will propose in verse 32.

# feed your flock and keep it

"feed and take care of your flock"
