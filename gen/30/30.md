# For you had little before I came

"your herds were small before I worked for you"

# and it has increased abundantly

"but now your wealth has greatly increased"

# Now when will I provide for my own household also?

"Now when will I take care of my own family?" Jacob uses a question to emphasize that he wants to start providing for his own family. This question can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: "Now I want to take care of my family!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
