# She said

"Rachel said"

# See

"Look" or "Listen" or "Pay attention to what I am about to tell you"

# there is my servant Bilhah ... I will have children by her

At that time, this was an acceptable way for a barren woman to have children that would legally belong to her. The full meaning of this may be made explicit. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# Bilhah

This is the name of Rachel's female servant. See how you translated this name in [Genesis 29:29](../29/28.md).

# on my knees

This is a way of saying that the child that Bilhah gives birth to will belong to Rachel. AT: "for me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# I will have children by her

"and in this way she will cause me to have children"
