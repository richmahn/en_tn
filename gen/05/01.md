# General Information:

This is the beginning of the list of Adam's descendants.

# in his own likeness

This phrase means that God made mankind to be like him. This verse does not tell in what ways God made people to be like himself. God does not have a body, so it does not mean that people would look like God. See how "after our likeness" is translated in [Genesis 1:26](../01/26.md). AT: "to truly be like us" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pronouns]])

# when they were created

This can be made active. AT: "when he created them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
