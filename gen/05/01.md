## translationNotes

* **This is the record of the descendants of Adam** - This sentence introduces the account of Adam's descendants in Genesis 5:1-6:8. It could be translated as “This is the account of Adam's descendants.”
* **in his own likeness** - "to be like God." This does not say how God made people to be like himself. God does not have a body, so it does not mean that people look like God.
