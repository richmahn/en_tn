## translationNotes

* **became the father of a son** - "had a son"
* **Noah** - Translators may want to add a footnote that says "This name sounds like the Hebrew word that means 'rest.'" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]]).
* **from our work and from the toil of our hands** - This is a doublet. It says the same thing twice to emphasize how hard the work was. This could also be translated as "from working so hard with our hands." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]].)
