# Dan will be a snake beside the road

Jacob speaks about Dan and his descendants as if they were snakes. Though a snake is small, it can bring down a rider off his horse. So Dan, though a small tribe, is very dangerous to its enemies. Alternate translation: "The descendants of Dan will be like a snake beside the road" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
