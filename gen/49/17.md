# [Dan](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/dan) will be a snake beside the road

Jacob speaks about [Dan](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/dan) and his descendants as if they were snakes. Though a snake is small, it can bring down a rider off his horse. So [Dan](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/dan), though a small tribe, is very dangerous to its enemies. AT: "The descendants of [Dan](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/dan) will be like a snake beside the road" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
