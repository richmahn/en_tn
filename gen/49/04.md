# Uncontrollable as rushing water

Jacob compares Reuben to water in a strong current to emphasize that he cannot control his anger and he is not stable. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# you will not have the preeminence

"you shall not be first among your brothers"

# because you went up to your father's bed. Then you defiled it; you went up to my couch

Here "bed" and "couch" stand for Jacob's concubine, Bilhah. Jacob is referring to when Reuben slept with Bilhah (See: [Genesis 35:22](../35/22.md)). AT: "because you went to my bed and slept with Bilhah my concubine. You have shamed me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# you went up to your father's bed ... you went up to my couch

Both statements mean the same thing. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
