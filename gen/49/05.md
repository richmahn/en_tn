## translationNotes

* **Weapons of violence are their swords** - "They use their swords to hurt and to kill people"
* **do not come into their council; do not join in their meetings** - Both of these phrases say the same thing for emphasis. Jacob uses the words "soul" and "heart" to refer to himself. AT: "I certainly will not join with them to make any plans" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
* **My self...my heart** - Jacob uses the words "self" and "heart" to refer to the most noble parts of himself.
* **they hamstrung oxen** - Jacob compares the men of Shechem to oxen. This emphasizes the strength of the men and that Simenon and Levi killed them as if the men were just animals. AT: "they slaughtered men like they slaughter oxen" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
