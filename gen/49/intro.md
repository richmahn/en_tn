# Genesis 49 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 49:1-27. This is a recording of Jacob's sayings to his children. 

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Prophecies #####
These statements made by Jacob to his sons are probably prophecies. These prophecies are concerned with the descendants of each of Jacob's sons who would become the twelve tribes of Israel. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]])

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### "The scepter will not depart from Judah" #####
This prophecy indicates Judah will be the ruling tribe of Israel. The future kings of Israel all come from the tribe of Judah. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

##### "I buried Leah" #####
Since Moses wrote the book of Genesis, this is an editorial comment he makes in the text as the narrator.
