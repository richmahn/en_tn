## translationNotes

* **the beginning of my strength** - Hebrew parents would dedicate their first child to God. The words "beginning" and "first-fruit" means that Reuben belonged to God in a special way. Alternate translation: "the first-fruit of my manhood."
* **outstanding in dignity, and outstanding in power** - "You are first in honor and power."
* **Uncontrollable as rushing water** - Jacob compares Reuben to water in a strong current to emphasize that he cannot control his anger and he is not stable. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
* **you shall not have the pre-eminence** - eminence** - "you shall not be first among your brothers"
* **because you went up to your fatherâ€™s bed. Then you defiled it; you went up to my couch.** - This refers to when Reuben slept with Bilhah in [[en:bible:notes:gen:35:21]]. This can be made explicit: "because you went to my bed and had sex with Bilhah my concubine. You brought shame on me." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]] and [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
