## the beginning of my strength ##

Hebrew parents would dedicate their first child to God. The words "beginning" and "first-fruit" means that Reuben belonged to God in a special way. Alternate translation: "the first-fruit of my manhood."

## outstanding in dignity, and outstanding in power ##

"You are first in honor and power."

## Uncontrollable as rushing water ##

Jacob compares Reuben to water in a strong current to emphasize that he cannot control his anger and he is not stable. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

## you shall not have the pre-eminence ##

eminence** - "you shall not be first among your brothers"

## because you went up to your fatherâ€™s bed. Then you defiled it; you went up to my couch. ##

This refers to when Reuben slept with Bilhah in [Genesis 35:21](../35/21.md). This can be made explicit: "because you went to my bed and had sex with Bilhah my concubine. You brought shame on me." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
