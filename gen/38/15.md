# When Judah saw her

The word "her" here refers to Tamar, but your reader should understand that Judah did not know that the woman he was looking at was Tamar.

# because she had covered her face

Judah did not think she was a prostitute just because her face was covered but also because she was sitting in the gate. AT: "because she had covered her head and sat where prostitutes often sat" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
