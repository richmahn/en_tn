# because she had covered her face

Judah did not think she was a prostitute just because her face was covered but also because she was sitting in the gate. AT: "because she had covered her head and sat where prostitutes often sat" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# When Judah saw her

"When Judah saw Tamar"
