# When she was brought out

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "When they brought her out" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# her father-in-law

"her husband's father"

# seal and cords and staff

A "seal" is similar to a coin with a design engraved on it, used to make an impression in melted wax. The "cord" was put through the seal so the owner could wear it around his neck. A staff was long wooden stick that helped in walking over rough ground. See how you translated this in [Genesis 38:18](../38/18.md).
