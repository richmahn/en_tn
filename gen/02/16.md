# From every tree in the garden

"The fruit of every tree in the garden"

# you

This pronoun is singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# you may freely eat ... you may not eat

In some languages it would be natural to first say what is not permitted and to then say what is permitted, as in the UDB.

# may freely eat

"may eat without restriction"
