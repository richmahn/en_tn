# But from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you may not eat

These words complete the command that begins with the words "From every tree in the garden you may freely eat" in verse 15. In some languages, it may be more natural to say what is not permitted and to then say what is permitted, as in the UDB. 

# the tree of the knowledge of good and evil

"the tree that gives people the ability to understand both good and evil" or "the tree that makes people who eat its fruit able to know good things and bad things." See how you translated this in [Genesis 2:9](../02/09.md).

# you may not eat

"I will not permit you to eat" or "you must not eat"
