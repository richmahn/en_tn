"Finally, this one's bones are like my bones, and her flesh is like my flesh." After looking among all the animals for a partner and not finding one, he finally saw someone who was like him and could be his partner. The man was probably expressing his feeling of relief and joy.

# She will be called 'woman,' because she was taken out of man

The translator may want to write a footnote saying "The Hebrew word for 'woman' sounds like the Hebrew word for 'man.'
