The rest of Genesis 2 tells about how God created people on the sixth day.

Possible meanings are 1) it is a summary of the events described in Genesis 1:1-2:3 or 2) it introduces the events described in Genesis 2. If possible, translate this so that people can understood it either way.

"when Yahweh God created." The word "day" refers to the whole time span of the creation, not to just one particular day.

# Yahweh

This is the name of God that he revealed to his people in the Old Testament. See the translationWord page about Yahweh concerning how to translate this.
