# Now

This does not mean "at this moment," but is used to draw attention to the important point that follows.

# therefore, when I come ... sorrow to Sheol

Judah is describing to Joseph a realistic but hypothetical case of what he will expect will happen to Jacob when he returns without Benjamin. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])

# when I come to your servant

Here "come" can be translated as "go" or "return."

# the lad is not with us

"the boy is not with us"

# since his life is bound up in the boy's life

The father saying he would die if his son died is spoken of as if their two lives were physically bound together. AT: "since he said he would die if the boy did not come back" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
