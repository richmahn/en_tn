# General Information:

Judah continues his story to Joseph

# said to us, 'You know that my wife bore me two sons. One of them went out from me and I said, "Surely he is torn in pieces, and I have not seen him since." Now if you also take this one from me, and harm comes to him, you will bring down my gray hair with sorrow to Sheol.'

This has a two level and three level quotation. They can be stated as indirect quotations. AT: "said to us that we know that his wife, Rachel, bore him only two sons, and that one of them went out and an animal tore him to pieces, and he has not seen him since. Then he said that if we take his other son and something bad happens to him, then we would cause him to die of sorrow." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
