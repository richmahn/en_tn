# Your servants will bring down the gray hair of your servant our father with sorrow to Sheol

To "bring down ... to Sheol" is way of saying they will cause him to die and go to Sheol. He uses the word "down" because it was commonly believed Sheol is somewhere underground. Alternate translation: "And we will have caused our old father to die of sorrow" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# the gray hair of your servant our father

Here "gray hair" stands for Jacob and emphasizes his old age. Alternate translation: "our old father" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
