# What was torn by beasts I did not bring to you

This can be stated in active form. AT: "When a wild animal killed one of your animals I did not bring it to you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# Instead, I bore the loss of it

For Jacob to count Laban's dead animals as a loss from his own flock is spoken of as if it was a burden he would bear on his shoulders. AT: "Instead of counting it a loss from your flock, I counted it as a loss from my flock" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
