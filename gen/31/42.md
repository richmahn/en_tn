Jacob is referring to the same God not to three different gods. AT: "If the God of [Abraham](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/abraham) and [Isaac](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/isaac), my father, had not been with me"

# the God of my father

Here the word "father" refers to his parent, [Isaac](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/isaac).

# the one [Isaac](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/isaac) fears

Here the word "fears" refers to the "fear of Yahweh," which means to deeply respect him and show that respect by obeying him.

# empty-handed

This stands for having nothing. AT: "with absolutely nothing" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# God has seen my oppression and how hard I worked

The abstract noun "oppression" can be stated as "oppressed." AT: "God has seen how hard I worked and how you oppressed me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
