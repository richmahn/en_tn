# Unless the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the one Isaac fears, had been with me

Jacob is referring to the same God not to three different gods. Alternate translation: "If the God of Abraham and Isaac, my father, had not been with me"

# the God of my father

Here the word "father" refers to his parent, Isaac.

# the one Isaac fears

Here the word "fears" refers to the "fear of Yahweh," which means to deeply respect him and show that respect by obeying him.

# empty-handed

This stands for having nothing. Alternate translation: "with absolutely nothing" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# God has seen my oppression and how hard I worked

The abstract noun "oppression" can be stated as "oppressed." Alternate translation: "God has seen how hard I worked and how you oppressed me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
