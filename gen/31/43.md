# But what can I do today to these my daughters, or to their children whom they have borne?

Laban uses a question to emphasize that there is nothing he can do. This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: "But, there is nothing I can do to bring my daughters and grandchildren back with me." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
