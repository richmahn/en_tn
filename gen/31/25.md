# Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the hill country. Laban also camped with his relatives in the hill country of Gilead

The word "now" is used here to mark a change from the story to background information about Jacob and Laban. Alternate translation: "When Laban caught up with Jacob, Jacob had set up camp in the hill country. Then Laban and his relatives also camped in the hill country of Gilead" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
