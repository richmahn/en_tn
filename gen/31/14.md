# Rachel and Leah answered and said to him

This does not mean they talked at the same time. It emphasizes they agreed with each other.

# Is there any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house?

Rachel and Leah use a question to emphasize that there is nothing left for their father to give. Alternate translation: "There is absolutely nothing left for us to inherit from our father!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
