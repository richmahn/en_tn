## Jacob heard the words of Laban’s sons, that they said ##

"Jacob heard that Laban's sons were saying,"

## has taken all that was our father’s ##

Laban's sons were exaggerating because they were angry. This could be translated as "has taken so much that belonged to our father." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

## Jacob saw the look on Laban's face. He saw that his attitude toward him had changed ##

This is two different ways of saying the same thing. It is used for emphasis. "Jacob noticed that Laban was no longer pleased with him." (See:[[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

## your fathers ##

"your father Isaac and your grandfather Abraham"
