# Now

This word is used here to mark a break in the main story line. Here the author starts to tell a new part of the story.

# Jacob heard the words of Laban's sons, that they said

"Jacob heard that Laban's sons were saying"

# Jacob has taken away all that was our father's

Laban's sons were exaggerating because they were angry. Alternate translation: "Everything that Jacob has taken belonged to our father" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
