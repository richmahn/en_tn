* **has taken away all that was our father’s** - Laban's sons were exaggerating because they were angry. This could be translated as "has taken so much that belonged to our father." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
* **Jacob saw the look on Laban's face. He saw that his attitude toward him had changed** - These two sentences mean basically the same thing.
