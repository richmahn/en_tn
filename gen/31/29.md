# It is in my power to do you harm

The word "you" is plural and refers to everyone with [Jacob](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/jacob). AT: "I have enough people with me to harm all of you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# Be careful that you speak to [Jacob](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/jacob) neither good nor bad
