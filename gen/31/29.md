# It is in my power to do you harm

The word "you" is plural and refers to everyone with Jacob. AT: "I have enough people with me to harm all of you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# Be careful that you speak to Jacob neither good nor bad

The words "good nor bad" are used together to mean "anything." See how you translated this in [Genesis 31:24](./24.md). AT: "Do not say anything to try and stop Jacob from leaving" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
