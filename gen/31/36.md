# He said to him

"Jacob said to Laban"

# What is my offense? What is my sin, that you have hotly pursued after me?

The phrases "What is my offense" and "What is my sin" mean basically the same thing. Jacob is asking Laban to tell him what he did wrong. Alternate translation: "What have I done wrong that you should pursue me like this?" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# hotly pursued after me

Here the word "hotly" means Laban urgently chased Jacob intending to capture him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
