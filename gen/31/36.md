# He said to him

"[Jacob](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/jacob) said to [Laban](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/laban)"

# What is my offense? What is my sin, that you have hotly pursued after me?

The phrases "What is my offense" and "What is my sin" mean basically the same thing. [Jacob](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/jacob) is asking [Laban](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/laban) to tell him what he did wrong. AT: "What have I done wrong that you should pursue me like this?" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# hotly pursued after me

Here the word "hotly" means [Laban](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/laban) urgently chased [Jacob](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/jacob) intending to capture him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
