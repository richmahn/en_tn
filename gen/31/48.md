# Galeed

Translators may add a footnote that says: "The name Galeed means 'heap of witness' in Jacob's language. See how you translated this in [Genesis 31:47](./45.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# Mizpah

Translators may add a footnote that says: "The name Mizpah means 'watchtower.'" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# when we are out of sight one from another

Here "out of sight" stands for no longer being in each other's presence. AT: "when we are no longer with each other" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# although no one else is with us

Here "us" refers to Laban and Jacob. AT: "even if no one else is there to see us"
