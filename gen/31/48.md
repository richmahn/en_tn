# This pile is a witness between me and you

The stones do not actually bear witness as a person. AT: "This pile will be a reminder between me and you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# Galeed

Translators may add a footnote that says: "The name Galeed means 'heap of witness' in Jacob's language. See how you translated this in [Genesis 31:47](./45.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
