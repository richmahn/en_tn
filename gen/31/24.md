# Now God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream at night

The word "now" is used here to mark a change from the story to background information about Laban. Alternate translation: "That night God came to Laban in a dream" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])

# Be careful that you speak to Jacob neither good nor bad

The phrase "good nor bad" are used together to mean "anything." Alternate translation: "Do not say anything to try and stop Jacob from leaving" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
