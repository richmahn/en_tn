# angel of God

Possible meanings are 1) God himself appeared as a man or 2) one of God's messengers appeared. Since the phrase is not well understood, it is best to simply translate it as "the angel of God," using the normal word that you use for "angel."

# I said

"And I answered"

# Here I am

"Yes, I am listening" or "Yes, what is it?" See how you translated this in [Genesis 22:1](../22/01.md).
