# There I was; in the day the heat consumed me, and the frost by night

Suffering in the hot and cold temperatures is spoken of as if the temperatures were animals that were eating Jacob. Alternate translation: "I stayed with your flocks even during hottest part of the day and the coldest part of the night" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
