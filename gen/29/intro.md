#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Shepherds #####
Although the exact reasoning for the shepherds' unwillingness to give water to the sheep is unknown, it is probable they were being lazy. The actions of these shepherds contrast Jacob's actions. 

##### Kissing #####
It was common in the ancient Near East for relatives to greet each other with a kiss. There was nothing sexual about this type of kissing. 

##### Marriage #####
It was customary in the ancient Near East for a man to work for a woman's father in order to earn the right to marry her. It is unknown how common it was for a father to have his younger daughter marry before an older daughter. It was also sinful for Jacob to marry more than one wife.
