# Leah was not loved

This can be stated in active form. AT: "Jacob did not love Leah" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# not loved

This is an exaggeration to emphasize that Jacob loved Rachel more than Leah. AT: "loved less than Rachel" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# so he opened her womb

God causing Leah to be able to become pregnant is spoken of as if God is opening her womb. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# was childless

"was not able to become pregnant"

# Leah conceived and bore a son

"Leah became pregnant and gave birth to a son"

# she called his name Reuben

Translators may also add a footnote that says: "The name Reuben means 'See, a son.'" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# Yahweh has looked upon my affliction

Leah was experiencing emotional pain because Jacob had rejected her. The abstract noun "affliction" can be stated as a verb. AT: "Yahweh saw that I was suffering" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
