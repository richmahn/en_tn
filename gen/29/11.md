## translationNotes

* **Jacob kissed Rachel** - In ancient Near East, it is common to greet a relative with a kiss. However, it is normally done between men. If your language has an affectionate greeting for a relative, use that. If not, use what is appropriate.
* **her fatherâ€™s relative** - "related to her father"
