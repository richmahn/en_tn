# General Information:

In verses 25-27 Noah pronounced a curse on Ham's son and blessings on Ham's brothers. What Noah said about them also applied to their descendants, as shown in the UST. Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in Noah's curse and blessings in verses 25-27.

# awoke from his wine

He awoke after drinking wine and becoming drunk. He "became sober."

# his youngest son

This refers to Ham. Alternate translation: "his youngest son, Ham"
