# Whoever sheds man's blood, by man will his blood be shed

The shedding of blood is a metaphor for killing someone. This means that if a person murders someone, someone else must kill the murderer. However, "blood" is very significant in this passage and should be used in the translation if possible. Translate "sheds blood" with words that indicate a major loss of blood that causes death. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# for it was in the image of God that he made man

"because God made people to be like him" or "because I made people in my own image"
