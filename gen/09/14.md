# General Information:

God continues speaking to Noah and his sons.

# It will come about when

"Whenever." It is something that would happen many times.

# the rainbow is seen

It is not clear who will see the rainbow, but because the covenant is between Yahweh and people, if you need to say who it is who will see the rainbow, it would be best to name both Yahweh and people. This can be translated in active form. AT: "people and I see the rainbow" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# rainbow

the colorful strip of light that appears in the rain when the sun shines from behind the viewer

# I will call to mind my covenant

This does not mean that God would first forget. AT: "I will think about my covenant"

# me and you

The word "you" is plural. God was speaking to Noah and Noah's sons.

# every living creature of all flesh

"every kind of living being"

# all flesh

Possible meanings for what "all flesh" represents are 1) all human beings or 2) all physical beings, including humans and animal. See how this is translated in [Genesis 6:12](../06/11.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
