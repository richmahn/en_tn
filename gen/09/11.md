God continues speaking to Noah and his sons.

## I hereby establish my covenant with you ##

"By saying this, I make my covenant with you."

## establish my covenant with you ##

See how you translated this phrase in [Genesis 9:8](./08.md).

## Never again will there be a flood to destroy the earth ##

"There will never again be a flood that destroys the earth." There would be floods, but they would not destroy the whole earth.

## covenantâ€¦for all future generations ##

The covenant applies to Noah and his family and also to all generations that follow.
