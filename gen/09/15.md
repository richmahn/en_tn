# I will call to mind my covenant

This does not mean that God would first forget. AT: "I will think about my covenant"

# me and you

The word "you" is plural. God was speaking to Noah and Noah's sons.

# every living creature of all flesh

"every kind of living being"

# all flesh

Possible meanings for what "all flesh" represents are 1) all human beings or 2) all physical beings, including humans and animal. See how this is translated in [Genesis 6:12](../06/11.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
