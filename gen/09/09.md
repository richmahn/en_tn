# As for me

This phrase is used in English to mark the change from God talking about what [Noah](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/noah) and his sons must do to talking about what God would do.

# confirm my covenant with you

"make a covenant between you and me." See how you translated this in [Genesis 6:18](../06/18.md).
