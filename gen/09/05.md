## translationNotes

* God continues speaking to Noah and his sons.
* **But for your blood** - This contrasts man's blood with the blood of animals in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:09:01]].
* **your blood, the life that is in your blood,** - It is implied that the blood is shed, or poured out, or spilled out. This could be made explicit as "if anyone causes your blood to pour out" or "if anyone spills your blood." This is also a metaphor for killing someone. It is possible to translate it as "if anyone kills you," but it would be good to leave "blood" in the text. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]], [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **I will require payment** - “I will require anyone who kills you to pay.” This payment does not refer to money, but to the death of the murderer.
* **From the hand of every animal, I will require it** - “I will require any animal that takes your life to pay”
* **From the hand of any man, that is, from the hand of one who has murdered his brother, I will require an accounting for the life of that man** - This can be translated as "I will require anyone who takes the life of another person to pay"
* **From the hand of** - This phrase refers to the person in a very personal way. This could be translated as "from that very man." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
* **whoever sheds man's blood, by man will his blood be shed** - The shedding of blood is a metaphor for killing someone. This means that if a person murders someone, someone else must kill the murderer. However, "blood" is very significant in this passage and should be used in the translation if possible. Translate "sheds blood" with words that indicate a major loss of blood that causes death.
* **for it was in the image of God that he made man ** - "because God made people to be like him." Since God was speaking, this can also be translated as "because I made people in my own image."
* **be fruitful and multiply** - See how you translated these commands in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:01:28]].
