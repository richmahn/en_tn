# God said to him

"God said to Jacob"

# Be fruitful and multiply

God told Jacob to produce children so that there would be many of them. The word "multiply" explains how he was to be "fruitful." See how you translated this in [Genesis 1:22](../01/22.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# A nation and a company of nations will come from you

Here "nation" and "nations" refer to Jacob's descendants who will establish these nations. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
