## the sons of Jacob ##

It is implied that no one attacked anyone in Jacob's family. But two of the sons, Simeon and Levi had attacked the Canaanites relatives of Shechem after he raped Jacob's daughter. Jacob was afraid they would seek revenge in [Genesis 34:30](../34/30.md). Alternate translation: "Jacob's family" or "Jacob's household." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
