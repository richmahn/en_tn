# Genesis 35 General Notes #

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Name change #####

In Scripture, a change in name always occurs at a highly significant point in a person's life. The return of Jacob to Canaan was a significant event in the history of the Hebrew people.

##### Covenant #####
The covenant God made with Abraham is repeated here. It indicates that all of Jacob's descendants will inherit the promises of this covenant. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/covenant]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/inherit]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/promise]])
