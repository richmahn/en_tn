# Zilpah

This is the name of [Leah](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/leah)'s female servant. See how you translated this name in [Genesis 29:24](../29/23.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# who were born to him in Paddan Aram

It is implied that this does not include Benjamin who was born in the land of Canaan near Bethlehem. It only mentions Paddan Aram since that is where most of them were born. The full meaning of this can be made explicit. AT: "who were born to him in Paddan Aram, except Benjamin who was born in the land of Canaan" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
