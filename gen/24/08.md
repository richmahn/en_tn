Verse 8 is a continuation of the instructions Abraham gave his servant.

## But if the woman is not willing to follow you ##

"But if the woman refuses to come with you." Abraham was answering the servant's question from [Genesis 24:5](./05.md). Abraham did not think that the woman would refuse to come. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])

## you will be free from this oath of mine ##

"you will be released from the oath you made to me." It can also be translated as "you will not have to do what you swore to do."

## put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master ##

This was to show that he would certainly do what he was swearing to do.

## swore to him ##

"made an oath to him"

## concerning this matter ##

"concerning Abraham's request" or "that he would do what Abraham said."
