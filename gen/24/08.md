# General Information:

Verse 8 is a continuation of the instructions Abraham gave his servant.

# But if the woman is not willing to follow you

"But if the woman refuses to come with you." Abraham was answering the servant's question from [Genesis 24:5](./05.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])

# you will be free from this oath of mine

"you will be released from the oath you made to me." Not having to fulfill an oath is spoken of as if the person is free from an object to which he was bound. Alternate translation: "you will not have to do what you swore to me that you would do" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
