## translationNotes

* **Come** - "Come in" or "Enter"
* **you blessed of Yahweh** - "you whom Yahweh has blessed"
* **you** - Here the word "you" refers to Abraham's servant.
* **Why are you standing outside?** - Laban used this question to invite Abraham's servant into his house. You could translate it as "You do not need to stay outside." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **he unloaded the camels** - It is not clear who did this work. Probably Laban told his servants to do it. It can also be translated with as "Laban's servants unloaded the camels" (UDB) or with a passive clause that does not tell who did the work:  "the camels were unloaded."  (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
* **The camels were given straw and feed, and water was provided** - This does not say who did the work. Probably Laban's servants did these things.
* **to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him** - This can be translated as "for Abraham's servant and the men who were with him to wash their feet."
