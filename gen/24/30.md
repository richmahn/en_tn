# When he had seen the nose ring ... and when he had heard the words of Rebekah his sister

These things happened before he ran out to the man. This tells why Laban ran out to the man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-events]])

# when he had heard the words of Rebekah his sister, "This is what the man said to me,"

This can be stated as an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: "when he had heard his sister Rebekah tell what the man had said to her" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])

# behold, he

The word "behold" here adds emphasis to what follows. "it was just as she had said: he"
