## translationNotes

* **all these things** - "everything that had just happened"
* **Now** - This word is used here to mark a new part of the story. We learn that Rebekah had a brother, and the story now tells about what he did.
* **spring** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:gen:24:12]].
* **When he had seen the nose ring…and heard the words of Rebekah his sister** - This tells why Laban ran out to the man.
* **when he had heard the words of Rebekah his sister, "This is what the man said to me"** - What Laban heard can be translated as an indirect quote: "when he had heard his sister Rebekah tell what the man had said to her."
* **behold** - The word “behold” here adds emphasis to what follows. You could translate this as "indeed."
