# Genesis 24 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations indent each line of poetry to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetry in 24:60. 

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Intermarriage #####

Abraham forbid any marriage between his son and the people of Canaan. This is because it would cause him to worship other gods. Intermarriage and worshiping false gods are things that frequently caused Abraham's descendants to struggle. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/falsegod]])

##### Abraham's wealth #####

There are many instances recorded in this chapter which highlight Abraham's significant wealth. He owned more than 10 camels and had large amounts of gold. 

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### "Put your hand under my thigh" #####

Many scholars believe this is a euphemism. Putting one's hand on a man's genitals was a way to make an important oath. It represented power and progeny. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
