Abraham's servant continues speaking to Rebekah's family.

## speaking in my heart ##

This means that he was praying quietly in his mind. Rebekah could not have heard what he was saying. It can be translated as "praying" (UDB) or "praying quietly." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

## behold ##

The word “behold” here alerts us to pay attention to the surprising information that follows. It can be translated as "indeed" or "suddenly."

## pitcher ##

See how you translated this in [Genesis 24:15](./15.md).

## spring ##

"well"

## watered the camels ##

"gave water to the camels"
