## translationNotes

* Abraham's servant continues speaking to Rebekah's family.
* **speaking in my heart** - This means that he was praying quietly in his mind. Rebekah could not have heard what he was saying. It can be translated as "praying" (UDB) or "praying quietly." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
* **behold** - The word “behold” here alerts us to pay attention to the surprising information that follows. It can be translated as "indeed" or "suddenly."
* **pitcher** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:gen:24:15]].
* **spring** - "well"
* **watered the camels** - "gave water to the camels"
