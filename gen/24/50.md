## translationNotes

* **Bethuel** - This was Laban and Rebekah's father.
* **The thing has come from Yahweh** - "Yahweh has caused all of this to happen"
* **we cannot speak to you either bad or good** - This is an idiom which means Laban and Bethuel do not have the authority to decide whether what God has done is good or bad. This can be translated as "we dare not judge what Yahweh is doing." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
* **Look** - The word “look” here adds emphasis to what follows.
* **Rebekah is before you.** - "Here is Rebekah."
