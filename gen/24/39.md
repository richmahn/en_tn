Abraham's servant continues speaking to Rebekah's family.

## Perhaps the woman will not follow me. ##

This is something that could possibly happen. The servant wanted to know what he should do if it did. It could be translated as a question: “What if the woman will not come back with me?” or "What should I do if the woman will not come back with me?" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])

## before whom I walk ##

This is a way of saying "whom I serve" or "whom I obey." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

## he will prosper your way ##

"he will make your journey successful"

## family line ##

"family"

## But you will be free from my oath if you come to my relatives and they will not give her to you. Then you will be free from my oath ##

"But, if you come to my relatives and they will not give her to you, then you will be free from my oath." This is a hypothetical situation that Abraham did not think was likely to happen.

## if you come to my relatives ##

Different languages use the words come and go differently. Alternate translations: "if you arrive at my relatives' home" or "if you go to my relatives"
