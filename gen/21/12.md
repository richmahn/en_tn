# Do not be grieved because of the lad, and because of your servant woman

"Do not be upset about the boy and your handmaid"

# Listen to her words in all she says to you about this matter

"Do everything that [Sarah](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/sarah) says to you about them"

# it is through [Isaac](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/isaac) that your descendants will be named

The phrase "will be named" means those born through [Isaac](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/isaac) are the ones God considers to be the descendants that he promised [Abraham](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/abraham). This can be stated in active form. AT: "[Isaac](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/isaac) is the one who will be the forefather of the descendants I promised to give you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
