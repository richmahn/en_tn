# Do not be grieved because of the lad, and because of your servant woman

"Do not be upset about the boy and your handmaid"

# Listen to her words in all she says to you about this matter

"Do everything that Sarah says to you about them"

# it is through Isaac that your descendants will be named

The phrase "will be named" means those born through Isaac are the ones God considers to be the descendants that he promised Abraham. This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "Isaac is the one who will be the forefather of the descendants I promised to give you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
