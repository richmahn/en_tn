# The child grew and ... [Isaac](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/isaac) was weaned

"Wean" here is a polite way of saying the child was finished with breast feeding. AT: "[Isaac](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/isaac) grew, and when he no longer needed his mother's milk, [Abraham](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/abraham) had a large feast" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
