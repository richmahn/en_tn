# I will also make the son of the servant woman into a nation

The word "nation" means God will give him many descendants so that they become a great nation of people. Alternate translation: "I will make the servant woman's son also become the father of a great nation" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
