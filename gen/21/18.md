# raise up the lad

"help the boy stand up"

# I will make him into a great nation

To make Ishmael into a great nation means God will give him many descendants who will become a great nation. Alternate translation: "I will make his descendants become a great nation" or "I will make him become the ancestor of a great nation" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
