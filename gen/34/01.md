Here this word is used to mark a new part of the story.

This is the name of Leah's daughter. See how you translated this name in [Genesis 30:21](../30/19.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# the Hivite

This is the name of a people group. See how you translated the similar word "Hivites" in [Genesis 10:17](../10/15.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# the prince of the land

This is referring to Hamor not Shechem. Also, "prince" here does not mean son of a king. It means Hamor was the leader of the people in that area.

# assaulted her, and slept with her

Shechem raped Dinah. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])

# He was drawn to Dinah

AT: "He wanted very much to be with Dinah" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# spoke tenderly to her

This means he spoke affectionately to convince her that he loved her and that he wanted her to love him also.
