# General Information:

Hamor and Shechem his son continue to talk to the city elders.

# Only on this condition will the men agree to live with us and become one people: If every male among us is circumcised, as they are circumcised

"Only if every man among us is circumcised, as the men of Israel are circumcised, will they agree to live among us and unite with us as one people"

# Will not their livestock and their propertyâ€”all their animals be ours?

Shechem uses a question to emphasize that Jacob's livestock and property will belong to the people of Shechem. This can be translated as a statement. AT: "All of their animals and property will be ours." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
