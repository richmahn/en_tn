# the dead bodies

"the dead bodies of Hamor, Shechem, and their men"

# looted the city

"stole everything in the city that was valuable"

# because the people had defiled their sister

Shechem alone had defiled Dinah, but [Jacob](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/jacob)'s sons considered Shechem's entire family and everyone in the city responsible for this act.

# had defiled

This means that Shechem had greatly dishonored and disgraced Dinah by forcing her to sleep with him. See how you translated "defiled" in [Genesis 34:5](./04.md).
