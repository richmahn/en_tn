# Will not their livestock and their propertyâ€”all their animals be ours?

Shechem uses a question to emphasize that Jacob's livestock and property will belong to the people of Shechem. This can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: "All of their animals and property will be ours." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
