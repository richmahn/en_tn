# to do what they said

"to become circumcised"

# Jacob's daughter

"Jacob's daughter Dinah"

# because he was the most honored person in all his father's household

This can be translated as a new sentence. It can be made explicit that Shechem knew the other men would agree to be circumcised because they greatly respected him. Alternate translation: "Shechem knew all the men in his father's household would agree with him because he was the most honored among them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
