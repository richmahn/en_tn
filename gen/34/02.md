# the Hivite

This is the name of a people group. See how you translated the similar word "Hivites" in [Genesis 10:17](../10/17.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# the prince of the land

This is referring to Hamor not Shechem. Also, "prince" here does not mean son of a king. It means Hamor was the leader of the people in that area.

# assaulted her, and slept with her

Shechem raped Dinah. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
