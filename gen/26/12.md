# General Information:

This begins a new part of the story. It changes from telling about Isaac calling Rebekah his sister, and it starts to tell about how Isaac became very rich and the Philistines were jealous of him.

# in that land

"in Gerar"

# a hundredfold

This means "one hundred times as much as he planted." It can be translated more generally as "a very large crop." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])
