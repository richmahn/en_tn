# General Information:

Yahweh continues speaking to Isaac.

# I will multiply your descendants

"I will cause you to have very many descendants."

# like the stars of heaven

This speaks about the number of Isaac's descendants as if they were the same as the number of stars. See how you translated this in [Genesis 22:17](../22/15.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# heaven

This refers to everything we see above the earth, including the sun, moon, and stars.

# all the nations of the earth will be blessed

This can be stated in active form. AT: "I will bless all the nations of the earth" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# Abraham obeyed my voice and kept my instructions, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws

The phrases "obeyed my voice" and "kept my instructions, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws" mean basically the same thing. AT: "Abraham obeyed me and did everything I commanded him to do" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# obeyed my voice

Here "voice" stands for Yahweh. AT: "obeyed me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
