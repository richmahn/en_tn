# General Information:

Yahweh continues speaking to Isaac.

# I will multiply your descendants

"I will cause you to have very many descendants."

# like the stars of heaven

This speaks about the number of Isaac's descendants as if they were the same as the number of stars. See how you translated this in [Genesis 22:17](../22/17.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# heaven

This refers to everything we see above the earth, including the sun, moon, and stars.

# all the nations of the earth will be blessed

This can be stated in active form. AT: "I will bless all the nations of the earth" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
