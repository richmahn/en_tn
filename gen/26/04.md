Yahweh continues speaking to Isaac

## I will multiply your descendants ##

“I will cause your descendants to be very many” or “I will cause you to have very many descendants”

## like the stars of heaven ##

This compares Isaac's descendants with the stars to emphasize that he would have very many descendants. See how you translated this in [Genesis 22:15](../22/15.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

## all the nations of the earth will be blessed ##

This can be translated with an active verb: "I will bless all the nations of the earth." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## obeyed my voice ##

"obeyed what I said" or "obeyed me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
