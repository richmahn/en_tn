## they said ##

This refers to Abimelech, Ahuzzath, and Phicol. One of them spoke and the other two agreed with what he said. It does not mean they all spoke at the same time.  This could be translated as "One of them said."

## we have clearly seen ##

"we know" or "we are certain"

## So let us make a covenant ##

"So we want to make a covenant"

## as we have treated you well ##

"as we have done only good to you." This can also be translated as the beginning of a new sentence as it is in the UDB.

## you are blessed by Yahweh ##

This can be translated with an active verb: "Yahweh has blessed you." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
