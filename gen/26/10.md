# What is this you have done to us?

[Abimelech](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/abimelech) used this question to scold [Isaac](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/isaac). AT: "You should not have done this to us!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# you would have brought guilt upon us

This speaks about causing someone to be guilty as if "guilt" were an object that is placed on someone. AT: "you would have caused us to be guilty of taking a man's wife" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# upon us

Here "us" refers to [Abimelech](rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/abimelech) and his people. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
