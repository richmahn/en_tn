Abimelech used this question to scold Isaac. AT: "You should not have done this to us!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# might easily have lain with your wife

The word "lain" here is a euphemism for "had sexual relations." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])

# you would have brought guilt upon us

This speaks about causing someone to be guilty as if "guilt" were an object that is placed on someone. AT: "you would have caused us to be guilty of taking a man's wife" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# upon us

Here "us" refers to Abimelech and his people. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
