## let us go down ##

The word “us” is plural even though it refers to God. Some translate it as "let me go down" or “I will go down.” If you do this, consider adding a footnote to say that the word is plural. (See the note on "Let us make" in [Genesis 1:26](../01/26.md).) ([[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pluralpronouns]])
