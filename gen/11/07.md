# Come

If your language has a way of urging or commanding people to begin work, like the English "Come on!" you might use it here. See how this is translated in [Genesis 11:3](./03.md).

# let us go down

The word "us" is plural even though it refers to God. Some translate it as "let me go down" or "I will go down." If you do this, consider adding a footnote to say that the pronoun is plural. See the note on "Let us make" in [Genesis 1:26](../01/26.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pronouns]])

# confuse their language

This means that Yahweh would cause the people all over the earth to stop speaking the same language. Alternate translation: "mix up their language" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# so that they may not understand each other

This was the purpose of confusing their language. Alternate translation: "so that they will not be able to understand what each other is saying" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
