## translationNotes

* The rest of this chapter lists the line of Shem's descendants down to Abram.
* **These are the descendants of Shem** - This sentence introduces the list of Shem's descendants in Genesis 11:10-26.
* **became the father of Arpachshad** - This can also be translated as "had his son Arpachshad" or "his son Arpachshad was born."
* **Arpachshad** - (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
* **a hundred…two…five hundred** - Translators may write the words or the numerals “100,” "2" and “500.” (The ULB and the UDB have words if the number has only one or two words; they have numerals if the number has three or more words. See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
