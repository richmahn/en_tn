The first half of Exodus is about how Yahweh made Abraham’s descendants into a nation. This nation, which would be called “Israel,” was meant to belong to Yahweh and worship him. The second half of Exodus describes how God gave the Israelites his law through Moses. The law of Moses told the Israelites how to obey and worship Yahweh properly.<br><br>The book of Exodus tells how the Israelites were to build the tabernacle. The tabernacle was a tent where Yahweh would be among his people. The Israelites worshiped and sacrificed animals to Yahweh at the tabernacle. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/tabernacle]])<br><br>### How should the title of this book be translated?<br><br>“Exodus” means “exit” or “departure.” Translators may translate this title in a way that can communicate its subject clearly, for example, “About the Israelites Leaving Egypt” or “How the Israelites Left the Land of Egypt.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])<br><br>### Who wrote the book of Exodus?<br><br>The writers of both the Old and New Testaments present Moses as being very involved with writing the book of Exodus. Since ancient times, both Jews and Christians have thought that Moses wrote Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy.<br><br>### Why did Moses write so much about God delivering or rescuing the people of Israel?<br><br>Moses wrote much about God rescuing his people from the Egyptians to show that Yahweh is very powerful. Egypt was the most powerful nation at that time, but Yahweh was still able to free the Israelites from the Egyptians. Also, by rescuing the Israelites, Yahweh showed that he had chosen them as his people, and they should worship him.<br><br>### How does the book of Exodus show the fulfillment of the promises given to Abraham?<br><br>The book of Exodus shows God beginning to fulfill his promise to Abraham. In Genesis, God promised Abraham that he would have many descendants and that they would become a large nation. When God rescued the Israelites from the Egyptians, he took them to Mount Sinai. There he made a covenant with them, and they became the nation that belonged to Yahweh.<br><br>## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts<br><br>### What was the Jewish Passover?<br><br>The Jewish Passover was a religious festival. Yahweh commanded the Israelites to celebrate it every year. Passover was a time to remember how God rescued Israel from the Egyptians. The first Passover meal was eaten in the evening just before they left Egypt.<br><br>### What was the law of Moses to the people of Israel?<br><br>The law of Moses instructed the people of Israel about what Yahweh required them to do as his people. In the law, God told the people how they should live so that they would honor him. He also instructed them about their need to offer animal sacrifices. God required these sacrifices so that he could forgive their sins and continue living among them. The law also described the duties of the priests and told how to build the tabernacle.<br><br>### What did it mean that Israel was to be a “kingdom of priests and a holy nation” ([19:6](../19/06.md) ULT)?<br><br>Israel was a holy nation because Yahweh separated them from all other nations to belong to him. They were to honor and worship him only. This made them different from all the other nations of the world. These other nations worshiped many false gods.<br><br>## Part 3: Important Translation Issues<br><br>### Thus says Yahweh<br><br>This phrase is used many times in the Old Testament to introduce Yahweh’s speech. Your team should pick a standard translation. See [4:intro](../04/intro.md) for more.<br><br>### Pharaoh’s stubborn heart<br><br>Between chapters 4–14 there are 18 cases where Pharaoh’s heart is described as strong (11x), heavy (6x), or hard (1x), and one case where the Egyptians’ hearts are described as strong. These are metaphors for being stubborn, that is, being unwilling to obey Yahweh or even to do what is clearly in his own and Egypt’s best interest. Many cultures have similar metaphors, but not all will use the same body part. Within these cases, six times there is a neutral description that Pharaoh was stubborn without saying anyone made him so ([7:13](../07/13.md), [7:14](../07/14.md), [7:22](../07/22.md), [8:19](../08/19.md), [9:7](../09/07.md), [9:35](../09/35.md)); three times Pharaoh makes himself stubborn ([8:15](../08/15.md), [8:32](../08/32.md), [9:34](../09/34.md)); and ten times Yahweh makes Pharaoh/the Egyptians stubborn ([4:21](../04/21.md), [7:3](../07/03.md), [9:12](../09/12.md), [10:1](../10/01.md), [10:20](../10/20.md), [10:27](../10/27.md), [11:10](../11/10.md), [14:4](../14/04.md), [14:8](../14/08.md), [14:17](../14/17.md)).<br><br>### Why are the details of the construction of the tabernacle in Exodus 25–32 repeated in Exodus 35–40?<br><br>In Exodus 25–32, God describes exactly how the tabernacle was to be built. The details were repeated in Exodus 35–40. This showed that the people were to be careful to do exactly as God commanded.<br><br>### Are the events in the order that they actually happened?<br><br>Most but not all of the events in the book of Exodus are told in the order that they actually happened. Translators may need to make it clear when the events are in an unusual order.<br><br>### What does it mean that God “lived” among his people?<br><br>The book of Exodus presents God as living in the tabernacle among the nation of Israel. God is everywhere, but he lived among the Israelites in a special way. God dwelled with the Israelites because they belonged to him. He promised to lead them and bless them. In return, the people were to worship him and honor him.
EXO	1	intro	cj55	​	וַ⁠יֵּ֥לֶךְ	0		# Exodus 01 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>This chapter is intended to form a smooth transition with the last chapter of the book of Genesis.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Israel’s growth<br>Israel grew in number. This was in fulfillment of the covenant God made with Abraham. It also caused the Egyptians great concern that there would be more Israelites than Egyptians because they would be unable to defend themselves against such a large number of people. Pharaoh also tried to kill all of the male babies so they would not become soldiers who fought against him. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/fulfill]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/covenant]])<br><br>### End of the famine<br>It is obvious that some time has passed since the beginning of the famine which brought the Israelites into Egypt. Yahweh appears to be punishing the Hebrews for not returning to the Promised Land instead of choosing to stay in Egypt. No return attempt is recorded to have been made. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/promisedland]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### “All of the descendants of Jacob were 70 in number”<br>This number included both Jacob’s children and grandchildren. It may cause confusion, but it is important to remember Jacob only had 12 sons.

There are even more Israelites, 2. There is a battle. These are followed by a series of undesirable consequences: 3. The Israelites join an enemy, 4. The Israelites attack the Egyptians, 5. The Israelites leave Egypt. While the series of consequences is also technically hypothetical, the king’s language indicates that if 1-2 happen, then 3-5 are certain. Use language that makes it clear that the first two events are hypothetical, and that the next three are consequences that could be expected if the first two events happen.

This may be strange in some languages. If it would be unnatural to say that the king spoke or said twice, you may leave one off.

EXO	1	19	0ppa	figs-synecdoche	וַ⁠תֹּאמַ֤רְןָ הַֽ⁠מְיַלְּדֹת֙	1		It may not make sense in your language to say that multiple people said something, so you may need to translate it in the singular (see UST). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
EXO	1	19	2ivn		הַֽ⁠מְיַלְּדֹת֙	1		These were women who helped a woman give birth to a baby. See how you translated this in [Exodus 1:15](../01/15.md).

If your language doesn’t have as many words that mean the same thing, you can use fewer words and express the emphasis in another way. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
EXO	1	20	0wpb	​grammar-connect-logic-result	​וַ⁠יֵּ֥יטֶב אֱלֹהִ֖ים לַֽ⁠מְיַלְּדֹ֑ת	1		This phrase is more logically connected to the statements in verse 21. It describes the result of the midwives fearing God with a general statement. You may need to rearrange vs 20-21 so that the reason (vs 21) comes before both the general and specific results. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
EXO	1	21	3q9e	​grammar-connect-logic-result	וַ⁠יְהִ֕י כִּֽי־יָֽרְא֥וּ הַֽ⁠מְיַלְּדֹ֖ת אֶת־הָ⁠אֱלֹהִ֑ים	1		This is the reason for what God did.

The full meaning of this may be made explicit. Alternate translation: “You must dispose of each new baby boy in the river so he will drown” or “Drown each baby boy in the river when he is born” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EXO	1	22	a6b2	figs-quotations	וַ⁠יְצַ֣ו פַּרְעֹ֔ה לְ⁠כָל־עַמּ֖⁠וֹ לֵ⁠אמֹ֑ר כָּל־הַ⁠בֵּ֣ן הַ⁠יִּלּ֗וֹד הַ⁠יְאֹ֨רָ⁠ה֙ תַּשְׁלִיכֻ֔⁠הוּ וְ⁠כָל־הַ⁠בַּ֖ת תְּחַיּֽוּ⁠ן	1		From **You shall** to the end of the verse is a direct quote of Pharaoh’s speech. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with first-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. However, it could be translated as an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: “And Pharaoh commanded all of his people to throw every baby boy into the river, but to let the every girl live.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
EXO	1	22	stag	figs-youdual	תַּשְׁלִיכֻ֔⁠הוּ…תְּחַיּֽוּ⁠ן	1		The uses of the word **you** here refer to all the Egyptians. If your language uses different forms of “you” depending on the number of people addressed, use a plural form here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/​figs-youdual]])

EXO	2	1	riy7	writing-participants	אִ֖ישׁ…בַּת	1		These are new participants. They remain unnamed until [Exodus 6:20](../06/20.md) where they are identified as Amram and Jochebed. For now it is best to leave them unnamed in your language, if possible. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
EXO	2	1	40u9	figs-idiom	וַ⁠יִּקַּ֖ח אֶת־בַּת־לֵוִֽי	1		This is an idiom for marrying. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

EXO	2	2	q4c0	grammar-connect-logic-result	וַ⁠תֵּ֤רֶא…וַֽ⁠תִּצְפְּנֵ֖⁠הוּ	1		Hiding the boy was a result of seeing that he was good. Alternative translation: “Since she saw … she hid him”  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])

EXO	2	3	tn3y	figs-explicit	וַ⁠תַּחְמְרָ֥⁠ה בַ⁠חֵמָ֖ר וּ⁠בַ⁠זָּ֑פֶת	1	sealed it with bitumen and pitch	You could explicitly state that this was to keep out water. Alternate translation: “spread tar on it to keep water from getting into it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EXO	2	3	wpb6	translate-unknown	וַ⁠תַּחְמְרָ֥⁠ה 	1	sealed	This means that she applied a waterproof coating. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
EXO	2	3	ym3k	translate-unknown	בַ⁠חֵמָ֖ר	1	bitumen	This is a sticky black paste made from petroleum. It can be used to keep out water. Alternate translation: “with tar” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
EXO	2	3	v825	translate-unknown	וּ⁠בַ⁠זָּ֑פֶת 	1	pitch	This is a sticky brown or black paste that can be made from tree sap or from petroleum. Therefore, **pitch** would include not only bitumen but also plant-based resins. It too can be used to keep out water. Alternate translation: “and with tar” or “and with resin” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
EXO	2	3	y8gq	translate-unknown	בַּ⁠סּ֖וּף	1	reeds	These **reeds** were a type of tall grass that grew in flat, wet areas. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
EXO	2	4	av8b		וַ⁠תֵּתַצַּ֥ב אֲחֹת֖⁠וֹ מֵ⁠רָחֹ֑ק	1	at a distance	This means she stood far enough away so that she would not be noticed, but close enough to see the ark. Use a word that expresses this sort of distance in your language.
EXO	2	4	9m7y	figs-abstractnouns	מֵ⁠רָחֹ֑ק	1		This probably means somewhere in the reeds where she could see the basket but no one would see her. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
EXO	2	4	4d7n	figs-kinship	אֲחֹת֖⁠וֹ	1		In the UST, “older” is supplied because her actions clearly show she is his older sister. In some languages a different term is used for siblings based on their relative ages and/or the gender of the siblings. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-kinship]])
EXO	2	4	z1cy	grammar-connect-logic-goal	לְ⁠דֵעָ֕ה מַה־יֵּעָשֶׂ֖ה לֽ⁠וֹ	1		This is her purpose in being close by. Alternative translation: “in order to learn what would happen to him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
EXO	2	5	1vls	figs-go	וַ⁠תֵּ֤רֶד	1		**Came down** may be literal or figurative, as important places are often considered to be in a higher place. This means she came from her home, probably Pharaoh’s palace. If a perspective is required for Pharaoh’s daughter, you may choose go or come as works best in your language. “Come” is better as the scene is at the river and she comes to the scene location. However, you also need to consider your language’s way of introducing new participants. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-go]]) 
EXO	2	5	y26h	writing-participants	וַ⁠תֵּ֤רֶד בַּת־פַּרְעֹה֙	1		The **daughter of Pharaoh** is introduced here as a new participant. Along with choosing come or go as mentioned in the previous note, you may need to mark her introduction in a particular way in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
EXO	2	5	3van	writing-participants	וְ⁠נַעֲרֹתֶ֥י⁠הָ	1		These women are introduced here as new participants; however they are not mentioned again after this verse. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
EXO	2	5	im0d	figs-metaphor	עַל־יַ֣ד הַ⁠יְאֹ֑ר	1		**Hand** is a metaphor for “side,” which in this case can be translated as the shore or bank (UST) of the river. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EXO	2	5	bi7s		וְ⁠נַעֲרֹתֶ֥י⁠הָ	1	her attendants	These were the young women whose job it was to be with her and make sure nothing bad happened to her.
EXO	2	5	am7g	writing-participants	וַ⁠תִּקָּחֶֽ⁠הָ	1		It is not clear who is meant by **she** here, either Pharaoh’s daughter or the servant. It is likely that Pharaoh’s daughter stays the subject. Alternative translation: “and she took the ark from her slave” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
EXO	2	6	g9n6	figs-exclamations	וְ⁠הִנֵּה	1	Behold	The word **behold** signals the surprising information that follows. See UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations]])
EXO	2	6	tyub	grammar-connect-logic-result	וַ⁠תַּחְמֹ֣ל עָלָ֔י⁠ו	1		The text does not state exactly what caused her to have compassion on the baby. If a reason must be provided in your language it should be connected to either his crying (this is the better option) or that he was a “good” baby [verse 2](../02/02.md). (See:  [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
EXO	2	6	jg0d	figs-quotemarks	מִ⁠יַּלְדֵ֥י הָֽ⁠עִבְרִ֖ים זֶֽה	1		This is a direct quote. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with first-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. It seems to have been said loud enough for the baby’s sister to hear. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	2	7	3zvu	figs-quotemarks	וְ⁠קָרָ֤אתִי לָ⁠ךְ֙ אִשָּׁ֣ה מֵינֶ֔קֶת מִ֖ן הָ⁠עִבְרִיֹּ֑ת וְ⁠תֵינִ֥ק לָ֖⁠ךְ אֶת־הַ⁠יָּֽלֶד	1		This is a direct quote of the baby’s sister. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with first-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	2	7	x5ja		וְ⁠קָרָ֤אתִי לָ⁠ךְ֙ אִשָּׁ֣ה מֵינֶ֔קֶת מִ֖ן הָ⁠עִבְרִיֹּ֑ת	1		This is a suggestive question. The child’s sister is hopeful that Pharaoh’s daughter does not have a plan yet for the baby beyond saving his life. However, it is still a true question, for without Pharaoh’s daughter’s permission the child’s sister will not be able to fetch the woman. If your language has a way of forming questions that are also suggestions, use it here.
EXO	2	7	psb2	figs-possession	אֲחֹת⁠וֹ֮…בַּת־פַּרְעֹה֒	1		These are both possessive of social relationship. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])

EXO	2	8	ab1m	figs-go	לֵ֑כִי…וַ⁠תֵּ֨לֶךְ֙	1		The girl left Pharaoh’s daughter to go to the child’s mother. The girl was almost certainly on foot. Use verbs of motion that express this. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])
EXO	2	8	2456	figs-quotemarks	לֵ֑כִי	1		This is a direct quote. Pharaoh’s daughter commands the baby’s sister. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with first-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	2	8	lyyj	figs-possession	בַּת־פַּרְעֹ֖ה…אֵ֥ם הַ⁠יָּֽלֶד	1		These are both the possessive of social relationship. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])

EXO	2	9	hqsa	figs-explicit	וַ⁠תִּקַּ֧ח…וַ⁠תְּנִיקֵֽ⁠הוּ	1		The mother’s acceptance of the deal is implied. You could make it explicit, as in the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EXO	2	10	zj8h	grammar-connect-time-sequential	וַ⁠יִגְדַּ֣ל הַ⁠יֶּ֗לֶד וַ⁠תְּבִאֵ֨⁠הוּ֙	1	she brought him	An unspecified amount of time is designated by this. He would have stayed with his mother at least until he was weaned (no longer drinking his mother’s milk). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
EXO	2	10	ta4r	figs-possession	לְ⁠בַת־פַּרְעֹ֔ה	1		This is the possessive of social relationship. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])

Consider using a conjunction that does not make a great separtion between these events. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous]])
EXO	2	10	nh2m		מֹשֶׁ֔ה וַ⁠תֹּ֕אמֶר כִּ֥י מִן־הַ⁠מַּ֖יִם מְשִׁיתִֽ⁠הוּ	1	Because I drew him from the water	Translators may add a footnote that says “The name Moses sounds like the Hebrew word that means ‘draw out.’” 
EXO	2	10	ityq	figs-quotations	וַ⁠תֹּ֕אמֶר כִּ֥י מִן־הַ⁠מַּ֖יִם מְשִׁיתִֽ⁠הוּ	1		This is a direct quote. It could be stated indirectly.  It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with first-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. Alternate translation: “because she said she draw him out of the water” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
EXO	2	10	yax4	translate-names	מֹשֶׁ֔ה	1	drew him	**Moses** - (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

Alternative translation: “Many years later, once Moses was grown, he went out” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
EXO	2	11	p7gx	writing-newevent	 וַ⁠יְהִ֣י׀ בַּ⁠יָּמִ֣ים הָ⁠הֵ֗	1		This introduces a new event in the story. In your language, use a phrase that indicates a new event occurring after significant time has passed. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
EXO	2	11	917y	figs-go	וַ⁠יֵּצֵ֣א	1		The UST supplies a probable location that he **went out** from; it could also have been simply out from the Egyptian area or out to the work area or cities. Use go or come as appropriate in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])
EXO	2	11	swn3		מַכֶּ֥ה אִישׁ־עִבְרִ֖י	1	striking a Hebrew	“hitting a Hebrew” or “beating a Hebrew”
EXO	2	12	m9bn	figs-merism	וַ⁠יִּ֤פֶן כֹּה֙ וָ⁠כֹ֔ה	1	He looked this way and that way	These two opposite directions have the combined meaning of “everywhere.” Alternate translation: “He looked all around” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
EXO	2	12	rmgn	figs-metonymy	וַ⁠יַּךְ֙	1		The context makes clear that Moses struck the Egyptian hard enough or repeatedly until Moses killed him. Consider using a word that indicates a deadly blow. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

EXO	2	14	lyqh	figs-aside	אָכֵ֖ן נוֹדַ֥ע הַ⁠דָּבָֽר	1		It is likely this is something Moses said to himself, that is, he thought it to himself rather than speaking to the men in front of him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-aside]])
EXO	2	14	vfw5	figs-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּאמַ֔ר אָכֵ֖ן נוֹדַ֥ע הַ⁠דָּבָֽר	1		It may be clearer to present as an indirect quotation what was likely a thought Moses had.

EXO	3	intro	n6ze			0		# Exodus 03 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>This chapter records one of the most important events in the history of the Israelite people: the revelation of the name Yahweh at the burning bush. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/reveal]])<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### God’s holiness<br><br>God is so holy that people could not look upon him without dying. This is why Moses covered his eyes. It is also why he took off his shoes. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/holy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])<br><br>### Yahweh<br><br>The name Yahweh is sacred in the Hebrew religion. It is the personal name of God, which he revealed to Moses. It is by this name that he is known. Yahweh means “I am.” Some translations use all capitals to set this apart, “I AM.” Great care must be taken in translating the phrase “I am that I am.” (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/yahweh]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Participants<br><br>“The angel of Yahweh,” “Yahweh,” and “God” all appear to be speaking to Moses and interacting with him from the burning bush. Furthermore, God says that his name is “I AM.” (See note above on Yahweh and I AM.) Yahweh and God are the same while there is speculation about who the angel of Yahweh is.
EXO	3	1	gqvh	writing-newevent	וּ⁠מֹשֶׁ֗ה הָיָ֥ה רֹעֶ֛ה	1		This phrase brings the story focus back to Midian and Moses. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
EXO	3	1	jv7b	figs-possession	צֹ֛אן יִתְר֥וֹ	1		This is an ownership possessive. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])

EXO	3	1	v97t	figs-go	וַ⁠יָּבֹ֛א אֶל	1		“and he arrived at” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])
EXO	3	1	p27s	figs-possession	הַ֥ר הָ⁠אֱלֹהִ֖ים	1		This is an associative possessive. This mountain was associated with God in some way. In [Exodus 3:12](../03/12.md) God tells Moses that he and the Israelites will serve him on this mountain. Later in the story, this promise is fulfilled and it is where God makes his covenant with Israel and gives them the 10 Commandments. So it may have been called the mountain of God in retrospect (as Moses probably wrote this book sometime after the Israelites were wandering in the wilderness). However, it is possible that the mountain was already associated with God’s presence or worship somehow before Moses went there with the flock.  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])

He expected the bush to be burnt up completely by the fire. Consider using an interjection in your language that expresses that the next thing is a surprise. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
EXO	3	2	3bvb	figs-metonymy	אֻכָּֽל	1		**Being consumed** means being eaten completely until gone. In the case of fire, this is a metonym for burning completely until gone. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

It’s not specified who Moses spoke to; he may have been alone or with a group of shepherds or his family. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with first-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation.

The UST continues the quotation from verse 5 rather than including an additional “he said.” This may be more natural in some languages. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with first-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	3	6	l5sy	​	אָבִ֔י⁠ךָ	1	your father	Possible meanings are (1) “your ancestor” or (2) “your father.” If it means “your ancestor,” then the phrases following it clarify who “your father” refers to: it refers to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. If it means “your father,” then it refers to Moses’s own father. It most cases it will be best to translate it as “your father,” i.e. Amram, Moses’s father.
EXO	3	6	lfbb	​grammar-connect-logic-result	וַ⁠יַּסְתֵּ֤ר מֹשֶׁה֙ פָּנָ֔י⁠ו כִּ֣י יָרֵ֔א מֵ⁠הַבִּ֖יט אֶל־הָ⁠אֱלֹהִֽים	1		Reason: **for he was afraid from staring toward God** Result: **And Moses hid his face** Some languages may need to put the reason before the result.

EXO	3	7	nl33	figs-quotemarks	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר יְהוָ֔ה	1		After this phrase a direct quote begins that continues through the end of [verse 10](../03/10.md). It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with an opening first-level quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the beginning of a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	3	7	xoz0	figs-idiom	רָאֹ֥ה רָאִ֛יתִי	1		The repetition of **see** expresses the intensity, certainty, or clarity of Yahweh’s seeing. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EXO	3	7	tpk0	figs-possession	אֶת־עֳנִ֥י עַמִּ֖⁠י	1		There are two possessives here. 1) “affliction of … people”: This is an event-related possessive where the people are the objects of affliction. They are treated badly as slaves. 2) “my people”: This one is more difficult as it involves both ownership and the possessive of social relationship. God views his people as his possession, and he is also in relationship with them as their God because they are descended from Abraham, though at this time they may not know God as theirs. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
EXO	3	7	p3tx	figs-metonymy	מִ⁠פְּנֵ֣י נֹֽגְשָׂ֔י⁠ו	1		**Faces** refers to the whole person or the presence of the person(s) who were oppressing the Israelites. If this image is used in your language, you may translate it. If a similar image is used, you may consider using it. If neither is the case, you may omit the word “face” and translate the meaning. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EXO	3	7	xx7r		נֹֽגְשָׂ֔י⁠ו	1	taskmasters	“his oppressors”
EXO	3	7	ofxt		כִּ֥י	1		The conjunction is probably functioning modally here, intensifying the expression of Yahweh’s knowledge. Your translation should express Yahweh’s knowing with certainty or strength.
EXO	3	7	mfn2	figs-collectivenouns	נֹֽגְשָׂ֔י⁠ו…מַכְאֹבָֽי⁠ו	1		These pronouns, **him** and **his**, refer to the Israelites as a group in the singular. They agree with “people” as a collective noun in [3:6](../03/06.md). Some languages may have to use plural pronouns. Others may have to match the pronoun’s gender to the grammatical gender of the word for “people” in their language.  If necessary change “him” to “them” or change “his” to “hers” or “its” (depending on grammatical gender of “people”.) Alternate translation: “those who oppress them…their anguish” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-collectivenouns]])
EXO	3	7	hkcj	figs-possession	מַכְאֹבָֽי⁠ו	1		This is an event-related possessive where the people (as a group: **his**) are the subjects of anguish. Your translation should express that they are in deep mental and emotional distress (anguish). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
EXO	3	7	ui28	figs-explicit	מַכְאֹבָֽי⁠ו	1		It is implied that they are in deep mental and emotional distress (anguish) because they are treated badly as slaves. You may make this explicit. Alternate translation: “his anguish from his slavery” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

You may need to expressly mark this, for instance by introducing verse 8 with something like “therefore,” and verse 9 with something like “again, because.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
EXO	3	8	xy36	figs-go	וָ⁠אֵרֵ֞ד	1		God is figuratively expressing that he is descending from heaven to earth to intervene.

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])
EXO	3	8	nahb	figs-collectivenouns	לְ⁠הַצִּיל֣⁠וֹ…וּֽ⁠לְ⁠הַעֲלֹת⁠וֹ֮	1		Here, **him** refers in the singular to the Israelites as a group. It is agreeing with “people” as a collective noun in [3:6](../03/06.md). Some languages may have to use plural pronouns. Others may have to match the pronoun’s gender to the grammatical gender of the word for “people” in their language. See what you did in the [previous verse](../03/07.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-collectivenouns]])
EXO	3	8	8afv	figs-metaphor	מִ⁠יַּ֣ד	1		Someone’s **hand** is a common metaphor for power and control. Use a similar image if your language has one. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EXO	3	8	djbz	figs-possession	מִ⁠יַּ֣ד מִצְרַ֗יִם	1		This is a possessive where the Egyptians are the subject of **the hand**, which means power. The Egyptians used their power and control to oppress the Israelites. Use a phrase in your language that expresses the idea of a group of people having power. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])

First, the statements, **to a good and wide land** and **to a land flowing with milk and honey** are in parallel with each other. Within each of those, **good** and **wide** are in parallel with each other and also **milk** and **honey** are in parallel with each other. Each of these levels is meant to reinforce and expand on one another. These are not examples of synonymous parallelism, and each part of the statement should be translated. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
EXO	3	8	37fp	figs-metonymy	חָלָ֖ב וּ⁠דְבָ֑שׁ	1		Here, **milk** is a metonym for domestic animals and the food products obtained from them; **honey** is a metonym for the food obtained from growing plants. See UST and [the next note]([[rc://en/tn/help/exo/03/08/pxy8]]) (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with an opening second-level quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the beginning of a quotation within a quotation. The closing marks for both the second and third-level quotations should not occur until the end of verse 17. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])

EXO	3	16	55jm	figs-activepassive	הֶ⁠עָשׂ֥וּי	1		In some languages you may not be able to translate this in the passive form. Alternative translation: see UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
EXO	3	16	4vgc	figs-metonymy	בְּ⁠מִצְרָֽיִם	1		The phrase **in Egypt** is a metonym for the Egyptian oppressors. Alternative translation: “by the Egyptians” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
EXO	3	17	eloj	figs-quotemarks	וּ⁠דְבָֽשׁ	1		If you are using direct quotations, at the end of this verse you should have three closing markers. In English, it looks like ’ ” ’ (without spaces). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	3	17	r8mg	figs-idiom	אַעֲלֶ֣ה	1		Regardless of the geographic realities, to **bring up** does not primarily have a literal meaning. Rather, it means to bring the Israelites into a better situation. God promised to bring them up from their low status as slaves to a place where they would be the masters of a good land. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EXO	3	17	wyvt	figs-metonymy	חָלָ֖ב וּ⁠דְבָֽשׁ	1		Here, **milk** is a metonym for domestic animals and the food products obtained from them; **honey** is a metonym for the food obtained from growing plants.

EXO	3	18	i47o	figs-exclusive	עָלֵ֔י⁠נוּ…נֵֽלֲכָה…וְ⁠נִזְבְּחָ֖ה	1		These instances of **us** are exclusive; they include Moses, the elders, and all the Israelites, but exclude the king of Egypt. If your language makes this distinction, verify that you used the correct form. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
EXO	3	18	4eal	translate-numbers	שְׁלֹ֤שֶׁת	1		“3” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])

EXO	3	21	btwc	figs-idiom	חֵ֥ן…בְּ⁠עֵינֵ֣י מִצְרָ֑יִם	1		**In the eyes of the Egyptians** is an idiom for the Egyptian’s feelings. **Favor** means those feelings are positive. Taken together, this means that when the Egyptians see the Israelites (Hebrews) leaving Egypt, they will gladly help them (because they want them to leave so badly due to the Egyptians suffering under God’s judgement).  If your language has the same or a similar idiom, you can translate or use it. Otherwise, you can translate the meaning. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EXO	3	21	82wf	figs-possession	בְּ⁠עֵינֵ֣י מִצְרָ֑יִם	1		This is a part-whole possessive. Also, if your language uses a specific form of the possessive for things one cannot lose, it would be appropriate to use that form here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])

It is unclear both who the sojourning (visiting) women are and in whose house they are sojourning, leaving several possibilities. Most translations that make a decision about who they are identify both the temporary resident and her host home as Egyptian. This makes sense as the Israelites will be plundering the Egyptians. If it is possible to leave this ambiguous in your translation, that would be best. 
EXO	3	22	474q	figs-youdual	וְ⁠שַׂמְתֶּ֗ם עַל־בְּנֵי⁠כֶם֙ וְ⁠עַל־בְּנֹ֣תֵי⁠כֶ֔ם וְ⁠נִצַּלְתֶּ֖ם	1		Each of these is a plural **you.** If your language uses different forms of “you” depending on the number of people addressed, use a plural form here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])

It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with a closing first-level quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the end of a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	4	intro	kap5			0		# Exodus 04 General Notes<br><br>## Potential Translation Issues<br><br>### Quotations<br><br>*   There is a difficult transition between [4:4](../04/04.md) and [4:5](../04/05.md) because the quotation stops in the middle to inject a bit of narrative. When it resumes in [4:5](../04/05.md), the sentence seems incomplete (even if merged directly with the quotation fragment in [4:4](../04/04.md)). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])*   Yahweh’s instructions to Moses are complex and there are up to four levels of quotations in this chapter. Translators will need to decide if some of these need to become indirect quotations (if that is possible in their language) and take great care to use the proper quotation markings in the proper location.<br><br>### Order of events<br><br>*   The order of events is not always clear. In [4:14](../04/14.md) Yahweh tells Moses that Aaron is coming to meet him, but Yahweh telling Aaron to go meet Moses in the wilderness is not recorded until [4:27](../04/27.md).<br>*   The timing of the events in [4:18](../18/.md)\-[4:27](../04/23.md), especially verse 18-19 and 27, in relation to the rest of the events of the chapter is unclear.<br><br>### Thus says Yahweh<br><br>The first of over 400 occurrences throughout the Old Testament of a standard phrase used to introduce direct, authoritative instruction from Yahweh occurs in [4:22](../04/22.md). It occurs ten times in the book of Exodus; nine of these are between chapters 4–11. It would be good for your team to have a standard way to translate this that makes it clear that the words that come next are directly from God. If your language has a standard way of introducing a new message from your leader that alerts the hearers that these are the words of the leader, that would be a good phrase to consider.<br><br>### Yahweh’s attempt to kill someone<br><br>The encounter recorded from [4:24](../04/24.md) to [4:26](../04/26.md) is one of the strangest and most difficult passages in the entire book. Difficulties include:<br><br>*   To whom do the pronouns refer? Masculine pronouns are used throughout the section, but there are two possible antecedents, Moses (who is not named in the narrative) and Zipporah’s son (who was presumably also Moses’ son, but this is how he is referred to in this text. For why, see below on why Yahweh did this). Most commentators believe the pronouns refer to Moses.<br>*   Circumcision is described in fairly graphic detail. Different cultures will need to approach this differently. Some may have terms for circumcision, while others may be comfortable translating mostly literally, and others will need to use euphemisms or other strategies to translate. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/circumcise]])*   The meaning of the phrase **a bridegroom of blood** (ULT) is unknown.<br>*   Why did Yahweh attack Moses? Many commentators conclude that Moses had neglected to circumcise one of his sons because it displeased Zipporah, and Yahweh was holding Moses responsible before he returned to lead the Israelites (who should have been circumcised). When Zipporah repented by circumcising the son herself and touching the foreskin to Moses’ feet, Yahweh relents. These conclusions should help inform translation but should not be made explicit in the text.<br><br>## Study concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Moses does not understand<br><br>Although Moses believes in Yahweh, he does not trust in him. This is because Moses lacks understanding. Moses tries to believe the things he is asked to do are done by his own power. Yahweh is trying to get Moses to trust that these things are Yahweh’s doing. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/believe]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/trust]])<br><br>### Children of God<br><br>This chapter introduces the concept that Israel, the people group, is the chosen people of God and God’s firstborn son. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/elect]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/peopleofgod]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/firstborn]])<br><br>### Yahweh hardened Pharaoh’s heart<br><br>Scholars are divided over how to understand this statement. There is debate over whether Pharaoh plays an active or passive role in the hardening of his own heart. Translators should simply follow the text. In Exodus 4-14 there are ten statements that Yahweh hardens Pharaoh’s heart, and ten statements that Pharaoh hardens his own heart. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
EXO	4	1	j4yg		וַ⁠יַּ֤עַן מֹשֶׁה֙ וַ⁠יֹּ֔אמֶר	1	if they do not believe	Here, **answered and said** is a Hebrew expression which does not convey any extra information. Unless your language naturally uses a similar structure, it is better to translate one verb and omit the other. Alternate translation: “Moses answered”
EXO	4	1	b3xv	figs-quotemarks	וְ⁠הֵן֙ לֹֽא־יַאֲמִ֣ינוּ לִ֔⁠י וְ⁠לֹ֥א יִשְׁמְע֖וּ בְּ⁠קֹלִ֑⁠י כִּ֣י יֹֽאמְר֔וּ לֹֽא־נִרְאָ֥ה אֵלֶ֖י⁠ךָ יְהוָֽה	1		This is a direct quotation. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by marking it with first-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	4	1	neto	figs-quotesinquotes	לֹֽא־נִרְאָ֥ה אֵלֶ֖י⁠ךָ יְהוָֽה	1		This is a second-level quotation. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by marking it with second-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation within a quotation. However, you could translate it as an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: “that Yahweh has not appeared to me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
EXO	4	1	327j		וְ⁠הֵן֙	1		This is a term meant to focus the attention of the listener on what the speaker is about to say. If there is not a good way to translate this term in your language, this term can be omitted from the translation, or you can use an alternate translation like “Listen to me.”
EXO	4	2	87dl	writing-participants	אֵלָ֛י⁠ו…וַ⁠יֹּ֖אמֶר	1		“Moses” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
EXO	4	2	r3f9	figs-quotemarks	מ⁠זה בְ⁠יָדֶ֑⁠ךָ	1		This is a direct quotation. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by marking it with first-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	4	2	p8sg	figs-quotemarks	מַטֶּֽה	1		This is a direct quotation. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by marking it with first-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	4	3	jgir	figs-quotemarks	הַשְׁלִיכֵ֣⁠הוּ אַ֔רְצָ⁠ה	1		This is a direct quotation. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by marking it with first-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	4	3	zycd	figs-metonymy	מִ⁠פָּנָֽי⁠ו	1		Here, “face” figuratively represents the snake itself. Alternative translation: “from the snake” (See:  [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EXO	4	4	g6bk		וֶ⁠אֱחֹ֖ז בִּ⁠זְנָב֑⁠וֹ	1	take it by the tail	“and pick it up by the tail” or “and grasp it by the tail”
EXO	4	4	mqpc	figs-quotemarks	שְׁלַח֙ יָֽדְ⁠ךָ֔ וֶ⁠אֱחֹ֖ז בִּ⁠זְנָב֑⁠וֹ	1		This is a direct quotation.

EXO	4	4	bzmp	grammar-connect-time-sequential	שְׁלַח֙ יָֽדְ⁠ךָ֔ וֶ⁠אֱחֹ֖ז בִּ⁠זְנָב֑⁠וֹ	1		This direct quotation is interrupted by Moses obeying Yahweh. This is probably a tightly ordered sequence of events where Yahweh paused and then continued speaking immediately after Moses obeyed. The quote resumes in [verse 5](../04/05.md) and there is more discussion there about how to handle the resumption.(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
EXO	4	4	m86n		וַ⁠יְהִ֥י לְ⁠מַטֶּ֖ה	1	became a staff	“and it turned into a rod” or “and it changed into a staff”

It may be more natural to reorganize verses four and five to keep the quote together. If you rearrange like this, Moses picking up the snake/staff should come after the full quotation. However, it is better to do something similar to the UST, which restates that Yahweh is speaking and provides some implied directives from Yahweh to make a complete sentence. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	4	5	m4fk	figs-ellipsis	לְמַ֣עַן יַאֲמִ֔ינוּ כִּֽי־נִרְאָ֥ה אֵלֶ֛י⁠ךָ יְהוָ֖ה אֱלֹהֵ֣י אֲבֹתָ֑⁠ם אֱלֹהֵ֧י אַבְרָהָ֛ם אֱלֹהֵ֥י יִצְחָ֖ק וֵ⁠אלֹהֵ֥י יַעֲקֹֽב	1		This quote is not a complete sentence; the UST provides a clarification. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
EXO	4	5	9iok	writing-participants	יַאֲמִ֔ינוּ…אֲבֹתָ֑⁠ם	1		These pronouns refer either to the Israelites or to the Israelite elders. God had instructed Moses to gather and speak to the elders; if you make this participant explicit, elders is a better option. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
EXO	4	5	oqi5	writing-participants	אֵלֶ֛י⁠ךָ	1		This refers to Moses. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
EXO	4	5	jr8m		אֱלֹהֵ֣י אֲבֹתָ֑⁠ם אֱלֹהֵ֧י אַבְרָהָ֛ם אֱלֹהֵ֥י יִצְחָ֖ק וֵ⁠אלֹהֵ֥י יַעֲקֹֽב	1	the God of their ancestors, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob	Abraham, Isaac and Jacob were three of their ancestors. They all worshiped the same God.
EXO	4	6	0hre	figs-quotemarks	הָֽבֵא־נָ֤א יָֽדְ⁠ךָ֙ בְּ⁠חֵיקֶ֔⁠ךָ	1		This is a direct quotation.

EXO	4	6	ep52	figs-exclamations	וְ⁠הִנֵּ֥ה	1	behold	This word is used to create an exclamation, showing surprise. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations]])
EXO	4	6	pw7g	figs-simile	כַּ⁠שָּֽׁלֶג	1	as white as snow	The word **like** (ULT) or “as” (UST) here is used to compare how Moses’ hand looked. You may not have a word for snow in your language. If so, consider an alternative that describes something very white. You may need to make the whiteness explicit. Alternate translation: “like wool” or “that made it look white like the sand on the beach” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
EXO	4	7	kv9r	figs-quotemarks	הָשֵׁ֤ב יָֽדְ⁠ךָ֙ אֶל־חֵיקֶ֔⁠ךָ	1		This is a direct quotation.

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	4	7	prr9	figs-exclamations	וְ⁠הִנֵּה	1		This word is used to create an exclamation, showing surprise. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations]])
EXO	4	8	q9qb	figs-exclamations	וְ⁠הָיָה֙ 	1		Yahweh’s speech resumes here and continues through the end of [verse 9](../04/09.md). It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with an opening first-level quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the beginning of a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	4	8	well	figs-personification	וְ⁠לֹ֣א יִשְׁמְע֔וּ לְ⁠קֹ֖ל הָ⁠אֹ֣ת הָ⁠רִאשׁ֑וֹן וְ⁠הֶֽאֱמִ֔ינוּ לְ⁠קֹ֖ל הָ⁠אֹ֥ת הָ⁠אַחֲרֽוֹן	1		Here the **sign**s are spoken of as if they had a **voice** with which they could speak. If this imagery would not make sense in your language you may need to translate this in a way that makes explicit that the signs are meant to be proof that God sent Moses. Alternative translation: “and are not convinced that God has appeared to you by seeing the first sign, then they will be convinced by seeing the second sign.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
EXO	4	8	gxlg	writing-participants	יַאֲמִ֣ינוּ…יִשְׁמְע֔וּ…וְ⁠הֶֽאֱמִ֔ינוּ	1		These pronouns refer either to the Israelites or to the Israelite elders. God had instructed Moses to gather and speak to the elders; if you make this participant explicit, elders is the better option, but be sure to do the same as you did in [verse 5](../04/05.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
EXO	4	8	lsb3		לֹ֣א יַאֲמִ֣ינוּ…וְ⁠הֶֽאֱמִ֔ינוּ	1	pay attention	“they do not acknowledge… then they will acknowledge” or “they do not accept… then they will accept”

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	4	10	t8i9		בִּ֣י	1		This word is used by a speaker to beg a superior to allow him to speak. Alternate translation: “Please”

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	4	11	ks2m	figs-rquestion	מִ֣י שָׂ֣ם פֶּה֮ לָֽ⁠אָדָם֒	1	Who is it who made man’s mouth?	Yahweh uses this question to emphasize that he is the Creator who makes it possible for people to speak.

Yahweh uses this question to emphasize that he is the one who decides if people can speak and hear, and if they can see. Alternate translation: “I, Yahweh, make people able to speak, or hear, or to see, or to be blind!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
EXO	4	11	uq7j	figs-rquestion	הֲ⁠לֹ֥א אָנֹכִ֖י יְהוָֽה	1	Is it not I, Yahweh?	Yahweh uses this question to emphasize that he alone makes these decisions. Alternate translation: “I, Yahweh, am the one who does this!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

EXO	4	14	e0js	figs-kinship	אָחִ֨י⁠ךָ֙	1		His **brother** Aaron was three years older than Moses (see [Exodus 7:7](../07/07.md)), which may be important for translating “brother” in some languages. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-kinship]])
EXO	4	14	y5ed	figs-idiom	דַבֵּ֥ר יְדַבֵּ֖ר	1		In Hebrew, the word **speak** is repeated. This means he speaks well. English cannot convey this by doubling, so the meaning of the repetition was translated in the ULT in this case. If your language can say something like “speaking speaks” to mean “speaks well,” consider it; otherwise, translate the meaning similarly to the ULT or UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EXO	4	14	8q64		הִנֵּה	1		**Behold** is used to draw attention to surprising information that follows. If your language has a term that functions in that way (“Listen!” or “Look!” or “Pay Attention!”), use it here.

EXO	4	14	8kn8	grammar-connect-logic-result	וְ⁠שָׂמַ֥ח	1		Aaron will be glad because he sees Moses. Consider a conjunction or other form that expresses result as in the UST or alternative translation: “and because he sees you, he will have joy” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
EXO	4	14	ew4h	figs-metonymy	בְּ⁠לִבּֽ⁠וֹ	1	he will be glad in his heart	Here, **heart** refers to inner thoughts and emotions. If the heart is not a body part your culture uses to refer to a person’s thoughts and emotions, consider using whichever organ your culture would use for this image.

EXO	4	16	mnsp	figs-simile	לְ⁠פֶ֔ה	1		This phrase compares Aaron to a mouth because he will be the one to actually vocalize to the Israelites and Pharaoh what Moses tells him to say. Alternate translation: “the one to say what you tell him to say” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
EXO	4	16	gn5v	figs-simile	תִּֽהְיֶה־לּ֥⁠וֹ לֵֽ⁠אלֹהִֽים	1	you will be to him like me, God	The word **like** here means Moses would represent the same authority to Aaron as God did to Moses. Alternate translation: “you will speak to Aaron with the same authority with which I speak to you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
EXO	4	17	0h45	figs-quotemarks	תַּעֲשֶׂה־בּ֖⁠וֹ אֶת־הָ⁠אֹתֹֽת	1		After this phrase, the direct quote of Yahweh ends.

EXO	4	18	cbop	figs-go	וַ⁠יֵּ֨לֶךְ	1		Because the setting has shifted back to Jethro’s home, some languages may need to use “come” here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])
EXO	4	18	b6mf	figs-kinship	חֹֽתְנ֗⁠וֹ	1	father-in-law	This refers to the father of Moses’ wife. Some languages may use a different term for the husband’s or wife’s father. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-kinship]]) 
EXO	4	18	wlit	writing-participants	וַ⁠יֹּ֤אמֶר	1		“and Moses said” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])

It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by marking it with first-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	4	18	67yz	figs-metonymy	אַחַ֣⁠י	1		“my relatives” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EXO	4	18	gq2g	figs-idiom	וְ⁠אֶרְאֶ֖ה הַ⁠עוֹדָ֣⁠ם	1		Later in the Bible we are told that Moses was in Midian for 40 years. Moses’ request may have been literal or an idiom that meant he wanted to know how they were doing. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EXO	4	18	yay3	figs-explicit	לֵ֥ךְ לְ⁠שָׁלֽוֹם	1		This is a phrase of assent and blessing. It may be necessary for some languages to explicitly add, “Yes,” to the beginning of Jethro’s response. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EXO	4	18	i807	figs-quotemarks	לֵ֥ךְ לְ⁠שָׁלֽוֹם	1		This is a direct quotation. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by marking it with first-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	4	19	wwr8	grammar-connect-time-sequential	וַ⁠יֹּ֨אמֶר יְהוָ֤ה אֶל־מֹשֶׁה֙	1		The timing and situation for Yahweh speaking to Moses here is not specified. Some conjecture that it was part of the narrative of the encounter with Yahweh from the previous verses but placed after his request to Jethro for an unknown reason. Another speculation is that Moses delayed returning to Egypt (either by his own choice, Yahweh’s instructions, or someone else delaying him) and Yahweh came and told him again (the UST explicitly offers this optional translation). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
EXO	4	19	aosm	figs-quotemarks	לֵ֖ךְ שֻׁ֣ב מִצְרָ֑יִם כִּי־מֵ֨תוּ֙ כָּל־הָ֣⁠אֲנָשִׁ֔ים הַֽ⁠מְבַקְשִׁ֖ים אֶת־נַפְשֶֽׁ⁠ךָ	1		This is a direct quotation. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by marking it with first-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	4	19	clfj		הַֽ⁠מְבַקְשִׁ֖ים אֶת־נַפְשֶֽׁ⁠ךָ	1		This means they were seeking to end his life, that is, to kill him. Alternate translation: see UST.
EXO	4	20	fua6	writing-participants	בָּנָ֗י⁠ו	1		Moses’ second son is not introduced until [18:4](../18/.04.md) but had already been born before they left Midian. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
EXO	4	20	zi5m	writing-participants	וַ⁠יָּ֖שָׁב אַ֣רְצָ⁠ה מִצְרָ֑יִם	1		It is clear from [verse 24](../04/24.md) and [25](../04/25.md) that his family went with him, so you may need to translate as “they returned.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
EXO	4	20	47k5	grammar-connect-time-sequential	וַ⁠יָּ֖שָׁב אַ֣רְצָ⁠ה מִצְרָ֑יִם	1		After the incident on the road in verses [24](../04/24.md)-[26](../04/26.md), Moses’ family is not mentioned again until [18:2](../18/02.md) which says that Moses sent them back, so a translation similar to the UST which only commits to the family starting on the way to Egypt may be better. This option has the further benefit of allowing for the several events that happen before Moses gets to Egypt. The ULT’s “towards” is another way of giving space in the translation for the next several events. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
EXO	4	20	768n	figs-explicit	מַטֵּ֥ה הָ⁠אֱלֹהִ֖ים	1		The phrase the staff of God refers to the staff that God told Moses to take with him in v. [17](../04/17.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EXO	4	20	7e3s	figs-explicit	מַטֵּ֥ה הָ⁠אֱלֹהִ֖ים	1		The book describes this staff as **the staff of God** because God appointed it as his instrument so that Moses could do miraculous works through it. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Make sure your translation does not lead people to think the staff was a magic wand or shaman’s staff that had its own power, or power from Moses, or that the staff gave Moses the ability to command God. In every instance where miracles happened, God told Moses to do something with the staff, Moses obeyed, and then God caused a miracle. Alternate translation: “the staff that God had told him to bring because God intended to work powerfully through it when Moses stretched it out.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EXO	4	21	lva8	figs-quotemarks	בְּ⁠לֶכְתְּ⁠ךָ֙ 	1		This begins a direct quotation that continues to the end of [4:23](../04/23.md). It contains up to fourth-level quotations. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with an opening first-level quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the beginning of a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	4	21	oajf		רְאֵ֗ה	1		Most translations and interpretations of the verb **see** take it to mean something like “see that you do.”
EXO	4	21	0gqf	figs-metaphor	כָּל־הַ⁠מֹּֽפְתִים֙ אֲשֶׁר־שַׂ֣מְתִּי בְ⁠יָדֶ֔⁠ךָ	1		Here the miracles are spoken of as if they were items Moses could carry. In part, this may be because the three signs already given to Moses involved the use of his hand. Alternative translation: “all the wonders I have authorized you to perform” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EXO	4	21	kdsb	figs-metonymy	לִ⁠פְנֵ֣י פַרְעֹ֑ה	1		This time while **before the face of** still has the standard figurative meaning of “in the presence of,” it is a much more literal use here. Moses is to actually do the miracles in front of Pharaoh so he can see them. Alternative translation: “so Pharaoh can see them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EXO	4	21	ovma	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	וַ⁠אֲנִי֙ אֲחַזֵּ֣ק	1		Referring to himself in the opening of this sentence serves to emphasize a contrast in what might be expected and what will happen. Translate this in a way that clearly contrasts the performance of miracles before Pharaoh (which might be expected to lead to him releasing the Israelites) with what Yahweh says he will do. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
EXO	4	21	uvoh	figs-metaphor	וַ⁠אֲנִי֙ אֲחַזֵּ֣ק אֶת־לִבּ֔⁠וֹ	1		This means that God will make him stubborn. His stubborn attitude is spoken of as if his heart would be made stronger. If the heart is not the body part your culture uses to refer to a person’s will, consider using whichever organ your culture would use for this image. Alternate translation: “But as for me, I will cause Pharaoh to be stubborn” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EXO	4	21	uudz	grammar-connect-logic-result	וְ⁠לֹ֥א יְשַׁלַּ֖ח אֶת־הָ⁠עָֽם	1		Make it clear in your translation that this is a result of God hardening Pharaoh’s heart. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
EXO	4	22	ftde		כֹּ֚ה אָמַ֣ר יְהוָ֔ה	1		This is the first of hundreds of occurrences throughout the Old Testament of a standard phrase used to introduce direct, authoritative instruction from Yahweh. It would be good for your team to have a standard way to translate this that makes it clear that the words that come next are directly from God. If your language has a standard way of introducing a new message from your rulers that alerts the hearers that these are the words of the rulers, that would be a good phrase to consider.
EXO	4	22	zb2e	figs-quotesinquotes	כֹּ֚ה	1		**Thus** begins a second-level quotation that continues until the end of  [4:23](../04/23.md). It should be marked in some manner that distinguishes it from the outer level, the first level. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
EXO	4	22	teyy	figs-quotesinquotes	כֹּ֚ה אָמַ֣ר יְהוָ֔ה	1		This begins a second-level quotation that continues until the end of  [4:23](../04/23.md). It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with an opening second-level quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the beginning of a quotation within a quotation. However, you may want to translate this as an indirect quotation in order to reduce the levels of quotations in this passage. Alternative translation: “that Yahweh says” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
EXO	4	22	kud7	figs-quotemarks	בְּנִ֥⁠י	1		This is the beginning of a third-level quotation that continues until the end of [4:23](../04/23.md). It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with an opening third-level quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the beginning of a quotation within a quotation within a quotation. (If you chose to translate, “Thus says Yahweh,” as an indirect quote, this will be a second- level quotation.) (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	4	22	1od0	figs-metaphor	בְּנִ֥⁠י בְכֹרִ֖⁠י יִשְׂרָאֵֽל׃	1		Some languages may need to change the metaphor here into a simile. See UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EXO	4	22	pt4n	figs-collectivenouns	יִשְׂרָאֵֽל	1	Israel is my son	The word **Israel** here represents all the people of Israel as a group. It is important to keep the singular reference to Israel as son, rather than change it to something like ‘the Israelites are my children,’ because God is making a particular contrast here between his son and Pharaoh’s son. Some languages may not be able to use “Israel” as a collective noun and may need to choose a translation like “the nation of Israel” or “the Israelite nation.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-collectivenouns]])
EXO	4	22	8oc8	figs-metonymy	יִשְׂרָאֵֽל	1		The Israelite nation is often referred to simply by the name of the patriarch. For alternative translation see: [[rc://en/tn/help/exo/04/22/pt4n]] (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EXO	4	23	syar	figs-quotemarks	שַׁלַּ֤ח אֶת־בְּנִ⁠י֙ וְ⁠יַֽעַבְדֵ֔⁠נִי	1		This is a fourth-level quotation. It should be marked in some manner that distinguishes it from the outer levels. (If you chose to translate “Thus says Yahweh” as an indirect quote, this will be a third-level quotation.) (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	4	23	0pc4	figs-quotations	וָ⁠אֹמַ֣ר אֵלֶ֗י⁠ךָ שַׁלַּ֤ח אֶת־בְּנִ⁠י֙ וְ⁠יַֽעַבְדֵ֔⁠נִי וַ⁠תְּמָאֵ֖ן	1		The fourth-level quotation here may be a good one to translate as an indirect quotation in order to reduce the levels of quotations in this passage. Alternative translation: “and I told you to let my son go that he may serve me. But you have refused” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
EXO	4	23	k7mh	figs-metaphor	בְּנִ⁠י֙	1	you have refused to let him go	Yahweh continues to metaphorically speak of Israel as **my son.** See what you did at [[rc://en/tn/help/exo/04/22/1od0]]. Alternative translation: “the Israelite nation which is like a son to me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EXO	4	23	u825	figs-pronouns	וְ⁠יַֽעַבְדֵ֔⁠נִי…לְ⁠שַׁלְּח֑⁠וֹ	1		The pronouns **he** and **him** agree with “son.” What you use may depend on how you translated son at [[rc://en/tn/help/exo/04/23/k7mh]]. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pronouns]])
EXO	4	23	2g32		הִנֵּה֙	1		This is used to draw attention to surprising information that follows. Alternative translation: “Know this” 
EXO	4	23	re11		בִּנְ⁠ךָ֖ 	1	I will certainly kill your son, your firstborn	This refers to the actual son of Pharaoh.
EXO	4	23	ubcw	figs-quotemarks	בִּנְ⁠ךָ֖ בְּכֹרֶֽ⁠ךָ	1		After this phrase, the three levels of direct quotations end bringing a complete close to all quotations that started in verses [21](../04/21.md) and [22](../04/22.md). If you are using direct quotations, at the end of this verse you should have three closing markers, third level, second level and first level. In English, it looks like **” ’ ”** (without spaces). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	4	24	sp6h	writing-newevent	וַ⁠יְהִ֥י	1	Yahweh met Moses and tried to kill him	This introduces a new event. Mark the transition in a natural way in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
EXO	4	24	p820	writing-participants	וַ⁠יִּפְגְּשֵׁ֣⁠הוּ…הֲמִיתֽ⁠וֹ	1		Here, it is not clear who **him** refers to. Most commentators believe it refers to Moses, but it could refer to the son, though that is less likely. If it is necessary to choose for your translation, use Moses. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
EXO	4	24	3xy0	writing-participants	הֲמִיתֽ⁠וֹ	1		Here, **he** refers to Yahweh. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
EXO	4	25	m1la	translate-names	צִפֹּרָ֜ה	1	Zipporah	This is the name of Moses’s wife. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
EXO	4	25	sftg	writing-participants	צִפֹּרָ֜ה	1		Zipporah is introduced here as a new participant. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
EXO	4	25	a36h	translate-unknown	צֹ֗ר	1	flint knife	This was a knife with a sharpened stone blade. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
EXO	4	25	nkxn	translate-unknown	עָרְלַ֣ת	1		The**foreskin** is the retractable fold of skin which covers and protects the end of the penis. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
EXO	4	25	l6sr	figs-euphemism	לְ⁠רַגְלָ֑י⁠ו	1	to his feet	It is possible that the word **feet** may have been a more respectful way to refer to the genital area of the body. However, that possibility is not high enough that you should translate it either literally as genitals or with another euphemism meaning genitals in your language. If you have a word that means primarily feet or legs, but could in some cases also euphemistically mean genitals, you may consider it. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
EXO	4	25	3g3x	figs-quotemarks	כִּ֧י חֲתַן־דָּמִ֛ים אַתָּ֖ה לִֽ⁠י	1		This is a direct quotation. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by marking it with first-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	4	25	b2t3	figs-metaphor	כִּ֧י חֲתַן־דָּמִ֛ים אַתָּ֖ה לִֽ⁠י	1	you are a bridegroom to me by blood	The meaning of this metaphor is unclear. It was probably a known saying in that culture. Alternate translation: “you are related to me by this blood” or “you are my husband because of blood” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EXO	4	26	ceqk	grammar-connect-logic-result	וַ⁠יִּ֖רֶף	1		As a result of Zipporah’s action. Consider a conjunction or other form that expresses result as in the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
EXO	4	26	o4zt	writing-participants	וַ⁠יִּ֖רֶף	1		“Yahweh relented” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
EXO	4	26	4l5u	writing-participants	מִמֶּ֑⁠נּוּ	1		As in [4:24](../04/24.md) this could mean either Moses or the son, but most commentators think it is still Moses. The UST uses “anyone” to preserve ambiguity. Alternative translation: “from Moses” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
EXO	4	26	r8hj	figs-quotations	חֲתַ֥ן דָּמִ֖ים	1		This is a unique quotation because Zipporah probably does not speak again, rather the quotation refers back to her statement in [4:25](../04/25.md). Your language may handle this sort of quotation in a special way. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
EXO	4	26	abmg	figs-quotemarks	חֲתַ֥ן דָּמִ֖ים לַ⁠מּוּלֹֽת	1		It is not clear if the quotation includes **because of the circumcision** or if that is a comment explaining the quotation. Translations are divided in where they end the quotation, but most exclude **because of the circumcision** and it is best to follow that unless a locally respected translation includes it. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	4	27	xk6b	writing-newevent	וַ⁠יֹּ֤אמֶר	1	Yahweh said to Aaron	You may want to add a word that marks the beginning of a new part of the story, as the UST does. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
EXO	4	27	qxpc	writing-participants	אַהֲרֹ֔ן	1		**Aaron** is introduced as a new participant. Some languages may mark this in some way. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
EXO	4	27	221t	figs-quotemarks	לֵ֛ךְ לִ⁠קְרַ֥את מֹשֶׁ֖ה הַ⁠מִּדְבָּ֑רָ⁠ה	1		This is a direct quotation. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by marking it with first-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	4	27	wy4n	figs-possession	בְּ⁠הַ֥ר הָ⁠אֱלֹהִ֖ים	1	at the mountain of God	See how you translated this in [3:1](../03/01.md), consult this this note: [[rc://en/tn/help/exo/03/01/p27s]] (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
EXO	4	27	tfn2	translate-symaction	וַ⁠יִּשַּׁק	1		This was a traditional way of greeting which showed love. You can make this explicit as the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
EXO	4	28	ad9x		שְׁלָח֑⁠וֹ…צִוָּֽ⁠הוּ	1		These are a bit awkward to translate in English, so the UST adds more information. Other languages may not have the same difficulty.
EXO	4	28	b429	writing-participants	שְׁלָח֑⁠וֹ…צִוָּֽ⁠הוּ	1	he had sent him to say	The words **he** refers to Yahweh, and **him** refers to Moses. Alternative translation: “Yahweh sent Moses…Yahweh commanded Moses” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
EXO	4	29	y8o3	writing-newevent	וַ⁠יֵּ֥לֶךְ	1		This begins a new event which you may need to mark in your translation with a transitional word like the UST’s “When.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
EXO	4	30	bm2x	figs-metonymy	לְ⁠עֵינֵ֥י הָ⁠עָֽם	1	in the sight of the people	This means he did the signs so they could see them. Alternative translation: “in their sight” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EXO	4	30	x1v3	writing-participants	הָ⁠עָֽם	1		Context suggests that **people** refers to the leaders gathered in [4:29](../04/29.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
EXO	4	31	8n78	writing-participants	הָ⁠עָ֑ם	1		Context suggests that **people** refers to the leaders gathered in [4:29](../04/29.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
EXO	4	31	q1er		פָקַ֨ד…בְּנֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֗ל	1	had observed the Israelites	“saw the Israelites” or “was concerned about the Israelites”
EXO	4	31	g83a	translate-symaction	וַֽ⁠יִּקְּד֖וּ וַ⁠יִּֽשְׁתַּחֲוּֽוּ	1	they bowed their heads	Alternative translations: “they bowed their heads in awe” or “they bowed down low in reverence.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
EXO	5	intro	kea2			0		# Exodus 05 General Notes<br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### A slave’s work<br>The Egyptians were known for making their slaves do a lot of work. The Israelite slaves were forced to make a specific number of bricks every day. In this chapter, they were required not only to make these bricks, but also to gather straw, one of the raw materials, in order to make these bricks.<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### “Let my people go”<br>This is a very important statement. Moses does not  seek permission to leave, asking Pharaoh to “let go” of the Hebrew people. Instead, he demands that Pharaoh free the Hebrew people.<br><br>### Titles<br>The leaders are given different titles in this chapter. The ULT uses “taskmasters” and “foremen.” Many cultures will not have these types of titles. Generic expressions like “Egyptian leaders” and “Hebrew leaders” may be necessary.

EXO	5	1	q9kn	grammar-connect-time-sequential	וְ⁠אַחַ֗ר בָּ֚אוּ מֹשֶׁ֣ה וְ⁠אַהֲרֹ֔ן וַ⁠יֹּאמְר֖וּ אֶל־פַּרְעֹ֑ה	1	After these things happened	It is unclear how long Moses and Aaron waited until they went to see Pharoah. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
EXO	5	1	cudx	figs-go	בָּ֚אוּ	1		In this instance, depending on how they have to set scenes, some languages may need to use “came in.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])
EXO	5	1	7l1y	writing-participants	פַּרְעֹ֑ה	1		Pharaoh is reintroduced as a participant in the narrative for the first time since chapter two. Some languages may need to mark his reintroduction in a particular way. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	5	1	lu3i		כֹּֽה־אָמַ֤ר יְהוָה֙	1		This quote form is used to introduce commands from Yahweh. See [4:intro](../04/intro.md) for more information.
EXO	5	1	u2vt		וְ⁠יָחֹ֥גּוּ	1	festival for me	This is a celebration to worship Yahweh. Alternative translation: “so they can worship me with eating and drinking” 
EXO	5	2	v4c1	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר	1	Why should I…let Israel go?	The result here is exactly as God has said; therefore, a contrastive transition word is reasonable but not required given the immediate human context. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
EXO	5	2	fq6i	figs-quotemarks	מִ֤י יְהוָה֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר אֶשְׁמַ֣ע בְּ⁠קֹל֔⁠וֹ לְ⁠שַׁלַּ֖ח אֶת־יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל לֹ֤א יָדַ֨עְתִּי֙ אֶת־יְהוָ֔ה וְ⁠גַ֥ם אֶת־יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל לֹ֥א אֲשַׁלֵּֽחַ	1		This is a direct quotation.

EXO	5	2	lqwt		מִ֤י יְהוָה֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר אֶשְׁמַ֣ע בְּ⁠קֹל֔⁠וֹ לְ⁠שַׁלַּ֖ח אֶת־יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל	1		This is not a rhetorical question, though Pharaoh may have spoken with contempt. Pharaoh would have considered himself a go. The Egyptians had several gods, and most people groups were assumed to have their own gods. Therefore, Pharaoh had truly not heard of Yahweh (who has just told his name to Moses).
EXO	5	2	wpff	figs-collectivenouns	יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל…יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל	1		Here the nation is spoken of as an individual. Alternative translation: “the nation of Israel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-collectivenouns]])
EXO	5	2	c653	figs-metonymy	בְּ⁠קֹל֔⁠וֹ	1	listen to his voice	This represent the words God spoke. Alternate translation: “listen to what he says” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

Alternate translation: “them a reason to think they would be right” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EXO	5	22	pm0l	figs-quotemarks	וַ⁠יֹּאמַ֑ר 	1		After this phrase, a direct quote begins which continues to the end of the chapter. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with an opening first-level quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the beginning of a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	5	22	g4d5	figs-rquestion	לָ֥⁠מָּה זֶּ֖ה שְׁלַחְתָּֽ⁠נִי	1	Lord, why have you caused trouble for this people?	This question shows how disappointed Moses was that the Egyptians were treating the Israelites even more harshly now. He is expressing that he thinks God has caused the opposite of what he promised to happen. Alternate translation: “You sent me to rescue them.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
EXO	5	23	v2k2	figs-metonymy	בִּ⁠שְׁמֶ֔⁠ךָ 	1	to speak to him in your name	Here, **in your name** indicates that Moses delivers Yahweh’s message. Alternate translation: “for you” or “your message for him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EXO	5	23	fzir	figs-idiom	וְ⁠הַצֵּ֥ל לֹא־הִצַּ֖לְתָּ	1		In Hebrew, **rescued** is repeated for emphasis. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EXO	5	23	ce6s	figs-idiom	עַמֶּֽ⁠ךָ	1		After this phrase, the direct quote of Moses that began in the [previous verse](../05/22.md) ends. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with a closing first-level quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the end of a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	6	intro	we5k			0		# Exodus 06 General Notes<br><br>## Possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Repetition of events:<br><br>Most of the content of this chapter is very similar to the events and dialogue in chapters 3-4. For consistency, translators should consult the decisions they made there while keeping in mind that this narrative is not exactly the same. Also, verses 10-12 and verses 28-30 are very similar to each other. These events are probably a recommissioning of Moses. After his first encounter with Pharaoh went very poorly and the Israelites seem to reject God, reminds Moses of God’s promises and power.<br><br>### Referring to God<br><br>A name for God (**Yahweh**) and a title for God (**El Shaddai**) are mentioned in this chapter ([6:2](../06/02.md)\-[6:3](../06/03.md)). The precise meaning of El Shaddai is not known, but most scholars think it means something like “almighty.” Translators who have worked on Genesis may find confusing the statement that Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob did not know Yahweh as the name of God.<br><br>### Other possible translation difficulties:<br><br>With little explanation, a large portion of the chapter is devoted to the genealogy of Moses and Aaron. Some of the people in the genealogy lived much longer than is normal for humans today. If translators are not familiar with the lengths of people’s lives in the early days of the world (as recorded in Genesis, especially chapter 5), this may cause confusion.<br><br>## Study concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Promised Land<br><br>According to the covenant Yahweh made with Abraham, Egypt is not the home of the Hebrew people. Their home is the Promised Land in Canaan. The people are to return home to their land. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/covenant]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/promisedland]])<br><br>### “Let my people go”<br><br>This is a very important statement. Moses is not asking Pharaoh to “let go” of the Hebrew people. Instead, he is demanding that Pharaoh free the Hebrew people.<br><br>### God and his people<br><br>In verse 7, note mention of a very important biblical theme of God being “your God” and the special relationship that his people have with him.
EXO	6	1	ip5i	figs-quotemarks	עַתָּ֣ה תִרְאֶ֔ה אֲשֶׁ֥ר אֶֽעֱשֶׂ֖ה לְ⁠פַרְעֹ֑ה כִּ֣י בְ⁠יָ֤ד חֲזָקָה֙ יְשַׁלְּחֵ֔⁠ם וּ⁠בְ⁠יָ֣ד חֲזָקָ֔ה יְגָרְשֵׁ֖⁠ם מֵ⁠אַרְצֽ⁠וֹ	1		This is a direct quotation. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by marking it with first-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	6	1	lu95	grammar-connect-time-sequential	עַתָּ֣ה	1		This refers to future events starting very soon. Alternative translation: “Starting soon” or “Very soon” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
EXO	6	1	ece6	figs-metonymy	בְ⁠יָ֤ד חֲזָקָה֙…וּ⁠בְ⁠יָ֣ד חֲזָקָ֔ה	1	my strong hand	**Hand** is a metonym for power. Alternate translation: “by a strong power … and by a strong power” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EXO	6	1	7wm5	figs-metonymy	בְ⁠יָ֤ד חֲזָקָה֙…וּ⁠בְ⁠יָ֣ד חֲזָקָ֔ה	1		It is not clear in the text whose **hand** is referred to here. The options are: (1) Both refer to God’s hand (forcing Pharaoh’s actions), (2) Both refer to Pharaoh’s hand (forcing the Israelites out), (3) They don’t refer to the same person’s hand; the first refers to God’s and the second to Pharaoh’s. The UST has followed (1) which is the most common interpretation. Alternate translation: (1) “by my strong hand … and by my strong hand” or (2) “by his strong hand … and by his strong hand” or  (3) “by my strong hand … and by his strong hand”
EXO	6	1	4m4g	figs-parallelism	כִּ֣י בְ⁠יָ֤ד חֲזָקָה֙ יְשַׁלְּחֵ֔⁠ם וּ⁠בְ⁠יָ֣ד חֲזָקָ֔ה יְגָרְשֵׁ֖⁠ם מֵ⁠אַרְצֽ⁠וֹ	1		These two phrases mean similar things. God says the same thing twice, in similar ways, for emphasis. You do not need to repeat both phrases in your translation if that might be confusing for your readers. Instead, if it would be clearer in your language, you could combine them. Alternate translation: “I will force him to let my people leave the land”  However, there is a slight difference in meaning, and you could also choose to bring that out in your translation. The second phrase intensifies the first by portraying Pharaoh as not merely letting the Israelites go, but as forcing them to leave the land. Alternate translation: “I will force him to let them go, in fact, I will force him to force them to leave his land” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
EXO	6	1	sdon		מֵ⁠אַרְצֽ⁠וֹ	1		“from Egypt”
EXO	6	2	5m1a	writing-newevent	וַ⁠יְדַבֵּ֥ר אֱלֹהִ֖ים אֶל־מֹשֶׁ֑ה וַ⁠יֹּ֥אמֶר אֵלָ֖י⁠ו 	1		There is a transition here. Before this verse, Yahweh was answering Moses’ question more directly. At the beginning of this verse, Yahweh is reintroduced as “God” because he begins to make a clarifying statement about himself and his relationship with the Israelites and their ancestors as well as his plans for the Israelites. Much of this section repeats what Yahweh has already told Moses. You may want to consider a section break before this verse. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
EXO	6	2	kcty	figs-quotemarks	וַ⁠יְדַבֵּ֥ר אֱלֹהִ֖ים אֶל־מֹשֶׁ֑ה וַ⁠יֹּ֥אמֶר אֵלָ֖י⁠ו 	1		After this phrase a direct quote begins which continues until the end of [verse 8](../06/08.md). It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with an opening first-level quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the beginning of a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	6	3	l81y	translate-transliterate	בְּ⁠אֵ֣ל שַׁדָּ֑י	1	I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob	This is a title for God that many scholars think means “almighty.” You will need to decide if you will transliterate the term into your language or translate the meaning. Either approach has broad support. Alternative translation: “as the strongest God of all” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate]])
EXO	6	3	m27p	figs-activepassive	וּ⁠שְׁמִ֣⁠י יְהוָ֔ה לֹ֥א נוֹדַ֖עְתִּי לָ⁠הֶֽם	1	I was not known to them	This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: “but they did not know me by my name Yahweh” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
EXO	6	3	e36z		וּ⁠שְׁמִ֣⁠י יְהוָ֔ה לֹ֥א נוֹדַ֖עְתִּי לָ⁠הֶֽם	1		This statement is very difficult to understand as God’s name, Yahweh, is used throughout Genesis, including by Abraham and others. There are many theories about what it means; the view followed by the UST is that now God is revealing to the Israelites a fuller meaning of his divine name than what Abraham and others knew. Alternate translation: “but my name Yahweh was not understood by them”
EXO	6	4	zxvc	figs-quotations	לָ⁠תֵ֥ת לָ⁠הֶ֖ם אֶת־אֶ֣רֶץ כְּנָ֑עַן	1		This is the content of the covenant promise from God to his people. Some languages may need to make this part a direct quotation. Alternate translation: “ I said, ‘I will give you the land of Canaan’ ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
EXO	6	4	gkkc	figs-parallelism	אֶ֥רֶץ מְגֻרֵי⁠הֶ֖ם אֲשֶׁר־גָּ֥רוּ בָֽ⁠הּ	1		These two phrases mean similar things. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine these phrases. Alternate translation: “the land they lived in as temporary residents”; otherwise, “the land that was not their home but where they lived as foreigners” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
EXO	6	5	l3yc		נַאֲקַת֙	1	groaning	This means making sad sounds because of pain and suffering.
EXO	6	5	0l2p		וָ⁠אֶזְכֹּ֖ר אֶת־בְּרִיתִֽ⁠י	1		**I have remembered my covenant** means God is going to take action. Alternative translation: “I will keep my promise”
EXO	6	6	rgh0	grammar-connect-logic-result	לָ⁠כֵ֞ן	1		God is now telling Moses to deliver a message to the Israelites of what God is going to do because of everything that he said in verses 2-5. The reason-result relationship is strongly marked here, so translations should make sure to use a connector that marks verse 6-8 as a result of verses 2-5. Alternate translation: “Because of this” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
EXO	6	6	yv14		לָ⁠כֵ֞ן אֱמֹ֥ר לִ⁠בְנֵֽי־יִשְׂרָאֵ֘ל	1	say to the Israelites	This is a command from Yahweh to Moses. Alternate translation: “So Yahweh told Moses to say to the Israelites”
EXO	6	6	yg2d	figs-quotemarks	אֲנִ֣י	1		This begins a second-level quotation that continues to the end of Yahweh’s speech at the close of [verse 8](../06/08.md). It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by marking it with second-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation within a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	6	6	we3z	figs-youdual	אֶתְ⁠כֶ֗ם…אֶתְ⁠כֶ֖ם…אֶתְ⁠כֶם֙	1		**You** refers to the Israelites. If your language uses different forms of “you” depending on the number of people addressed, use a plural form here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
EXO	6	6	oqnw	figs-synecdoche	מִ⁠תַּ֨חַת֙ סִבְלֹ֣ת מִצְרַ֔יִם	1		This refers to all the hard work the Egyptians made the Israelites do. Alternate translation: “from the hard work the Egyptians force you to do” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
EXO	6	6	xyn4	figs-metaphor	בִּ⁠זְר֣וֹעַ נְטוּיָ֔ה	1		**Arm** here is a figurative way of referring to God’s power, influence, and capacity for action. **Outstretched** means that he is using that power. Alternate translation: “by my great strength” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EXO	6	6	efx1		וּ⁠בִ⁠שְׁפָטִ֖ים	1		Here, the term **judgments** refers to the plagues that God is about to send to harm Egypt and the Egyptians. Each plague is a response to Pharaoh’s stubbornness. Alternate translation: “and by [greatly] harming the Egyptians”
EXO	6	7	o3lb	figs-youdual	אֶתְ⁠כֶ֥ם…לָ⁠כֶ֖ם…וִֽ⁠ידַעְתֶּ֗ם…אֱלֹ֣הֵי⁠כֶ֔ם…אֶתְ⁠כֶ֔ם	1		Here every occurrence of **you** refers to the Israelites. If your language uses different forms of “you” depending on the number of people addressed, use a plural form here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
EXO	6	7	14ev	figs-synecdoche	מִ⁠תַּ֖חַת סִבְל֥וֹת מִצְרָֽיִם	1		This refers to all the hard work the Egyptians forced upon the Israelites. See what you did in the previous verse at [[rc://en/tn/help/exo/06/07/oqnw]]. Alternate translation: “from the hard work the Egyptians force you to do” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
EXO	6	8	h9ho	figs-youdual	אֶתְ⁠כֶם֙…לָ⁠כֶ֛ם	1		Here, every occurrence of **you** refers to the Israelites. If your language uses different forms of “you” depending on the number of people addressed, use a plural form here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
EXO	6	8	g9ru	translate-symaction	נָשָׂ֨אתִי֙ אֶת־יָדִ֔⁠י	1	I swore	This is an action that signifies making an oath. Raising the hand may not have the same meaning in your culture so you may need to use a different symbolic oath-taking action in your translation, or simply translate the meaning. Alternate translation: “I promised” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
EXO	6	8	i3vj		מוֹרָשָׁ֖ה	1		This means the Israelites will own the land. Alternate translation: “as your own land”
EXO	6	8	ipnm	figs-quotemarks	אֲנִ֥י יְהוָֽה	1		After this phrase, the direct quote of Yahweh ends. Both the first-level and second-level quotes end. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with a closing first-level and second-level quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the end of a quotation and a quotation within a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	6	9	aalj	grammar-connect-logic-result	וְ⁠לֹ֤א שָֽׁמְעוּ֙ אֶל־מֹשֶׁ֔ה מִ⁠קֹּ֣צֶר ר֔וּחַ וּ⁠מֵ⁠עֲבֹדָ֖ה קָשָֽׁה	1		In some languages it will be necessary to put the reason for the people not listening before the result. Alternate translation: “but because of shortness of spirit and because of hard service, they did not listen to Moses” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
EXO	6	9	0jc7		מִ⁠קֹּ֣צֶר ר֔וּחַ	1		Here, the people’s **spirit** is spoken of as something that could be measured. By calling it “short,” the author is saying they did not have very much motivation or hope. Alternate translation: “because they had no hope” 
EXO	6	10	tpw4		לֵּ⁠אמֹֽר	1		This is used to mark the beginning of a direct quotation. It can be omitted if it is unnatural.
EXO	6	11	pi7a	figs-quotemarks	בֹּ֣א דַבֵּ֔ר אֶל־פַּרְעֹ֖ה מֶ֣לֶךְ מִצְרָ֑יִם וִֽ⁠ישַׁלַּ֥ח אֶת־בְּנֵֽי־יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל מֵ⁠אַרְצֽ⁠וֹ	1		This is a direct quotation. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by marking it with first-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	6	11	fxf2	figs-quotations	וִֽ⁠ישַׁלַּ֥ח אֶת־בְּנֵֽי־יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל מֵ⁠אַרְצֽ⁠וֹ	1		This is an indirect quote; in some languages you will have to make it a direct quote. Be careful to change the third-person pronouns to second-person pronouns if you do this. Alternate translation: “saying, ‘You must let the sons of Israel go from your land’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
EXO	6	12	rsag	figs-quotemarks	הֵ֤ן בְּנֵֽי־יִשְׂרָאֵל֙ לֹֽא־שָׁמְע֣וּ אֵלַ֔⁠י וְ⁠אֵיךְ֙ יִשְׁמָעֵ֣⁠נִי פַרְעֹ֔ה וַ⁠אֲנִ֖י עֲרַ֥ל שְׂפָתָֽיִם	1		This is a direct quotation. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by marking it with first-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	6	12	h7o0	figs-metonymy	לִ⁠פְנֵ֥י יְהוָ֖ה	1		Here, **face** figuratively represents the presence of a person. There may also be a hint of impudence in Moses’ attitude that is conveyed by saying he **before the face of Yahweh** Alternate translation: “in the presence of Yahweh” or “boldly to Yahweh” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EXO	6	12	iiui		הֵ֤ן	1		**Behold** is a term meant to focus the attention of the listener on what the speaker is about to say. If there is not a good way to translate this term in your language, this term can be omitted from the translation, or you can use an alternate translation like “as you know.”
EXO	6	12	k7hl	figs-rquestion	הֵ֤ן בְּנֵֽי־יִשְׂרָאֵל֙ לֹֽא־שָׁמְע֣וּ אֵלַ֔⁠י וְ⁠אֵיךְ֙ יִשְׁמָעֵ֣⁠נִי פַרְעֹ֔ה	1	If the Israelites have not listened to me, why will Pharaoh listen to me, since I am not good at speaking?	Moses asked this question hoping God would change His mind about using Moses. This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: “Since the Israelites did not listen to me, neither will Pharaoh!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
EXO	6	12	4iul	figs-rquestion	הֵ֤ן בְּנֵֽי־יִשְׂרָאֵל֙ לֹֽא־שָׁמְע֣וּ אֵלַ֔⁠י וְ⁠אֵיךְ֙ יִשְׁמָעֵ֣⁠נִי פַרְעֹ֔ה	1		Moses is presenting a reasoned argument: since this, then probably that. Use a natural way of expressing such arguments in your language. Alternate translation: “Since the sons of Israel have not listened to me, why would you think Pharaoh would listen to me?” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
EXO	6	12	k3br	figs-metaphor	וַ⁠אֲנִ֖י עֲרַ֥ל שְׂפָתָֽיִם	1		This is a metaphor that means that Moses was not a good speaker. It is somewhat crude; your translation of this phrase could convey that Moses spoke impolitely. Alternate translation: “And I do not speak well” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EXO	6	13	9o6g		וַ⁠יְצַוֵּ⁠ם֙ אֶל־בְּנֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל וְ⁠אֶל־פַּרְעֹ֖ה	1		This phrase is somewhat difficult to translate. Here, **command** could also be translated as “charge” or “commission.” Another difficulty is knowing to whom the command is directed: is it to Moses and Aaron or are they to give the command to Pharaoh and the Israelites, thus **to** could be translated as “for” or “regarding” Alternate translations: “and he charged them regarding the sons of Israel and regarding Pharaoh” or “and he gave them a command for the sons of Israel and for Pharaoh” or “and he gave them a commission to the sons of Israel and to Pharaoh”
EXO	6	14	hh3z	writing-background	אֵ֖לֶּה	1		Verses 14-27 are background information. If your language marks background information with particular discourse features, use them here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
EXO	6	14	h195	figs-metonymy	רָאשֵׁ֣י	1	the heads of their fathers’ houses	Here, “heads” refers to the original ancestors of the clan. Alternate translation: “the ancestors of ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by marking it with first-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation of a previous remark. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])

EXO	6	28	xssl	writing-newevent	וַ⁠יְהִ֗י בְּ⁠י֨וֹם	1		This marks a transition from the record of the genealogy back to the narrative. Consider placing a section break at the start of this verse. Alternate translation: “One day” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
EXO	6	29	7s2n	figs-quotemarks	לֵּ⁠אמֹ֖ר	1		Here, **saying** is used to mark the beginning of a direct quotation. It can be omitted if unnatural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])

It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by marking it with first-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	6	30	zyqs	figs-metonymy	לִ⁠פְנֵ֣י יְהוָ֑ה	1		Here, **face** figuratively represents the presence of a person. There may also be a hint of impudence in Moses’ attitude that is conveyed by saying he spoke before **the face of Yahweh**. See how you translated this in [6:12](../06/12.md) Alternate translation: “in the presence of Yahweh” or “boldly to Yahweh” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EXO	6	30	nf3w	figs-rquestion	הֵ֤ן אֲנִי֙ עֲרַ֣ל שְׂפָתַ֔יִם וְ⁠אֵ֕יךְ יִשְׁמַ֥ע אֵלַ֖⁠י פַּרְעֹֽה	1	I am not good…why will Pharaoh listen to me?	Moses asks this question hoping to change God’s mind about sending him. This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: “Behold, I am not a good speaker. Pharaoh will certainly not listen to me!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
EXO	6	30	qvxf	figs-quotemarks	הֵ֤ן אֲנִי֙ עֲרַ֣ל שְׂפָתַ֔יִם וְ⁠אֵ֕יךְ יִשְׁמַ֥ע אֵלַ֖⁠י פַּרְעֹֽה	1		This is a direct quotation. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by marking it with first-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	6	30	y4g2		הֵ֤ן	1		**Behold** is a term meant to focus the attention of the listener on what the speaker is about to say. If there is not a good way to translate this term in your language, this term can be omitted from the translation, or you can use an alternate translation like “as you know.”
EXO	6	30	18l8	figs-metaphor	אֲנִי֙ עֲרַ֣ל שְׂפָתַ֔יִם	1		This is a metaphor that means that Moses thought he was not a good speaker. It is somewhat crude, and your translation of this phrase could convey that Moses spoke impolitely. See how you translated this in [6:12](../06/12.md) Alternate translation: “And I always fail to speak well” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EXO	7	intro	r9we			0		# Exodus 07 General Notes<br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Miracles<br>When Yahweh had Moses perform miracles, Pharaoh’s men were able to copy these miracles. It is unknown how they were able to do this, but since it was not from Yahweh, they were probably done under some evil power. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/miracle]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/evil]])<br><br>### Pharaoh’s hard heart<br>Pharaoh’s heart is often described as hard, strong, or heavy in this chapter. This means that his heart was not open or willing to understand Yahweh’s instructions. <br><br>### “Let my people go”<br>This is a very important statement. Moses is not asking Pharaoh to “let go” of the Hebrew people. Instead, he is demanding that Pharaoh free the Hebrew people.<br><br>## Possible translation difficulties in this chapter include:<br>- Moses as God to Pharaoh<br>- A number of difficult terms: prophet, signs, wonders, miracles, sorcerers, magicians, magic, judgements, canals, reservoirs<br>- The use of “heart” to refer to the seat of will and emotion<br>- Up to third-level quotations<br><br>
EXO	7	1	4vak	figs-quotemarks	מֹשֶׁ֔ה 	1		After this phrase, a direct quote begins which continues to the end of [verse 5](../07/05.md). It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with an opening first-level quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the beginning of a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	7	1	gy1t		רְאֵ֛ה	1		This is used to draw attention to surprising information that follows. Alternative translation: “Listen carefully”
EXO	7	1	dn1s	figs-metaphor	נְתַתִּ֥י⁠ךָ אֱלֹהִ֖ים לְ⁠פַרְעֹ֑ה	1	I have made you like a god	This means Moses would represent the same authority to Pharaoh as God did to Moses. See how you translated the very similar phrase in [Exodus 4:16](../04/16.md), see [this note]([[rc://en/tn/help/exo/04/16/gn5v]]). Alternate translation: “I will cause Pharaoh to consider you as a god” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EXO	7	1	z163	figs-metaphor	וְ⁠אַהֲרֹ֥ן אָחִ֖י⁠ךָ יִהְיֶ֥ה נְבִיאֶֽ⁠ךָ	1		This phrase compares Aaron to a prophet because he will be the one actually to proclaim to Pharaoh what Moses tells him. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Exodus 4:16](../04/16.md), see [this note]([[rc://en/tn/help/exo/04/16/mnsp]]). Alternate translation: “and Aaron your brother will act like your prophet” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EXO	7	2	l44v	figs-kinship	אָחִ֨י⁠ךָ֙	1		Aaron is older than Moses. Some languages will use a different term for the sibling relationship based on gender and age order. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-kinship]])
EXO	7	2	hdwo	figs-quotations	וְ⁠שִׁלַּ֥ח אֶת־בְּנֵֽי־יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל מֵ⁠אַרְצֽ⁠וֹ	1		Some languages may need to make this a direct quote. If so, be sure to mark it as a second-level quotation, subordinate to Yahweh’s main speech. Alternative translation: “saying, ‘You must let the sons of Israel go from your land’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
EXO	7	2	204o		מֵ⁠אַרְצֽ⁠וֹ	1		“Egypt”
EXO	7	3	adsq	figs-metaphor	אַקְשֶׁ֖ה אֶת־לֵ֣ב פַּרְעֹ֑ה	1		This means God will make him stubborn. His stubborn attitude is spoken of as if his heart were hard. If the heart is not the body part your culture uses to refer to a person’s will, consider using whichever organ your culture would use for this image. See how you translated this in [Exodus 4:21](../04/21.md), but note the slightly different metaphor there: the heart being strong vs. hard. Alternate translation: “will cause Pharaoh to be stubborn” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EXO	7	3	vtt1	figs-doublet	אֶת־אֹתֹתַ֛⁠י וְ⁠אֶת־מוֹפְתַ֖⁠י	1	many signs…many wonders	The words **signs** and **wonders** mean basically the same thing. God uses them to emphasize the greatness of what he will do in Egypt. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
EXO	7	4	ar0l	figs-youdual	אֲלֵ⁠כֶם֙	1		Here, **you** means Moses and Aaron. If your language uses different forms of “you” depending on the number of people addressed, use a dual form (if you have one) or plural form (if not) here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
EXO	7	4	e2kv	figs-metonymy	יָדִ֖⁠י	1	put my hand on	The words **my hand** represent God’s great power. Alternate translation: “my power” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EXO	7	4	0r0r	figs-metonymy	בְּ⁠מִצְרָ֑יִם	1		**On Egypt** refers to the land and everything in it, including people, animals, and plants. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EXO	7	4	nilu		אֶת־צִבְאֹתַ֜⁠י אֶת־עַמִּ֤⁠י בְנֵֽי־יִשְׂרָאֵל֙	1		These phrases refer to the Israelites in three different ways; they do not refer to three different groups of people. **Armies** is the same word translated “hosts” in [Exodus 6:26](../06/26.md). Alternate translation: “the armies of my Israelite people”
EXO	7	5	cg3n	grammar-connect-logic-result	וְ⁠יָדְע֤וּ מִצְרַ֨יִם֙ כִּֽי־אֲנִ֣י יְהוָ֔ה	1		This is the result of God rescuing the Israelites. In some languages the result will have to be placed after the cause, as in the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
EXO	7	5	npd6	figs-metonymy	בִּ⁠נְטֹתִ֥⁠י אֶת־יָדִ֖⁠י עַל	1	reach out with my hand on	This phrase represents God’s great power. Alternate translation: “when I show my powerful acts against” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EXO	7	5	dguc	grammar-connect-logic-goal	וְ⁠הוֹצֵאתִ֥י אֶת־בְּנֵֽי־יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל מִ⁠תּוֹכָֽ⁠ם	1		The goal of God’s powerful acts was to rescue the Israelites. Alternate translation: “so that I bring the sons of Israel out from their midst” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
EXO	7	5	8576	figs-quotemarks	מִ⁠תּוֹכָֽ⁠ם	1		At the end of this verse, the direct quote that began in [verse 1](../07/01.md) ends. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with a closing first-level quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the end of a quotation. Note that the UST is reordered. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	7	6	iii5	figs-parallelism	וַ⁠יַּ֥עַשׂ…עָשֽׂוּ	1		This repetition emphasizes the statement. Some languages can use repetition for emphasis; others will need to use another way of expressing emphasis.  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
EXO	7	7	liir	writing-background	וּ⁠מֹשֶׁה֙ בֶּן־שְׁמֹנִ֣ים שָׁנָ֔ה וְ⁠אַֽהֲרֹ֔ן בֶּן־שָׁלֹ֥שׁ וּ⁠שְׁמֹנִ֖ים שָׁנָ֑ה בְּ⁠דַבְּרָ֖⁠ם אֶל־פַּרְעֹֽה	1		This verse contains background information. If your language marks background information with particular discourse features, use them here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
EXO	7	7	g7i5	translate-numbers	שְׁמֹנִ֣ים…שָׁלֹ֥שׁ וּ⁠שְׁמֹנִ֖ים	1	Aaron eighty-three years old	“eighty … eighty-three” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])

EXO	7	8	pwph	writing-newevent	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר יְהוָ֔ה	1		This verse marks the beginning of new sections, both major and minor. The major story of the plagues and Exodus itself unfolds from here until after Pharaoh’s army is defeated at the Red Sea.  The next minor event is the miracle of the rods becoming snakes. Either by using particular forms that your language uses to mark transitions or by making a section break and heading, this transition should be marked for readers.  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
EXO	7	8	p2kf		לֵ⁠אמֹֽר	1		Here, **saying** marks the beginning of a direct quote and is often omitted in translation when such a construction is unnatural in the target language. See UST. 
EXO	7	9	b0jl	figs-quotemarks	כִּי֩ יְדַבֵּ֨ר אֲלֵ⁠כֶ֤ם פַּרְעֹה֙ לֵ⁠אמֹ֔ר תְּנ֥וּ לָ⁠כֶ֖ם מוֹפֵ֑ת וְ⁠אָמַרְתָּ֣ אֶֽל־אַהֲרֹ֗ן קַ֧ח אֶֽת־מַטְּ⁠ךָ֛ וְ⁠הַשְׁלֵ֥ךְ לִ⁠פְנֵֽי־פַרְעֹ֖ה יְהִ֥י לְ⁠תַנִּֽין	1		This is a direct quotation.

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	7	9	jt9z	figs-quotations	כִּי֩ יְדַבֵּ֨ר אֲלֵ⁠כֶ֤ם פַּרְעֹה֙ לֵ⁠אמֹ֔ר תְּנ֥וּ לָ⁠כֶ֖ם מוֹפֵ֑ת וְ⁠אָמַרְתָּ֣ אֶֽל־אַהֲרֹ֗ן קַ֧ח אֶֽת־מַטְּ⁠ךָ֛ וְ⁠הַשְׁלֵ֥ךְ לִ⁠פְנֵֽי־פַרְעֹ֖ה יְהִ֥י לְ⁠תַנִּֽין	1	When Pharaoh says to you, ‘Do a miracle,’ then you will say to Aaron, ‘Take your staff and throw it down before Pharaoh, so that it may become a snake.’	The two quotations in this verse could be stated as indirect quotes. Alternate translation: “When Pharaoh tells you to do a miracle, then you will tell Aaron to take his staff and throw it down before Pharaoh so that it may become a snake” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
EXO	7	9	ye9j	figs-quotemarks	תְּנ֥וּ לָ⁠כֶ֖ם מוֹפֵ֑ת	1		This is a second-level direct quotation. If you did not decide to make it an indirect quotation, it may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by marking it with second-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation within a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	7	9	r0tp	figs-quotemarks	קַ֧ח אֶֽת־מַטְּ⁠ךָ֛ וְ⁠הַשְׁלֵ֥ךְ לִ⁠פְנֵֽי־פַרְעֹ֖ה יְהִ֥י לְ⁠תַנִּֽין	1		This is a second-level direct quotation. The second level may end after **Pharaoh.** If you did not decide to make it an indirect quotation, it may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by marking it with second-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation within a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	7	9	p3xh		לֵ⁠אמֹ֔ר	1		Here, **saying** marks the beginning of a direct quote and is often omitted in translation when such a construction is unnatural in the target language. See UST. 
EXO	7	9	ms5o	figs-youdual	אֲלֵ⁠כֶ֤ם…לָ⁠כֶ֖ם	1		These are plural, referring to Moses and Aaron. If your language uses different forms of “you” depending on the number of people addressed, use a dual form (if you have one) or plural form (if not) here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
EXO	7	9	6hfg	figs-quotesinquotes	תְּנ֥וּ לָ⁠כֶ֖ם מוֹפֵ֑ת	1		This is a second-level quotation. It should be marked in some manner that distinguishes it from the outer level. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
EXO	7	9	s5a9		קַ֧ח אֶֽת־מַטְּ⁠ךָ֛ וְ⁠הַשְׁלֵ֥ךְ לִ⁠פְנֵֽי־פַרְעֹ֖ה יְהִ֥י לְ⁠תַנִּֽין	1		This is a second-level quotation. It should be marked in some manner that distinguishes it from the outer level. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
EXO	7	9	ogk9	figs-metonymy	לִ⁠פְנֵֽי־פַרְעֹ֖ה	1		Although **before the face of**  still has the standard figurative meaning of “in the presence of,” it is a much more literal use here. Moses and Aaron are to actually do the miracles in front of Pharaoh so that Pharaoh can see them. Alternative translation: “so Pharaoh can see it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EXO	7	10	4q7r	figs-metonymy	לִ⁠פְנֵ֥י פַרְעֹ֛ה וְ⁠לִ⁠פְנֵ֥י עֲבָדָ֖י⁠ו	1		This time, while **before the face of**  still has the standard figurative meaning of “in the presence of,” it is a much more literal use here. Aaron actually does this right in front of Pharaoh and his servants so they could watch what happens. Alternative translation: “where Pharaoh and his servants could see it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EXO	7	10	3dkq		עֲבָדָ֖י⁠ו	1		**His servants** probably refers to important advisors that would be in the king’s court, and does not refer common servants.
EXO	7	11	mqde		לַֽ⁠חֲכָמִ֖ים וְ⁠לַֽ⁠מְכַשְּׁפִ֑ים…חַרְטֻמֵּ֥י	1		Here, **magicians** probably describes both **wise men and sorcerers** rather than being a third group. See translationWords articles for each term.
EXO	7	12	u6np		וַ⁠יִּבְלַ֥ע	1	swallowed up	“ate up” or “devoured”
EXO	7	12	m0kw	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	וַ⁠יִּבְלַ֥ע מַטֵּֽה־אַהֲרֹ֖ן אֶת־מַטֹּתָֽ⁠ם	1		This is a surprising and amusing twist which was not what the magicians expected. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
EXO	7	12	prnp	figs-personification	מַטֵּֽה…מַטֹּתָֽ⁠ם	1		It may be necessary in some languages to translate the word **staff** as “snake” since it had turned into one. This may be true if it would not make sense in the target language to say that a staff swallowed or ate something (because it is not living). It may also be not make sense in some languages to speak of the snakes as staffs once transformed. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
EXO	7	13	g42f	figs-metaphor	וַ⁠יֶּחֱזַק֙ לֵ֣ב פַּרְעֹ֔ה	1	Pharaoh’s heart was hardened	Pharaoh’s stubborn attitude is spoken of as if his heart were **strong**. If the heart is not the body part your culture uses to refer to a person’s will, consider using whichever organ your culture would use for this image. See how you translated this in [Exodus 4:21](../04/21.md), but note that this is a neutral statement (it does not say that anyone caused him to be stubborn, as many others in this part of the narrative do). Alternate translation: “Pharaoh was still defiant” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EXO	7	13	2fve		כַּ⁠אֲשֶׁ֖ר דִּבֶּ֥ר יְהוָֽה	1		Because Yahweh’s prediction precedes this event, some languages may need to place the reference to that prediction before the statement that it was fulfilled. See UST.
EXO	7	14	d27r	figs-metaphor	כָּבֵ֖ד לֵ֣ב פַּרְעֹ֑ה	1	Pharaoh’s heart is hard	Yahweh speaks of Pharaoh’s stubborn attitude as if Pharaoh’s heart were heavy. If the heart is not the body part your culture uses to refer to a person’s will, consider using whichever organ your culture would use for this image. This is a neutral statement (it does not say that anyone caused him to be stubborn as many others in this part of the narrative do). See how you translated this in [Exodus 7:13](../07/13.md), but note the slightly different metaphor there: the heart being heavy vs strong. Alternate translation: “Pharaoh is defiant” (See:  [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EXO	7	14	qiyx	writing-newevent	וַ⁠יֹּ֤אמֶר	1		A new scene begins here, which may need to be marked in a certain way in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
EXO	7	14	t79b	figs-quotemarks	מֹשֶׁ֔ה 	1		After this phrase, a direct quote begins which continues to the end of [verse 18](../07/18.md). It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with an opening first-level quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the beginning of a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	7	15	ecby		הִנֵּה֙	1		This is used to draw attention to information that follows. 
EXO	7	15	c5np		יֹצֵ֣א הַ⁠מַּ֔יְמָ⁠ה	1	when he goes out to the water	There are various theories as to what Pharaoh went down to the Nile to do, but there is no need to speculate or specify in the translation.
EXO	7	16	yqp7		וְ⁠אָמַרְתָּ֣ אֵלָ֗י⁠ו	1	Say to him	“Say to Pharaoh”
EXO	7	16	i4yt	figs-quotemarks	יְהוָ֞ה	1		This begins a second-level quotation that continues until the end of [verse 18](../07/18.md).  It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by marking it with second-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation within a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	7	16	uvxe	figs-possession	אֱלֹהֵ֤י הָ⁠עִבְרִים֙	1		Yahweh claimed the Hebrews (Israelites) as his own. They worshiped him. This is a possessive of social relationship. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])

It should be marked in some manner that distinguishes it from the outer levels. Alternatively, you could translate it as an indirect quotation as in the UST. If you do this, take care to adjust the pronoun person (second/third) as appropriate. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
EXO	7	16	cwox		וְ⁠הִנֵּ֥ה	1		**Behold** is used to draw attention to the information that follows. In some languages, it will not be translated.
EXO	7	17	j1ev		כֹּ֚ה אָמַ֣ר יְהוָ֔ה	1	strike the water	This quote form is used to introduce commands from Yahweh. See [4:intro](../04/intro.md) for more information.
EXO	7	17	mywj	figs-quotesinquotes	בְּ⁠זֹ֣את	1		This begins a third-level quotation that continues until the end of verse 18. It should be marked in some manner that distinguishes it from the outer levels. It is possible that the third-level quote actually ends before **Behold,** in which case, in the rest of the quote **I** refers to Moses, not Yahweh. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
EXO	7	17	jjm3		הִנֵּ֨ה	1		**Behold** is a term meant to focus the attention of the listener on what the speaker is about to say. Alternate translation: “Look at this”
EXO	7	18	bsjn	grammar-connect-logic-result	וּ⁠בָאַ֣שׁ הַ⁠יְאֹ֑ר	1		**The river will stink** will happen because the fish die. Alternate translation: “and because of that the river will stink” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])

EXO	7	18	350i	figs-rpronouns	וְ⁠נִלְא֣וּ מִצְרַ֔יִם	1		Here, **themselves** refers back to the subject (**the Egyptians**) to indicated that the Egyptians are the object of the verb as well. Different languages have different methods of marking this. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns]])
EXO	7	18	grwh	figs-quotemarks	מִן־הַ⁠יְאֹֽר	1		After this phrase, the direct quote of Yahweh’s commands ends. Depending on your decisions about the embedded quotation levels, you may have up to three levels of quotations that need to be closed here. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with closing quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the end of a quotation and quotations within quotations. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])

You should translate the list in such a way that the locations of the blood are not limited to these specific places, but to imply universality. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])

EXO	7	22	qdc7	figs-metaphor	וַ⁠יֶּחֱזַ֤ק לֵב־פַּרְעֹה֙	1	Pharaoh’s heart was hardened	Pharaoh’s stubborn attitude is spoken of as if his heart were strong. If the heart is not the body part your culture uses to refer to a person’s will, consider using whichever organ your culture would use for this image. This is a neutral statement (it does not say that anyone caused him to be stubborn as many others in this part of the narrative do). See how you translated this in [Exodus 7:13](../07/13.md). Alternate translation: “Pharaoh was still defiant” (See:  [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EXO	7	22	sbic		כַּ⁠אֲשֶׁ֖ר דִּבֶּ֥ר יְהוָֽה	1		Because Yahweh’s prediction precedes this event, some languages may need to place the reference to that prediction before the statement that it was fulfilled. See UST and how you handled this in [7:13](../07/13.md) where the same sentence appears.
EXO	7	23	atdk	figs-idiom	וְ⁠לֹא־שָׁ֥ת לִבּ֖⁠וֹ גַּם־לָ⁠זֹֽאת	1		This is an idiom meaning Pharaoh did not think about the meaning of the miracle he had just seen. Alternate translation: “And he did not consider what even this meant” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EXO	7	24	m6zn	figs-hyperbole	כָל־מִצְרַ֛יִם	1	All the Egyptians	The word **all** here is a generalization that means “many.” At the least, the upper class would have sent their slaves to dig for them. Alternate translation: “Many of the Egyptians” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

EXO	8	intro	ww1y			0		# Exodus 08 General Notes<br>## Possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>- the exact insects in plagues 3-4 are not certain, translation teams will need to decide what insects they can use for each<br>- Pharaoh makes his own heart heavy, that is, he determines to be proud and resist Yahweh twice in this chapter<br>- the Israelites’ sacrifices are spoken of as an abomination to the Egyptians but it is not specified how or why that is<br><br><br>### Lifting up the hand and staff: <br>In the next few chapters God will instruct Moses and/or Aaron to raise his hand and/or staff. The narrative will then record that whoever will raise his hand and/or staff. The instruction and the action do not always match exactly. God may say raise your hand and the narrative may say Moses raised his staff. These are not conflicting reports. Translators should understand that the hand and the staff are always understood together. They are one unit and they can both be mentioned or they can be mentioned separately. In each case, Moses or Aaron raises his hand with the staff in it. This fact is merely expressed differently.<br><br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Pharaoh’s hard heart<br>Pharaoh’s heart is often described as hard in this chapter. This means that his heart was not open or willing to understand Yahweh’s instructions. When his heart was hardened, it became less and less receptive to Yahweh.<br><br>### Let my people go<br><br>This is a very important statement. Moses does not ask Pharaoh for permission to “let go” of the Hebrew people. Instead, he is demanding that Pharaoh free the Hebrew people.

You should translate the list in such a way that the frogs’ location is not limited to these specific places. The list should imply universality. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
EXO	8	4	okok	figs-quotemarks		1		Up to three levels of quotes end at the end of this verse. Depending on how many levels you chose to mark as direct quotations, you should indicate them ending here with closing second-level (and third-level) quotation mark(s) or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the end of quotations and quotations within a quotation.

It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with second-level opening and closing quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation inside a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])

You should translate the list in such a way that the locations are not limited to these specific places. The list should imply universality. This is made clear in [8:6](../08/06.md).(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
EXO	8	6	wf3a	figs-explicit	וַ⁠יֵּ֤ט אַהֲרֹן֙	1		It is implied that Moses told Yahweh’s instructions to Aaron. You may choose to make this explicit as in the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

He likely stretched his hand over some nearby portion of the Nile symbolizing all the water of Egypt. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
EXO	8	6	drmg	figs-explicit	וַ⁠תַּ֨עַל֙	1		[Verse 3](../08/03.md) has specified from where the frogs will come. Here it is implied, but you may make it explicit as in the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EXO	8	6	rxze	figs-collectivenouns	הַ⁠צְּפַרְדֵּ֔עַ	1		There were so many frogs that the text uses the collective singular. If that does not make sense in your language, you may simply use the plural as in the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-collectivenouns]])
EXO	8	6	j83d	figs-metaphor	וַ⁠תַּ֨עַל֙ הַ⁠צְּפַרְדֵּ֔עַ וַ⁠תְּכַ֖ס אֶת־אֶ֥רֶץ מִצְרָֽיִם	1		This means that there were frogs everywhere in Egypt.

Note that this will make it a second-level quotation and you will need to mark it with second-level quotation markings if your language uses them. Alternate translation: “to Yahweh saying, ‘Please take away the frogs from Pharaoh and from his people.’ ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])

This makes clear that Moses will ask for a complete end of the plague. You should translate the list in such a way that it does not convey limitation to these specifics, but is understood to imply universality. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
EXO	8	10	g5e7	figs-quotemarks	לְ⁠מָחָ֑ר	1		This is a direct quotation.

EXO	8	10	8120	figs-exclusive	אֱלֹהֵֽי⁠נוּ	1		Here, **our** refers to the Israelites’ God, excluding Pharaoh and the Egyptians. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

This shows that the end of the plague will be as complete as its extent. You should translate the list in such a way that it does not convey limitation to these specifics, but is understood to imply universality. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
EXO	8	11	ttyr	figs-quotemarks	רַ֥ק בַּ⁠יְאֹ֖ר תִּשָּׁאַֽרְנָה	1		After this phrase, the direct quote of Moses that started in the previous verse ends.

You should translate the list in such a way that it does not convey limitation to these specifics, but is understood to imply universality. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
EXO	8	14	a03n		חֳמָרִ֣ם חֳמָרִ֑ם	1		Literally, “piles piles.” Repetition is used in Hebrew to emphasize how many or how big they were.
EXO	8	15	lv2n	figs-metaphor	וְ⁠הַכְבֵּד֙ אֶת־לִבּ֔⁠וֹ	1	he hardened his heart	Pharaoh’s stubborn attitude is spoken of as if he made his own heart heavy. If the heart is not the body part your culture uses to refer to a person’s will, consider using whichever organ your culture would use for this image. See how you translated this in [Exodus 7:14](../07/14.md), but note, there, that the state of Pharaoh’s heart is reported, whereas here, Pharaoh makes his own heart heavy. Alternate translation: “and Pharaoh determined to be defiant” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by marking it with first-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. However, it may be helpful to translate one of the parts as an indirect quotation so that you do not have to have two levels of quotations here. Alternate translation: see UST or “[And Yahweh told Moses] to tell Aaron” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])

It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by marking it with second-level (or first-level) quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation (within a quotation). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	8	16	joxz		נְטֵ֣ה אֶֽת־מַטְּ⁠ךָ֔ וְ⁠הַ֖ךְ	1		This is one action or motion but it is described with the two verbs that occur throughout this section of plague judgement.

EXO	8	19	z1w2	figs-metaphor	וַ⁠יֶּחֱזַ֤ק לֵב־פַּרְעֹה֙	1	Pharaoh’s heart was hardened	Pharaoh’s stubborn attitude is spoken of as if his heart was strong. If the heart is not the body part your culture uses to refer to a person’s will, consider using whichever organ your culture would use for this image. See how you translated this in [Exodus 7:13](../07/13.md). This is a neutral statement (it does not say that anyone caused him to be stubborn as many others in this part of the narrative do). Alternate translation: “Pharaoh was still defiant” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

The same term is used in Genesis 43:32 and 46:34 to describe the Egyptians’ feelings about eating with Hebrews and about the Hebrew profession of shepherding, respectively.

EXO	9	27	sh1x		חָטָ֣אתִי 	1		Some commentators suggest translating this term more literally, that is “to miss the mark,” because Pharaoh is probably not admitting a moral failure. He is admitting that he misjudged.
EXO	9	27	joxy		הַ⁠צַּדִּ֔יק…הָ⁠רְשָׁעִֽים	1		Many commentators suggest that Pharaoh is using these terms in a narrow, legal sense and only referring to this instance. That is, he is saying something like “I’ve lost this round in court.” See UST.

EXO	9	35	yxt8	figs-metaphor	וַֽ⁠יֶּחֱזַק֙ לֵ֣ב פַּרְעֹ֔ה	1	The heart of Pharaoh was hardened	Pharaoh’s stubborn attitude is spoken of as if his heart was strong. If the heart is not the body part your culture uses to refer to a person’s will, consider using whichever organ your culture would use for this image. See how you translated this in [Exodus 7:13](../07/13.md). This is a neutral statement (it does not say that anyone caused him to be stubborn as many others in this part of the narrative do). Alternate translation: “Pharaoh was still defiant” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EXO	9	35	6cbh	figs-metaphor	כַּ⁠אֲשֶׁ֛ר דִּבֶּ֥ר יְהוָ֖ה בְּ⁠יַד־מֹשֶֽׁה	1		This is similar to [9:12](../09/12.md). In this case, what Yahweh said is figuratively spoken of as if it was something that could be held in someone’s hand. This means that Moses delivered a message from Yahweh that Pharaoh would be stubborn. It is not clear if this message was given to the Israelites or if this refers to Moses’ statement to Pharaoh in [9:30](../09/30.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EXO	10	intro	s5g1			0		# Exodus 10 General Notes<br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Pharaoh’s hard heart<br><br>Pharaoh’s heart is often described as hard in this chapter. This means that his heart was not open or willing to understand Yahweh’s instructions. When his heart was hardened, it became less and less receptive to Yahweh.<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Let my people go<br><br>This is a very important statement. Moses does not ask Pharaoh for permission to “let go” of the Hebrew people. Instead, he is demanding that Pharaoh free the Hebrew people.

Their stubborn attitude is spoken of as if their hearts were heavy. If the heart is not the body part your culture uses to refer to a person’s will, consider using whichever organ your culture would use for this image. See how you translated this in [4:21](../04/21.md), but note that the metaphor is slightly different here. Alternate translation: “for I have caused Pharaoh and his servants to be stubborn” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EXO	10	2	zg4c		הִתְעַלַּ֨לְתִּי֙ בְּ⁠מִצְרַ֔יִם 	1	various signs	“I mocked Egypt”
EXO	10	3	2614		וַ⁠יֹּאמְר֣וּ אֵלָ֗י⁠ו	1		After this phrase a direct quote begins which continues until near the end of [10:6](../10/06.md). It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with an opening first-level quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the beginning of a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	10	3	4b3a		וַ⁠יֹּאמְר֣וּ אֵלָ֗י⁠ו כֹּֽה־אָמַ֤ר יְהוָה֙ אֱלֹהֵ֣י הָֽ⁠עִבְרִ֔ים	1		It may be helpful to turn the introductory quotation into an indirect quotation so you do not have to use quotes within quotes. Alternate translation: “and told him that Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews, said thus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
EXO	10	3	vze4		כֹּֽה־אָמַ֤ר יְהוָה֙	1		This quote form is used to introduce commands from Yahweh. See [4:intro](../04/intro.md) for more information.
EXO	10	3	cicf	figs-metonymy	עַד־מָתַ֣י מֵאַ֔נְתָּ לֵ⁠עָנֹ֖ת מִ⁠פָּנָ֑⁠י	1		Here, **face** figuratively represents the presence of Yahweh. Particularly it means the presence of his judgement (the plagues). Alternate translation: “Until when will you refuse to be humble when I judge you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EXO	10	4	ge67		הִנְ⁠נִ֨י	1	listen	This word adds emphasis to what is said next. Alternate translation: “Pay attention to what I am about to tell you”
EXO	10	4	uwtp	figs-collectivenouns	אַרְבֶּ֖ה	1		**Locust** is a singular noun referring to the group as one. Alternate translation: “locusts” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-collectivenouns]])

They are used to emphasize the great number of locusts that are coming. In some languages this will not have the same rhetorical effect and you will need to use another device to emphasize the statement. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
EXO	10	5	rdav		וְ⁠כִסָּה֙ אֶת־עֵ֣ין הָ⁠אָ֔רֶץ	1		“And it will cover the land from sight”
EXO	10	5	oj3i	figs-collectivenouns	וְ⁠כִסָּה֙…וְ⁠אָכַ֣ל…וְ⁠אָכַל֙ 	1		Here, the pronoun **it** agrees in number with the collective singular “locust” in the previous verse. Insects are often referred to without gender in English, but you will need to use whatever number, gender, and/or noun class is required in your language to agree with the word you used in the [previous verse](../10/04.md) for “locust.” See UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-collectivenouns]])
EXO	10	6	ir5l	figs-hyperbole	עַל־הָ֣⁠אֲדָמָ֔ה	1	nothing ever seen	This could either mean **on the earth** (planet) or “on the land” (Egypt). Either way, it is meant to emphasize an extremely long time, meaning never. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
EXO	10	6	4mno	figs-explicit	וַ⁠יִּ֥פֶן 	1		[Verse 3](../10/03.md) says that Aaron came in to see the king with Moses. It is implied that he left with him as well. You may make this explicit if it would help your readers. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EXO	10	7	xn8j	figs-rquestion	עַד־מָתַי֙ יִהְיֶ֨ה זֶ֥ה לָ֨⁠נוּ֙ לְ⁠מוֹקֵ֔שׁ	1	How long will this man be a menace to us?	Pharaoh’s servants ask this question to show Pharaoh that he is stubbornly causing the destruction of Egypt. This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: “We cannot allow this man to continue to bring trouble to us!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
EXO	10	7	jqbh	figs-gendernotations	הָ֣⁠אֲנָשִׁ֔ים	1		Here, **men** may be literal or it may refer to the Israelites, including the women and children. In [verse 10](../10/10.md) the king rejects the idea of letting the women and children go and in [verse 11](../10/11.md) he specifically says that the men can go. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
EXO	10	7	xdm5	figs-rquestion	הֲ⁠טֶ֣רֶם תֵּדַ֔ע כִּ֥י אָבְדָ֖ה מִצְרָֽיִם	1	Do you not yet realize that Egypt is destroyed?	Pharaoh’s servants ask this question to bring Pharaoh to recognize what he refuses to see. This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: “You should realize that Egypt is destroyed!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
EXO	10	7	c6pr	figs-activepassive	כִּ֥י אָבְדָ֖ה מִצְרָֽיִם	1	that Egypt is destroyed	This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: “that these plagues have destroyed Egypt” or “that their God has destroyed Egypt” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
EXO	10	8	8ukg	figs-activepassive	וַ⁠יּוּשַׁ֞ב אֶת־מֹשֶׁ֤ה וְ⁠אֶֽת־אַהֲרֹן֙ אֶל־פַּרְעֹ֔ה	1		This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: “And a servant brought Moses and Aaron back to Pharaoh” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
EXO	10	8	6733		מִ֥י וָ⁠מִ֖י	1		“Who all”
EXO	10	9	fnnl	figs-exclusive	נֵלֵ֑ךְ…נֵלֵ֔ךְ	1		**We** means the Israelites and does not include Pharaoh or the Egyptians. Use an exclusive form here if your language has this distinction. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

It likely means something like “It will take Yahweh’s power to make me let you and your children go,” or “May Yahweh be as favorable to you as I am to the idea of letting your children go.” Pharaoh is saying that it will take Yahweh to make him do what Moses wants, but he does not think that will happen. Alternate translation: “It will be clear that Yahweh is with you if I let you and your children go”
EXO	10	10	w8x4		רְא֕וּ כִּ֥י רָעָ֖ה נֶ֥גֶד פְּנֵי⁠כֶֽם	1		The phrase **for evil is before you faces** could either be a warning from Pharaoh that Moses’ actions will lead to evil for the Israelites or it could mean that Pharaoh thinks the Israelites plan something that he considers evil. **Faces** is a metonym for the whole person. Alternate translations: “I see that you plan evil” or “Be careful, your actions will have bad consequences” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EXO	10	11	pkm4		הַ⁠גְּבָרִים֙	1	Then Moses and Aaron were driven out from Pharaoh’s presence	This interjection clarifies who may go. Alternate translation: “the leaders”
EXO	10	11	vdjk	figs-metonymy	מֵ⁠אֵ֖ת פְּנֵ֥י פַרְעֹֽה	1		Here, **face** figuratively represents the presence of Pharaoh. Alternate translation: “from his presence” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

EXO	10	16	ty9f	figs-youdual	אֱלֹֽהֵי⁠כֶ֖ם וְ⁠לָ⁠כֶֽם	1		Here, **you** and **your** are plural. These could refer either to Moses and Aaron or to all the Israelites. If your language uses different forms of “you” depending on the number of people addressed, use a plural form here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
EXO	10	17	953e		שָׂ֣א 	1		“take away”
EXO	10	17	ttog		אַ֣ךְ הַ⁠פַּ֔עַם…רַ֖ק 	1		Pharaoh could either be desperate and using **just this once... only** to attempt to make his request as small as possible to increase the chances of it being granted or he could be still too proud to admit guilt beyond this single incident (which is probably his bold statement about Yahweh being with the Israelites in [10:10](../10/10.md)). The former seems more likely given that he terms this plague “this death.” If your culture has a way making a request seem as small as possible, you may want to use it to translate Pharaoh’s request.
EXO	10	17	kd6d	figs-youdual	אֱלֹהֵי⁠כֶ֑ם	1	this time	Here, **your** is plural. This could refer either to Moses and Aaron or to all the Israelites.

EXO	10	17	doeg	figs-metonymy	הַ⁠מָּ֥וֶת הַ⁠זֶּֽה	1		The word **death** here refers to the destruction by the locusts of all plants in Egypt, which would eventually lead to the deaths of people because there were no crops. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EXO	10	17	nn2b	figs-explicit	הַ⁠מָּ֥וֶת הַ⁠זֶּֽה	1	take this death away from me	The word **death** here refers to the destruction by the locusts of all plants in Egypt, which would eventually lead to the deaths of people because there were no crops.

EXO	10	19	q8aj	figs-collectivenouns	וַ⁠יִּתְקָעֵ֖⁠הוּ 	1		Here, the first **it** refers to the wind, the second agrees in number with the collective singular “locust.” See how you translated this in [10:5](../10/05.md) (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-collectivenouns]]
EXO	10	20	dw1d	figs-metaphor	וַ⁠יְחַזֵּ֥ק יְהוָ֖ה אֶת־לֵ֣ב פַּרְעֹ֑ה	1	Yahweh hardened Pharaoh’s heart	This means God made him stubborn. His stubborn attitude is spoken of as if his heart was strong.

EXO	10	21	m38s	figs-metaphor	מִצְרָ֑יִם וְ⁠יָמֵ֖שׁ חֹֽשֶׁךְ	1	darkness that may be felt	This is a somewhat puzzling construction which describes the darkness. Most English translations take it as a passive, which restated actively means, “people will feel the darkness,” meaning metaphorically what is expressed in different ways in the UST and the alternate translation here. Another option is to view the Hebrew verb form as causative and translate as such: “and the darkness will cause people to feel,” meaning people will have to feel where they are going because they will not be able to see. A final option would be a personification of darkness such that the darkness gropes around, filling in every place in the land. Alternate translation: “Egypt—an extremely oppressive darkness” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

EXO	10	23	7ud1	figs-gendernotations	אִ֣ישׁ …אִ֥ישׁ 	1		Here, **man** refers to any human in general. Alternate translation: “person” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])

Based on context Moses is probably not saying that Pharaoh needs to provide his own animals to the Israelites He is asking Pharaoh to let the Israelites take their own animals. **Give in our hands** means to take with them, by whatever means, which may include holding a rope in the hand to lead the animals or any other means of herding the animals.

EXO	11	intro	pu3u			0		# Exodus 11 General Notes<br><br><br>Chapter 11 is a transition point in the book. The previous nine plagues (in their three sequences of three) have come to an end and the last plague, the death of the firstborn, is about to occur along with the Passover and Exodus itself. It is difficult to know if the events in chapter 11 are all recorded in the order in which they happened. For translation, you should follow the text’s order if it will not confuse your readers.<br><br>It may be helpful to think that after the end of chapter 10, Yahweh immediately spoke to Moses, before he actually left Pharaoh’s presence (v. [1](../11/01.md)-[2](../11/02.md)). [Verse 3](../11/03.md) is a comment suggesting that the Egyptians will be willing to do as the Israelites are told to ask them to do in [v. 2](../11/02.md). In verses [4](../11/04.md)-[7](../11/07.md) Moses gives Pharaoh and his officials a message from Yahweh that Yahweh is giving to Moses right at that moment. At the end of [v. 8](../11/08.md) Moses leaves Pharaoh’s presence (completing the interaction from the [end of ch. 10](../10/28.md)). [Verse 9](../11/09.md) may either be Yahweh telling Moses what is going to happen, or it could be part of the summary that occurs in [v. 10](../11/10.md). Verse 10 summarizes what has happened in chs. 5-10 (especially the plagues in chs. 7-10) in preparation for the great last plague.<br><br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Pharaoh’s hard heart<br><br>Pharaoh’s heart is often described as hard in this chapter. This means that his heart was not open or willing to understand Yahweh’s instructions. When his heart was hardened, it became less and less receptive to Yahweh.<br><br>### Let my people go<br><br>In the previous chapters, Moses does not ask Pharaoh for permission to “let go” of the Hebrew people. Instead, he demanded that Pharaoh free the Hebrew people. In this chapter, the same wording is used to refer to Pharaoh “allowing” the Hebrew people to leave Egypt.

EXO	12	29	rvg9			1		The next few verses are the climax of this part of Exodus. A number of literary features mark it out. First, it is specially introduced with **and so it happened,** which is used to mark major breaks in the narrative. Second, repetition: **firstborn** is repeated four times in verse 29 so that the reader cannot possibly miss what is happening. **Night** is repeated in verse 29, 30, and 31.  **Got up/get up** is repeated in verse 30 and 31. In verses 31 and 32 “also” occurs five times (it is translated as “both” once in the ULT). Third, the places of both **Pharaoh** and **the captive** are elaborated on to slow the pace and create a vivid mental image for the reader. In verse 30 there is the listing of sorts of people who got up and the use of the double negative for emphasis. Your translation should attempt to use the same or similar literary features of your own language that slow down the pace, create vivid imagery, and emphasize that this is a climax point.

EXO	13	12	mqgs		וְ⁠הַעֲבַרְתָּ֥	1		This is a deliberate word-play with [Exodus 12:12](../12/12.md) and [Exodus 12:23](../12/23.md) because these memorial sacrifices are to be reminders of what happened at the first Passover. It would be good to make a similar word-play in your translation if possible, but following the meaning as in the UST is fine.

EXO	13	17	5vck		יִנָּחֵ֥ם	1		“turn back”
EXO	13	18	c4tw		וַ⁠חֲמֻשִׁ֛ים	1		The meaning of this term (**by fives**) is uncertain. Many English translations opt for something like “prepared for battle” because this seems to be the meaning in Numbers 32:17 and the related Joshua 1:14 and 4:12. Because of what the previous verse said about war it may mean that they went out in formation—like an army would march—but perhaps not armed. Alternate translation: “And … in formation like an army”

EXO	14	intro	jq4u			0		# Exodus 14 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>This is an important event in the history of Israel, known as the “parting of the sea of reeds (Red Sea).”<br>Throughout this chapter and chapter 15 the word “sea” is used. The context shows that this is the sea of reeds (Red Sea). Since the text does not explicitly say that though, the ULT will only say “sea.” In your translation, it may help people to be more specific than the text if just using “sea” is confusing.<br><br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Pharaoh’s hard heart<br><br>Pharaoh’s heart is often described as hard in this chapter. This means that his heart was not open or willing to understand Yahweh’s instructions. When his heart was hardened, it became less and less receptive to Yahweh.<br><br>### Pharaoh’s chariots<br>These chariots were a fighting force. Pharaoh took an army to kill the Hebrew people. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Rhetorical Questions<br>The Israelites asked a few rhetorical questions of Moses. These questions were not really directed at Moses, but at Yahweh. This showed their lack of faith in Yahweh. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]])

Furthermore, most translations render **horses of the chariots** as “horses and chariots,” suggesting four total groups (possibly because of [v. 23](../14/23.md)).
