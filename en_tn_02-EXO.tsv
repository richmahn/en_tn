The first half of Exodus is about how Yahweh made Abraham’s descendants into a nation. This nation, which would be called “Israel,” was meant to belong to Yahweh and worship him. The second half of Exodus describes how God gave the Israelites his law through Moses. The law of Moses told the Israelites how to obey and worship Yahweh properly.<br><br>The book of Exodus tells how the Israelites were to build the tabernacle. The tabernacle was a tent where Yahweh would be among his people. The Israelites worshiped and sacrificed animals to Yahweh at the tabernacle. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/tabernacle]])<br><br>### How should the title of this book be translated?<br><br>“Exodus” means “exit” or “departure.” Translators may translate this title in a way that can communicate its subject clearly, for example, “About the Israelites Leaving Egypt” or “How the Israelites Left the Land of Egypt.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])<br><br>### Who wrote the book of Exodus?<br><br>The writers of both the Old and New Testaments present Moses as being very involved with writing the book of Exodus. Since ancient times, both Jews and Christians have thought that Moses wrote Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy.<br><br>### Why did Moses write so much about God delivering or rescuing the people of Israel?<br><br>Moses wrote much about God rescuing his people from the Egyptians to show that Yahweh is very powerful. Egypt was the most powerful nation at that time, but Yahweh was still able to free the Israelites from the Egyptians. Also, by rescuing the Israelites, Yahweh showed that he had chosen them as his people, and they should worship him.<br><br>### How does the book of Exodus show the fulfillment of the promises given to Abraham?<br><br>The book of Exodus shows God beginning to fulfill his promise to Abraham. In Genesis, God promised Abraham that he would have many descendants and that they would become a large nation. When God rescued the Israelites from the Egyptians, he took them to Mount Sinai. There he made a covenant with them, and they became the nation that belonged to Yahweh.<br><br>## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts<br><br>### What was the Jewish Passover?<br><br>The Jewish Passover was a religious festival. Yahweh commanded the Israelites to celebrate it every year. Passover was a time to remember how God rescued Israel from the Egyptians. The first Passover meal was eaten in the evening just before they left Egypt.<br><br>### What was the law of Moses to the people of Israel?<br><br>The law of Moses instructed the people of Israel about what Yahweh required them to do as his people. In the law, God told the people how they should live so that they would honor him. He also instructed them about their need to offer animal sacrifices. God required these sacrifices so that he could forgive their sins and continue living among them. The law also described the duties of the priests and told how to build the tabernacle.<br><br>### What did it mean that Israel was to be a “kingdom of priests and a holy nation” ([19:6](../19/06.md) ULT)?<br><br>Israel was a holy nation because Yahweh separated them from all other nations to belong to him. They were to honor and worship him only. This made them different from all the other nations of the world; the other nations worshiped many false gods.<br><br>## Part 3: Important Translation Issues<br><br>### Thus says Yahweh<br><br>This phrase is used many times in the Old Testament to introduce Yahweh’s speech. Your team should pick a standard translation. See [4:intro](../04/intro.md) for more.<br><br>### Pharaoh’s stubborn heart<br><br>Between chapters 4 and 14, there are 18 cases where Pharaoh’s heart is described as strong (11x), heavy (6x), or hard (1x), and one case where the Egyptians’ hearts are described as strong. These are metaphors for being stubborn, that is, being unwilling to obey Yahweh or even to do what is clearly in his own and Egypt’s best interest. Many cultures have similar metaphors, but not all will use the same body part. Within these cases, six times there is a neutral description that Pharaoh was stubborn, without saying anyone made him so ([7:13](../07/13.md), [7:14](../07/14.md), [7:22](../07/22.md), [8:19](../08/19.md), [9:7](../09/07.md), [9:35](../09/35.md)); three times Pharaoh makes himself stubborn ([8:15](../08/15.md), [8:32](../08/32.md), [9:34](../09/34.md)); and ten times Yahweh makes Pharaoh/the Egyptians stubborn ([4:21](../04/21.md), [7:3](../07/03.md), [9:12](../09/12.md), [10:1](../10/01.md), [10:20](../10/20.md), [10:27](../10/27.md), [11:10](../11/10.md), [14:4](../14/04.md), [14:8](../14/08.md), [14:17](../14/17.md)).<br><br>### Why are the details of the construction of the tabernacle in Exodus 25–32 repeated in Exodus 35–40?<br><br>In Exodus 25–32, God describes exactly how the tabernacle was to be built. The details were repeated in Exodus 35–40 in the description of the actual construction. This showed that the people were to be careful to do exactly as God commanded.<br><br>### Are the events in the order that they actually happened?<br><br>Most, but not all, of the events in the book of Exodus are told in the order that they actually happened. Translators may need to make it clear when the events are in an unusual order.<br><br>### What does it mean that God “lived” among his people?<br><br>The book of Exodus presents God as living in the tabernacle among the nation of Israel. God is everywhere, but he lived among the Israelites in a special way. God dwelled with the Israelites because they belonged to him. He promised to lead them and bless them. In return, the people were to worship him and honor him.
EXO	1	intro	cj55			0		# Exodus 01 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and Formatting<br><br>This chapter is intended to form a smooth transition from the last chapter of the book of Genesis.<br><br>## Special Concepts in this Chapter<br><br>### Israel’s growth<br><br>Israel grew in number. This was in fulfillment of the covenant God made with Abraham. It also caused the Egyptians great concern that there would be more Israelites than Egyptians, with the result that the Egyptians would be unable to defend themselves against such a large number of people. Pharaoh tried to kill all of the male babies so they would not become soldiers who fought against him. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/fulfill]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/covenant]])<br><br>### End of the famine<br><br>It is obvious that some time has passed since the beginning of the famine which brought the Israelites into Egypt. Yahweh appears to be punishing the Hebrews for not returning to the Promised Land but instead choosing to stay in Egypt. No return attempt is recorded to have been made. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/promisedland]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])<br><br>## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter<br><br>### “All of the descendants of Jacob were 70 in number”<br><br>This number included both Jacob’s children and grandchildren. It may cause confusion, but it is important to remember Jacob only had 12 sons.

EXO	1	1	fxbx	figs-go	הַ⁠בָּאִ֖ים…בָּֽאוּ	1		The words translated as **came in** could also be translated as “went in.” Use whichever form is most natural in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])
EXO	1	1	e65z	translate-names	יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל…יַעֲקֹ֔ב	1		**Jacob** and **Israel** are two names for the same man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
EXO	1	1	g89k	figs-metonymy	וּ⁠בֵית֖⁠וֹ	1	household	Here, **house** refers to all of the people who live together, usually a large family with servants. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “and his household” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EXO	1	5	uk67	figs-metonymy	וַֽ⁠יְהִ֗י כָּל־נֶ֛פֶשׁ יֹצְאֵ֥י יֶֽרֶךְ־יַעֲקֹ֖ב שִׁבְעִ֣ים נָ֑פֶשׁ	1	household	Here, **lives** refers to people (specifically, men); **going out of the loins of Jacob** is a reference to these people as being in his seed or semen and produced through his sexual acts–therefore meaning they are his descendants. See also Hebrews 7:9-10. Alternate translation: “And all the male descendants of Jacob numbered 70.”
EXO	1	6	sh42	grammar-connect-time-sequential	וַ⁠יָּ֤מָת	1		They did not die immediately. Jacob and his sons spent the rest of their lives in Egypt and died there. If necessary, use a transition word that conveys that some time passed. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
EXO	1	6	g5qg	translate-kinship	וְ⁠כָל־אֶחָ֔י⁠ו	1	all his brothers	**All his brothers** includes ten older brothers and one younger brother. If your language has different words for those, you can say, “his ten older brothers and his younger brother” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship]])
EXO	1	7	c368	figs-metonymy	וּ⁠בְנֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֗ל	1		This is the first of many times in this book that **sons of Israel** refers to the Israelite nation or people. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “And the people of Israel” or “And the Israelites” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EXO	1	7	c7ep	figs-doublet	פָּר֧וּ וַֽ⁠יִּשְׁרְצ֛וּ וַ⁠יִּרְבּ֥וּ וַ⁠יַּֽעַצְמ֖וּ	1		All of these verbs mean similar things; they are used together to emphasize that the Israelites became very numerous. If your language doesn’t have as many words that mean the same thing, you can use fewer words and express the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “had many children and became strong” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
EXO	1	7	uo65		פָּר֧וּ…וַ⁠יִּרְבּ֥וּ…וַ⁠תִּמָּלֵ֥א הָ⁠אָ֖רֶץ	1		Compare your translation of **fruitful … and multiplied … and the land was filled** here to Genesis 1:28, 9:1, 9:7, and especially Genesis 35:11 where God renamed Jacob to be called Israel.
EXO	1	7	nk2l	figs-metaphor	פָּר֧וּ וַֽ⁠יִּשְׁרְצ֛וּ	1	were fruitful	The birth of children to the Israelites is spoken of as if they were plants that were producing fruit and causing new plants to grow around them. If your readers would not understand what this image means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “had many children” or “gave birth to many children” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EXO	1	7	x97m	figs-abstractnouns	בִּ⁠מְאֹ֣ד מְאֹ֑ד	1	were fruitful	If your language does not use an abstract noun for this idea, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **greatness** in another way. Alternate translation: “and were very great” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
EXO	1	7	r2f1	figs-activepassive	וַ⁠תִּמָּלֵ֥א הָ⁠אָ֖רֶץ אֹתָֽ⁠ם	1	the land was filled with them	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language Alternate translation: “and they filled the land” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
EXO	1	7	e110	figs-idiom	בִּ⁠מְאֹ֣ד מְאֹ֑ד	1		Here the same word is used twice to emphasize how many the Israelite people had become.

EXO	1	8	eu8y	writing-newevent	וַ⁠יָּ֥קָם	1		This introduces a new event that happened some time after the events the story has just related. The story does not say how long after those events this new event happened. Use the natural form in your language for introducing a new event. (See:[[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
EXO	1	8	d20y	writing-participants	מֶֽלֶךְ־חָדָ֖שׁ	1		The story begins with the new king. Use the natural form in your language for introducing a new character.(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])

If your readers might misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “And a new king began to rule over the Egyptians and the country of Egypt” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EXO	1	8	dnkw	figs-metonymy	לֹֽא־יָדַ֖ע אֶת־יוֹסֵֽף	1		Here, **Joseph** refers to both the person Joseph and to all of the good things that he did for Egypt. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. See the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EXO	1	9	aku3	figs-exclamations	הִנֵּ֗ה	1		Here, **Behold** draws special attention to what is about to be said. Use a way of drawing people’s attention that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “Listen” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations]])
EXO	1	9	x65i	figs-possession	עַמּ֑⁠וֹ	1	his people	The people whom the king rules over and who are also part of his group (probably ethnicity, tribe, and/or clan) rather than the Israelite group are spoken of as if they belonged to the king. This is an instance of the possessive of social relationship. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
EXO	1	9	t7s1		עַמּ֑⁠וֹ	1		There is some ambiguity as to whom exactly Pharaoh was addressing. It could have been: (1) the people who lived in Egypt, the Egyptians or (2) some group of “his people” like his advisors, generals, nobles, or friends and family. Even if option 1 is meant, it is quite possible that he actually spoke to some smaller group of representatives, as in option 2.
EXO	1	9	jik8		מִמֶּֽ⁠נּוּ	1		Use a way that is natural in your language to compare non-specific sizes of groups of people. Alternate translation: “more than we are”
EXO	1	9	njuf	figs-quotemarks	הִנֵּ֗ה	1		Beginning from **behold** and extending to the end of [verse 10](../01/10.md) is a direct quote of what the king said. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with an opening first-level quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the beginning of a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	1	10	hiq4	figs-exclusive	נִֽתְחַכְּמָ֖ה…שֹׂ֣נְאֵ֔י⁠נוּ…בָּ֖⁠נוּ	1	let us	The word **us** is inclusive and refers to the king and his people, the Egyptians. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

The pronouns agree grammatically with the singular “people” in the original. This occurs in many places in Exodus. If this is confusing in your language, you can use the plural, as in the UST.
EXO	1	10	il4u	grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical	פֶּן־יִרְבֶּ֗ה וְ⁠הָיָ֞ה כִּֽי־תִקְרֶ֤אנָה מִלְחָמָה֙	1		The king suggests a combination of two hypothetical events: 1. There are even more Israelites, 2. There is a battle. These are followed by a series of undesirable consequences: 3. The Israelites join an enemy, 4. The Israelites attack the Egyptians, 5. The Israelites leave Egypt. While the series of consequences is also technically hypothetical, the king’s language indicates that if 1-2 happen, then 3-5 are certain. Use language that makes it clear that the first two events are hypothetical and that the next three are consequences that could be expected if the first two events happen. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical]])
EXO	1	10	jc1h		וְ⁠עָלָ֥ה מִן־הָ⁠אָֽרֶץ	1	leave the land	Alternate translation: “and he leaves Egypt”
EXO	1	10	ni77	figs-quotemarks	הָ⁠אָֽרֶץ	1		After this phrase, the direct quote of what the king said comes to an end. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with a closing first-level quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the end of a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])

EXO	1	12	pdfk	figs-abstractnouns	וַ⁠יָּקֻ֕צוּ	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for this idea, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **dread** in another way. Alternate translation: “And they were afraid” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
EXO	1	12	qgzz	figs-metonymy	מִ⁠פְּנֵ֖י בְּנֵ֥י יִשְׂרָאֵֽל	1		Here, **face** figuratively means the presence of a person. The phrase means that the Egyptians were afraid of the Israelites’ existence in their country. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “whenever they saw an Israelite” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EXO	1	13	j1q6	figs-abstractnouns	וַ⁠יַּעֲבִ֧דוּ מִצְרַ֛יִם אֶת־בְּנֵ֥י יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל בְּ⁠פָֽרֶךְ	1	made…work rigorously	Here, **rigor** is a noun used to modify the verb **enslaved**. **Rigor** could refer either to how hard the work was or how unkindly the Egyptians treated the Israelites.

EXO	1	14	mx6v	figs-metaphor	וַ⁠יְמָרְר֨וּ אֶת־חַיֵּי⁠הֶ֜ם	1	made their lives bitter	The difficult lives of the Israelites are spoken of as if their daily lives were bitter food that was difficult to eat. If your readers would not understand what this image means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “And they made their lives difficult” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EXO	1	14	jre2	figs-abstractnouns	בַּ⁠עֲבֹדָ֣ה קָשָׁ֗ה	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for this idea, you could express the idea behind **slavery** in another way. Alternative translation: “by making them work hard as slaves” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
EXO	1	14	cuq7	translate-unknown	בְּ⁠חֹ֨מֶר֙	1	mortar	This was a wet glue or mud put between bricks or stones that held them together when it dried. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
EXO	1	14	h5dx	translate-unknown	וּ⁠בִ⁠לְבֵנִ֔ים	1		**Bricks** are hardened rectangular blocks of mud, clay etc., used for building. (Source: Wiktionary) The clay or mud was hardened in the sun or by heating it to higher temperatures in other ways. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

EXO	1	15	h8f8	translate-names	שִׁפְרָ֔ה…פּוּעָֽה	1	Shiphrah…Puah	**Shiphrah** and **Puah** are Hebrew women’s names. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
EXO	1	15	h59t	writing-participants	שִׁפְרָ֔ה…פּוּעָֽה	1		The midwives are introduced here as new participants in the story. Use the natural form in your language for introducing a new character. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
EXO	1	16	t8f5		וַ⁠יֹּ֗אמֶר	1		**And the king said**, is combined with “spoke” from [verse 15](../01/15.md) in the ULT because the verb for “say” is used twice before he speaks. This may be strange in some languages. If it would be unnatural to say twice that the king spoke or said words, you may leave one off.
EXO	1	16	yovg	figs-quotemarks	בְּ⁠יַלֶּדְ⁠כֶן֙ אֶת־הָֽ⁠עִבְרִיּ֔וֹת וּ⁠רְאִיתֶ֖ן עַל־הָ⁠אָבְנָ֑יִם אִם־בֵּ֥ן הוּא֙ וַ⁠הֲמִתֶּ֣ן אֹת֔⁠וֹ וְ⁠אִם־בַּ֥ת הִ֖יא וָ⁠חָֽיָה	1		This is a direct quote of what the king said.

If your language uses different forms of “you” depending on the number of people addressed, use a dual or plural form here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
EXO	1	16	h3mb	figs-metonymy	עַל־הָ⁠אָבְנָ֑יִם	1	on the birthstool	Women sat on this short stool as they gave birth. Therefore, it was associated with birth. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “as they give birth” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

EXO	1	17	gy7k	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	וַ⁠תִּירֶ֤אןָ	1		Use a conjunction or other language structure that expresses contrast. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
EXO	1	18	y9g5		לַֽ⁠מְיַלְּדֹ֔ת	1	midwives	Women whose work is to help other woman give birth to a baby are called **midwives**. See how you translated this in [Exodus 1:15](../01/15.md).

EXO	1	18	o97u	figs-youdual	עֲשִׂיתֶ֖ן	1		This **you** is plural. The king is speaking to the two midwives. If your language uses different forms of “you” depending on the number of people addressed, use a dual or plural form here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
EXO	1	19	ocgl	figs-quotemarks	כִּ֣י לֹ֧א כַ⁠נָּשִׁ֛ים הַ⁠מִּצְרִיֹּ֖ת הָֽ⁠עִבְרִיֹּ֑ת כִּֽי־חָי֣וֹת הֵ֔נָּה בְּ⁠טֶ֨רֶם תָּב֧וֹא אֲלֵ⁠הֶ֛ן הַ⁠מְיַלֶּ֖דֶת וְ⁠יָלָֽדוּ	1		This is a direct quote of the midwives’ response.

EXO	1	19	cxu1	figs-synecdoche	וַ⁠תֹּאמַ֤רְןָ הַֽ⁠מְיַלְּדֹת֙	1		It may not make sense in your language to say that multiple people said something, so you may need to translate it in the singular (see UST). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
EXO	1	19	wl8h		הַֽ⁠מְיַלְּדֹת֙	1		These were women who helped a woman give birth to a baby. See how you translated this in [Exodus 1:15](../01/15.md).
EXO	1	20	eh25		לַֽ⁠מְיַלְּדֹ֑ת	1	midwives	These were women who helped a woman give birth to a baby. See how you translated this in [Exodus 1:15](../01/15.md).

EXO	1	20	h133	figs-doublet	וַ⁠יִּ֧רֶב…וַ⁠יַּֽעַצְמ֖וּ מְאֹֽד	1	The people increased in numbers	These words mean similar things and are used together to emphasize their numeric growth. If your language doesn’t have as many words that mean the same thing, you can use fewer words and express the emphasis in another way. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
EXO	1	20	eo1p	grammar-connect-logic-result	וַ⁠יֵּ֥יטֶב אֱלֹהִ֖ים לַֽ⁠מְיַלְּדֹ֑ת	1		This phrase is more logically connected to the statements in verse 21. It describes the result of the midwives fearing God with a general statement. You may need to rearrange vs 20-21 so that the reason (vs 21) comes before both the general and specific results. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
EXO	1	21	de53	grammar-connect-logic-result	כִּֽי־יָֽרְא֥וּ הַֽ⁠מְיַלְּדֹ֖ת אֶת־הָ⁠אֱלֹהִ֑ים	1		This is the reason for what God did. You may need to rearrange vs 20-21 so that the reason (vs 21) comes before both the general and specific results. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
EXO	1	21	pbve	grammar-connect-logic-result	וַ⁠יַּ֥עַשׂ לָ⁠הֶ֖ם בָּתִּֽים	1		This describes the result of the midwives fearing God with a specific statement. You may need to rearrange vs 20-21 so that the reason (vs 21) comes before both the general and specific results. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
EXO	1	21	jx9c		בָּתִּֽים	1	he gave them families	Alternate translation: “households”
EXO	1	22	ld1j	figs-explicit	כָּל־הַ⁠בֵּ֣ן הַ⁠יִּלּ֗וֹד הַ⁠יְאֹ֨רָ⁠ה֙ תַּשְׁלִיכֻ֔⁠הוּ	1	You must throw every son…into the river	This order was given in order to drown the male Hebrew children. The full meaning of this may be made explicit. Alternate translation: “You must dispose of each new baby boy in the river so he will drown” or “Drown each baby boy in the river when he is born” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EXO	1	22	a6b2	figs-quotations	וַ⁠יְצַ֣ו פַּרְעֹ֔ה לְ⁠כָל־עַמּ֖⁠וֹ לֵ⁠אמֹ֑ר כָּל־הַ⁠בֵּ֣ן הַ⁠יִּלּ֗וֹד הַ⁠יְאֹ֨רָ⁠ה֙ תַּשְׁלִיכֻ֔⁠הוּ וְ⁠כָל־הַ⁠בַּ֖ת תְּחַיּֽוּ⁠ן	1		From **You shall** to the end of the verse is a direct quote of Pharaoh’s speech. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with first-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. However, it could be translated as an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: “And Pharaoh commanded all of his people to throw every baby boy into the river, but to let every girl live.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
EXO	1	22	stag	figs-youdual	תַּשְׁלִיכֻ֔⁠הוּ…תְּחַיּֽוּ⁠ן	1		The uses of the word **you** here refer to all the Egyptians. If your language uses different forms of “you” depending on the number of people addressed, use a plural form here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])

This is because many of the participants play very minor roles and because this part of the story is focusing on Moses’ life.<br><br>### Ironic situations<br>* While Pharaoh tried to diminish the power of the Israelites by killing all of their baby boys, God used Pharaoh’s own daughter to save Moses.<br>* Moses believes he is meant to be the rescuer of his people, but they reject him. Ultimately, Moses was correct, but God had not yet sent him for that mission.
EXO	2	1	wvj9	writing-newevent	וַ⁠יֵּ֥לֶךְ	1	Now	A new scene begins here. Use the natural form in your language for introducing a new event. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
EXO	2	1	riy7	writing-participants	אִ֖ישׁ…בַּת	1		These are new participants. They remain unnamed until [Exodus 6:20](../06/20.md) where they are identified as Amram and Jochebed. For now it is best to leave them unnamed in your language, if possible. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
EXO	2	1	mp7m	figs-idiom	וַ⁠יִּקַּ֖ח אֶת־בַּת־לֵוִֽי	1		Here, **took a daughter** is an idiom for marrying. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent expression from your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EXO	2	2	s49k		ט֣וֹב	1		Alternative translations: “pleasing” or “fine”
EXO	2	2	q4c0	grammar-connect-logic-result	וַ⁠תֵּ֤רֶא…וַֽ⁠תִּצְפְּנֵ֖⁠הוּ	1		Hiding the boy was a result of seeing that he was good. Alternative translation: “Since she saw … she hid him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
EXO	2	2	j2es	translate-numbers	שְׁלֹשָׁ֥ה	1		3 (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])
EXO	2	3	t2gj	translate-unknown	תֵּ֣בַת גֹּ֔מֶא	1	papyrus basket	This is a basket made from a tall grass that grows by the Nile River in Egypt. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
EXO	2	3	tn3y	figs-explicit	וַ⁠תַּחְמְרָ֥⁠ה בַ⁠חֵמָ֖ר וּ⁠בַ⁠זָּ֑פֶת	1	sealed it with bitumen and pitch	You could explicitly state that this was to keep out water. Alternate translation: “and she daubed it with bitumen and with pitch to keep water from getting into it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EXO	2	3	wpb6	translate-unknown	וַ⁠תַּחְמְרָ֥⁠ה	1	sealed	This means that she applied a waterproof coating. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
EXO	2	3	ym3k	translate-unknown	בַ⁠חֵמָ֖ר	1	bitumen	This is a sticky black substance made from oil. It can be used to keep out water. Alternate translation: “with tar” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
EXO	2	3	v825	translate-unknown	וּ⁠בַ⁠זָּ֑פֶת	1	pitch	This is a sticky brown or black substance that can be made from tree sap or from oil. Therefore, **pitch** would include not only bitumen but also plant-based resins. It too can be used to keep out water. Alternate translation: “and with tar” or “and with resin” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
EXO	2	3	y8gq	translate-unknown	בַּ⁠סּ֖וּף	1	reeds	These **reeds** were a type of tall grass that grew in flat, wet areas. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
EXO	2	4	av8b		וַ⁠תֵּתַצַּ֥ב אֲחֹת֖⁠וֹ מֵ⁠רָחֹ֑ק	1	at a distance	This means she stood far enough away so that she would not be noticed, but close enough to see the ark. Use a word that expresses this sort of distance in your language.
EXO	2	4	uf14	figs-abstractnouns	מֵ⁠רָחֹ֑ק	1		This probably means somewhere in the reeds where she could see the basket, but no one would see her. If your language does not use an abstract noun for this idea, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **distance** in another way. Alternate translation: “not far away” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
EXO	2	4	ruvb	translate-kinship	אֲחֹת֖⁠וֹ	1		Here, the actions of **his sister** show that she was older. If your language uses a different term for siblings based on their relative ages and/or the gender of the siblings, use one that means “a boy’s older sister.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship]])<br>
EXO	2	4	z1cy	grammar-connect-logic-goal	לְ⁠דֵעָ֕ה מַה־יֵּעָשֶׂ֖ה לֽ⁠וֹ	1		This is her purpose in being close by. Alternative translation: “in order to learn what would happen to him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
EXO	2	5	m3i0	figs-go	וַ⁠תֵּ֤רֶד	1		**Came down** may be literal or figurative, as important places are often considered to be in a higher place. This means she came from her home, probably Pharaoh’s palace. If a perspective is required for Pharaoh’s daughter, you may choose go or come as works best in your language. “Come” is better as the scene is at the river and she comes to the scene location. However, you also need to consider your language’s way of introducing new participants. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])
EXO	2	5	y26h	writing-participants	וַ⁠תֵּ֤רֶד בַּת־פַּרְעֹה֙	1		The **daughter of Pharaoh** is introduced here as a new participant. Use the natural form in your language for introducing a new character. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
EXO	2	5	jjke	writing-participants	וְ⁠נַעֲרֹתֶ֥י⁠הָ	1		These women are introduced here as new participants; however, they are not mentioned again after this verse. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
EXO	2	5	im0d	figs-metaphor	עַל־יַ֣ד הַ⁠יְאֹ֑ר	1		Here, **hand** is a metaphor for side or, as relating to a river, shore. If your readers would not understand what this image means in this context, you can simply translate the meaning. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EXO	2	5	bi7s		וְ⁠נַעֲרֹתֶ֥י⁠הָ	1	her attendants	These were the young women whose job it was to be with her and make sure nothing bad happened to her.
EXO	2	5	am7g	writing-pronouns	וַ⁠תִּקָּחֶֽ⁠הָ	1		It is not clear who is meant by **she** here, either Pharaoh’s daughter or the servant. It is likely that Pharaoh’s daughter remains the subject. Alternative translation: “and she took the ark from her slave” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
EXO	2	6	g9n6	figs-exclamations	וְ⁠הִנֵּה	1	Behold	The word **behold** signals the surprising information that follows. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations]])
EXO	2	6	tyub	grammar-connect-logic-result	וַ⁠תַּחְמֹ֣ל עָלָ֔י⁠ו	1		The text does not state exactly what caused her to have compassion on the baby. If a reason must be provided in your language, it should be connected to either his crying (this is the better option) or that he was a “good” baby ([verse 2](../02/02.md)). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
EXO	2	6	jg0d	figs-quotemarks	מִ⁠יַּלְדֵ֥י הָֽ⁠עִבְרִ֖ים זֶֽה	1		This is a direct quote. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with first-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. It seems to have been said loud enough for the baby’s sister to hear. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	2	7	rnpl	figs-quotemarks	וְ⁠קָרָ֤אתִי לָ⁠ךְ֙ אִשָּׁ֣ה מֵינֶ֔קֶת מִ֖ן הָ⁠עִבְרִיֹּ֑ת וְ⁠תֵינִ֥ק לָ֖⁠ךְ אֶת־הַ⁠יָּֽלֶד	1		This is a direct quote of the baby’s sister. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with first-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	2	7	x5ja		וְ⁠קָרָ֤אתִי לָ⁠ךְ֙ אִשָּׁ֣ה מֵינֶ֔קֶת מִ֖ן הָ⁠עִבְרִיֹּ֑ת	1		This is a suggestive question. The child’s sister is hopeful that Pharaoh’s daughter does not yet have a plan for the baby beyond saving his life. However, it is still a true question, for without Pharaoh’s daughter’s permission, the child’s sister will not be able to fetch the woman. If your language has a way of forming questions that are also suggestions, use it here.
EXO	2	7	d7aj		מֵינֶ֔קֶת…וְ⁠תֵינִ֥ק	1	nurse	Here, **nursing** or **to nurse** means to feed with milk from the breast.
EXO	2	7	tqq9	grammar-connect-logic-goal	וְ⁠תֵינִ֥ק לָ֖⁠ךְ אֶת־הַ⁠יָּֽלֶד	1		This is the purpose of the sister’s proposal. Alternative translation: “And she could nurse the infant for you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
EXO	2	8	ab1m	figs-go	לֵ֑כִי…וַ⁠תֵּ֨לֶךְ֙	1		The girl left Pharaoh’s daughter to go to the child’s mother. The girl was almost certainly on foot. Use verbs of motion that express this. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])
EXO	2	8	d007	figs-quotemarks	לֵ֑כִי	1		This is a direct quote. Pharaoh’s daughter commands the baby’s sister. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with first-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	2	9	u554	writing-participants	לָ֣⁠הּ	1		The child’s mother is reintroduced as a participant. Use the natural form in your language for reintroducing a character. Alternative translation: “to the baby’s mother” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
EXO	2	9	xp5x	figs-quotemarks	הֵילִ֜יכִי אֶת־הַ⁠יֶּ֤לֶד הַ⁠זֶּה֙ וְ⁠הֵינִקִ֣⁠הוּ לִ֔⁠י וַ⁠אֲנִ֖י אֶתֵּ֣ן אֶת־שְׂכָרֵ֑⁠ךְ	1		This is a direct quote. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with first-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	2	9	mogg		שְׂכָרֵ֑⁠ךְ	1		This refers to payment that Pharaoh’s daughter would give to the mother in exchange for her service of nursing the baby.
EXO	2	9	hqsa	figs-explicit	וַ⁠תִּקַּ֧ח…וַ⁠תְּנִיקֵֽ⁠הוּ	1		The mother’s acceptance of the deal is implied. You could make it explicit, as in the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EXO	2	10	zj8h	grammar-connect-time-sequential	וַ⁠יִגְדַּ֣ל הַ⁠יֶּ֗לֶד וַ⁠תְּבִאֵ֨⁠הוּ֙	1	she brought him	**And the child grew older** marks an unspecified amount of time. He would have stayed with his mother at least until he was weaned (no longer feeding on his mother’s milk). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
EXO	2	10	j7n1		וַֽ⁠יְהִי־לָ֖⁠הּ לְ⁠בֵ֑ן	1	he became her son	Alternate translation: “and he became the adopted son of Pharaoh’s daughter”
EXO	2	10	h7to	grammar-connect-time-simultaneous	וַֽ⁠יְהִי־לָ֖⁠הּ לְ⁠בֵ֑ן וַ⁠תִּקְרָ֤א שְׁמ⁠וֹ֙ מֹשֶׁ֔ה	1		These events were likely simultaneous, because her act of naming him may have been what made him become **as a son to her**. Consider using a conjunction that does not make a great separation between these events. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous]])
EXO	2	10	nh2m		מֹשֶׁ֔ה וַ⁠תֹּ֕אמֶר כִּ֥י מִן־הַ⁠מַּ֖יִם מְשִׁיתִֽ⁠הוּ	1	Because I drew him from the water	Translators may add a footnote that says, “The name Moses sounds like the Hebrew word that means ‘draw out.’”
EXO	2	10	ityq	figs-quotations	וַ⁠תֹּ֕אמֶר כִּ֥י מִן־הַ⁠מַּ֖יִם מְשִׁיתִֽ⁠הוּ	1		**For** begins a direct quotation. It could be stated indirectly. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with first-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation.

EXO	2	11	tyol	grammar-connect-time-sequential	וַ⁠יְהִ֣י ׀ בַּ⁠יָּמִ֣ים הָ⁠הֵ֗ם וַ⁠יִּגְדַּ֤ל מֹשֶׁה֙ וַ⁠יֵּצֵ֣א	1		A significant amount of time has passed; later texts state that Moses was 40 years old at this point. Alternative translation: “Many years later, once Moses was grown, he went out” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
EXO	2	11	p7gx	writing-newevent	וַ⁠יְהִ֣י ׀ בַּ⁠יָּמִ֣ים הָ⁠הֵ֗	1		This introduces a new event in the story. In your language, use a phrase that indicates a new event occurring after significant time has passed. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
EXO	2	11	uy39	figs-go	וַ⁠יֵּצֵ֣א	1		The UST supplies a probable location that he **went out** from; it could also have been simply out from the Egyptian area or out to the work area or cities. Use go or come as appropriate in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])
EXO	2	11	swn3		מַכֶּ֥ה אִישׁ־עִבְרִ֖י	1	striking a Hebrew	Alternate translation: “hitting a Hebrew” or “beating a Hebrew”
EXO	2	12	m9bn	figs-merism	וַ⁠יִּ֤פֶן כֹּה֙ וָ⁠כֹ֔ה	1	He looked this way and that way	These two opposite directions have the combined meaning of “everywhere.” If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “He looked all around” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
EXO	2	12	rmgn	figs-explicit	וַ⁠יַּךְ֙	1		The context makes clear that Moses struck the Egyptian hard enough or repeatedly until Moses killed him. Consider using a word that indicates a deadly blow. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EXO	2	13	qn45	figs-go	וַ⁠יֵּצֵא֙	1	He went out	See how you translated this in [Exodus 2:11](../02/11.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])
EXO	2	13	wqrm	translate-ordinal	הַ⁠שֵּׁנִ֔י	1		The ordinal number here could mean “the next day” (UST) or simply on some day following the events of the previous verse. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
EXO	2	13	rgn1	figs-exclamations	וְ⁠הִנֵּ֛ה	1	behold	Here, **behold** shows that Moses was surprised by what he saw. You can use a word in your language that will give this meaning. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations]])
EXO	2	13	i4d6		לָֽ⁠רָשָׁ֔ע	1	the one who was in the wrong	Based on Moses’s question, this means the aggressor or the man wrongfully attacking his neighbor. Alternate translation: “the man who was guilty of starting the fight”

EXO	2	14	lyqh	figs-aside	אָכֵ֖ן נוֹדַ֥ע הַ⁠דָּבָֽר	1		It is likely this is something Moses said to himself, that is, he thought it to himself rather than speaking to the men in front of him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-aside]])
EXO	2	14	vfw5	figs-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּאמַ֔ר אָכֵ֖ן נוֹדַ֥ע הַ⁠דָּבָֽר	1		It may be clearer to present as an indirect quotation what was likely a thought Moses had. Alternative translation (as indirect quotation): “because he thought that everyone knew what he had done” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
EXO	2	15	yutr		וַ⁠יְבַקֵּ֖שׁ לַ⁠הֲרֹ֣ג אֶת־מֹשֶׁ֑ה	1		Pharaoh most likely delegated this task. Alternative translation: “and he sought to have Moses killed” (note that the passive form will not work in every language)

EXO	2	15	otsl		וַ⁠יֵּ֥שֶׁב…וַ⁠יֵּ֥שֶׁב	1		These are the same verb. This could mean: (1) Moses lived in Midian. He sat by this well one day. This may have been the well for the town he lived in. (2) Moses lived in Midian. His home was by this well. (3) Moses was a wanderer. He was in Midian and sat by this well when the next event occurred.

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	2	22	f76m	translate-names	גֵּרְשֹׁ֑ם	1		His name, **Gershom**, sounds somewhat like the Hebrew for “a stranger here.” You may consider using a footnote to explain that. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

EXO	3	intro	n6ze			0		# Exodus 03 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and Formatting<br><br>This chapter records one of the most important events in the history of the Israelite people: the revelation of the name Yahweh at the burning bush. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/reveal]])<br><br>## Special Concepts in this Chapter<br><br>### God’s holiness<br><br>God is so holy that people could not look upon him without dying. This is why Moses covered his eyes. It is also why he took off his shoes. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/holy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])<br><br>### Yahweh<br><br>The name Yahweh is sacred in the Hebrew religion. It is the personal name of God, which he revealed to Moses. It is by this name that he is known. Yahweh means “I am.” Some translations use all capitals to set this apart, “I AM.” Great care must be taken in translating the phrase “I am that I am.” (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/yahweh]])<br><br>## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter<br><br>### Participants<br><br>“The angel of Yahweh,” “Yahweh,” and “God” all appear to be speaking to Moses and interacting with him from the burning bush. Furthermore, God says that his name is “I AM.” (See note above on Yahweh and I AM.) Yahweh and God are the same, while there is speculation about who the angel of Yahweh is.
EXO	3	1	gqvh	writing-newevent	וּ⁠מֹשֶׁ֗ה הָיָ֥ה רֹעֶ֛ה	1		This phrase brings the story focus back to Midian and Moses. Use the natural form in your language for introducing a new event. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
EXO	3	1	oqcr	writing-background		0		Verse 1 provides immediate background context, setting the scene for Moses’ interaction with Yahweh. Use the natural form in your language for expressing background information. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
EXO	3	1	l7x6	figs-possession	כֹּהֵ֣ן מִדְיָ֑ן	1		This is a possessive of social relationship. **Jethro** is a **priest** who serves the Midianites. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
EXO	3	1	v97t	figs-go	וַ⁠יָּבֹ֛א אֶל	1		Alternate translation: “and he arrived at” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])
EXO	3	1	p27s	figs-possession	הַ֥ר הָ⁠אֱלֹהִ֖ים	1		This is an associative possessive. This mountain was associated with God in some way. In [Exodus 3:12](../03/12.md) God tells Moses that he and the Israelites will serve him on this mountain. Later in the story, this promise is fulfilled, and it is where God makes his covenant with Israel and gives them the 10 Commandments. So it may have been called **the mountain of God** in retrospect (as Moses probably wrote this book sometime after the Israelites were wandering in the wilderness). However, it is possible that the mountain was already somehow associated with God’s presence or worship before Moses went there with the flock. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
EXO	3	2	p0nt		וַ֠⁠יֵּרָא מַלְאַ֨ךְ יְהֹוָ֥ה אֵלָ֛י⁠ו בְּ⁠לַבַּת־אֵ֖שׁ מִ⁠תּ֣וֹךְ הַ⁠סְּנֶ֑ה	1		This is a summary of what happened. The next few verses tell the story of how this happened and how Moses discovered what was happening.

He expected the bush to be burnt up completely by the fire. Consider using an interjection in your language that expresses that what follows is a surprise. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
EXO	3	2	jmz0	figs-metonymy	אֻכָּֽל	1		Here, **being consumed** means being eaten completely until gone. In the case of fire, this is a metonym for burning completely until gone. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “destroyed by the fire” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EXO	3	3	fpww	figs-quotemarks	אָסֻֽרָה־נָּ֣א וְ⁠אֶרְאֶ֔ה אֶת־הַ⁠מַּרְאֶ֥ה הַ⁠גָּדֹ֖ל הַ⁠זֶּ֑ה מַדּ֖וּעַ לֹא־יִבְעַ֥ר הַ⁠סְּנֶֽה	1		This is a direct quote. It’s not specified who Moses spoke to; he may have been alone or with a group of shepherds or his family. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with first-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	3	3	jbue	figs-abstractnouns	אֶת־הַ⁠מַּרְאֶ֥ה הַ⁠גָּדֹ֖ל	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for something strange that someone sees, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **sight** in another way. Alternate translation: “unusual thing that I see” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
EXO	3	4	ue8v		יְהוָ֖ה…אֱלֹהִ֜ים	1		These terms both refer to the same being, since God’s name is Yahweh.

Your language may need to put the reason before the commands, as in, “The place on which you are standing, it is holy ground, so you must not come close to here. Take your sandals off from on your feet.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])

The UST continues the quotation from verse 5 rather than including an additional “he said.” This may be more natural in some languages. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with first-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	3	6	l5sy		אָבִ֔י⁠ךָ	1	your father	Possible meanings are (1) “your ancestor” or (2) “your father.” If it means “your ancestor,” then the phrases following it clarify who “your father” refers to: it refers to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. If it means “your father,” then it refers to Moses’s own father. It most cases it will be best to translate it as “your father,” i.e. Amram, Moses’s father.
EXO	3	6	lfbb	grammar-connect-logic-result	וַ⁠יַּסְתֵּ֤ר מֹשֶׁה֙ פָּנָ֔י⁠ו כִּ֣י יָרֵ֔א מֵ⁠הַבִּ֖יט אֶל־הָ⁠אֱלֹהִֽים	1		Reason: **for he was afraid from staring toward God** Result: **And Moses hid his face** Some languages may need to put the reason before the result.

EXO	3	7	nl33	figs-quotemarks	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר יְהוָ֔ה	1		After this phrase, a direct quote begins that continues through the end of [verse 10](../03/10.md). It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with an opening first-level quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the beginning of a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	3	7	xoz0	figs-idiom	רָאֹ֥ה רָאִ֛יתִי	1		The repetition of **see** expresses the intensity, certainty, or clarity of Yahweh’s seeing. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent expression from your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EXO	3	7	tpk0	figs-possession	אֶת־עֳנִ֥י עַמִּ֖⁠י	1		There are two possessives here: 1) “affliction of … people”: This is an event-related possessive where the people are the objects of affliction. They are treated badly as slaves. 2) “my people”: This one is more difficult as it involves both ownership and the possessive of social relationship. God views his people as his possession, and he is also in relationship with them as their God because they are descended from Abraham, though at this time they may not know God as theirs. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
EXO	3	7	nbft	figs-abstractnouns	עֳנִ֥י עַמִּ֖⁠י אֲשֶׁ֣ר בְּ⁠מִצְרָ֑יִם	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for this idea, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **affliction** in another way. Alternate translation: “how my people who are in Egypt are afflicted” or “how the Egyptians afflict my people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
EXO	3	7	p3tx	figs-metonymy	מִ⁠פְּנֵ֣י נֹֽגְשָׂ֔י⁠ו	1		Here, **faces** refers to the whole person or the presence of the person(s) who were oppressing the Israelites. If this image is used in your language, you may translate it. If a similar image is used, you may consider using it. If neither is the case, you may omit the word “face” and translate the meaning. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EXO	3	7	xx7r		נֹֽגְשָׂ֔י⁠ו	1	taskmasters	Alternate translation: “his oppressors”
EXO	3	7	ofxt		כִּ֥י	1		The conjunction is intensifying the expression of Yahweh’s knowledge. Your translation should express Yahweh’s knowing with certainty or strength.
EXO	3	7	mfn2	grammar-collectivenouns	נֹֽגְשָׂ֔י⁠ו…מַכְאֹבָֽי⁠ו	1		These pronouns, **him** and **his**, refer to the Israelites as a group in the singular. They agree with “people” as a collective noun in [3:6](../03/06.md). Some languages may have to use plural pronouns. Others may have to match the pronoun’s gender to the grammatical gender of the word for “people” in their language. If necessary, change “him” to “them” or change “his” to “hers” or “its” (depending on grammatical gender of “people.”) Alternate translation: “those who oppress them … their anguish” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns]])
EXO	3	7	hkcj	figs-possession	מַכְאֹבָֽי⁠ו	1		This is an event-related possessive where the people (as a group: **his**) are the subjects of anguish. Your translation should express that they are in deep mental and emotional distress (anguish). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
EXO	3	7	ui28	figs-explicit	מַכְאֹבָֽי⁠ו	1		It is implied that they are in deep mental and emotional distress (anguish) because they are treated badly as slaves. You may make this explicit. Alternate translation: “his anguish from his slavery” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EXO	3	7	zth8	figs-abstractnouns	מַכְאֹבָֽי⁠ו	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for this idea, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **anguish** in another way. Alternate translation: “how distressed they are” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
EXO	3	8	a1yv	grammar-connect-logic-result		0		Verse 8 contains God’s intended result from his acts of seeing and hearing, expressed in both verses 7 and 9. You may need to expressly mark this, for instance by introducing verse 8 with something like “Therefore,” and verse 9 with something like “Again, because.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
EXO	3	8	xy36	figs-go	וָ⁠אֵרֵ֞ד	1		God is figuratively expressing that he is descending from heaven to earth to intervene. God is always everywhere, but this phrase means that his special attention will be directed to this situation. Use whatever form of come or go is appropriate in your language for this.

EXO	3	8	nahb	grammar-collectivenouns	לְ⁠הַצִּיל֣⁠וֹ…וּֽ⁠לְ⁠הַעֲלֹת⁠וֹ֮	1		Here, **him** refers in the singular to the Israelites as a group. It is agreeing with “people” as a collective noun in [3:6](../03/06.md). Some languages may have to use plural pronouns. Others may have to match the pronoun’s gender to the grammatical gender of the word for “people” in their language. See what you did in the [previous verse](../03/07.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns]])
EXO	3	8	bi4e	figs-metaphor	מִ⁠יַּ֣ד	1		Someone’s **hand** is a common Biblical metaphor for power and control. If your readers would not understand what this image means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning in a non-figurative way. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EXO	3	8	djbz	figs-possession	מִ⁠יַּ֣ד מִצְרַ֗יִם	1		This is a possessive where the Egyptians are the subject of **the hand**, which means power. The Egyptians used their power and control to oppress the Israelites. Use a phrase in your language that expresses the idea of a group of people having power. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
EXO	3	8	mqyp	figs-parallelism	אֶל־אֶ֤רֶץ טוֹבָה֙ וּ⁠רְחָבָ֔ה אֶל־אֶ֛רֶץ זָבַ֥ת חָלָ֖ב וּ⁠דְבָ֑שׁ	1		There are multiple levels of parallelism here. First, the statements, **to a good and wide land** and **to a land flowing with milk and honey** are in parallel with each other. Within each of those, **good** and **wide** are in parallel with each other, and **milk** and **honey** are in parallel with each other. Each of these levels is meant to reinforce and expand upon one another. These are not examples of synonymous parallelism, and each part of the statement should be translated.

Taken together, this means that when the Egyptians see the Israelites (Hebrews) leaving Egypt, they will gladly help them (because they want them to leave so badly due to the Egyptians suffering under God’s judgment). If your language has the same or a similar idiom, you can translate or use it. Otherwise, you can translate the meaning. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

It is unclear both who the sojourning (visiting) women are and in whose house they are sojourning, leaving several possibilities. Most translations which make a decision about who they are identify both the temporary resident and her host home as Egyptian. This makes sense as the Israelites will be plundering the Egyptians. If it is possible to leave this ambiguous in your translation, that would be best.

EXO	3	22	h38j	figs-quotemarks	מִצְרָֽיִם	1		After this phrase, the direct quote of Yahweh’s word which started in [verse 15](../03/15.md) ends. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with a closing first-level quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the end of a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	4	intro	kap5			0		# Exodus 04 General Notes<br><br>## Potential Translation Issues<br><br>### Quotations<br><br> * There is a difficult transition between [4:4](../04/04.md) and [4:5](../04/05.md) because the quotation stops in the middle to inject a bit of narrative. When it resumes in [4:5](../04/05.md),the sentence seems incomplete (even if merged directly with the quotation fragment in [4:4](../04/04.md)). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])* Yahweh’s instructions to Moses are complex, and there are up to four levels of quotations in this chapter. Translators will need to decide if some of these need to become indirect quotations (if that is possible in their language) and take great care to use the proper quotation markings in the proper locations.<br><br>### Order of events<br><br>* The order of events is not always clear. In [4:14](../04/14.md) Yahweh tells Moses that Aaron is coming to meet him, but Yahweh telling Aaron to go meet Moses in the wilderness is not recorded until [4:27](../04/27.md).<br>* The timing of the events in [4:18](../18/.md)\-[4:27](../04/27.md), especially verses 18-19 and 27 in relation to the rest of the events of the chapter, is unclear.<br><br>### Thus says Yahweh<br><br>The first of over 400 occurrences throughout the Old Testament of a standard phrase used to introduce direct, authoritative instruction from Yahweh occurs in [4:22](../04/22.md). It occurs ten times in the book of Exodus; nine of these are between chapters 4–11. It would be good for your team to have a standard way to translate this that makes it clear that the words that come next are directly from God. If your language has a standard way of introducing a new message from your leader that alerts the hearers that these are the words of the leader, that would be a good phrase to consider.<br><br>### Yahweh’s attempt to kill someone<br><br>The encounter recorded from [4:24](../04/24.md) to [4:26](../04/26.md) is one of the strangest and most difficult passages in the entire book. Difficulties include:<br><br>* To whom do the pronouns refer? Masculine pronouns are used throughout the section, but there are two possible antecedents, Moses (who is not named in the narrative) and Zipporah’s son (who was presumably also Moses’ son, but this is how he is referred to in this text. For why, see below on why Yahweh did this). Most commentators believe the pronouns refer to Moses.<br>* Circumcision is described in fairly graphic detail. Different cultures will need to approach this differently. Some may have terms for circumcision, while others may be comfortable translating mostly literally, and others will need to use euphemisms or other strategies to translate. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/circumcise]])* The meaning of the phrase **a bridegroom of blood** (ULT) is unknown.<br>* Why did Yahweh attack Moses? Many commentators conclude that Moses had neglected to circumcise one of his sons because it displeased Zipporah, and Yahweh was holding Moses responsible before he returned to lead the Israelites (who should have been circumcised). When Zipporah repented by circumcising the son herself and touching the foreskin to Moses’ feet, Yahweh relents. These conclusions should help inform translation but should not be made explicit in the text.<br><br>## Study Concepts in this Chapter<br><br>### Moses does not understand<br><br>Although Moses believes in Yahweh, he does not trust in him. This is because Moses lacks understanding. Moses tries to believe the things he is asked to do are done by his own power. Yahweh is trying to get Moses to trust that these things are Yahweh’s doing. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/believe]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/trust]])<br><br>### Children of God<br><br>This chapter introduces the concept that Israel, the people group, is the chosen people of God and God’s firstborn son. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/elect]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/peopleofgod]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/firstborn]])<br><br>### Yahweh hardened Pharaoh’s heart<br><br>Scholars are divided over how to understand this statement. There is debate over whether Pharaoh plays an active or passive role in the hardening of his own heart. Translators should simply follow the text. In Exodus 4-14 there are ten statements that Yahweh hardens Pharaoh’s heart, and ten statements that Pharaoh hardens his own heart. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
EXO	4	1	j4yg		וַ⁠יַּ֤עַן מֹשֶׁה֙ וַ⁠יֹּ֔אמֶר	1	if they do not believe	Here, **answered and said** is a Hebrew expression which does not convey any extra information. Unless your language naturally uses a similar structure, it is better to translate one verb and omit the other. Alternate translation: “Moses answered”
EXO	4	1	b3xv	figs-quotemarks	וְ⁠הֵן֙ לֹֽא־יַאֲמִ֣ינוּ לִ֔⁠י וְ⁠לֹ֥א יִשְׁמְע֖וּ בְּ⁠קֹלִ֑⁠י כִּ֣י יֹֽאמְר֔וּ לֹֽא־נִרְאָ֥ה אֵלֶ֖י⁠ךָ יְהוָֽה	1		This is a direct quotation. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by marking it with first-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	4	1	pq8x	figs-metonymy	בְּ⁠קֹלִ֑⁠י	1		See [3:18](../03/18.md). Alternate translation: “to what I say” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EXO	4	1	neto	figs-quotesinquotes	לֹֽא־נִרְאָ֥ה אֵלֶ֖י⁠ךָ יְהוָֽה	1		This is a second-level quotation. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by marking it with second-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation within a quotation. However, you could translate it as an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: “that Yahweh has not appeared to me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
EXO	4	1	fu2x		וְ⁠הֵן֙	1		This is a term meant to focus the attention of the listener on what the speaker is about to say. If there is not a good way to translate this term in your language, this term can be omitted from the translation, or you can use an alternate translation like “Listen to me.”
EXO	4	2	qmvk	writing-pronouns	אֵלָ֛י⁠ו…וַ⁠יֹּ֖אמֶר	1		Alternate translation: “to Moses … And Moses said” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
EXO	4	2	r3f9	figs-quotemarks	מ⁠זה בְ⁠יָדֶ֑⁠ךָ	1		This is a direct quotation. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by marking it with first-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	4	2	p8sg	figs-quotemarks	מַטֶּֽה	1		This is a direct quotation. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by marking it with first-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation.

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	4	3	zycd	figs-metonymy	מִ⁠פָּנָֽי⁠ו	1		Here, “face” figuratively represents the snake itself. Alternative translation: “from the snake” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EXO	4	4	g6bk		וֶ⁠אֱחֹ֖ז בִּ⁠זְנָב֑⁠וֹ	1	take it by the tail	Alternate translation: “and pick it up by the tail” or “and grasp it by the tail”
EXO	4	4	mqpc	figs-quotemarks	שְׁלַח֙ יָֽדְ⁠ךָ֔ וֶ⁠אֱחֹ֖ז בִּ⁠זְנָב֑⁠וֹ	1		This is a direct quotation.

EXO	4	4	bzmp	grammar-connect-time-sequential	שְׁלַח֙ יָֽדְ⁠ךָ֔ וֶ⁠אֱחֹ֖ז בִּ⁠זְנָב֑⁠וֹ	1		This direct quotation is interrupted by Moses obeying Yahweh. This is probably a tightly ordered sequence of events where Yahweh paused and then continued speaking immediately after Moses obeyed. The quote resumes in [verse 5](../04/05.md), and there is more discussion there about how to handle the resumption. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
EXO	4	4	m86n		וַ⁠יְהִ֥י לְ⁠מַטֶּ֖ה	1	became a staff	Alternate translation: “and it turned into a rod” or “and it changed into a staff”

It may be more natural to reorganize verses four and five to keep the quote together. If you rearrange like this, Moses picking up the snake/staff should come after the full quotation. However, it is better to do something similar to the UST, which restates that Yahweh is speaking and provides some implied directives from Yahweh to make a complete sentence. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	4	5	m4fk	figs-ellipsis	לְמַ֣עַן יַאֲמִ֔ינוּ כִּֽי־נִרְאָ֥ה אֵלֶ֛י⁠ךָ יְהוָ֖ה אֱלֹהֵ֣י אֲבֹתָ֑⁠ם אֱלֹהֵ֧י אַבְרָהָ֛ם אֱלֹהֵ֥י יִצְחָ֖ק וֵ⁠אלֹהֵ֥י יַעֲקֹֽב	1		This quote is not a complete sentence; the UST provides a clarification. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
EXO	4	5	zbfr	writing-pronouns	יַאֲמִ֔ינוּ…אֲבֹתָ֑⁠ם	1		These pronouns refer either to the Israelites or to the Israelite elders. God had instructed Moses to gather and speak to the elders; if you make this participant explicit, elders is a better option. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
EXO	4	5	oqi5	writing-pronouns	אֵלֶ֛י⁠ךָ	1		This pronoun refers to Moses. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])

EXO	4	6	b9m8	figs-quotemarks	הָֽבֵא־נָ֤א יָֽדְ⁠ךָ֙ בְּ⁠חֵיקֶ֔⁠ךָ	1		This is a direct quotation. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by marking it with first-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	4	6	ep52	figs-exclamations	וְ⁠הִנֵּ֥ה	1	behold	This word, **behold**, is used to create an exclamation, showing surprise. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations]])
EXO	4	6	pw7g	figs-simile	כַּ⁠שָּֽׁלֶג	1	as white as snow	The word **like** (ULT) or “as” (UST) here is used to compare how Moses’ hand looked. You may not have a word for snow in your language. If so, consider an alternative that describes something very white. You may need to make the whiteness explicit. Alternate translation: “that made it look white like wool” or “that made it look white like the sand on the beach” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
EXO	4	7	kv9r	figs-quotemarks	הָשֵׁ֤ב יָֽדְ⁠ךָ֙ אֶל־חֵיקֶ֔⁠ךָ	1		This is a direct quotation. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by marking it with first-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	4	7	prr9	figs-exclamations	וְ⁠הִנֵּה	1		This word is used to create an exclamation, showing surprise. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations]])
EXO	4	8	q9qb	figs-quotemarks	וְ⁠הָיָה֙	1		Yahweh’s speech resumes here and continues through the end of [verse 9](../04/09.md). It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with an opening first-level quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the beginning of a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	4	8	well	figs-personification	וְ⁠לֹ֣א יִשְׁמְע֔וּ לְ⁠קֹ֖ל הָ⁠אֹ֣ת הָ⁠רִאשׁ֑וֹן וְ⁠הֶֽאֱמִ֔ינוּ לְ⁠קֹ֖ל הָ⁠אֹ֥ת הָ⁠אַחֲרֽוֹן	1		Here each **sign** is spoken of as if it had a **voice** with which it could speak. If this imagery would not make sense in your language, you may need to translate this in a way that makes explicit that the signs are meant to be proof that God sent Moses. Alternative translation: “and are not convinced that God has appeared to you by seeing the first sign, then they will be convinced by seeing the second sign.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
EXO	4	8	gxlg	writing-pronouns	יַאֲמִ֣ינוּ…יִשְׁמְע֔וּ…וְ⁠הֶֽאֱמִ֔ינוּ	1		These pronouns refer either to the Israelites or to the Israelite elders. God had instructed Moses to gather and speak to the elders; if you make this participant explicit, elders is the better option, but be sure to do the same as you did in [verse 5](../04/05.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
EXO	4	8	lsb3		לֹ֣א יַאֲמִ֣ינוּ…וְ⁠הֶֽאֱמִ֔ינוּ	1	pay attention	Alternate translation: “they do not acknowledge … then they will acknowledge” or “they do not accept … then they will accept”

EXO	4	10	opes		אִ֨ישׁ דְּבָרִ֜ים	1		This expression means “a man who uses words well,” in other words, an eloquent man who can speak well and convincingly.
EXO	4	10	pk0l	figs-merism	גַּ֤ם מִ⁠תְּמוֹל֙ גַּ֣ם מִ⁠שִּׁלְשֹׁ֔ם	1		These phrases simply mean “in the past.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
EXO	4	10	wsl4	figs-123person	עַבְדֶּ֑⁠ךָ	1		Moses refers to himself as God’s servant to lower his status before God (and perhaps by doing so to make his argument of inability stronger). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
EXO	4	10	bv64	figs-doublet	כְבַד־פֶּ֛ה וּ⁠כְבַ֥ד לָשׁ֖וֹן	1	I am slow of speech and slow of tongue	These phrases mean basically the same thing. Moses uses them to emphasize that he is not a good speaker. If your language does not use repetition in this way, you could combine these phrases. Alternate translation: “not good at public speaking”(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
EXO	4	10	zm3y	figs-metonymy	לָשׁ֖וֹן	1	slow of tongue	Here, **tongue** refers to Moses’ ability to speak. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “speech” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EXO	4	11	xpgf	figs-quotemarks	וַ⁠יֹּ֨אמֶר יְהוָ֜ה אֵלָ֗י⁠ו	1		After this phrase, a direct quote begins that continues to the end of the [next verse](../04/12.md). It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with an opening first-level quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the beginning of a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	4	11	ks2m	figs-rquestion	מִ֣י שָׂ֣ם פֶּה֮ לָֽ⁠אָדָם֒	1	Who is it who made man’s mouth?	Yahweh uses this question to emphasize that he is the Creator who makes it possible for people to speak. Alternate translation: “Is it not I, Yahweh, who created the human mouth and the ability to speak” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
EXO	4	11	e1y6	figs-rquestion	מִֽי־יָשׂ֣וּם אִלֵּ֔ם א֣וֹ חֵרֵ֔שׁ א֥וֹ פִקֵּ֖חַ א֣וֹ עִוֵּ֑ר	1	Who makes a man mute or deaf or seeing or blind?

If your readers might misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “I will give you the ability to speak” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EXO	4	12	kg7l	figs-quotemarks	תְּדַבֵּֽר	1		After this phrase, the direct quote from the previous verse ends.

EXO	4	13	s8nl		שְֽׁלַֽח־נָ֖א בְּ⁠יַד־תִּשְׁלָֽח	1		In translating this phrase, it is important to make clear that Moses is asking Yahweh to send someone else. Here he is not accepting Yahweh’s commission.
EXO	4	13	y4a7	figs-synecdoche	בְּ⁠יַד	1		This phrase means “by a person.” The figure is of a person taking Yahweh’s message in his hand to the Israelites and Pharaoh. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

EXO	4	14	okko	figs-rquestion	הֲ⁠לֹ֨א אַהֲרֹ֤ן אָחִ֨י⁠ךָ֙ הַ⁠לֵּוִ֔י	1		Yahweh uses this rhetorical question to suggest an alternative to Moses. Alternative translation: “I know you have a brother, Aaron the Levite.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
EXO	4	14	e0js	translate-kinship	אָחִ֨י⁠ךָ֙	1		Aaron is older than Moses. If your language uses a different term for the sibling relationship based on gender and age order, choose the appropriate one. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship]])
EXO	4	14	y5ed	figs-idiom	דַבֵּ֥ר יְדַבֵּ֖ר	1		In Hebrew, the word **speak** is repeated. This means he speaks well. English cannot convey this by doubling, so the meaning of the repetition was translated in the ULT in this case. If your language can say something like “speaking speaks” to mean “speaks well,” consider it; otherwise, translate the meaning similarly to the ULT or UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EXO	4	14	c51y		הִנֵּה	1		Here, **behold** is used to draw attention to surprising information that follows. If your language has a term that functions in that way (“Listen!” or “Look!” or “Pay Attention!”), use it here.
EXO	4	14	ettp	figs-go	יֹצֵ֣א	1		Yahweh says Aaron is coming from Egypt to Midian to find Moses. He is probably on foot. Depending on the language, the required form of go or come may vary. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])
EXO	4	14	tfsa	grammar-connect-logic-result	וְ⁠שָׂמַ֥ח	1		Aaron will be glad because he sees Moses. Consider a conjunction or other form that expresses result, as in the UST or alternative translation: “and because he sees you, he will have joy” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
EXO	4	14	ew4h	figs-metonymy	בְּ⁠לִבּֽ⁠וֹ	1	he will be glad in his heart	Here, **heart** refers to inner thoughts and emotions. If the heart is not a body part your culture uses to refer to a person’s thoughts and emotions, consider using whichever organ your culture would use for this image. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EXO	4	15	u97f	figs-metaphor	הַ⁠דְּבָרִ֖ים	1	put the words to say into his mouth	Words here are spoken of as if they were something that can be physically placed in a person’s mouth. If your readers would not understand what this image means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “the message that he is to repeat” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

Alternate translation: “And I will be with you as you speak and with him as he speaks” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EXO	4	15	v57x	figs-youdual	אֶתְ⁠כֶ֔ם…תַּעֲשֽׂוּ⁠ן	1	with his mouth	These refer to Moses and Aaron. If your language uses different forms of “you” depending on the number of people addressed, use a dual form if you have one or, if not, use a plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
EXO	4	16	mnsp	figs-simile	לְ⁠פֶ֔ה	1		This phrase compares Aaron to a mouth because he will be the one to actually vocalize to the Israelites and Pharaoh what Moses tells him to say. Alternate translation: “the one to say what you tell him to say” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
EXO	4	16	gn5v	figs-simile	תִּֽהְיֶה־לּ֥⁠וֹ לֵֽ⁠אלֹהִֽים	1	you will be to him like me, God	The word **like** here means Moses would represent the same authority to Aaron as God did to Moses. Alternate translation: “you will speak to Aaron with the same authority with which I speak to you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
EXO	4	17	mq82	figs-quotemarks	תַּעֲשֶׂה־בּ֖⁠וֹ אֶת־הָ⁠אֹתֹֽת	1		After this phrase, the direct quote of Yahweh ends. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with a closing first-level quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the end of a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	4	17	hm47	figs-explicit	הַ⁠מַּטֶּ֥ה הַ⁠זֶּ֖ה	1		Yahweh assumes that Moses will know that by **this staff**, he means the one that Moses said he had in his hand in [v. 2](../04/02.md) and with which God told him to do a miracle in vv. [3](../04/03.md)–[4](../04/04.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])<br><br><br>
EXO	4	18	j2ix	writing-participants	יֶ֣תֶר	1		Jethro is reintroduced as a participant in the narrative here. Use the natural form in your language for reintroducing a character.(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
EXO	4	18	cbop	figs-go	וַ⁠יֵּ֨לֶךְ	1		Because the setting has shifted back to Jethro’s home, some languages may need to use “come” here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])
EXO	4	18	b6mf	translate-kinship	חֹֽתְנ֗⁠וֹ	1	father-in-law	This refers to the father of Moses’ wife. Some languages may use a different term for the husband’s or wife’s father. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship]])
EXO	4	18	wlit	writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יֹּ֤אמֶר	1		Alternate translation: “and Moses said” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
EXO	4	18	g1h1	writing-pronouns	ל⁠וֹ֙	1		Alternate translation: “to Jethro” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
EXO	4	18	uvqk	figs-quotemarks	אֵ֣לֲכָה נָּ֗א וְ⁠אָשׁ֨וּבָה֙ אֶל־אַחַ֣⁠י אֲשֶׁר־בְּ⁠מִצְרַ֔יִם וְ⁠אֶרְאֶ֖ה הַ⁠עוֹדָ֣⁠ם חַיִּ֑ים	1		This is a direct quotation. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by marking it with first-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	4	18	urt0	figs-metonymy	אַחַ֣⁠י	1		Here the term **brothers** refers more broadly to all of Moses’ people group, those he is related to. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “my relatives” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EXO	4	18	gq2g	figs-idiom	וְ⁠אֶרְאֶ֖ה הַ⁠עוֹדָ֣⁠ם חַיִּ֑ים	1		Later in the Bible we are told that Moses was in Midian for 40 years. Moses’ request may have been literal or an idiom that meant he wanted to know how they were doing. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent idiom or use plain language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EXO	4	18	yay3	figs-explicit	לֵ֥ךְ לְ⁠שָׁלֽוֹם	1		This is a phrase of assent and blessing. It may be necessary for some languages to explicitly add, “Yes,” to the beginning of Jethro’s response. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EXO	4	18	i807	figs-quotemarks	לֵ֥ךְ לְ⁠שָׁלֽוֹם	1		This is a direct quotation. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by marking it with first-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	4	19	wwr8	grammar-connect-time-sequential	וַ⁠יֹּ֨אמֶר יְהוָ֤ה אֶל־מֹשֶׁה֙	1		The timing and situation for Yahweh speaking to Moses here is not specified. Some conjecture that it was part of the narrative of the encounter with Yahweh from the previous verses but placed after his request to Jethro for an unknown reason. Another speculation is that Moses delayed returning to Egypt (either by his own choice, Yahweh’s instructions, or someone else delaying him) and Yahweh came and told him again (the UST explicitly offers this optional translation). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
EXO	4	19	aosm	figs-quotemarks	לֵ֖ךְ שֻׁ֣ב מִצְרָ֑יִם כִּי־מֵ֨תוּ֙ כָּל־הָ֣⁠אֲנָשִׁ֔ים הַֽ⁠מְבַקְשִׁ֖ים אֶת־נַפְשֶֽׁ⁠ךָ	1		This is a direct quotation. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by marking it with first-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	4	19	clfj		הַֽ⁠מְבַקְשִׁ֖ים אֶת־נַפְשֶֽׁ⁠ךָ	1		This means they were seeking to end his life, that is, to kill him. Alternate translation: see UST.
EXO	4	20	fua6	writing-participants	בָּנָ֗י⁠ו	1		Moses’ second son is not introduced until [18:4](../18/.04.md) but had already been born before they left Midian. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
EXO	4	20	zi5m	figs-123person	וַ⁠יָּ֖שָׁב אַ֣רְצָ⁠ה מִצְרָ֑יִם	1		It is clear from [verse 24](../04/24.md) and [25](../04/25.md) that his family went with him, so you may need to translate as “they returned.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
EXO	4	20	a1s5	grammar-connect-time-sequential	וַ⁠יָּ֖שָׁב אַ֣רְצָ⁠ה מִצְרָ֑יִם	1		After the incident on the road in verses [24-26](../04/24.md). Moses’ family is not mentioned again until [18:2](../18/02.md), which says that Moses sent them back, so it may be better to make a translation similar to the UST, which only commits to the family starting on the way to Egypt. This option has the further benefit of allowing for the several events that happen before Moses gets to Egypt. The ULT’s **toward** is another way of giving space in the translation for the next several events. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
EXO	4	20	f26l	figs-explicit	מַטֵּ֥ה הָ⁠אֱלֹהִ֖ים	1		The phrase **the staff of God** refers to the staff that God told Moses to take with him in v. [17](../04/17.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EXO	4	20	m4uj	figs-explicit	מַטֵּ֥ה הָ⁠אֱלֹהִ֖ים	1		The book describes this staff as **the staff of God** because God appointed it as his instrument so that Moses could do miraculous works through it. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Make sure your translation does not lead people to think the staff was a magic wand or shaman’s staff that had its own power or power from Moses or that the staff gave Moses the ability to command God. In every instance where miracles happened, first God told Moses to do something with the staff, then Moses obeyed, and then God caused a miracle. Alternate translation: “the staff that God had told him to bring because God intended to work powerfully through it when Moses stretched it out.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EXO	4	21	lva8	figs-quotemarks	בְּ⁠לֶכְתְּ⁠ךָ֙	1		This begins a direct quotation that continues to the end of [4:23](../04/23.md). It contains up to fourth-level quotations. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with an opening first-level quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the beginning of a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	4	21	oajf		רְאֵ֗ה	1		Most translations and interpretations of the verb **see** take it to mean something like “see that you do.”
EXO	4	21	paos	figs-metaphor	כָּל־הַ⁠מֹּֽפְתִים֙ אֲשֶׁר־שַׂ֣מְתִּי בְ⁠יָדֶ֔⁠ךָ	1		Here the miracles are spoken of as if they were items Moses could carry. In part, this may be because the three signs already given to Moses involved the use of his hand. If your readers would not understand what this image means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternative translation: “all the wonders I have authorized you to perform” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EXO	4	21	kdsb	figs-metonymy	לִ⁠פְנֵ֣י פַרְעֹ֑ה	1		This time, while **before the face of** still has the standard figurative meaning of “in the presence of,” it is a much more literal use here. Moses is to actually do the miracles in front of Pharaoh so he can see them. Alternative translation: “so Pharaoh can see them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EXO	4	21	ovma	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	וַ⁠אֲנִי֙ אֲחַזֵּ֣ק	1		Referring to himself in the opening of this sentence serves to emphasize a contrast between what might normally be expected and what will actually happen. Translate this in a way that clearly contrasts the performance of miracles before Pharaoh (which might be expected to lead to him releasing the Israelites) with what Yahweh says Pharaoh will do. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
EXO	4	21	uvoh	figs-metaphor	וַ⁠אֲנִי֙ אֲחַזֵּ֣ק אֶת־לִבּ֔⁠וֹ	1		This means that God will make him stubborn. His stubborn attitude is spoken of as if his heart would be made stronger. If the heart is not the body part your culture uses to refer to a person’s will, consider using whichever organ your culture would use for this image. Alternate translation: “But as for me, I will cause Pharaoh to be stubborn” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EXO	4	21	uudz	grammar-connect-logic-result	וְ⁠לֹ֥א יְשַׁלַּ֖ח אֶת־הָ⁠עָֽם	1		Make it clear in your translation that this is a result of God hardening Pharaoh’s heart. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
EXO	4	22	ftde		כֹּ֚ה אָמַ֣ר יְהוָ֔ה	1		This is the first of hundreds of occurrences throughout the Old Testament of a standard phrase, **Thus says Yahweh**, used to introduce direct, authoritative instruction from Yahweh. It would be good for your team to have a standard way to translate this that makes it clear that the words that come next are directly from God. If your language has a standard way of introducing a new message from your rulers that alerts the hearers that these are the words of the rulers, that would be a good phrase to consider.
EXO	4	22	zb2e	figs-quotesinquotes	כֹּ֚ה	1		Here, **Thus** begins a second-level quotation that continues until the end of [4:23](../04/23.md). It should be marked in some manner that distinguishes it from the outer level, the first level. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
EXO	4	22	teyy	figs-quotesinquotes	כֹּ֚ה אָמַ֣ר יְהוָ֔ה	1		This begins a second-level quotation that continues until the end of [4:23](../04/23.md). It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with an opening second-level quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the beginning of a quotation within a quotation. However, you may want to translate this as an indirect quotation in order to reduce the levels of quotations in this passage. Alternative translation: “that Yahweh says” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
EXO	4	22	kud7	figs-quotemarks	בְּנִ֥⁠י	1		This is the beginning of a third-level quotation that continues until the end of [4:23](../04/23.md). It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with an opening third-level quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the beginning of a quotation within a quotation within a quotation. (If you chose to translate, “Thus says Yahweh,” as an indirect quote, this will be a second- level quotation.) (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	4	22	gr2d	figs-metaphor	בְּנִ֥⁠י בְכֹרִ֖⁠י יִשְׂרָאֵֽל׃	1		Yahweh expresses his affection for the Israelites by calling them his **son**. Some languages may need to change the metaphor here into a simile. See the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EXO	4	22	pt4n	grammar-collectivenouns	יִשְׂרָאֵֽל	1	Israel is my son	The word **Israel** here represents all the people of Israel as a group. It is important to keep the singular reference to Israel as son rather than change it to something like ‘the Israelites are my children,’ because God is making a particular contrast here between his son and Pharaoh’s son. Some languages may not be able to use “Israel” as a collective noun and may need to choose a translation like “the nation of Israel” or “the Israelite nation.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns]])
EXO	4	22	nbn7	figs-metonymy	יִשְׂרָאֵֽל	1		The Israelite nation is often referred to simply by the name of the patriarch. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. For alternative translation see: [[rc://en/tn/help/exo/04/22/pt4n]] (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EXO	4	23	syar	figs-quotemarks	שַׁלַּ֤ח אֶת־בְּנִ⁠י֙ וְ⁠יַֽעַבְדֵ֔⁠נִי	1		This is a fourth-level quotation. It should be marked in some manner that distinguishes it from the outer levels. (If you chose to translate “Thus says Yahweh” as an indirect quote, this will be a third-level quotation.) (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	4	23	yyuo	figs-quotations	וָ⁠אֹמַ֣ר אֵלֶ֗י⁠ךָ שַׁלַּ֤ח אֶת־בְּנִ⁠י֙ וְ⁠יַֽעַבְדֵ֔⁠נִי וַ⁠תְּמָאֵ֖ן	1		The fourth-level quotation here may be a good one to translate as an indirect quotation in order to reduce the levels of quotations in this passage. Alternative translation: “and I told you to let my son go that he may serve me. But you have refused” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
EXO	4	23	k7mh	figs-metaphor	בְּנִ⁠י֙	1	you have refused to let him go	Yahweh continues to metaphorically speak of Israel as **my son.** See how you translated it in the previous verse. Alternative translation: “the Israelite nation, which is like a son to me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EXO	4	23	u825	figs-pronouns	וְ⁠יַֽעַבְדֵ֔⁠נִי…לְ⁠שַׁלְּח֑⁠וֹ	1		The pronouns **he** and **him** agree with “son.” What you use may depend on how you translated son at [[rc://en/tn/help/exo/04/23/k7mh]]. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pronouns]])
EXO	4	23	ot2b		הִנֵּה֙	1		This is used to draw attention to surprising information that follows. Alternative translation: “Know this”
EXO	4	23	re11		בִּנְ⁠ךָ֖	1	I will certainly kill your son, your firstborn	Here, **your son** refers to the actual son of Pharaoh.
EXO	4	23	ubcw	figs-quotemarks	בִּנְ⁠ךָ֖ בְּכֹרֶֽ⁠ךָ	1		After this phrase, the three levels of direct quotations end, bringing a complete close to all quotations that started in verses [21](../04/21.md) and [22](../04/22.md). If you are using direct quotations, at the end of this verse you should have three closing markers: third level, second level and first level. In English, it looks like **” ’ ”** (without spaces). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	4	24	sp6h	writing-newevent	וַ⁠יְהִ֥י	1	Yahweh met Moses and tried to kill him	This introduces a new event. Mark the transition in a natural way in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
EXO	4	24	p820	writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יִּפְגְּשֵׁ֣⁠הוּ…הֲמִיתֽ⁠וֹ	1		Here, it is not clear who **him** refers to. Most commentators believe it refers to Moses, but it could refer to the son, though that is less likely. If it is necessary to choose for your translation, use Moses. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
EXO	4	24	qeo5	writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יְבַקֵּ֖שׁ	1		Here, **he** refers to Yahweh. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
EXO	4	25	m1la	translate-names	צִפֹּרָ֜ה	1	Zipporah	**Zipporah** is the name of Moses’ wife. See how you translated it in [2:21](../02/21.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
EXO	4	25	sftg	writing-participants	צִפֹּרָ֜ה	1		**Zipporah** is introduced here as a new character. Use the natural form in your language for introducing a new character. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
EXO	4	25	a36h	translate-unknown	צֹ֗ר	1	flint knife	This was a knife with a sharpened stone blade. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
EXO	4	25	nkxn	translate-unknown	עָרְלַ֣ת	1		The **foreskin** is the retractable fold of skin which covers and protects the end of the penis. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
EXO	4	25	l6sr	figs-euphemism	לְ⁠רַגְלָ֑י⁠ו	1	to his feet	It is possible that the word **feet** may have been a more respectful way to refer to the genital area of the body. However, that possibility is not high enough that you should translate it either literally as genitals or with another euphemism meaning genitals in your language. If you have a word that means primarily feet or legs, but could in some cases also euphemistically mean genitals, you may consider it. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
EXO	4	25	iuzw	figs-quotemarks	כִּ֧י חֲתַן־דָּמִ֛ים אַתָּ֖ה לִֽ⁠י	1		This is a direct quotation. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by marking it with first-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	4	25	b2t3	figs-metaphor	כִּ֧י חֲתַן־דָּמִ֛ים אַתָּ֖ה לִֽ⁠י	1	you are a bridegroom to me by blood	The meaning of this metaphor is unclear. It was probably a known saying in that culture. Alternate translation: “You are related to me by this blood” or “You are my husband because of blood” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EXO	4	26	ceqk	grammar-connect-logic-result	וַ⁠יִּ֖רֶף	1		God **relented** as a result of Zipporah’s action. Consider a conjunction or other form that expresses result, as in the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
EXO	4	26	o4zt	writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יִּ֖רֶף	1		Alternate translation: “Yahweh relented” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
EXO	4	26	k136	writing-pronouns	מִמֶּ֑⁠נּוּ	1		As in [4:24](../04/24.md), this could mean either Moses or the son, but most commentators think it is still Moses. The UST uses “anyone” to preserve ambiguity. Alternative translation: “from Moses” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
EXO	4	26	r8hj	figs-quotations	חֲתַ֥ן דָּמִ֖ים	1		This is a unique quotation because Zipporah probably does not speak again; rather, the quotation refers back to her statement in [4:25](../04/25.md). Your language may handle this sort of quotation in a special way. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
EXO	4	26	abmg	figs-quotemarks	חֲתַ֥ן דָּמִ֖ים לַ⁠מּוּלֹֽת	1		It is not clear if the quotation includes **because of the circumcision** or if that is a comment explaining the quotation. Translations are divided in where they end the quotation, but most exclude **because of the circumcision**, and it is best to follow that unless a locally respected translation includes it. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	4	27	xk6b	writing-newevent	וַ⁠יֹּ֤אמֶר	1	Yahweh said to Aaron	You may want to add a word that marks the beginning of a new part of the story, as the UST does. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
EXO	4	27	qxpc	writing-participants	אַהֲרֹ֔ן	1		**Aaron** is introduced as a new participant. Use the natural form in your language for introducing a new character. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
EXO	4	27	fply	figs-quotemarks	לֵ֛ךְ לִ⁠קְרַ֥את מֹשֶׁ֖ה הַ⁠מִּדְבָּ֑רָ⁠ה	1		This is a direct quotation. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by marking it with first-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	4	27	wy4n	figs-possession	בְּ⁠הַ֥ר הָ⁠אֱלֹהִ֖ים	1	at the mountain of God	See how you translated this in [3:1](../03/01.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
EXO	4	27	tfn2	translate-symaction	וַ⁠יִּשַּׁק	1		This was a traditional way of greeting which showed love. You can make this explicit, as in the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
EXO	4	28	ad9x		שְׁלָח֑⁠וֹ…צִוָּֽ⁠הוּ	1		These are a bit awkward to translate in English, so the UST adds more information. Other languages may not have the same difficulty.
EXO	4	28	b429	writing-pronouns	שְׁלָח֑⁠וֹ…צִוָּֽ⁠הוּ	1	he had sent him to say	Here, the pronoun **he** refers to Yahweh, and **him** refers to Moses. Alternative translation: “Yahweh sent Moses … Yahweh commanded Moses” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
EXO	4	29	y8o3	writing-newevent	וַ⁠יֵּ֥לֶךְ	1		This begins a new event which you may need to mark in your translation with a transitional word like the UST’s “When.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
EXO	4	30	bm2x	figs-metonymy	לְ⁠עֵינֵ֥י הָ⁠עָֽם	1	in the sight of the people	Here, **before the eyes** means he did the signs so they could see them. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternative translation: “in their sight” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EXO	4	30	x1v3		הָ⁠עָֽם	1		Context suggests that **people** refers to the leaders gathered in [4:29](../04/29.md).
EXO	4	31	glp2		הָ⁠עָ֑ם	1		Context suggests that **people** refers to the leaders gathered in [4:29](../04/29.md).
EXO	4	31	q1er		פָקַ֨ד…בְּנֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֗ל	1	had observed the Israelites	Alternate translation: “saw the Israelites” or “was concerned about the Israelites”
EXO	4	31	g83a	translate-symaction	וַֽ⁠יִּקְּד֖וּ וַ⁠יִּֽשְׁתַּחֲוּֽוּ	1	they bowed their heads	Alternative translations: “they bowed their heads in awe” or “they bowed down low in reverence.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
EXO	5	intro	kea2			0		# Exodus 05 General Notes<br><br>## Special Concepts in this Chapter<br><br>### A slave’s work<br><br>The Egyptians were known for making their slaves do a lot of work. The Israelite slaves were forced to make a specific number of bricks every day.

The ULT uses “taskmasters” and “foremen.” Many cultures will not have these types of titles. Generic expressions like “Egyptian leaders” and “Hebrew leaders” may be necessary.

Use the natural form in your language for introducing a new event. Alternative translation: “After that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
EXO	5	1	q9kn	grammar-connect-time-sequential	וְ⁠אַחַ֗ר בָּ֚אוּ מֹשֶׁ֣ה וְ⁠אַהֲרֹ֔ן וַ⁠יֹּאמְר֖וּ אֶל־פַּרְעֹ֑ה	1	After these things happened	It is unclear how long Moses and Aaron waited before they went to see Pharaoh. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
EXO	5	1	cudx	figs-go	בָּ֚אוּ	1		In this instance, depending on how they have to set scenes, some languages may need to use “came in.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])

It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by marking it with first-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])

EXO	5	1	lu3i		כֹּֽה־אָמַ֤ר יְהוָה֙	1		This quotation form is used to introduce commands from Yahweh. See [4:intro](../04/intro.md) for more information.
EXO	5	1	u2vt		וְ⁠יָחֹ֥גּוּ	1	festival for me	This is a celebration to worship Yahweh. Alternative translation: “so they can worship me with eating and drinking”
EXO	5	2	v4c1	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר	1	Why should I…let Israel go?	The result here is exactly as God has said; therefore, a contrastive transition word is reasonable but not required, given the immediate human context. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
EXO	5	2	fq6i	figs-quotemarks	מִ֤י יְהוָה֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר אֶשְׁמַ֣ע בְּ⁠קֹל֔⁠וֹ לְ⁠שַׁלַּ֖ח אֶת־יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל לֹ֤א יָדַ֨עְתִּי֙ אֶת־יְהוָ֔ה וְ⁠גַ֥ם אֶת־יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל לֹ֥א אֲשַׁלֵּֽחַ	1		This is a direct quotation.

EXO	5	2	lqwt		מִ֤י יְהוָה֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר אֶשְׁמַ֣ע בְּ⁠קֹל֔⁠וֹ לְ⁠שַׁלַּ֖ח אֶת־יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל	1		This is not a rhetorical question, though Pharaoh may have spoken with contempt. Pharaoh would have considered himself a god. The Egyptians had several gods, and most people groups were assumed to have their own gods. Therefore, Pharaoh had truly not heard of Yahweh (who has just told his name to Moses).
EXO	5	2	wpff	grammar-collectivenouns	יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל…יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל	1		Here the nation is spoken of as an individual. Alternative translation: “the nation of Israel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns]])

EXO	5	2	ma6b		וְ⁠גַ֥ם	1		This functions to strengthen Pharaoh’s statement about his decision. Alternative translation: “and most definitely”
EXO	5	3	dt39	figs-123person	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמְר֔וּ	1		It may not make sense in all languages for multiple people to speak. Since Aaron was appointed as Moses’ spokesman, consider the alternative translation: “Aaron replied” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

EXO	5	3	y9ip		אֱלֹהֵ֥י הָ⁠עִבְרִ֖ים	1	God of the Hebrews	This term, **The God of the Hebrews**, is also used for Yahweh, the Israelites’ God.
EXO	5	3	kclj	figs-exclusive	עָלֵ֑י⁠נוּ נֵ֣לֲכָה…וְ⁠נִזְבְּחָה֙…יִפְגָּעֵ֔⁠נוּ	1		Here, **us** (or “we” in UST) refers to the Hebrew people (the Israelites). It excludes Pharaoh and his people. Some languages may need to consider whether to use an inclusive or exclusive form. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
EXO	5	3	gfs5	figs-metonymy	בֶ⁠חָֽרֶב	1	or with the sword	Here, **sword** represents war or an attack by enemies. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language.

Pharaoh uses this rhetorical question to express his anger towards Moses and Aaron for taking the Israelites away from their work. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “Stop distracting the people from doing their work!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
EXO	5	4	fiw9	figs-youdual	לְכ֖וּ לְ⁠סִבְלֹתֵי⁠כֶֽם	1		This **your** could refer to Moses and Aaron, or it could mean “all you Israelite people.” The second meaning is more likely. If your language uses different forms of “you” depending on the number of people addressed, use a dual or plural form here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
EXO	5	5	nqbe	figs-aside	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר פַּרְעֹ֔ה	1		It is unusual for the same speaker to be reintroduced like this. Some translations omit the repetition, but there is another option. This statement may be more connected to the next couple of verses, so it might be appropriate to make a minor break before this verse. Pharaoh may have been commenting to himself, or he may have only thought this statement silently; either way, it led to his next actions. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-aside]])
EXO	5	5	todi		הֵן	1		**Behold** is a term meant to focus the attention of the listener on what the speaker is about to say.
EXO	5	5	c53k	figs-youdual	וְ⁠הִשְׁבַּתֶּ֥ם	1		Here, **you** means Moses and Aaron. If your language uses different forms of “you” depending on the number of people addressed, use a dual form if you have one, or if not, use a plural form here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
EXO	5	6	ar9m		אֶת־הַ⁠נֹּגְשִׂ֣ים בָּ⁠עָ֔ם וְ⁠אֶת־שֹׁטְרָ֖י⁠ו	1		Pharaoh may have sent a messenger or messengers to the taskmasters and officers or spoken to one or a few representatives of them at his court rather than speaking to them directly. Alternative translation: “Pharaoh gave an order to the taskmasters among the people and officers. He said,”
EXO	5	6	zd4m		הַ⁠נֹּגְשִׂ֣ים	1	taskmasters	**Taskmasters** were Egyptians whose job it was to force the Israelites to do hard work. These are probably the same as the “overseers” of labor gangs from [Exodus 1:11](../01/11.md), but here the term is harsher. Alternative translation: “oppressors”
EXO	5	6	gsdx		שֹׁטְרָ֖י⁠ו	1		**Officers** were probably Israelite slaves who were in charge of the other Israelites but who answered to the Egyptian taskmasters.
EXO	5	6	dxih		לֵ⁠אמֹֽר	1		Here, **saying** is a way of introducing a direct quotation in Hebrew; most translations can omit it without harm.
EXO	5	7	k6io	figs-youdual	לֹ֣א תֹאסִפ֞וּ⁠ן	1		This command was given to multiple people; if your language distinguishes between singular and plural forms when giving commands, make sure this is a plural form. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
EXO	5	7	kfhw	figs-quotemarks	לֹ֣א תֹאסִפ֞וּ⁠ן	1		Verses 7-9 are a direct quotation. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate the start here with an opening first-level quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the beginning of the quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	5	7	p9nx	figs-idiom	כִּ⁠תְמ֣וֹל שִׁלְשֹׁ֑ם	1	you must no longer give	This is a Hebrew idiom meaning “in the past.” If your readers might misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent idiom or use plain language.

EXO	5	8	izkf	figs-youdual	תָּשִׂ֣ימוּ	1		If your language uses different forms of “you” depending on the number of people addressed, use a plural form here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
EXO	5	8	ro25	translate-unknown	הַ⁠לְּבֵנִ֜ים	1		**Bricks** are hardened clay blocks for building. See how you translated in [1:14][../01/14.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

EXO	5	9	xca1	figs-idiom	וְ⁠אַל־יִשְׁע֖וּ בְּ⁠דִבְרֵי־שָֽׁקֶר	1		Here words are spoken of as if they could be looked upon.

EXO	5	10	ozzn	writing-newevent	וַ⁠יֵּ֨צְא֜וּ	1		This begins a new scene, which may need to be marked in a certain way in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
EXO	5	10	x4bi		נֹגְשֵׂ֤י	1	taskmasters	**Taskmasters** were Egyptians whose job was to force the Israelites to do hard work. See how you translated this in [5:6](../05/6.md). See [[rc://en/tn/help/exo/05/06/zd4m]]
EXO	5	10	zvxx		כֹּ֚ה אָמַ֣ר פַּרְעֹ֔ה	1		This is the same quote form as is used when Yahweh gives a direct command. See [4:intro](../04/intro.md) for more information.
EXO	5	10	c12s	figs-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּאמְר֥וּ אֶל־הָ⁠עָ֖ם לֵ⁠אמֹ֑ר כֹּ֚ה אָמַ֣ר פַּרְעֹ֔ה	1		It might be helpful in some languages to translate **thus says Pharaoh** as an indirect quote so that his conveyed command is not a quote within a quote. Alternate translation: “and told the people that Pharaoh says” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
EXO	5	10	mkom	figs-quotesinquotes	אֵינֶ֛⁠נִּי	1		This is the beginning of a second-level quotation that continues until the end of verse 11. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with an opening second-level quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the start of a quotation within a quotation. However, you could also translate this as an indirect quote. See UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
EXO	5	10	ad73	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	אֵינֶ֛⁠נִּי נֹתֵ֥ן לָ⁠כֶ֖ם תֶּֽבֶן	1		The structure of this phrase and the one that opens [the next verse](../05/11.md) create a strong contrast between what **I** (Pharaoh) and **you** (you all, the Israelites) will do. Translate this in a way that emphasizes, if possible, the contrast between “I” and “you.” Alternative translation: “It is not I who will give you straw.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
EXO	5	10	si2e	figs-metonymy	אֵינֶ֛⁠נִּי נֹתֵ֥ן לָ⁠כֶ֖ם תֶּֽבֶן	1		Pharaoh uses **I** to refer to his ownership and commands. Pharaoh does not physically give the Israelites straw. Rather, he had commanded his servants to take straw that belonged to Pharaoh and give it to the Israelites. Now he told his servants to stop providing straw. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “My servants will no longer give you my straw” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

By explicitly using a pronoun with a command, he is emphasizing who will go get straw. If possible, translate this in a way that emphasizes the contrast between “I” and “you.” See [[rc://en/tn/help/exo/05/10/7zfp]] for more info. Alternative translation: “Rather, it is you yourselves who must go get straw from wherever you might find it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
EXO	5	11	xe4i	figs-youdual	אַתֶּ֗ם	1	you can find…your workload	Here, **you** is plural and refers to the Israelite people. If your language uses different forms of “you” depending on the number of people addressed, use a plural form here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])

It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with closing first-level (and second-level if you made both levels direct quotes) quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the end of a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	5	12	s9dk	figs-hyperbole	בְּ⁠כָל־אֶ֣רֶץ מִצְרָ֑יִם	1	throughout all the land of Egypt	This is a generalization used to show the extra effort Israel made to meet Pharaoh’s demands. Alternate translation: “to many places throughout Egypt” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

EXO	5	18	z6wt	figs-youdual	לָ⁠כֶ֑ם…תִּתֵּֽנּוּ	1		Here, **you** means all the Israelites or the officers as representatives of all the Israelites. If your language uses different forms of “you” depending on the number of people addressed, use a plural form here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
EXO	5	19	x6pp	grammar-connect-logic-result	וַ⁠יִּרְא֞וּ שֹֽׁטְרֵ֧י בְנֵֽי־יִשְׂרָאֵ֛ל אֹתָ֖⁠ם בְּ⁠רָ֣ע לֵ⁠אמֹ֑ר לֹא־תִגְרְע֥וּ מִ⁠לִּבְנֵי⁠כֶ֖ם דְּבַר־י֥וֹם בְּ⁠יוֹמֽ⁠וֹ	1		You may need to reorder the events in this verse in your language to put the reason before the result. See UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
EXO	5	19	i3ot	figs-quotemarks	לֹא־תִגְרְע֥וּ מִ⁠לִּבְנֵי⁠כֶ֖ם דְּבַר־י֥וֹם בְּ⁠יוֹמֽ⁠וֹ	1		This is a direct quotation of what Pharaoh said. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by marking it with first-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation of another person’s speech. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	5	19	l9d2	figs-rpronouns	אֹתָ֖⁠ם	1	when they were told	Here the officers are both the subject and object, because they are thinking about their own situation. Different languages have different methods of marking this. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns]])
EXO	5	19	j6f9		וַ⁠יִּרְא֞וּ…אֹתָ֖⁠ם בְּ⁠רָ֣ע לֵ⁠אמֹ֑ר	1		Alternate translation: “knew that they were in trouble, because the king said” or “perceived themselves to be in danger, because the king said”
EXO	5	20	ve3z	writing-newevent	וַֽ⁠יִּפְגְּעוּ֙	1	palace	A new scene begins here, which may need to be marked in a certain way in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
EXO	5	20	s9d2	writing-pronouns	וַֽ⁠יִּפְגְּעוּ֙…לִ⁠קְרָאתָ֑⁠ם בְּ⁠צֵאתָ֖⁠ם	1		Here, **they** and **them** refer to the officers. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])

It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by marking it with first-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	5	21	kv0v		יֵ֧רֶא יְהוָ֛ה עֲלֵי⁠כֶ֖ם וְ⁠יִשְׁפֹּ֑ט	1		The Israelite officers used this form to curse Moses and Aaron.
EXO	5	21	vfit	figs-youdual	עֲלֵי⁠כֶ֖ם וְ⁠יִשְׁפֹּ֑ט	1		**You** refers to Moses and Aaron. If your language uses different forms of “you” depending on the number of people addressed, use a dual or plural form here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
EXO	5	21	j3zp	figs-metaphor	הִבְאַשְׁתֶּ֣ם אֶת־רֵיחֵ֗⁠נוּ בְּ⁠עֵינֵ֤י פַרְעֹה֙ וּ⁠בְ⁠עֵינֵ֣י עֲבָדָ֔י⁠ו	1	you have made us offensive	The Egyptians responded to the Israelites the same way they would respond to a foul odor. If your readers would not understand what this image means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “you have caused Pharaoh and his servants to hate us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EXO	5	21	d592	figs-metonymy	חֶ֥רֶב בְּ⁠יָדָ֖⁠ם	1	have put a sword in their hand to kill us	Here, **a sword into their hand** is a metonym for “a reason in their mind.” The Israelites are afraid that the Egyptians will feel that they are doing the right thing if they kill the Israelites, because Moses and Aaron are making demands to the king and because the Egyptians view the Israelites as lazy and dangerous. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “them a reason to think they would be right” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EXO	5	22	pm0l	figs-quotemarks	וַ⁠יֹּאמַ֑ר	1		After this phrase, a direct quote begins that continues to the end of the chapter. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with an opening first-level quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the beginning of a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	5	22	g4d5	figs-rquestion	לָ֥⁠מָּה זֶּ֖ה שְׁלַחְתָּֽ⁠נִי	1	Lord, why have you caused trouble for this people?	This question shows how disappointed Moses was that the Egyptians were treating the Israelites even more harshly now. He is expressing that he thinks God has caused the opposite of what he promised to happen. Alternate translation: “You sent me to rescue them.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
EXO	5	23	v2k2	figs-metonymy	בִּ⁠שְׁמֶ֔⁠ךָ	1	to speak to him in your name	Here, **in your name** indicates that Moses delivers Yahweh’s message. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “for you” or “your message for him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EXO	5	23	fzir	figs-idiom	וְ⁠הַצֵּ֥ל לֹא־הִצַּ֖לְתָּ	1		In Hebrew, **rescued** is repeated for emphasis. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent idiom or use plain language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EXO	5	23	ce6s	figs-quotemarks	עַמֶּֽ⁠ךָ	1		After this phrase, the direct quote of Moses that began in the [previous verse](../05/22.md) ends.

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	6	intro	we5k			0		# Exodus 06 General Notes<br><br>## Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter<br><br>### Repetition of events:<br><br>Most of the content of this chapter is very similar to the events and dialogue in chapters 3-4. For consistency, translators should consult the decisions they made there while keeping in mind that this narrative is not exactly the same. Also, verses 10-12 and verses 28-30 are very similar to each other. These events are probably a recommissioning of Moses. After his first encounter with Pharaoh went very poorly and the Israelites seem to reject God, reminds Moses of God’s promises and power.<br><br>### Referring to God<br><br>A name for God (**Yahweh**) and a title for God (**El Shaddai**) are mentioned in this chapter ([6:2](../06/02.md)\-[6:3](../06/03.md)). The precise meaning of El Shaddai is not known, but most scholars think it means something like “almighty.” Translators who have worked on Genesis may find confusing the statement that Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob did not know Yahweh as the name of God.<br><br>### Other possible translation difficulties:<br><br>With little explanation, a large portion of the chapter is devoted to the genealogy of Moses and Aaron. Some of the people in the genealogy lived much longer than is normal for humans today. If translators are not familiar with the lengths of people’s lives in the early days of the world (as recorded in Genesis, especially chapter 5), this may cause confusion.<br><br>## Study Concepts in this Chapter<br><br>### Promised Land<br><br>According to the covenant Yahweh made with Abraham, Egypt is not the home of the Hebrew people. Their home is the Promised Land in Canaan. The people are to return home to their land. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/covenant]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/promisedland]])<br><br>### “Let my people go”<br><br>This is a very important statement. Moses is not asking Pharaoh to “let go” of the Hebrew people. Instead, he is demanding that Pharaoh free the Hebrew people.<br><br>### God and his people<br><br>In verse 7, note mention of a very important biblical theme of God being “your God” and the special relationship that his people have with him.
EXO	6	1	ip5i	figs-quotemarks	עַתָּ֣ה תִרְאֶ֔ה אֲשֶׁ֥ר אֶֽעֱשֶׂ֖ה לְ⁠פַרְעֹ֑ה כִּ֣י בְ⁠יָ֤ד חֲזָקָה֙ יְשַׁלְּחֵ֔⁠ם וּ⁠בְ⁠יָ֣ד חֲזָקָ֔ה יְגָרְשֵׁ֖⁠ם מֵ⁠אַרְצֽ⁠וֹ	1		This is a direct quotation. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by marking it with first-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	6	1	lu95	grammar-connect-time-sequential	עַתָּ֣ה	1		This refers to future events starting very soon. Alternative translation: “Starting soon” or “Very soon” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
EXO	6	1	ece6	figs-metonymy	בְ⁠יָ֤ד חֲזָקָה֙…וּ⁠בְ⁠יָ֣ד חֲזָקָ֔ה	1	my strong hand	Here, **hand** is a metonym for power. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “by a strong power … and by a strong power” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EXO	6	1	utnn	figs-metonymy	בְ⁠יָ֤ד חֲזָקָה֙…וּ⁠בְ⁠יָ֣ד חֲזָקָ֔ה	1		It is not clear in the text whose **hand** is referred to here. The options include: (1) Both refer to God’s hand (forcing Pharaoh’s actions) (2) Both refer to Pharaoh’s hand (forcing the Israelites out) (3) They don’t refer to the same person’s hand; the first refers to God’s and the second to Pharaoh’s. The UST has followed (1), which is the most common interpretation. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: (1) “by my strong hand … and by my strong hand” (2) “by his strong hand … and by his strong hand” (3) “by my strong hand … and by his strong hand” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EXO	6	1	vdno	figs-parallelism	כִּ֣י בְ⁠יָ֤ד חֲזָקָה֙ יְשַׁלְּחֵ֔⁠ם וּ⁠בְ⁠יָ֣ד חֲזָקָ֔ה יְגָרְשֵׁ֖⁠ם מֵ⁠אַרְצֽ⁠וֹ	1		These two phrases mean similar things. God says the same thing twice, in similar ways, for emphasis. You do not need to repeat both phrases in your translation if that might be confusing for your readers. Instead, if it would be clearer in your language, you could combine them. Alternate translation: “I will force him to let my people leave the land” However, there is a slight difference in meaning, and you could also choose to bring that out in your translation. The second phrase intensifies the first by portraying Pharaoh as not merely letting the Israelites go, but as forcing them to leave the land. Alternate translation: “I will force him to let them go, in fact, I will force him to force them to leave his land” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
EXO	6	1	sdon		מֵ⁠אַרְצֽ⁠וֹ	1		Alternate translation: “from Egypt”
EXO	6	2	wse5	writing-newevent	וַ⁠יְדַבֵּ֥ר אֱלֹהִ֖ים אֶל־מֹשֶׁ֑ה וַ⁠יֹּ֥אמֶר אֵלָ֖י⁠ו	1		There is a transition here. Before this verse, Yahweh was answering Moses’ question more directly. At the beginning of this verse, Yahweh is reintroduced as “God” because he begins to make a clarifying statement about himself and his relationship with the Israelites and their ancestors as well as his plans for the Israelites. Much of this section repeats what Yahweh has already told Moses. You may want to consider a section break before this verse. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
EXO	6	2	kcty	figs-quotemarks	וַ⁠יְדַבֵּ֥ר אֱלֹהִ֖ים אֶל־מֹשֶׁ֑ה וַ⁠יֹּ֥אמֶר אֵלָ֖י⁠ו	1		After this phrase a direct quote begins that continues until the end of [verse 8](../06/08.md). It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with an opening first-level quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the beginning of a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	6	3	l81y	translate-transliterate	בְּ⁠אֵ֣ל שַׁדָּ֑י	1	I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob	**El Shaddai** is a title for God that many scholars think means “almighty.” You will need to decide if you will transliterate the term into your language or translate the meaning. Either approach has broad support. Alternative translation: “as the strongest God of all” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate]])
EXO	6	3	m27p	figs-activepassive	וּ⁠שְׁמִ֣⁠י יְהוָ֔ה לֹ֥א נוֹדַ֖עְתִּי לָ⁠הֶֽם	1	I was not known to them	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “but they did not know me by my name Yahweh” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
EXO	6	3	e36z		וּ⁠שְׁמִ֣⁠י יְהוָ֔ה לֹ֥א נוֹדַ֖עְתִּי לָ⁠הֶֽם	1		This statement is very difficult to understand as God’s name, Yahweh, is used throughout Genesis, including by Abraham and others. There are many theories about what it means; the view followed by the UST is that now God is revealing to the Israelites a fuller meaning of his divine name than what Abraham and others knew. Alternate translation: “but my name Yahweh was not understood by them”
EXO	6	4	zxvc	figs-quotations	לָ⁠תֵ֥ת לָ⁠הֶ֖ם אֶת־אֶ֣רֶץ כְּנָ֑עַן	1		This is the content of the covenant promise from God to his people. Some languages may need to make this part a direct quotation. To do so, begin a new sentence. Alternate translation: “I said, ‘I will give you the land of Canaan’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
EXO	6	4	gkkc	figs-parallelism	אֶ֥רֶץ מְגֻרֵי⁠הֶ֖ם אֲשֶׁר־גָּ֥רוּ בָֽ⁠הּ	1		These two phrases mean similar things. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine these phrases. Alternate translation: “the land they lived in as temporary residents”; otherwise, “the land that was not their home but where they lived as foreigners” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
EXO	6	5	l3yc		נַאֲקַת֙	1	groaning	Here, **groaning** means making sad sounds because of pain and suffering.
EXO	6	5	aiey		וָ⁠אֶזְכֹּ֖ר אֶת־בְּרִיתִֽ⁠י	1		**I have remembered my covenant** means God is going to take action. Alternative translation: “I will keep my promise”
EXO	6	6	rgh0	grammar-connect-logic-result	לָ⁠כֵ֞ן	1		God is now telling Moses to deliver a message to the Israelites of what God is going to do because of everything that he said in verses 2-5. The reason-result relationship is strongly marked here, so translations should make sure to use a connector that marks verse 6-8 as a result of verses 2-5. Alternate translation: “Because of this” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
EXO	6	6	yv14		לָ⁠כֵ֞ן אֱמֹ֥ר לִ⁠בְנֵֽי־יִשְׂרָאֵ֘ל	1	say to the Israelites	This is a command from Yahweh to Moses. Alternate translation: “So Yahweh told Moses to say to the Israelites”
EXO	6	6	yg2d	figs-quotemarks	אֲנִ֣י	1		This begins a second-level quotation that continues to the end of Yahweh’s speech at the close of [verse 8](../06/08.md). It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by marking it with second-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation within a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	6	6	we3z	figs-youdual	אֶתְ⁠כֶ֗ם…אֶתְ⁠כֶ֖ם…אֶתְ⁠כֶם֙	1		Here every occurrence of **you** refers to the Israelites. If your language uses different forms of “you” depending on the number of people addressed, use a plural form here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
EXO	6	6	oqnw	figs-synecdoche	מִ⁠תַּ֨חַת֙ סִבְלֹ֣ת מִצְרַ֔יִם	1		This refers to all the hard work the Egyptians made the Israelites do. Alternate translation: “from the hard work the Egyptians force you to do” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
EXO	6	6	xyn4	figs-metaphor	בִּ⁠זְר֣וֹעַ נְטוּיָ֔ה	1		Here, **arm** is a figurative way of referring to Yahweh’s power, influence, and capacity for action. **Outstretched** means that he is using that power. If your readers would not understand what this image means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “by my great strength” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EXO	6	6	efx1		וּ⁠בִ⁠שְׁפָטִ֖ים	1		Here, the term **judgments** refers to the plagues that God is about to send to harm Egypt and the Egyptians. Each plague is a response to Pharaoh’s stubbornness. Alternate translation: “and by [greatly] harming the Egyptians”
EXO	6	7	o3lb	figs-youdual	אֶתְ⁠כֶ֥ם…לָ⁠כֶ֖ם…וִֽ⁠ידַעְתֶּ֗ם…אֱלֹ֣הֵי⁠כֶ֔ם…אֶתְ⁠כֶ֔ם	1		Here every occurrence of **you** refers to the Israelites. If your language uses different forms of “you” depending on the number of people addressed, use a plural form here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
EXO	6	7	xsdh	figs-synecdoche	מִ⁠תַּ֖חַת סִבְל֥וֹת מִצְרָֽיִם	1		This refers to all the hard work the Egyptians forced upon the Israelites. See what you did in the previous verse at [[rc://en/tn/help/exo/06/07/oqnw]]. Alternate translation: “from the hard work the Egyptians force you to do” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
EXO	6	8	h9ho	figs-youdual	אֶתְ⁠כֶם֙…לָ⁠כֶ֛ם	1		Here every occurrence of **you** refers to the Israelites. If your language uses different forms of “you” depending on the number of people addressed, use a plural form here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
EXO	6	8	g9ru	translate-symaction	נָשָׂ֨אתִי֙ אֶת־יָדִ֔⁠י	1	I swore	This is an action that signifies making an oath. Raising the hand may not have the same meaning in your culture, so you may need to use a different symbolic oath-taking action in your translation or simply translate the meaning. Alternate translation: “I promised” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
EXO	6	8	i3vj		מוֹרָשָׁ֖ה	1		This means the Israelites will own the land. Alternate translation: “as your own land”
EXO	6	8	ipnm	figs-quotemarks	אֲנִ֥י יְהוָֽה	1		After this phrase, the direct quote of Yahweh ends. Both the first-level and second-level quotes end. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with a closing first-level and second-level quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the end of a quotation and a quotation within a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	6	9	aalj	grammar-connect-logic-result	וְ⁠לֹ֤א שָֽׁמְעוּ֙ אֶל־מֹשֶׁ֔ה מִ⁠קֹּ֣צֶר ר֔וּחַ וּ⁠מֵ⁠עֲבֹדָ֖ה קָשָֽׁה	1		In some languages it will be necessary to put the reason for the people not listening before the result. Alternate translation: “but because of shortness of spirit and because of hard service, they did not listen to Moses” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
EXO	6	9	eph2		מִ⁠קֹּ֣צֶר ר֔וּחַ	1		Here, the people’s **spirit** is spoken of as something that could be measured. By calling it “short,” the author is saying they did not have very much motivation or hope. Alternate translation: “because they had no hope”
EXO	6	10	tpw4		לֵּ⁠אמֹֽר	1		This is used to mark the beginning of a direct quotation. It can be omitted if it is unnatural.
EXO	6	11	pi7a	figs-quotemarks	בֹּ֣א דַבֵּ֔ר אֶל־פַּרְעֹ֖ה מֶ֣לֶךְ מִצְרָ֑יִם וִֽ⁠ישַׁלַּ֥ח אֶת־בְּנֵֽי־יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל מֵ⁠אַרְצֽ⁠וֹ	1		This is a direct quotation. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by marking it with first-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	6	11	fxf2	figs-quotations	וִֽ⁠ישַׁלַּ֥ח אֶת־בְּנֵֽי־יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל מֵ⁠אַרְצֽ⁠וֹ	1		This is an indirect quote; in some languages you will have to make it a direct quote. Be careful to change the third-person pronouns to second-person pronouns if you do this. Alternate translation: “saying, ‘You must let the sons of Israel go from your land’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
EXO	6	12	rsag	figs-quotemarks	הֵ֤ן בְּנֵֽי־יִשְׂרָאֵל֙ לֹֽא־שָׁמְע֣וּ אֵלַ֔⁠י וְ⁠אֵיךְ֙ יִשְׁמָעֵ֣⁠נִי פַרְעֹ֔ה וַ⁠אֲנִ֖י עֲרַ֥ל שְׂפָתָֽיִם	1		This is a direct quotation. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by marking it with first-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	6	12	h7o0	figs-metonymy	לִ⁠פְנֵ֥י יְהוָ֖ה	1		Here, **face** figuratively represents the presence of a person. There may also be a hint of impudence in Moses’ attitude that is conveyed by the words **before the face of Yahweh**. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “in the presence of Yahweh” or “boldly to Yahweh” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EXO	6	12	iiui		הֵ֤ן	1		**Behold** is a term meant to focus the attention of the listener on what the speaker is about to say. If there is not a good way to translate this term in your language, this term can be omitted from the translation, or you can use an alternate translation like “as you know.”
EXO	6	12	k7hl	figs-rquestion	הֵ֤ן בְּנֵֽי־יִשְׂרָאֵל֙ לֹֽא־שָׁמְע֣וּ אֵלַ֔⁠י וְ⁠אֵיךְ֙ יִשְׁמָעֵ֣⁠נִי פַרְעֹ֔ה	1	If the Israelites have not listened to me, why will Pharaoh listen to me, since I am not good at speaking?	Moses asked this question in hopes that God would change his mind about using Moses. This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: “Since the Israelites did not listen to me, neither will Pharaoh!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
EXO	6	12	lj51	grammar-connect-logic-result	הֵ֤ן בְּנֵֽי־יִשְׂרָאֵל֙ לֹֽא־שָׁמְע֣וּ אֵלַ֔⁠י וְ⁠אֵיךְ֙ יִשְׁמָעֵ֣⁠נִי פַרְעֹ֔ה	1		Moses is presenting a reasoned argument: since this, then probably that. Use a natural way of expressing such arguments in your language. Alternate translation: “Since the sons of Israel have not listened to me, why would you think Pharaoh would listen to me?” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
EXO	6	12	k3br	figs-metaphor	וַ⁠אֲנִ֖י עֲרַ֥ל שְׂפָתָֽיִם	1		This is a metaphor that means that Moses was not a good speaker. It is somewhat crude; your translation of this phrase could convey that Moses spoke impolitely. If your readers would not understand what this image means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “And I do not speak well” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EXO	6	13	janr		וַ⁠יְצַוֵּ⁠ם֙ אֶל־בְּנֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל וְ⁠אֶל־פַּרְעֹ֖ה	1		This phrase is somewhat difficult to translate. Here, **command** could also be translated as “charge” or “commission.” Another difficulty is knowing to whom the command is directed: is it to Moses and Aaron or are they to give the command to Pharaoh and the Israelites; thus **to** could be translated as “for” or “regarding.” Alternate translations: “and he charged them regarding the sons of Israel and regarding Pharaoh” or “and he gave them a command for the sons of Israel and for Pharaoh” or “and he gave them a commission to the sons of Israel and to Pharaoh”
EXO	6	14	hh3z	writing-background		0		Verses 14-27 are background information. Use the natural form in your language for expressing background information. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
EXO	6	14	h195	figs-metonymy	רָאשֵׁ֣י	1	the heads of their fathers’ houses	Here, **heads** refers to the original ancestors of the clan. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “the ancestors of ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

EXO	6	25	fck8	figs-metonymy	רָאשֵׁ֛י	1	These were the heads of the fathers’ houses	Here, **heads** represents family leaders. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “These were the leaders of the families” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EXO	6	26	dqm8	figs-quotemarks	הוֹצִ֜יאוּ אֶת־בְּנֵ֧י יִשְׂרָאֵ֛ל מֵ⁠אֶ֥רֶץ מִצְרַ֖יִם עַל־צִבְאֹתָֽ⁠ם	1		This is a direct quotation of what Yahweh said earlier. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by marking it with first-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation of a previous remark. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	6	26	ft6y	translate-unknown	עַל־צִבְאֹתָֽ⁠ם	1	by their groups of fighting men	The term **hosts** refers to a large group of people often organized into groups for war. Alternate translation: “by their groups” or “by their divisions” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
EXO	6	27	o7xp	grammar-connect-logic-goal	לְ⁠הוֹצִ֥יא	1		This expresses their goal when they spoke to Pharaoh. See UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
EXO	6	28	xssl	writing-newevent	וַ⁠יְהִ֗י בְּ⁠י֨וֹם	1		This marks a transition from the record of the genealogy back to the narrative. Consider placing a section break at the start of this verse. Alternate translation: “One day” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
EXO	6	29	i50m	figs-quotemarks	לֵּ⁠אמֹ֖ר	1		Here, **saying** is used to mark the beginning of a direct quotation. It can be omitted if unnatural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])

It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by marking it with first-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	6	30	zyqs	figs-metonymy	לִ⁠פְנֵ֣י יְהוָ֑ה	1		Here, **face** figuratively represents the presence of a person. There may also be a hint of impudence in Moses’ attitude that is conveyed by saying he spoke before **the face of Yahweh**. See how you translated this in [6:12](../06/12.md). If your readers might misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “in the presence of Yahweh” or “boldly to Yahweh” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EXO	6	30	nf3w	figs-rquestion	הֵ֤ן אֲנִי֙ עֲרַ֣ל שְׂפָתַ֔יִם וְ⁠אֵ֕יךְ יִשְׁמַ֥ע אֵלַ֖⁠י פַּרְעֹֽה	1	I am not good…why will Pharaoh listen to me?	Moses asks this question hoping to change God’s mind about sending him. This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: “Behold, I am not a good speaker. Pharaoh will certainly not listen to me!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
EXO	6	30	qvxf	figs-quotemarks	הֵ֤ן אֲנִי֙ עֲרַ֣ל שְׂפָתַ֔יִם וְ⁠אֵ֕יךְ יִשְׁמַ֥ע אֵלַ֖⁠י פַּרְעֹֽה	1		This is a direct quotation. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by marking it with first-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	6	30	y4g2		הֵ֤ן	1		**Behold** is a term meant to focus the attention of the listener on what the speaker is about to say. If there is not a good way to translate this term in your language, this term can be omitted from the translation, or you can use an alternate translation like “as you know.”
EXO	6	30	vzhq	figs-metaphor	אֲנִי֙ עֲרַ֣ל שְׂפָתַ֔יִם	1		This is a metaphor that means that Moses thought he was not a good speaker. It is somewhat crude, and your translation of this phrase could convey that Moses spoke impolitely. See how you translated this in [6:12](../06/12.md). Alternate translation: “I always fail to speak well” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EXO	7	intro	r9we			0		# Exodus 07 General Notes<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Miracles<br><br>When Yahweh had Moses perform miracles, Pharaoh’s men were able to copy these miracles. It is unknown how they were able to do this, but since it was not from Yahweh, they were probably done under some evil power. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/miracle]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/evil]])<br><br>### Pharaoh’s hard heart<br><br>Pharaoh’s heart is often described as hard, strong, or heavy in this chapter. This means that his heart was not open or willing to understand Yahweh’s instructions.<br><br>### “Let my people go”<br><br>This is a very important statement. Moses is not asking Pharaoh to “let go” of the Hebrew people. Instead, he is demanding that Pharaoh free the Hebrew people.<br><br>## Possible translation difficulties in this chapter include:<br><br>- Moses as God to Pharaoh<br>- A number of difficult terms: prophet, signs, wonders, miracles, sorcerers, magicians, magic, judgments, canals, reservoirs<br>- The use of “heart” to refer to the seat of will and emotion<br>- Up to third-level quotations<br><br>
EXO	7	1	r18p	figs-quotemarks	מֹשֶׁ֔ה	1		After this phrase, a direct quote begins that continues to the end of [verse 5](../07/05.md). It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with an opening first-level quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the beginning of a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	7	1	gy1t		רְאֵ֛ה	1		This is used to draw attention to surprising information that follows. Alternative translation: “Listen carefully”
EXO	7	1	dn1s	figs-metaphor	נְתַתִּ֥י⁠ךָ אֱלֹהִ֖ים לְ⁠פַרְעֹ֑ה	1	I have made you like a god	This means Moses would represent the same authority to Pharaoh as God did to Moses. See how you translated the very similar phrase in [Exodus 4:16](../04/16.md). Alternate translation: “I will cause Pharaoh to consider you as a god” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EXO	7	1	z163	figs-metaphor	וְ⁠אַהֲרֹ֥ן אָחִ֖י⁠ךָ יִהְיֶ֥ה נְבִיאֶֽ⁠ךָ	1		This phrase compares Aaron to a prophet because he will be the one actually to proclaim to Pharaoh what Moses tells him. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Exodus 4:16](../04/16.md). Alternate translation: “and Aaron your brother will act like your prophet” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EXO	7	2	l44v	translate-kinship	אָחִ֨י⁠ךָ֙	1		Aaron is older than Moses. If your language uses a different term for the sibling relationship based on gender and age order, choose the appropriate one. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship]])
EXO	7	2	hdwo	figs-quotations	וְ⁠שִׁלַּ֥ח אֶת־בְּנֵֽי־יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל מֵ⁠אַרְצֽ⁠וֹ	1		Some languages may need to make this a direct quote. If so, be sure to mark it as a second-level quotation, subordinate to Yahweh’s main speech. Alternative translation: “saying, ‘You must let the sons of Israel go from your land’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
EXO	7	2	p9p7		מֵ⁠אַרְצֽ⁠וֹ	1		Alternate translation: “Egypt”
EXO	7	3	adsq	figs-metaphor	אַקְשֶׁ֖ה אֶת־לֵ֣ב פַּרְעֹ֑ה	1		This means God will make him stubborn. His stubborn attitude is spoken of as if his **heart** were **hard**. If the **heart** is not the body part your culture uses to refer to a person’s will, consider using whichever organ your culture would use for this image. See how you translated this in [Exodus 4:21](../04/21.md), but note the slightly different metaphor there: the heart being strong vs. **hard** here. Alternate translation: “will cause Pharaoh to be stubborn” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EXO	7	3	vtt1	figs-doublet	אֶת־אֹתֹתַ֛⁠י וְ⁠אֶת־מוֹפְתַ֖⁠י	1	many signs…many wonders	The words **signs** and **wonders** mean basically the same thing. God uses them to emphasize the greatness of what he will do in Egypt. If your language does not use repetition in this way, you could combine them.(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
EXO	7	4	ar0l	figs-youdual	אֲלֵ⁠כֶם֙	1		Here, **you** means Moses and Aaron. If your language uses different forms of “you” depending on the number of people addressed, use a dual form (if you have one) or plural form (if not) here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
EXO	7	4	e2kv	figs-metonymy	יָדִ֖⁠י	1	put my hand on	The words **my hand** represent God’s great power. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “my power” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EXO	7	4	b6h8	figs-metonymy	בְּ⁠מִצְרָ֑יִם	1		Here, **on Egypt** refers to the land and everything in it, including people, animals, and plants. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EXO	7	4	nilu		אֶת־צִבְאֹתַ֜⁠י אֶת־עַמִּ֤⁠י בְנֵֽי־יִשְׂרָאֵל֙	1		These phrases refer to the Israelites in three different ways; they do not refer to three different groups of people. **Armies** is the same word translated “hosts” in [Exodus 6:26](../06/26.md). Alternate translation: “the armies of my Israelite people”
EXO	7	5	cg3n	grammar-connect-logic-result	וְ⁠יָדְע֤וּ מִצְרַ֨יִם֙ כִּֽי־אֲנִ֣י יְהוָ֔ה	1		This is the result of God rescuing the Israelites. In some languages the result will have to be placed after the cause, as in the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
EXO	7	5	npd6	figs-metonymy	בִּ⁠נְטֹתִ֥⁠י אֶת־יָדִ֖⁠י עַל	1	reach out with my hand on	This phrase represents God’s great power. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “when I show my powerful acts against” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EXO	7	5	dguc	grammar-connect-logic-goal	וְ⁠הוֹצֵאתִ֥י אֶת־בְּנֵֽי־יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל מִ⁠תּוֹכָֽ⁠ם	1		The goal of God’s powerful acts was to rescue the Israelites. Alternate translation: “so that I bring the sons of Israel out from their midst” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
EXO	7	5	d1hq	figs-quotemarks	מִ⁠תּוֹכָֽ⁠ם	1		At the end of this verse, the direct quote that began in [verse 1](../07/01.md) ends. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with a closing first-level quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the end of a quotation. Note that the UST is reordered. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	7	6	iii5	figs-parallelism	וַ⁠יַּ֥עַשׂ…עָשֽׂוּ	1		This repetition emphasizes the statement. Some languages can use repetition for emphasis; others will need to use another way of expressing emphasis. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
EXO	7	7	liir	writing-background		0		This verse contains background information. Use the natural form in your language for expressing background information. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
EXO	7	7	g7i5	translate-numbers	שְׁמֹנִ֣ים…שָׁלֹ֥שׁ וּ⁠שְׁמֹנִ֖ים	1	Aaron eighty-three years old	Alternate translation: “eighty … eighty-three” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])
EXO	7	7	zoou	figs-idiom	בֶּן־שְׁמֹנִ֣ים שָׁנָ֔ה…בֶּן־שָׁלֹ֥שׁ וּ⁠שְׁמֹנִ֖ים שָׁנָ֑ה	1		This is an idiom that refers to their age. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent idiom or use plain language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EXO	7	8	pwph	writing-newevent	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר יְהוָ֔ה	1		This verse marks the beginning of new sections, both major and minor. The major story of the plagues and Exodus itself unfolds from here until after Pharaoh’s army is defeated at the Red Sea. The next minor event is the miracle of the rods becoming snakes. Either by using particular forms that your language uses to mark transitions or by making a section break and heading, this transition should be marked for readers. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
EXO	7	8	p2kf		לֵ⁠אמֹֽר	1		Here, **saying** marks the beginning of a direct quote and is often omitted in translation when such a construction is unnatural in the target language. See UST.
EXO	7	9	b0jl	figs-quotemarks	כִּי֩ יְדַבֵּ֨ר אֲלֵ⁠כֶ֤ם פַּרְעֹה֙ לֵ⁠אמֹ֔ר תְּנ֥וּ לָ⁠כֶ֖ם מוֹפֵ֑ת וְ⁠אָמַרְתָּ֣ אֶֽל־אַהֲרֹ֗ן קַ֧ח אֶֽת־מַטְּ⁠ךָ֛ וְ⁠הַשְׁלֵ֥ךְ לִ⁠פְנֵֽי־פַרְעֹ֖ה יְהִ֥י לְ⁠תַנִּֽין	1		This is a direct quotation. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by marking it with first-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	7	9	jt9z	figs-quotations	כִּי֩ יְדַבֵּ֨ר אֲלֵ⁠כֶ֤ם פַּרְעֹה֙ לֵ⁠אמֹ֔ר תְּנ֥וּ לָ⁠כֶ֖ם מוֹפֵ֑ת וְ⁠אָמַרְתָּ֣ אֶֽל־אַהֲרֹ֗ן קַ֧ח אֶֽת־מַטְּ⁠ךָ֛ וְ⁠הַשְׁלֵ֥ךְ לִ⁠פְנֵֽי־פַרְעֹ֖ה יְהִ֥י לְ⁠תַנִּֽין	1	When Pharaoh says to you, ‘Do a miracle,’ then you will say to Aaron, ‘Take your staff and throw it down before Pharaoh, so that it may become a snake.’	The two quotations in this verse could be stated as indirect quotes. Alternate translation: “When Pharaoh tells you to do a miracle, then you will tell Aaron to take his staff and throw it down before Pharaoh so that it may become a snake” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
EXO	7	9	ye9j	figs-quotemarks	תְּנ֥וּ לָ⁠כֶ֖ם מוֹפֵ֑ת	1		This is a second-level direct quotation. If you did not decide to make it an indirect quotation, it may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by marking it with second-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation within a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	7	9	r0tp	figs-quotemarks	קַ֧ח אֶֽת־מַטְּ⁠ךָ֛ וְ⁠הַשְׁלֵ֥ךְ לִ⁠פְנֵֽי־פַרְעֹ֖ה יְהִ֥י לְ⁠תַנִּֽין	1		This is a second-level direct quotation. The second level may end after **Pharaoh.** If you did not decide to make it an indirect quotation, it may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by marking it with second-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation within a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	7	9	p3xh		לֵ⁠אמֹ֔ר	1		Here, **saying** marks the beginning of a direct quote and is often omitted in translation when such a construction is unnatural in the target language. See UST.
EXO	7	9	ms5o	figs-youdual	אֲלֵ⁠כֶ֤ם…לָ⁠כֶ֖ם	1		These are plural, referring to Moses and Aaron. If your language uses different forms of “you” depending on the number of people addressed, use a dual form (if you have one) or plural form (if not) here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
EXO	7	9	kj8g	figs-quotesinquotes	תְּנ֥וּ לָ⁠כֶ֖ם מוֹפֵ֑ת	1		This is a second-level quotation. It should be marked in some manner that distinguishes it from the outer level. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
EXO	7	9	s5a9	figs-quotesinquotes	קַ֧ח אֶֽת־מַטְּ⁠ךָ֛ וְ⁠הַשְׁלֵ֥ךְ לִ⁠פְנֵֽי־פַרְעֹ֖ה יְהִ֥י לְ⁠תַנִּֽין	1		This is a second-level quotation. It should be marked in some manner that distinguishes it from the outer level. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
EXO	7	9	ogk9	figs-metonymy	לִ⁠פְנֵֽי־פַרְעֹ֖ה	1		Although **before the face of** still has the standard figurative meaning of “in the presence of,” it is a much more literal use here. Moses and Aaron are to actually do the miracles in front of Pharaoh so that Pharaoh can see them. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternative translation: “so Pharaoh can see it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EXO	7	10	ehm9	figs-metonymy	לִ⁠פְנֵ֥י פַרְעֹ֛ה וְ⁠לִ⁠פְנֵ֥י עֲבָדָ֖י⁠ו	1		This time, while **before the face of** still has the standard figurative meaning of “in the presence of,” it is a much more literal use here. Aaron actually does this right in front of Pharaoh and his servants so they could watch what happens. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternative translation: “where Pharaoh and his servants could see it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EXO	7	10	kv93		עֲבָדָ֖י⁠ו	1		**His servants** probably refers to important advisors that would be in the king’s court and does not refer common servants.
EXO	7	11	mqde		לַֽ⁠חֲכָמִ֖ים וְ⁠לַֽ⁠מְכַשְּׁפִ֑ים…חַרְטֻמֵּ֥י	1		Here, **magicians** probably describes both **wise men and sorcerers** rather than being a third group. See translationWords articles for each term.
EXO	7	12	u6np		וַ⁠יִּבְלַ֥ע	1	swallowed up	Alternate translation: “ate up” or “devoured”
EXO	7	12	m0kw	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	וַ⁠יִּבְלַ֥ע מַטֵּֽה־אַהֲרֹ֖ן אֶת־מַטֹּתָֽ⁠ם	1		This is a surprising and amusing twist which was not what the magicians expected. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
EXO	7	12	prnp	figs-personification	מַטֵּֽה…מַטֹּתָֽ⁠ם	1		It may be necessary in some languages to translate the word **staff** as “snake,” since it had turned into one. This may be true if it would not make sense in the target language to say (because it is not living) that a staff swallowed or ate something. It may also may not make sense in some languages to speak of the snakes as staffs once they have been transformed. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
EXO	7	13	g42f	figs-metaphor	וַ⁠יֶּחֱזַק֙ לֵ֣ב פַּרְעֹ֔ה	1	Pharaoh’s heart was hardened	Pharaoh’s stubborn attitude is spoken of as if his **heart** were **strong**. If the **heart** is not the body part your culture uses to refer to a person’s will, consider using whichever organ your culture would use for this image. See how you translated this in [Exodus 4:21](../04/21.md), but note that this is a neutral statement (it does not say that anyone caused him to be stubborn, as many others in this part of the narrative do). Alternate translation: “Pharaoh was still defiant” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EXO	7	13	wekf		כַּ⁠אֲשֶׁ֖ר דִּבֶּ֥ר יְהוָֽה	1		Because Yahweh’s prediction precedes this event, some languages may need to place the reference to that prediction before the statement that it was fulfilled. See UST.
EXO	7	14	d27r	figs-metaphor	כָּבֵ֖ד לֵ֣ב פַּרְעֹ֑ה	1	Pharaoh’s heart is hard	Yahweh speaks of Pharaoh’s stubborn attitude as if Pharaoh’s **heart** were **heavy**. If the **heart** is not the body part your culture uses to refer to a person’s will, consider using whichever organ your culture would use for this image. This is a neutral statement (it does not say that anyone caused him to be stubborn as many others in this part of the narrative do). See how you translated this in [Exodus 7:13](../07/13.md), but note the slightly different metaphor there: the heart being strong vs **heavy** here. Alternate translation: “Pharaoh is defiant” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EXO	7	14	qiyx	writing-newevent	וַ⁠יֹּ֤אמֶר	1		A new scene begins here, which may need to be marked in a certain way in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
EXO	7	14	t79b	figs-quotemarks	מֹשֶׁ֔ה	1		After this phrase, a direct quote begins that continues to the end of [verse 18](../07/18.md).

If the **heart** is not the body part your culture uses to refer to a person’s will, consider using whichever organ your culture would use for this image. This is a neutral statement (it does not say that anyone caused him to be stubborn as many others in this part of the narrative do). See how you translated this in [Exodus 7:13](../07/13.md). Alternate translation: “Pharaoh was still defiant” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EXO	7	22	sbic		כַּ⁠אֲשֶׁ֖ר דִּבֶּ֥ר יְהוָֽה	1		Because Yahweh’s prediction precedes this event, some languages may need to place the reference to that prediction before the statement that it was fulfilled. See UST and how you handled this in [7:13](../07/13.md) where the same sentence appears.

The narrative will then record whoever will raise his hand and/or staff. The instruction and the action do not always match exactly. God may say raise your hand, and the narrative may say Moses raised his staff. These are not conflicting reports. Translators should understand that the hand and the staff are always understood together. They are one unit, and they can both be mentioned, or they can be mentioned separately. In each case, Moses or Aaron raises his hand with the staff in it. This fact is merely expressed differently.<br><br><br>## Special Concepts in this Chapter<br><br>### Pharaoh’s hard heart<br><br>Pharaoh’s heart is often described as hard in this chapter. This means that his heart was not open or willing to understand Yahweh’s instructions. When his heart was hardened, it became less and less receptive to Yahweh.<br><br>### Let my people go<br><br>This is a very important statement. Moses does not ask Pharaoh for permission to “let go” of the Hebrew people. Instead, he is demanding that Pharaoh free the Hebrew people.

You should translate the list in such a way that the frogs’ location is not limited to these specific places. The list should imply universality. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])

EXO	8	6	drmg	figs-explicit	וַ⁠תַּ֨עַל֙	1		[Verse 3](../08/03.md) has specified from where the frogs will come. Here it is implied, but you may make it explicit as in the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EXO	8	6	rxze	grammar-collectivenouns	הַ⁠צְּפַרְדֵּ֔עַ	1		There were so many frogs that the text uses the collective singular. If that does not make sense in your language, you may simply use the plural as in the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns]])

The image is like that of a blanket smothering the entire country. (Or more directly, like one giant, nation-sized frog sitting on top of the entire land).

It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by marking it with first-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. However, it may be helpful to translate one of the parts as an indirect quotation so that you do not have to have two levels of quotations here. Alternate translation: see UST or “[And Yahweh told Moses] to tell Aaron” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
EXO	8	16	xh9e	figs-quotemarks	נְטֵ֣ה אֶֽת־מַטְּ⁠ךָ֔ וְ⁠הַ֖ךְ אֶת־עֲפַ֣ר הָ⁠אָ֑רֶץ וְ⁠הָיָ֥ה לְ⁠כִנִּ֖ם בְּ⁠כָל־אֶ֥רֶץ מִצְרָֽיִם	1		This is a second-level direct quotation (unless you translated one portion as an indirect quotation).

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	8	16	joxz		נְטֵ֣ה אֶֽת־מַטְּ⁠ךָ֔ וְ⁠הַ֖ךְ	1		This is one action or motion, but it is described with the two verbs that occur throughout this section of plague judgment.
EXO	8	16	kpr5		מַטְּ⁠ךָ֔	1		This is Aaron’s staff. See note in the [introduction to chapter 8](../08/intro.md) regarding the hand and staff.
EXO	8	16	w5el	translate-unknown	לְ⁠כִנִּ֖ם	1		We do not know exactly what this word means. It is probably a tiny (as in dust-particle size) biting insect. You should choose a different insect here than in the next plague ([8:21](../08/21.md)-8:31). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

EXO	8	19	z1w2	figs-metaphor	וַ⁠יֶּחֱזַ֤ק לֵב־פַּרְעֹה֙	1	Pharaoh’s heart was hardened	Pharaoh’s stubborn attitude is spoken of as if his **heart** were **strong**. If the **heart** is not the body part your culture uses to refer to a person’s will, consider using whichever organ your culture would use for this image. See how you translated this in [Exodus 7:13](../07/13.md). This is a neutral statement (it does not say that anyone caused him to be stubborn as many others in this part of the narrative do). Alternate translation: “Pharaoh was still defiant” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EXO	8	19	rp3i	writing-pronouns	אֲלֵ⁠הֶ֔ם	1		It is possible that **them** refers to the magicians here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])

EXO	8	20	vnym		הִנֵּ֖ה	1		This is used to draw attention to important information that is next. In some languages and translation styles it will make the most sense to omit this, as in the UST. Alternate translation: “Listen carefully”
EXO	8	20	uypa	figs-quotations	כֹּ֚ה אָמַ֣ר יְהוָ֔ה	1		This phrase opens a direct quote which continues until the end of [verse 23](../08/23.md). It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with an opening first-level quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the beginning of a quotation. However, you may also consider making the opening portion an indirect quote so that you do not have a quote inside of a quote for the next verses. Alternate translation: “that Yahweh says” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
EXO	8	20	eqd2		כֹּ֚ה אָמַ֣ר יְהוָ֔ה	1	Let my people go	This quotation form is used to introduce commands from Yahweh. See [4:intro](../04/intro.md) for more information.

You should translate the list in such a way that the flies’ location is not limited to these specific places but is understood to imply universality. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
EXO	8	22	mv8w	grammar-connect-logic-result	לְ⁠בִלְתִּ֥י הֱיֽוֹת־שָׁ֖ם עָרֹ֑ב	1	General Information:	This is the result of Yahweh treating the land of Goshen differently. Alternate translation: “by keeping the swarm from there” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])

EXO	8	23	oxr5	figs-abstractnouns	פְדֻ֔ת	1		This is a noun derived from a verb meaning “to buy back.” Very broadly it can mean “to save or rescue.” See the next note regarding textual variants for more information. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
EXO	8	23	tf4j	translate-textvariants	פְדֻ֔ת	1		Many translations follow the Septuagint here, which uses the word “division.” A minor change to the Hebrew would also produce the word translated “treat differently” in the [previous verse](../08/22.md). Alternate translation: “a division” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
EXO	8	23	u4gs		עַמִּ֖⁠י	1		Yahweh’s people, that is, the Israelites. Alternate translation: “the Israelites”

It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with closing first-level, second-level, and third-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the end of quotations. You may not have three levels if you made any level an indirect quote. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	8	24	gw3c	figs-explicit	וַ⁠יַּ֤עַשׂ יְהוָה֙ כֵּ֔ן	1		The UST supplies a brief sentence filling in the gap between Yahweh’s command to Moses and the onset of the plague.

EXO	8	24	nd6e	figs-activepassive	תִּשָּׁחֵ֥ת הָ⁠אָ֖רֶץ מִ⁠פְּנֵ֥י הֶ⁠עָרֹֽב	1	the land was ruined because of the swarms of flies	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “The swarms of flies devastated the land” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
EXO	8	24	ngue	figs-metonymy	מִ⁠פְּנֵ֥י הֶ⁠עָרֹֽב	1		Here, **face** figuratively represents the presence of the insects. Alternate translation: “because the insects were everywhere” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EXO	8	25	e7l0	grammar-connect-time-simultaneous	וַ⁠יִּקְרָ֣א	1		This happened during the plague. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous]])

The same term is used in Genesis 43:32 and 46:34 to describe the Egyptians’ feelings about eating with Hebrews and about the Hebrew profession of shepherding, respectively. Translators should attempt to convey the strong negative feelings that would be provoked in the Egyptians without speculating as to the cause.

Alternate translation: “in their sight” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EXO	8	27	ju3u	figs-exclusive	נֵלֵ֖ךְ…וְ⁠זָבַ֨חְנוּ֙…אֱלֹהֵ֔י⁠נוּ…אֵלֵֽי⁠נוּ	1		Here, **we, our,** and **us** should all be translated as exclusive (if your language makes that distinction). Pharaoh and his people are not included. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

EXO	8	28	hnud	figs-idiom	הַרְחֵ֥ק…תַרְחִ֖יקוּ	1		In Hebrew, **far** is repeated to emphasize (with **not**) that they are absolutely not to go too far. If your language does not use repeating words like this, express the emphasis in another way. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

EXO	8	29	yvcl	figs-123person	מִ⁠פַּרְעֹ֛ה…פַּרְעֹה֙	1		Moses may be using the third person to refer to Pharaoh to show respect, because the king appears to be relenting. If use of the third person is not a way of showing respect in your culture or is not a valid way of addressing an individual at all, you may need to change the form. Alternate translation: “from you … you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

It is presented in this way for rhetorical effect, that is, to convince Pharaoh of how bad this plague will be so he will obey. You should translate the list in such a way that it is not limiting but is understood to imply universality. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])

EXO	9	5	w8gk		לֵ⁠אמֹ֑ר	1		This marks the beginning of a direct quotation. It can be omitted in translation if your language does not use a similar form. However, in this sentence it is the only verb related to speech, so you may need to translate it similarly to the way the UST does.<br>.

EXO	9	7	j51j	figs-metaphor	וַ⁠יִּכְבַּד֙ לֵ֣ב פַּרְעֹ֔ה	1	his heart was stubborn	Pharaoh’s stubborn attitude is spoken of as if his **heart** were **heavy**. If the **heart** is not the body part your culture uses to refer to a person’s will, consider using whichever organ your culture would use for this image. This is a neutral statement (it does not say that anyone caused him to be stubborn as many others in this part of the narrative do). See how you translated this in [Exodus 7:14](../07/14.md). Alternate translation: “But Pharaoh was defiant” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EXO	9	8	brm6	writing-newevent	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר יְהוָה֮	1	kiln	A new scene begins here. Use the natural form in your language for introducing a new event. This is the start of the sixth plague scene. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])

EXO	9	12	p5m5	figs-metaphor	וַ⁠יְחַזֵּ֤ק יְהוָה֙ אֶת־לֵ֣ב פַּרְעֹ֔ה	1	Yahweh hardened Pharaoh’s heart	This means God made him stubborn. His stubborn attitude is spoken of as if his **heart** was **strong**. If the **heart** is not the body part your culture uses to refer to a person’s will, consider using whichever organ your culture would use for this image. See how you translated this in [4:21](../04/21.md). Alternate translation: “But Yahweh caused Pharaoh to be stubborn” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with an opening second-level quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the beginning of a quotation within a quotation. However, it may be useful to translate this short quote frame as an indirect quotation as the UST does. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])

This is to set up the reason he gives in the [next verse](../09/16.md). Be sure that it is clear in your translation that these are hypothetical past events.

If your readers would not understand what this image means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture.

EXO	9	17	h3ed	figs-metaphor	עוֹדְ⁠ךָ֖ מִסְתּוֹלֵ֣ל בְּ⁠עַמִּ֑⁠י	1	lifting yourself up against my people	Pharaoh’s opposition to letting the Israelites go to worship Yahweh is spoken of as if he were raising himself up as a barrier to them. If your readers would not understand what this image means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “You are still blocking my people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EXO	9	17	sdav	figs-rpronouns	מִסְתּוֹלֵ֣ל	1		Here, Pharaoh fills two different roles in the sentence. Different languages have different methods of marking this.

However, the next two verses make it clear that Pharaoh’s servants heard and understood this warning to be for them as well. In this sense Pharaoh represents the Egyptians. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

If the **heart** is not the body part your culture uses to refer to a person’s will, consider using whichever organ your culture would use for this image. Alternate translation: “but whoever did not respect” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EXO	9	22	vtfl	writing-newevent	וַ⁠יֹּ֨אמֶר יְהוָ֜ה	1		A minor scene shift occurs here and may need to be marked in a certain way in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])

EXO	9	27	sh1x		חָטָ֣אתִי	1		Some commentators suggest translating **sinned** more literally, that is “missed the mark,” because Pharaoh is probably not admitting a moral failure, but instead, admitting that he misjudged.
EXO	9	27	joxy		הַ⁠צַּדִּ֔יק…הָ⁠רְשָׁעִֽים	1		Many commentators suggest that Pharaoh is using these terms in a narrow, legal sense and only referring to this instance. That is, he is saying something like “I’ve lost this round in court.” See UST.
EXO	9	27	wag1		וְ⁠עַמִּ֖⁠י	1		**My people** refers to the Egyptians.
EXO	9	28	r0cs	figs-litotes	וְ⁠לֹ֥א תֹסִפ֖וּ⁠ן לַ⁠עֲמֹֽד	1		This negative statement strengthens the force of Pharaoh’s statement that he will let the people go. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])

EXO	9	29	b787	translate-symaction	אֶפְרֹ֥שׂ אֶת־כַּפַּ֖⁠י אֶל־יְהוָ֑ה	1	spread my hands out to Yahweh	This symbolic gesture accompanies prayer. Alternate translation: “I will pray to Yahweh” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
EXO	9	30	tn94	grammar-connect-condition-contrary	וְ⁠אַתָּ֖ה וַ⁠עֲבָדֶ֑י⁠ךָ	1	honor Yahweh God	This phrase is shifted to the beginning of the sentence to mark focus on Pharaoh and his servants because, despite Yahweh demonstrating his power, they are not yet afraid of him. If your language has a form or discourse feature that draws contrastive focus to participants, use it here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-contrary]])
EXO	9	30	srx4	figs-metonymy	מִ⁠פְּנֵ֖י יְהוָ֥ה	1		Here, **face** means presence or power. Alternate translation: “of Yahweh” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EXO	9	31	pcwg	writing-background			flax	This and the next verse give background information so that the later plagues’ destruction can be understood by the reader. Use the natural form in your language for expressing background information. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])

EXO	9	33	fa2j	translate-symaction	וַ⁠יִּפְרֹ֥שׂ כַּפָּ֖י⁠ו אֶל־יְהוָ֑ה	1	spread out his hands to Yahweh	This symbolic gesture accompanies prayer. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Exodus 9:29](../09/29.md). Alternate translation: “lifted up his hands toward Yahweh and prayed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
EXO	9	34	ke5k	figs-metaphor	וַ⁠יַּכְבֵּ֥ד לִבּ֖⁠וֹ	1	hardened his heart	Pharaoh’s stubborn attitude is spoken of as if he made his own **heart heavy**. This time his servants do the same. If the **heart** is not the body part your culture uses to refer to a person’s will, consider using whichever organ your culture would use for this image. See how you translated this in [8:15](../08/15.md). Alternate translation: “Pharaoh determined to be defiant” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EXO	9	34	nz0e		וַ⁠יֹּ֣סֶף לַ⁠חֲטֹ֑א	1		This statement is from the author’s perspective. Therefore, unlike in [9:27](../09/27.md), **sin** should be translated with the word your language uses for “sin.”
EXO	9	34	ooed		וַ⁠יַּכְבֵּ֥ד לִבּ֖⁠וֹ ה֥וּא וַ⁠עֲבָדָֽי⁠ו	1		Alternate translation: “and he caused his heart to be heavy. His servants did also” or “and he caused his heart to be heavy. His servants did the same”
EXO	9	35	yxt8	figs-metaphor	וַֽ⁠יֶּחֱזַק֙ לֵ֣ב פַּרְעֹ֔ה	1	The heart of Pharaoh was hardened	Pharaoh’s stubborn attitude is spoken of as if his **heart** were **strong**. If the **heart** is not the body part your culture uses to refer to a person’s will, consider using whichever organ your culture would use for this image. See how you translated this in [Exodus 7:13](../07/13.md). This is a neutral statement (it does not say that anyone caused him to be stubborn as many others in this part of the narrative do). Alternate translation: “Pharaoh was still defiant” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EXO	9	35	x0kn	figs-metaphor	כַּ⁠אֲשֶׁ֛ר דִּבֶּ֥ר יְהוָ֖ה בְּ⁠יַד־מֹשֶֽׁה	1		This is similar to [9:12](../09/12.md). In this case, what Yahweh said is figuratively spoken of as if it were something that could be held in someone’s hand. This means that Moses delivered a message from Yahweh that Pharaoh would be stubborn. It is not clear if this message was given to the Israelites or if this refers to Moses’ statement to Pharaoh in [9:30](../09/30.md). If your readers would not understand what this image means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “just as Yahweh had told Moses to say” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EXO	10	intro	s5g1			0		# Exodus 10 General Notes<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Pharaoh’s hard heart<br><br>Pharaoh’s heart is often described as hard in this chapter. This means that his heart was not open or willing to understand Yahweh’s instructions. When his heart was hardened, it became less and less receptive to Yahweh.<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Let my people go<br><br>This is a very important statement. Moses does not ask Pharaoh to “let go” of the Hebrew people. Instead, he demands that Pharaoh free the Hebrew people.
EXO	10	1	w4pw	figs-metaphor	כִּֽי־אֲנִ֞י הִכְבַּ֤דְתִּי אֶת־לִבּ⁠וֹ֙ וְ⁠אֶת־לֵ֣ב עֲבָדָ֔י⁠ו	1	for I have hardened his heart and the hearts of his servants	This means God made Pharaoh and his servants stubborn. Their stubborn attitude is spoken of as if their **hearts** were **heavy.** If the **heart** is not the body part your culture uses to refer to a person’s will, consider using whichever organ your culture would use for this image. See how you translated this in [4:21](../04/21.md), but note that the metaphor is slightly different here. Alternate translation: “for I have caused Pharaoh and his servants to be stubborn” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EXO	10	2	zg4c		הִתְעַלַּ֨לְתִּי֙ בְּ⁠מִצְרַ֔יִם	1	various signs	Alternate translation: “I mocked Egypt”
EXO	10	3	pm8p	figs-quotemarks	וַ⁠יֹּאמְר֣וּ אֵלָ֗י⁠ו	1		After this phrase, a direct quote begins that continues until near the end of [10:6](../10/06.md). It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with an opening first-level quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the beginning of a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
EXO	10	3	u3mq	figs-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּאמְר֣וּ אֵלָ֗י⁠ו כֹּֽה־אָמַ֤ר יְהוָה֙ אֱלֹהֵ֣י הָֽ⁠עִבְרִ֔ים	1		It may be helpful to turn the introductory quotation into an indirect quotation so that you do not have to use quotes within quotes. Alternate translation: “and told him that Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews, said thus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
EXO	10	3	vze4		כֹּֽה־אָמַ֤ר יְהוָה֙	1		This quotation form is used to introduce commands from Yahweh. See [4:intro](../04/intro.md) for more information.
EXO	10	3	cicf	figs-metonymy	עַד־מָתַ֣י מֵאַ֔נְתָּ לֵ⁠עָנֹ֖ת מִ⁠פָּנָ֑⁠י	1		Here, **face** figuratively represents the presence of Yahweh. Particularly, it means the presence of his judgment (the plagues). Alternate translation: “Until when will you refuse to be humble when I judge you” or “Until when will you refuse to be humble before me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EXO	10	4	ge67		הִנְ⁠נִ֨י	1	listen	**Behold me** adds emphasis to what is said next. Alternate translation: “beware”
EXO	10	4	uwtp	grammar-collectivenouns	אַרְבֶּ֖ה	1		**Locust** is a singular noun referring to the group as one. Alternate translation: “locusts” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns]])
EXO	10	5	zu5r	figs-parallelism	וְ⁠כִסָּה֙ אֶת־עֵ֣ין הָ⁠אָ֔רֶץ וְ⁠לֹ֥א יוּכַ֖ל לִ⁠רְאֹ֣ת אֶת־הָ⁠אָ֑רֶץ	1	hail	These parallel statements have a similar meaning. They are used to emphasize the great number of locusts that are coming. In some languages this will not have the same rhetorical effect, and you will need to use another device to emphasize the statement. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
EXO	10	5	rdav		וְ⁠כִסָּה֙ אֶת־עֵ֣ין הָ⁠אָ֔רֶץ	1		Alternate translation: “And it will cover the land from sight”
EXO	10	5	oj3i	grammar-collectivenouns	וְ⁠כִסָּה֙…וְ⁠אָכַ֣ל…וְ⁠אָכַל֙	1		Here the pronoun **it** agrees in number with the collective singular “locust” in the previous verse. Insects are often referred to without gender in English, but you will need to use whatever number, gender, and/or noun class is required in your language to agree with the word for “locust” that you used in the [previous verse](../10/04.md). See UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns]])
EXO	10	6	ir5l	figs-hyperbole	עַל־הָ֣⁠אֲדָמָ֔ה	1	nothing ever seen	This could either mean **on the earth** (planet) or “on the land” (Egypt). Either way, it is meant to emphasize an extremely long time, meaning never. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
EXO	10	6	ma0o	figs-explicit	וַ⁠יִּ֥פֶן	1		[Verse 3](../10/03.md) says that Aaron came in to see the king with Moses. It is implied that he left with him as well. You may make this explicit if it would help your readers. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EXO	10	7	xn8j	figs-rquestion	עַד־מָתַי֙ יִהְיֶ֨ה זֶ֥ה לָ֨⁠נוּ֙ לְ⁠מוֹקֵ֔שׁ	1	How long will this man be a menace to us?	Pharaoh’s servants ask this question to show Pharaoh that he is stubbornly causing the destruction of Egypt. This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: “We cannot allow this man to continue to bring trouble to us!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
EXO	10	7	jqbh	figs-gendernotations	הָ֣⁠אֲנָשִׁ֔ים	1		Here, **men** may be literal or it may refer to the Israelites, including the women and children. In [verse 10](../10/10.md) the king rejects the idea of letting the women and children go, and in [verse 11](../10/11.md) he specifically says that the men can go. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
EXO	10	7	xdm5	figs-rquestion	הֲ⁠טֶ֣רֶם תֵּדַ֔ע כִּ֥י אָבְדָ֖ה מִצְרָֽיִם	1	Do you not yet realize that Egypt is destroyed?	Pharaoh’s servants ask this question to bring Pharaoh to recognize what he refuses to see. This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: “You should realize that Egypt is destroyed!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
EXO	10	7	c6pr	figs-activepassive	כִּ֥י אָבְדָ֖ה מִצְרָֽיִם	1	that Egypt is destroyed	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “that these plagues have destroyed Egypt” or “that their God has destroyed Egypt” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
EXO	10	8	bu1x	figs-activepassive	וַ⁠יּוּשַׁ֞ב אֶת־מֹשֶׁ֤ה וְ⁠אֶֽת־אַהֲרֹן֙ אֶל־פַּרְעֹ֔ה	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “And a servant brought Moses and Aaron back to Pharaoh” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
EXO	10	8	fzsv		מִ֥י וָ⁠מִ֖י	1		Alternate translation: “Who all”
EXO	10	9	fnnl	figs-exclusive	נֵלֵ֑ךְ…נֵלֵ֔ךְ	1		**We** means the Israelites and does not include Pharaoh or the Egyptians. Use an exclusive form here if your language has this distinction. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
EXO	10	10	hjc9		יְהִ֨י כֵ֤ן יְהוָה֙ עִמָּ⁠כֶ֔ם כַּ⁠אֲשֶׁ֛ר אֲשַׁלַּ֥ח אֶתְ⁠כֶ֖ם וְ⁠אֶֽת־טַפְּ⁠כֶ֑ם	1	if I ever let you go and your little ones go	**May Yahweh be with you** is usually a blessing but is almost certainly not here. It likely means something like “It will take Yahweh’s power to make me let you and your children go,” or “May Yahweh be as favorable to you as I am to the idea of letting your children go.” Pharaoh is saying that it will take Yahweh to make him do what Moses wants, but he does not think that will happen. Alternate translation: “It will be clear that Yahweh is with you if I let you and your children go”
EXO	10	10	w8x4	figs-metonymy	רְא֕וּ כִּ֥י רָעָ֖ה נֶ֥גֶד פְּנֵי⁠כֶֽם	1		The phrase **for evil is before your faces** could either be a warning from Pharaoh that Moses’ actions will lead to evil for the Israelites, or it could mean that Pharaoh thinks the Israelites plan something that he considers evil. **Faces** is a metonym for the whole person. Alternate translations: “I see that you plan evil” or “Be careful! Your actions will have bad consequences” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EXO	10	11	pkm4		הַ⁠גְּבָרִים֙	1	Then Moses and Aaron were driven out from Pharaoh’s presence	This interjection clarifies who may go. Alternate translation: “the leaders”
EXO	10	11	vdjk	figs-metonymy	מֵ⁠אֵ֖ת פְּנֵ֥י פַרְעֹֽה	1		Here, **face** figuratively represents the presence of Pharaoh. Alternate translation: “from his presence” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EXO	10	12	kchn	writing-newevent	וַ⁠יֹּ֨אמֶר יְהוָ֜ה	1		There is a minor scene change here, which may need to be marked in a certain way in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])

EXO	10	12	gzwa	grammar-collectivenouns	וְ⁠יַ֖עַל…וְ⁠יֹאכַל֙	1		Here, the pronoun **it** agrees in number with the collective singular “locust.” See how you translated this in [10:5](../10/05.md) (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns]])
EXO	10	13	xqsz		מַטֵּ⁠הוּ֮	1		See note in the [introduction to chapter 8](../08/intro.md) regarding the hand and staff.

EXO	10	15	b3h5	grammar-collectivenouns	וַ⁠יְכַ֞ס…וַ⁠יֹּ֜אכַל	1	so that it was darkened	Here the pronoun **it** agrees in number with the collective singular “locust.” See how you translated this in [10:5](../10/05.md) (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns]])
EXO	10	15	xszc		וַ⁠יְכַ֞ס אֶת־עֵ֣ין כָּל־הָ⁠אָרֶץ֮	1		See how you translated this in [10:5](../10/05.md).

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
EXO	10	16	ty9f	figs-youdual	אֱלֹֽהֵי⁠כֶ֖ם וְ⁠לָ⁠כֶֽם	1		Here, **you** and **your** are plural. These could refer either to Moses and Aaron or to all the Israelites. If your language uses different forms of “you” depending on the number of people addressed, use a plural form here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
EXO	10	17	tsve		שָׂ֣א	1		Alternate translation: “take away”
EXO	10	17	ttog		אַ֣ךְ הַ⁠פַּ֔עַם…רַ֖ק	1		Pharaoh could either be desperate and using **just this once … only** to attempt to make his request as small as possible to increase the chances of it being granted, or he could be still too proud to admit guilt beyond this single incident (which is probably his bold statement about Yahweh being with the Israelites in [10:10](../10/10.md)). The former seems more likely given that he terms this plague “this death.” If your culture has a way of making a request seem as small as possible, you may want to use it to translate Pharaoh’s request.
EXO	10	17	kd6d	figs-youdual	אֱלֹהֵי⁠כֶ֑ם	1	this time	Here, **your** is plural. This could refer either to Moses and Aaron or to all the Israelites. If your language uses different forms of “you” depending on the number of people addressed, use a plural form here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
EXO	10	17	doeg	figs-metonymy	הַ⁠מָּ֥וֶת הַ⁠זֶּֽה	1		The word **death** here refers to the destruction by the locusts of all plants in Egypt, which would eventually lead to the deaths of people, because there would be no crops. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. See the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EXO	10	17	nn2b	figs-explicit	הַ⁠מָּ֥וֶת הַ⁠זֶּֽה	1	take this death away from me	The word **death** here refers to the destruction by the locusts of all plants in Egypt, which would eventually lead to the deaths of people because there would be no crops. The full meaning of this statement can be made explicit. Alternate translation: “this destruction that will lead to our deaths” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EXO	10	18	p9hz		וַ⁠יֵּצֵ֖א	1		Moses and Aaron were summoned to the king in [10:16](../10/16.md) so some translations will need to say that they both left.
EXO	10	19	xhsv		רֽוּחַ־יָם֙ חָזָ֣ק מְאֹ֔ד	1		Alternate translation: “a very strong west wind” or “a very strong wind from the west”
EXO	10	19	mdp5		וַ⁠יִּשָּׂא֙ אֶת־הָ֣⁠אַרְבֶּ֔ה	1	picked up the locusts	Alternate translation: “and it moved the locusts upwards”
EXO	10	19	zhcu	grammar-collectivenouns	הָ֣⁠אַרְבֶּ֔ה…אַרְבֶּ֣ה	1		See how you translated this in [10:4](../10/04.md). Alternate translation: “the locusts … of the locusts” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns]])
EXO	10	19	q8aj	grammar-collectivenouns	וַ⁠יִּתְקָעֵ֖⁠הוּ	1		Here, the first **it** refers to the wind, the second agrees in number with the collective singular “locust.” See how you translated this in [10:5](../10/05.md) (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns]])
EXO	10	20	dw1d	figs-metaphor	וַ⁠יְחַזֵּ֥ק יְהוָ֖ה אֶת־לֵ֣ב פַּרְעֹ֑ה	1	Yahweh hardened Pharaoh’s heart	This means God made him stubborn. His stubborn attitude is spoken of as if his **heart** were **strong**. If the **heart** is not the body part your culture uses to refer to a person’s will, consider using whichever organ your culture would use for this image. See how you translated this in [4:21](../04/21.md). Alternate translation: “But Yahweh caused Pharaoh to be stubborn” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EXO	10	21	x6xk	writing-newevent	וַ⁠יֹּ֨אמֶר יְהוָ֜ה	1		A new scene begins here, which may need to be marked in a certain way in your language. This is the start of the third plague sequence. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
EXO	10	21	utyz		יָֽדְ⁠ךָ֙	1		See note in the [introduction to chapter 8](../08/intro.md) regarding the hand and staff.
EXO	10	21	m38s	figs-metaphor	מִצְרָ֑יִם וְ⁠יָמֵ֖שׁ חֹֽשֶׁךְ	1	darkness that may be felt	This is a somewhat puzzling construction which describes the darkness. Most English translations take it as a passive, which restated actively means, “people will feel the darkness,” meaning metaphorically what is expressed in different ways in the UST and the alternate translation here. Another option is to view the Hebrew verb form as causative and translate as such: “and the darkness will cause people to feel,” meaning people will have to feel where they are going because they will not be able to see. A final option would be a personification of darkness such that the darkness gropes around, filling in every place in the land. If your readers would not understand what this image means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “Egypt — an extremely oppressive darkness” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EXO	10	22	z4ge		יָד֖⁠וֹ	1		See note in the [introduction to chapter 8](../08/intro.md) regarding the hand and staff.

EXO	10	23	jmd8	figs-metonymy	לֹֽא־רָא֞וּ אִ֣ישׁ אֶת־אָחִ֗י⁠ו	1		This phrase means that people could not see the people who lived closest to them, whether or not that person was literally their **brother**.

Based on context, Moses is probably not saying that Pharaoh needs to provide his own animals to the Israelites. He is asking Pharaoh to let the Israelites take their own animals. **Give in our hands** means to take with them, by whatever means, which may include holding a rope in the hand to lead the animals or any other means of herding the animals. See the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

EXO	11	intro	pu3u			0		# Exodus 11 General Notes<br><br><br>Chapter 11 is a transition point in the book. The previous nine plagues (in their three sequences of three) have come to an end and the last plague, the death of the firstborn, is about to occur, along with the Passover and the Exodus itself. It is difficult to know if the events in chapter 11 all are recorded in the order in which they happened. For translation, you should follow the order of the text if it will not confuse your readers.<br><br>It may be helpful to think that after the end of chapter 10, Yahweh spoke to Moses immediately, before he actually left Pharaoh’s presence (v. [1](../11/01.md)-[2](../11/02.md)). [Verse 3](../11/03.md) is a comment suggesting that the Egyptians will be willing to do as the Israelites are told to ask them to do in [v. 2](../11/02.md). In verses [4](../11/04.md)-[7](../11/07.md) Moses gives Pharaoh and his officials a message from Yahweh that Yahweh is giving to Moses right at that moment. At the end of [v. 8](../11/08.md) Moses leaves Pharaoh’s presence (completing the interaction from the [end of ch. 10](../10/28.md)). [Verse 9](../11/09.md) may either be Yahweh telling Moses what is going to happen, or it could be part of the summary that occurs in [v. 10](../11/10.md). Verse 10 summarizes what has happened in chs. 5-10 (especially the plagues in chs. 7-10) in preparation for the great last plague.<br><br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Pharaoh’s hard heart<br><br>Pharaoh’s heart is often described as hard in this chapter. This means that his heart was not open or willing to understand Yahweh’s instructions. When his heart was hardened, it became less and less receptive to Yahweh.<br><br>### Let my people go<br><br>In the previous chapters, Moses did not ask Pharaoh’s permission for the Hebrew people to leave. Instead, he demanded that Pharaoh free the Hebrew people. In this chapter, the same wording is used to refer to Pharaoh “allowing” the Hebrew people to leave Egypt.
EXO	11	1	hrom	figs-quotemarks	אֶל־מֹשֶׁ֗ה	1		After this phrase, a direct quote begins that continues until the end of [11:2](../11/02.md).

EXO	11	2	t14c		נָ֖א	1		Here, **now** conveys urgency, indicating that Moses should speak soon, without delaying for other things. If you have a way of giving a command that shows that it is important for someone to do it quickly, it would be better to translate in that way than in a way that means “now” in a time sense (versus earlier or later).

EXO	11	3	hng9	figs-idiom	חֵ֥ן הָ⁠עָ֖ם בְּ⁠עֵינֵ֣י מִצְרָ֑יִם	1		Here, **in the eyes of the Egyptians** is an idiom for the Egyptian’s feelings or opinion. **Favor** means those feelings are positive. Taken together, this means that when the Egyptians see the Israelites leaving Egypt, they will gladly help them. (Because the Egyptians have suffered under Gods judgment, the Egyptians want so badly to see them leave). If your language has the same or a similar idiom, you can translate or use it. Otherwise, you can translate the meaning. See how you translated this in [3:21](../03/21.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

First, two extremes are mentioned: the highest of society (**Pharaoh, who sits on his throne**) and the lowest (**the slave girl who is behind the mill**). Then the animals (**beasts**) are added making it a three- item list of parts of society and even economy to show the totality of the coming judgment. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])

EXO	11	8	hoft	translate-symaction	וְ⁠הִשְׁתַּֽחֲוּוּ־לִ֣⁠י	1		This does not mean to bow for worshiping. **They will bow to** Moses to beg him to leave. They will do this to show how desperate they will be for Moses and the Israelites to go. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])

EXO	11	8	njx8	figs-metaphor	וְ⁠כָל־הָ⁠עָ֣ם אֲשֶׁר־בְּ⁠רַגְלֶ֔י⁠ךָ	1		Here, the people are figuratively pictured as below Moses, which means they are his followers. The reference to **feet** also can mean they go the same place he goes, again, meaning “follower.” If your language uses a similar image to mean follower, you can translate the image; if not, you may use another image from your culture or translate the meaning. Alternate translation: “and all the people who are following you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EXO	11	8	ria5	figs-explicit	וְ⁠אַחֲרֵי־כֵ֖ן אֵצֵ֑א	1	After that I will go out	This means that Moses and the Israelites will leave Egypt. Alternate translation: “After that I will leave here” or “After that I will go out from Egypt” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

Here, the ULT uses **lamb** (a young sheep), because [verse 5](../12/05.md) specifies that it must be one year old. “Kid” (a young goat) would be equally valid as verse 5 also says that it could be either a sheep or a goat. You may translate it as whatever would be most familiar of sheep or goat—preferably a word that means a young sheep or goat.

EXO	12	29	rvg9			0		The next few verses are the climax of this part of Exodus. A number of literary features mark it out. First, it is specially introduced with **and so it happened,** which is used to mark major breaks in the narrative. Second, it uses repetition: **firstborn** is repeated four times in verse 29 so that the reader cannot possibly miss what is happening. **Night** is repeated in verse 29, 30, and 31. **Got up/get up** is repeated in verse 30 and 31. In verses 31 and 32 “also” occurs five times (it is translated as “both” once in the ULT). Third, the places of both **Pharaoh** and **the captive** are elaborated on to slow the pace and create a vivid mental image for the reader. In verse 30 there is the listing of sorts of people who got up; note the use of the double negative for emphasis. Your translation should attempt to use the same or similar literary features of your own language that slow down the pace, create vivid imagery, and emphasize that this is a climax point.

EXO	13	18	c4tw		וַ⁠חֲמֻשִׁ֛ים	1		The meaning of this term (**by fives**) is uncertain.

EXO	15	intro	ni4b			0		# Exodus 15 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Verses 1b-18 and 21b of chapter 15 verses are poetry. They are a song of praise to Yahweh because he defeated and destroyed the Egyptian army ([Exodus 14:26-28](../14/26.md).). Translating poetry should be done by someone who is a skilled poet in the target language. Because the forms of poetry are so different in different languages, a translation that is good poetry in the target language may seem very different from the original poem. The structure may look quite different. The poet will be well served by looking at the entire poem from multiple perspectives. He will need to know the meaning of the poem, the themes and discourse structure of the poem, and the feelings that the poem is supposed to create in the reader at each point (UST, tNotes). He will need to understand how that was accomplished by the original form and structure (ULT). Then he will need to compose the translated poem using forms and structures that have the same or similar meaning, themes, discourse elements, and feelings.<br><br>### Structure<br><br>This song follows a basic AB structure which is given to us in verse 1b-c and 21b-c:<br><br>* A - praise to Yahweh - he is magnificent (expressed in various words)<br>* B - because he defeats our enemies<br><br>The song can be divided into three major sections, each of which is patterned as: AB(a)b. Each section starts with an AB portion which is characterized by fewer verbs (or participles, how to express) (especially the A portion). The section then elaborates on each. Note that there are other possible analyses of the structure of the poem.<br><br>Here is an outline of the structure according to this model:<br><br>* Section 1 (see alternate breakdown below):<br>    * 1b: A “Let me sing to Yahweh, for he has triumphantly triumphed;”<br>    * 1c: B “the horse and the one riding it he threw into the sea.”<br>    * 2-3: a<br>    * 4-5: b<br>* Section 2:<br>    * 6a: A<br>    * 6b: B<br>    * 7a: a “And in the abundance of your majesty”<br>    * 7a-10: b “you overthrow those who rise up against you … ”<br>* Section 3:<br>    * 11: A<br>    * 12: B<br>    * 13a: a (possibly) “In your covenant loyalty”<br>    * 13a-17: b<br>* 18: finale<br><br>Alternate breakdown of section 1: it is possible to view 1b-c as the introduction and divide verse 2 such that:<br><br>* 2a: A “Yah is my strength and my song”<br>* 2b: B “and he has become my salvation”<br>* 2c-3: a<br>* 4-5: b<br><br>### Themes:<br><br>There are several images and themes that are throughout the song as well as some that are throughout an individual section.<br><br>* “High” versus “low”: Yahweh is high, while his enemies are low.<br>    * The following words are all related to the idea of being high or rising up: **triumph** ([v1](../15/01.md)), **exalt** ([v2](../15/02.md)), **majestic** ([v6](../15/06.md), [v11](../15/11.md)), **majesty** ([v7](../15/07.md)), and **the mountain of** \[Yahweh’s\] **possession** ([v17](../15/17.md)). In the last case Yahweh’s people are brought to a high place with him.<br>    * In contrast, his enemies are low. Note in [verse 7](../15/07.md), Yahweh overthrows those who **rise up against** \[him\]. Ideas of being low are as follows: **sank** ([v4](../15/04.md), [v10](../15/19.md)), **deeps** ([v5](../15/05.md)), **descended into the depths** ([v5](../15/05.md)), **melted away** ([v15](../15/15.md)), and **fall on them** ([v16](../15/16.md)).<br>* The strength of Yahweh in [verses 2](../15/02.md), [6](../15/06.md), and [13](../15/13.md).<br>* The effectiveness of Yahweh’s hand versus the enemy’s hand. Yahweh’s hand (and arm) is effective in [verses 6](../15/06.md), [12](../15/12.md), [16](../15/16.md), and [17](../15/17.md) but the enemy’s hand is ineffective despite his boasting in [verse 9](../15/09.md).<br>* There is parallel imagery near the end of each section. The enemy is compared three times by simile to a heavy, inert object. In [verses 5](../15/05.md) and [16](../15/16.md) that is a **stone**, in [verse 10](../15/10.md) that is **lead**.<br>* More parallel imagery occurs at the end of sections one ([v5](../15/05.md)) and two ([v10](../15/10.md)): that of the enemy sinking in the water and being covered by it.<br>* In sections two and three the water ([v8](../15/08.md)) and the other peoples ([v16](../15/16.md)) are made still by Yahweh.<br>* Section two begins and ends with **majestic** ([v6](../15/06.md), [v10](../15/10.md)) and that word is picked up in the beginning of section three ([v11](../15/11.md)).<br>* In section two ([v9](../15/09.md)), the enemies seek to **dispossess** (or disinherit) the Israelites; in section three ([v16](../15/16.md)), the Israelites come to live in the land of Yahweh’s **possession** (or inheritance).<br>* In [verse 11](../15/11.md), three themes for the third section are introduced. These are each expanded on in that section.<br>    * **Holiness** occurs again in [verses 13](../15/13.md) and [16](../15/16.md)<br>    * **Fear** is vividly described in [verses 14-16](../15/14.md) (shake, terror, panic, trembling, melted away, dread)<br>    * Yahweh **does miracles** to protect and build a home for his people<br>* [Verses 14](../15/14.md)-16a are a chiasm, a complex parallel structure where concepts are repeated in reverse order:<br>    * A: 14a: peoples (nations) *become* afraid<br>    * B: 14b: *inhabitants* of Philistia are afraid<br>    * C: 15a: *rulers* of Edom are afraid<br>    * C’: 15b: *rulers* of Moab are afraid<br>    * B’: 15c: *inhabitants* of Canaan are afraid<br>    * A’: 16a: people *become* afraid<br>* In section three, there is another parallel structure:<br>    * [v13](../15/13.md): you led this people => [v16](../15/16.md): your people pass by<br>    * v13: this people you redeemed => v16: this people you acquired (or purchased or ransomed)<br>    * v13: you led them to the home => [v17](../15/17.md): you will bring them … \[to\] the place … you made<br>    * v13: of your holiness => v17: the holy place<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### The Israelite’s discontent<br><br>In [verse 24](../15/24.md) the word **murmur** is introduced for the first time. This is a very strong term for “grumble” or “complain” that is used to describe the Israelites’ attitude throughout their time in the wilderness. It occurs several times in Exodus and Numbers.<br><br>### Yahweh’s laws<br><br>In verses [24-26](../15/24.md), there is an introductory revelation of the requirement that Israel keep the covenant by obeying the law of Moses. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/reveal]])

EXO	15	9	lu0e		תּוֹרִישֵׁ֖⁠מוֹ יָדִֽ⁠י	1	my hand will destroy them	The meaning of this phrase is unclear. The word translated **dispossess** could also mean ”possess” or ”inherit.” What seems clear is that the Egyptians plan to use their power to prevent the Israelites from possessing good things. Whether this is a reference back to **plunder** earlier in the verse, or to recapturing them as slaves, or to taking over the Israelites’ place in the land of Goshen, or of keeping them from reaching the promised land (of Yahweh’s possession, see [verse 17](../15/17.md) regarding where Yahweh will bring his people), or something else is not so clear. **Dispossess** was chosen rather than another term because the verb is in a causative form here. Alternate translation: “my hand will possess them” or “my hand will inherit them”
EXO	15	9	sm77	figs-metonymy	תּוֹרִישֵׁ֖⁠מוֹ יָדִֽ⁠י	1	my hand will destroy them	Here **hand** is used figuratively of the Egyptians’ power (that is, their military strength).

Alternatively, you could express the meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “But you made the wind blow” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

If your readers would not understand what this image means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture.

EXO	15	16	kbt5	figs-metaphor	תִּפֹּ֨ל עֲלֵי⁠הֶ֤ם אֵימָ֨תָ⁠ה֙ וָ⁠פַ֔חַד	1	Terror and dread will fall on them	**Terror and dread** are pictured as physical objects that could **fall on** people. The image might be of them crushing people or being a heavy weight that people struggle under (however, the image is not specified). It means that the people will feel the emotions of terror and dread very strongly. If your readers would not understand what this image means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “They will be overwhelmed with feelings of terror and dread” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

EXO	16	intro	nkd7			0		# Exodus 16 General Notes<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Complaints<br><br>After complaining about the water, the Israelites complained that they had less food than in Egypt. This is intended to show their ungratefulness and their sinful view of Yahweh. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])<br><br>### Prohibition against storing food<br><br>The people were not allowed to store the food, called manna, that Yahweh provided to them. This is because they were to trust in Yahweh to provide for their needs every day. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/trust]])<br><br>### Sabbath<br><br>This is the first recorded celebration of the Sabbath rest. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sabbath]])<br><br>## Possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Bread as food<br><br>Yahweh speaks of the food that he will send as if it were bread. The manna he gave them was perhaps not literally bread. The Israelites would eat this food every day, just as they had eaten bread every day before this. Alternate translations: “food” or “food like bread” (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/bread]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])<br><br>### Chronology<br><br>[Verses 34](../../exo/16/34.md)-36 are written from a much later perspective.

EXO	18	intro	t8g2			0		# Exodus 18 General Notes<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Leadership lessons<br><br>Jethro taught Moses an important leadership lesson in this chapter. Many scholars look at this chapter for important leadership lessons. Moses delegated some of his responsibilities to other godly men so that he would not become worn out by all the demands made of him. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/godly]])<br><br><br>## Possible translation difficulties<br><br>### Order of events<br><br>The timing of the events in [verse 2](../18/02.md) is not clear and whatever their timing, may be difficult to translate. The question is: Is Jethro’s **taking** Zipporah related to the past event of Moses sending her back to him at some otherwise unmentioned point in time, or is Jethro’s **taking** related to his coming to meet Moses in [verse 5](../18/05.md).<br><br>### Verse 11<br><br>[Verse 11](../18/11.md) is difficult in the original and requires interpretation.<br><br>### God and Yahweh<br><br>For this chapter God, who is named Yahweh, is mostly referred to as God instead by his name as is usual in much of the rest of the book. Translations should not suggest that they are not different beings.<br><br>### Kinship: Father-in-law<br><br>Jethro is the father of Moses’ wife. Some languages may make a distinction between that and a woman’s father-in-law. If that is the case, note it in verses: 1-2, 5-8, 12, 14-15, 17, 24, and 27. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship]])<br><br><br>### Participant reference<br><br>Jethro is often referred to simply as the father-in-law of Moses in this chapter. He is also named explicitly an unusually high number of times (it would be more usual to have more pronouns referring to him). This is likely to emphasize his familial ties and authority (or honored status). Some languages may need to use alter the way he is referred to for naturalness or to convey the same sense of familial ties and authority (or honored status).

If your readers would not understand what this image means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “They told Moses about the difficult cases” or “When there were difficult cases, they told Moses about them so that he would judge them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

EXO	19	intro	ck7e			0		# Exodus 19 General Notes<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### “A kingdom of priests”<br><br>The function of the priests was to intercede for the people. The Levites were the only priests in Israel; this is a metaphor indicating that the nation was to intercede for the world as a whole. They were also to be holy, or set apart, from the rest of the world. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/priest]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/holy]])<br><br>### Revealing the Law<br><br>The events of this chapter are concerned with preparing the people to receive the law of Moses. The people go through all of this to prepare themselves for the law, which shows the great importance of this event for Israel. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]])<br><br><br>### Boundaries between Yahweh and the people<br><br>Moses is told to make the people holy in preparation for meeting Yahweh, then boundaries are set up to keep the people separate from Yahweh, then the priests are told to make themselves holy. The theme of a holy separation is beginning to be developed that will become much of the law code.

This may be for poetic effect as Yahweh’s statement here through [verse 6](../19/06.md) is somewhat artfully crafted. You may need to use a strategy other than parallelism to achieve a similar poetic effect in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
EXO	19	4	z9i6	figs-you	אַתֶּ֣ם רְאִיתֶ֔ם	1	You have seen	The word **you** here refers to the Israelites. Yahweh is telling Moses what to tell the Israelites. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
EXO	19	4	l1do	figs-quotemarks		0	You have seen	A second-level direct quotation begins with this verse and continues until the middle of [verse 6](../19/06.md). It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by marking it with second-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation within a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])

EXO	19	11	tdg9	figs-metonymy	לְ⁠עֵינֵ֥י	1	Be ready	Here, **before the eyes** means “so they can see.” If your readers might misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. See the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

EXO	19	12	hhv5	figs-quotesinquotes	לֵ⁠אמֹ֔ר הִשָּׁמְר֥וּ לָ⁠כֶ֛ם	1	set boundaries	A second-level direct quotation begins with **watch**. It is not clear where this command that Moses is to give the Israelites ends. Most English translations end it in [verse 13](../19/13.md) before the last sentence. For that reason, it may be most helpful to translate the instruction as an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: “telling them to watch themselves” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])

EXO	19	13	ezpm	figs-go	יַעֲל֥וּ	1	shot	If you translate this with come or go, consider which would be the correct perspective for your language and the text context. Yahweh is speaking, so “come up” is valid, however, the people will be the ones moving so “go up” is as well. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])

EXO	19	18	m1b5		יָרַ֥ד…יְהוָ֖ה	1	Yahweh descended	Alternate translation: “Yahweh came down”
EXO	19	18	a8p7	figs-simile	כְּ⁠עֶ֣שֶׁן הַ⁠כִּבְשָׁ֔ן	1	like the smoke of a furnace	This shows that it was a very large amount of smoke. Alternate translation: “like the smoke from a very large fire” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

EXO	19	21	d2qm	figs-metaphor	פֶּן־יֶהֶרְס֤וּ	1	not to break through	God spoke about walking past the boundary as if they might break down a barrier and walk through it. See how you translated “set bounds” in [Exodus 19:12](../19/12.md). If your readers would not understand what this image means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture.

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical]])

Some languages require that the additional condition, that he marries while a slave, be stated clearly. Alternate translation: “If he became a slave while he had no wife, and if he marries while he is a slave, the master need only free the man” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

EXO	21	6	vnjk	figs-metonymy	הָ֣⁠אֱלֹהִ֔ים	1	bore his ear through	The word for **God** at its most literal means “great ones.” Here it may have this basic meaning and refer to human judges or other leaders in Israel. It may also be a metonym and refer to the judges because they represent God to the people and have his authority. Texts other than the standard Hebrew text support this reading. See [Exodus 22:8-9](../22/08.md) for another example of this. Alternate translation: “the judges” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

EXO	21	8	t2zf	figs-activepassive	וְ⁠הֶפְדָּ֑⁠הּ	1	he must let her be bought back	If your language does not use the passive form in this way you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “he must allow her father to buy her back” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
EXO	21	8	h7f7		בְּ⁠בִגְד⁠וֹ־בָֽ⁠הּ	1	he has treated her deceitfully	Alternate translation: “since he has deceived her”

EXO	21	10	i0xh			0	designates her as a wife for his son	This verse and the next are the third of three possible situations between a master and his female slave.

Alternate translation: “he must give the first wife the same food, clothing, and marital rights she had before” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
EXO	21	10	np9b	figs-euphemism	וְ⁠עֹנָתָ֖⁠הּ	1	or her marital rights	This term only occurs here in the Bible. It probably means things that a husband must do for his wife. Most commentators believe it specifically means having sexual relations with her, possibly so that she can bear children. Alternate translation: “or her right to intimacy” or “or her childbearing rights” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
EXO	21	12	gks4		מַכֵּ֥ה אִ֛ישׁ	1	strikes a man	Alternate translation: “Whoever attacks a man”

Alternate translation: “If anyone hits his father or mother, you must surely put him to death” or “You must surely kill anyone who hits his father or mother” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
EXO	21	15	qh2j		מ֥וֹת	1	must surely	Alternate translation: “must certainly”

Alternate translation: “You must surely kill anyone who curses his father or his mother” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
EXO	21	17	kvbc		וּ⁠מְקַלֵּ֥ל	1	Whoever curses his father or his mother must surely be put to death	The word translated **acts contemptuously** means the opposite of “honor” (as in the commandment to honor one’s parents). Alternate translation: “Whoever acts dishonorably towards”
EXO	21	19	c7rv		יָק֞וּם	1	he recovers	Alternate translation: “he gets better”
EXO	21	19	tv0z		וְ⁠נִקָּ֣ה	1	he recovers	Alternate translation: “then … is innocent”
EXO	21	19	xg6c	figs-explicit	שִׁבְתּ֛⁠וֹ	1	the loss of his time	This refers to a situation when someone cannot work to earn money. You can express this clearly in the translation. Alternate translation: “for the time he could not work” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

EXO	21	21	r65u	figs-explicit	כִּ֥י כַסְפּ֖⁠וֹ הֽוּא	1	for he will have suffered the loss of the servant	A common view is that the loss of the valuable property, the slave, is itself a punishment. It may be that the master loses the slave for a time and also has to pay for his healing, or it may be that the slave dies after a few days. You can express clearly in the translation that the servant was valuable to his master. Alternate translation: “because he has already lost his servant who was valuable to him” or “because he has already lost his servant’s work for a time and had to pay for his healing” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EXO	21	22	a6av		וְ⁠יָצְא֣וּ יְלָדֶ֔י⁠הָ וְ⁠לֹ֥א יִהְיֶ֖ה אָס֑וֹן	1	she miscarries	It is not clear in the passage what happens to the child. The text is simply as in the ULT. Some have taken it to mean that the child dies because of premature birth and the **serious injury** only relates to the woman. In this case, a fine is imposed for the loss of the child. However, the text could also mean that the child is born at least mostly safely. A fine is still imposed because of the great danger to the two lives. Then the next few verses give consequences for any injury either to mother or child.
EXO	21	22	w4p3		אָס֑וֹן	1	she miscarries	Alternate translation: “hurt”
EXO	21	22	cn4h	figs-activepassive	עָנ֣וֹשׁ יֵעָנֵ֗שׁ	1	the guilty man must surely be fined	If your language does not use the passive form in this way you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “you must certainly fine the guilty man” or “the guilty man must pay a fine” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
EXO	21	22	v5ye		בִּ⁠פְלִלִֽים	1	as the judges determine	Alternate translation: “what the judges decide”
EXO	21	23	ya82	figs-explicit	וְ⁠נָתַתָּ֥ה נֶ֖פֶשׁ תַּ֥חַת נָֽפֶשׁ	1	as the judges determine	This means that if someone is hurt, the person who caused the hurt must be hurt in the same way. Alternate translation: “you must take the killer’s life for the murdered person’s life” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EXO	21	24	c5bq	figs-explicit	עַ֚יִן תַּ֣חַת עַ֔יִן	1	an eye for an eye	This means that if someone is hurt, the person who caused the hurt must be hurt in the same way. Alternate translation: “the striker’s eye for the injured person’s eye” (and etc throughout this and the next verse) (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EXO	21	26	i8cg		אִ֜ישׁ	1	If a man	Here, **man** refers to the owner of a slave.
EXO	21	26	bmc1		תַּ֥חַת	1	in compensation	Alternate translation: “as payment for”

EXO	21	28	qk3u	figs-activepassive	סָק֨וֹל יִסָּקֵ֜ל הַ⁠שּׁ֗וֹר	1	the ox must surely be stoned	If your language does not use the passive form in this way you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “you must surely stone the ox to death” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
EXO	21	28	q2gv	figs-activepassive	וְ⁠לֹ֤א יֵאָכֵל֙ אֶת־בְּשָׂר֔⁠וֹ	1	its flesh must not be eaten	If your language does not use the passive form in this way you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “and you must not eat its flesh” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
EXO	21	29	zgll	figs-activepassive	וְ⁠הוּעַ֤ד בִּ⁠בְעָלָי⁠ו֙	1	its owner also must be put to death	If your language does not use the passive form in this way you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “and someone warned its owner” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
EXO	21	29	x2y0	figs-explicit	וְ⁠הוּעַ֤ד בִּ⁠בְעָלָי⁠ו֙	1	its owner also must be put to death	The content of the warning could be made explicit. Alternate translation: “and its owner was warned that it gores” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EXO	21	29	nzn1	figs-activepassive	וְ⁠גַם־בְּעָלָ֖י⁠ו יוּמָֽת	1	its owner also must be put to death	If your language does not use the passive form in this way you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “you must also kill its owner” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
EXO	21	30	t5rs	figs-explicit	אִם־כֹּ֖פֶר יוּשַׁ֣ת עָלָ֑י⁠ו וְ⁠נָתַן֙ פִּדְיֹ֣ן נַפְשׁ֔⁠וֹ כְּ⁠כֹ֥ל אֲשֶׁר־יוּשַׁ֖ת עָלָֽי⁠ו	1	If a payment is required for his life	The text does not specify who will impose a ransom on the ox’s owner. Since other texts indicate that justice is retributive and performed by the dead person’s family, that is one option. Another is that the judges will impose it. One of these can be stated clearly. Alternate translation: see UST (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EXO	21	30	py37	figs-activepassive	אִם־כֹּ֖פֶר יוּשַׁ֣ת עָלָ֑י⁠ו…יוּשַׁ֖ת עָלָֽי⁠ו	1	If a payment is required for his life	If your language does not use the passive form in this way you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. However, you must make a decision regarding who is imposing the ransom, or use an unspecified pronoun if that is possible in your language (this second option would not make sense in English). Alternate translation: “If the judges impose a ransom on him … they impose on him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
EXO	21	31	kg25		יִגָּ֖ח…יִגָּ֑ח	1	has gored	Alternate translation: “it injures with its horns … it injures with its horns”
EXO	21	31	to8k	writing-pronouns	לּֽ⁠וֹ	1	has gored	Here, **him** probably refers to the ox’s owner. Alternate translation: “to the owner” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
EXO	21	32	qzv3	translate-bmoney	כֶּ֣סֶף׀ שְׁלֹשִׁ֣ים שְׁקָלִ֗ים	1	thirty shekels of silver	A **shekel** weighed 11 grams. Alternate translation: “330 grams of silver” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney]])
EXO	21	32	qy0g	figs-explicit	אִם־עֶ֛בֶד יִגַּ֥ח הַ⁠שּׁ֖וֹר	1	thirty shekels of silver	Because they are to kill the ox, the slave must have died. You can make this explicit. Alternate translation: “If an ox kills a male servant” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EXO	21	32	wm9a	figs-activepassive	וְ⁠הַ⁠שּׁ֖וֹר יִסָּקֵֽל	1	the ox must be stoned	If your language does not use the passive form in this way you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

EXO	21	33	fd4p		יִפְתַּ֨ח…בּ֗וֹר	1	opens a pit	Alternate translation: “uncovers a hole in the ground” or “takes a cover off a hole in the ground”
EXO	21	34	b48a	figs-explicit	כֶּ֖סֶף יָשִׁ֣יב לִ⁠בְעָלָ֑י⁠ו	1	repay the loss	The owner must be paid for the loss of his animal. Alternate translation: “he must pay the owner for the dead animal” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

EXO	21	34	j8qz	figs-explicit	וְ⁠הַ⁠מֵּ֖ת יִֽהְיֶה־לּֽ⁠וֹ	1	will become his	The one who paid for the loss of the animal will become the owner of the dead animal and can do what he wants with it. The full meaning of this statement can be made explicit. Alternate translation: “will belong to the owner of the pit” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EXO	21	35	z9ug		וְ⁠חָצ֣וּ אֶת־כַּסְפּ֔⁠וֹ	1	divide its price	Alternate translation: “and divide the money” or “and divide the money they receive”
EXO	21	36	fkx2	figs-activepassive	א֣וֹ נוֹדַ֗ע	1	if it was known	If your language does not use the passive form in this way you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: see UST (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
EXO	21	36	v64b		נַגָּ֥ח הוּא֙ מִ⁠תְּמ֣וֹל שִׁלְשֹׁ֔ם	1	a habit of goring in time past	Alternate translation: “had gored other animals before”
EXO	21	36	ix8h	figs-explicit	וְ⁠לֹ֥א יִשְׁמְרֶ֖⁠נּוּ בְּעָלָ֑י⁠ו	1	its owner has not kept it in	This means that the owner did not keep his ox safely where it could not wander to hit other animals. This can be clearly stated in the translation. Alternate translation: “and its owner did not keep it inside a fence” or “and its owner did not tie it securely” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EXO	21	36	dcv2	figs-explicit	שַׁלֵּ֨ם יְשַׁלֵּ֥ם שׁוֹר֙ תַּ֣חַת הַ⁠שּׁ֔וֹר	1	he must surely pay ox for ox	The owner of the ox that killed must give an ox to the man who lost his ox. This can be stated clearly in the translation. Alternate translation: “the owner of the ox that killed must surely give a living ox to the owner of the ox that died” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

EXO	23	33	d1fp	figs-metaphor	כִּֽי־יִהְיֶ֥ה לְ⁠ךָ֖ לְ⁠מוֹקֵֽשׁ	1	this will surely become a trap for you	This means worshiping other gods will lead the people of Israel to certain destruction as if they were an animal caught in a hunter’s trap. It could also be saying that leaving the other people around will make it so that the Israelites see the other people’s worship and are lured (like in a trap) into worshipping the other gods, which is a sin against Yahweh.

The ULT takes this view, however, for languages where it is hard to express events out of order, the UST reflects the other grammatical possibility and says in [24:13](../24/13.md) that Moses started up the mountain and in [24:15](../24/15.md) that he went the rest of the way up the mountain. Following this you can view this verse as if Moses paused and gave these final instructions as he was leaving the elders behind, keeping a sequential structure. Either approach is permissible by the text, but the approach of the ULT is preferred if possible. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])

If this sort of metal-working process is unknown to your people, you may simply describe it, or use a word meaning “make” as the UST does. The UST approach is preferred, as the creation process is not in focus here, and it would be cumbersome to include the description in the text. You could use a word meaning “make” and include the description in a footnote, if you are including those, and your team feels it is important to understand.

It may, however, mean that at the end they should be one piece, so the gold should be heated to melting and the lid and cherubim joined together. Alternate translation: “You shall join the cherubim to the atonement lid on its two ends”

The priests were to be set apart from the rest of Israel because Yahweh is holy.

This phrase indicates that he permanently remains within Israel in a special way while they have the ark.

Some take it to mean that the actions previous to this statement describe the consecrating of Aaron and his sons as priests. And at this point they are ordained. Others suggest this phrase may introduce the following material as the consecration process. However, because there are several statements regarding this consecration (literally filling the hand) throughout the chapter (see verses 29, 33, and 35), it may also merely be a summary and reminder statement of the purpose of the entire process as the instructions transition from dressing the priests to the sacrificial portion of the ritual. It would probably be best to translate this in the way a mid-text summary reminder phrase would be spoken in your language, avoiding any indication that it refers only to the previous or following text.

EXO	30	15	ew8p	figs-123person	נַפְשֹׁתֵי⁠כֶֽם	1	the half shekel	The plural form of you is used here. In many cases, since Yahweh is speaking to Moses about the people that will be counted, it may make more sense to change to the third person. However, Moses would be counted as well and would have to pay the ransom, so a form of you that could include Moses and all the other Israelite men would also be an appropriate translation.

It may make more sense in some languages to move this whole statement to the beginning of the verse because the rule about pouring on someone’s body is an application of the result. Alternate translation (placed at the beginning of the verse): “Because it is sacred, you must treat it like it is sacred, therefore” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])

EXO	32	1	cfk8	figs-metaphor	וַ⁠יַּ֣רְא הָ⁠עָ֔ם	1	the people saw	Here understanding something is spoken of as if it were being seen. If your readers would not understand what this image means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “And the people realized” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EXO	32	1	lnau	figs-rpronouns	וַ⁠יִּקָּהֵ֨ל הָ⁠עָ֜ם	1	the people saw	This means the people were not summoned by Aaron, they decided to come **gather themselves.** (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns]])
EXO	32	1	k2i1	figs-idiom	ק֣וּם	1	Come, make us an idol	**Arise** strengthens the force of the command following it. The people were demanding that Aaron make an idol for them. It did not necessarily mean to literally stand up. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent idiom or use plain language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EXO	32	1	mrb5	figs-metonymy	יֵֽלְכוּ֙ לְ⁠פָנֵ֔י⁠נוּ	1	go before us	Here, **before our faces** means ahead of. The Israelites want idols to lead them. Alternate translation: “shall lead us” or “shall be our leader” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EXO	32	1	wulk		כִּי־זֶ֣ה׀ מֹשֶׁ֣ה	1	go before us	People showed disrespect by putting the word **this** before his name, as if Moses were someone they did not know and could not trust.

EXO	32	3	ckg2	figs-hyperbole	כָּל־הָ⁠עָ֔ם	1	All the people	This refers to all the people who rejected Moses as their leader and Yahweh as their God.

When the gold became hard, he removed the mold, and the hardened gold had the shape of a calf. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
EXO	32	4	cc7s	writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמְר֔וּ	1	fashioned it with an engraving tool and he made a cast idol in the shape of a calf	It is not clear who **they** is who spoke. Alternate translation: “And someone said” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
EXO	32	4	ence	figs-123person	אֱלֹהֶ֨י⁠ךָ֙…הֶעֱל֖וּ⁠ךָ	1	fashioned it with an engraving tool and he made a cast idol in the shape of a calf	Because the speaker of this sentence is unknown and mentioned in the plural, it is possible that it is the people speaking. In that case, it would be possible for a translation to use the first person rather than second person here. Alternate translation: “our gods … brought us up” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
EXO	32	4	n17v		אֵ֤לֶּה אֱלֹהֶ֨י⁠ךָ֙	1	fashioned it with an engraving tool and he made a cast idol in the shape of a calf	In the text, there only appears to be one “god” (the golden calf idol) presented to Israel.

EXO	32	6	as6u	figs-euphemism	לְ⁠צַחֵֽק	1	to carouse in wild celebration	This word may imply drunken and sexual sin (for a sexual implication see [Genesis 26:8](../GEN/26/08)). However, the only actions mentioned in the text are singing ([v. 18](../32/18.md)) and dancing ([v. 19](../32/19.md)) so translators should avoid using a term that is overly suggestive. Alternate translation: “to revel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
EXO	32	7	iajs	writing-newevent		0	to carouse in wild celebration	There is a scene shift back to the top of the mountain with Moses and Yahweh here, which may need to be marked in a certain way in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
EXO	32	7	tcek	figs-rpronouns	שִׁחֵ֣ת	1	to carouse in wild celebration	Here, the reflexive **themselves** is used to translate the fact that the Israelites actions made the Israelites corrupt. Alternate translation: “have acted corruptly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns]])

If your readers would not understand what this image means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “They have quickly stopped doing what I commanded them to do” or “They have quickly stopped obeying what I commanded them to do” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

EXO	32	9	ffe2	figs-metaphor	עַם־קְשֵׁה־עֹ֖רֶף	1	a stiff-necked people	Yahweh speaks of the people being rebellious as if they had hard necks. The image comes from an animal that does not want to go the way his master is trying to direct him (not going in the way God commanded). If your readers would not understand what this image means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “is a rebellious people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EXO	32	9	my87	grammar-collectivenouns	הַ⁠זֶּ֔ה…הֽוּא	1	a stiff-necked people	**People** is a collective noun so the pronouns refering to the people are singular.

If doubling in this way would not convey emphasis in your language, you will need to find a way to translate it that does give emphasis. Alternate translation: “using your very strong power” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
EXO	32	11	ph43	figs-metonymy	וּ⁠בְ⁠יָ֥ד חֲזָקָֽה	1	a mighty hand	Here, **hand** represents God’s actions or works. See how you translated this in [Exodus 6:1](../06/01.md). Alternate translation: “and with powerful works” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

If your language would emphasize these topics in a different way than moving them to the front of the sentence follow your language’s natural usage for emphasis. Alternate translation: “And the tablets themselves were the work of God. And the writing itself was the writing of God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
EXO	32	17	cua3	writing-participants	יְהוֹשֻׁ֛עַ	1	he said to Moses	Joshua was last mentioned in [Exodus 24:13](../24/13.md).

If it would be unclear to say that Moses heard **the sound of singing** in the third line after saying he didn’t hear the sound of singing twice before, something more like the UST may be followed that is more contrastive.

If your readers might misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent idiom or use plain language. Alternate translation: “that they are set on evil” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EXO	32	22	h6dm	figs-123person	הֽוּא	1	they are set on doing evil	Here, **it** is used because **people** is grammatically singular in Hebrew. Alternate translation: “they are” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

EXO	32	24	yq7s	figs-quotesinquotes	וָ⁠אֹמַ֤ר לָ⁠הֶם֙ לְ⁠מִ֣י זָהָ֔ב הִתְפָּרָ֖קוּ	1	So I said to them, ‘Whoever has any gold, let him take it off.’	**Whoever has gold, take it off yourself** is a second-level quotation. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with second-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation within a quotation.<br>However, this can be stated as an indirect quote. Alternate translation: “So I told them that whoever had any gold should take it off” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
EXO	32	24	yy82	figs-rpronouns	הִתְפָּרָ֖קוּ	1	So I said to them, ‘Whoever has any gold, let him take it off.’	He instructs people to take their own gold off. Alternate translation: “you take off your own” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns]])
EXO	32	24	wvin	grammar-connect-logic-result	וָ⁠אַשְׁלִכֵ֣⁠הוּ בָ⁠אֵ֔שׁ וַ⁠יֵּצֵ֖א הָ⁠עֵ֥גֶל הַ⁠זֶּֽה	1	So I said to them, ‘Whoever has any gold, let him take it off.’	Aaron claims an unusual sequence of events here. The translation should surprise an audience unfamiliar with the story. He states that the result of simply throwing gold in the fire is the apperance (by its own power or volition it seems) of the calf. This is a lie. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
EXO	32	25	ck1f		פָרֻ֖עַ	1	were running wild	Alternate translation: “were behaving wildly” or “were not controlling themselves”
EXO	32	25	csg0	grammar-collectivenouns	כִּ֥י פָרֻ֖עַ ה֑וּא כִּֽי־פְרָעֹ֣⁠ה אַהֲרֹ֔ן	1	were running wild	Here, the pronoun **it** agrees with the grammatical number of **people** (singular). Alternate translation: “that they were let loose, for Aaron had let them loose” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns]])
EXO	32	26	jis7	figs-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֕אמֶר מִ֥י לַ⁠יהוָ֖ה אֵלָ֑⁠י	1	Then Moses stood at the entrance…“Whoever is on Yahweh’s side, come to me.”	You can state this as an indirect quote. Alternate translation: “and said that whoever was for Yahweh should come to him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
EXO	32	26	ryb5	figs-idiom	מִ֥י לַ⁠יהוָ֖ה	1	Whoever is on Yahweh’s side	Moses speaks of being loyal to Yahweh as being **for Yahweh**. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent idiom or use plain language. Alternate translation: “Whoever serves Yahweh” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EXO	32	27	xsl3		עִבְר֨וּ וָ⁠שׁ֜וּבוּ מִ⁠שַּׁ֤עַר לָ⁠שַׁ֨עַר֙ בַּֽ⁠מַּחֲנֶ֔ה	1	go back and forth from entrance to entrance	Alternate translation: “Go from side of the camp to the other, starting at one entrance to the camp and going to the entrance on the other side of the camp”

EXO	32	29	to5d	figs-idiom	מִלְא֨וּ יֶדְ⁠כֶ֤ם	1	You have been placed into Yahweh’s service	This seems to be an idiom for giving authority to someone. See how you translated this in [Exodus 28:41](../28/41.md). However, this usage is different from that text as here it is not specified what authority they are given or what they are consecrated for other than **for Yahweh**. Alternate translation: “Consecrate yourselves” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EXO	32	29	rkp6		מִלְא֨וּ יֶדְ⁠כֶ֤ם הַ⁠יּוֹם֙ לַֽ⁠יהוָ֔ה	1	You have been placed into Yahweh’s service	Here it is unclear if **fill** should be rightly understood in the past or as a command. You may want to follow the decision of another translation your people are familiar with. Alternate translation: “You have filled your hand for Yahweh today”
EXO	32	29	c6fg	figs-explicit	כִּ֛י אִ֥ישׁ בִּ⁠בְנ֖⁠וֹ וּ⁠בְ⁠אָחִ֑י⁠ו	1	for each of you has taken action against his son and his brother	The fact that they did this in obedience to God can be stated clearly. Alternate translation: “for you have obeyed Yahweh and killed your sons and your brothers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EXO	32	29	l54l		וְ⁠לָ⁠תֵ֧ת עֲלֵי⁠כֶ֛ם הַ⁠יּ֖וֹם בְּרָכָֽה	1	for each of you has taken action against his son and his brother	This phrase is difficult to interpret. Several options depend on exactly how the conjunction, preposition, and verb combination are interpreted. The first difficulty is related to the difficulty with the previous verb, have they already been blessed or are they going to be blessed? (Alternate translation: “and to have given a blessing over you today”) The second is, should the clause connections be understood to say that the blessing is because of their actions, or more strongly, that a desire for blessing motivated them to take action? (Alternate translation: “and therefore to give a blessing over you today” or “so that a blessing may be given over you today”) The third is, while ultimately all blessing is from Yahweh, is Yahweh or the Levites the subject? (Alternate translation: “and to give a blessing over yourselves today” or “and so Yahweh gives a blessing over you today”) As with the previous clause, you may want to follow the decision of another translation your people are familiar with. Alternate translation: “by that you brought blessing on yourselves”
EXO	32	30	kvj4	figs-doublet	חֲטָאתֶ֖ם חֲטָאָ֣ה גְדֹלָ֑ה	1	You have committed a very great sin	Here, **sin** is repeated as a verb and then noun for emphasis. Along with **great** it suggests that the people sinned very very badly. If the repetition of words in this way would not create emphasis use another form in your language that does. Alternate translation: “you have sinned extremally badly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
EXO	32	30	r5fn	figs-abstractnouns	חֲטָאתֶ֖ם חֲטָאָ֣ה גְדֹלָ֑ה	1	You have committed a very great sin	If your language does not use an abstract noun for **sin**, you could express the idea behind it in another way. See UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
EXO	32	31	ccpg	figs-doublet	חָטָ֞א הָ⁠עָ֤ם הַ⁠זֶּה֙ חֲטָאָ֣ה	1	You have committed a very great sin	Here, **sin** is repeated as a verb and then noun for emphasis. Along with **great** it suggests that the people sinned very very badly. If the repetition of words in this way would not create emphasis use another form in your language that does. Alternate translation: “this people has sinned extremally badly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
EXO	32	31	y049	figs-abstractnouns	חֲטָאָ֣ה	1	You have committed a very great sin	If your language does not use an abstract noun for **sin**, you could express the idea behind it in another way. See UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

EXO	32	32	brpu	figs-ellipsis	וְ⁠עַתָּ֖ה אִם־תִּשָּׂ֣א חַטָּאתָ֑⁠ם	1	blot me out of the book	Moses leaves out his conclusion, perhaps as a way of making this conditional phrase into a request, perhaps to avoid suggesting to God what would be good for him to do. However, if leaving out a conclusion would be misunderstood in your language you may need to rephrase it or add the implied conclusion. Alternate translation: “But now, if you forgive their sin, good!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
EXO	32	32	c72y	figs-metonymy	מְחֵ֣⁠נִי	1	blot me out of the book	Here, **me** refers to the name of Moses. Alternate translation: “erase my name from the book” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EXO	32	32	ahb3	figs-explicit	כָּתָֽבְתָּ	1	the book that you have written	What God had written in the book can be stated clearly. Alternate translation: “the book in which you have written the names of your people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EXO	32	33	igb4	figs-metonymy	אֶמְחֶ֖⁠נּוּ מִ⁠סִּפְרִֽ⁠י	1	that person I will blot out of my book	Here, **him** represents that person’s name. Alternate translation: “I will erase that person’s name from my book” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

If it would be more clear in your language to place the reason first you may consider reordering the clauses. Alternate translation: “However, because they sinned, one day I will come to punish them.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
EXO	32	35	wv1v	figs-explicit	עָשׂ֣וּ אֶת־הָ⁠עֵ֔גֶל אֲשֶׁ֥ר עָשָׂ֖ה אַהֲרֹֽן	1	they had made the calf, the one that Aaron made	The first **made** here could mean (1) “do” which could imply worship (2) the people are being spoken of as having made the calf themselves (as well as Aaron) because they demanded it and gave their gold for it. Alternate translation: “they had worshiped the calf that Aaron made” or “they were guilty along with Aaron of making the calf” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EXO	32	35	h3kl	grammar-connect-logic-result	וַ⁠יִּגֹּ֥ף יְהוָ֖ה אֶת־הָ⁠עָ֑ם עַ֚ל אֲשֶׁ֣ר עָשׂ֣וּ אֶת־הָ⁠עֵ֔גֶל אֲשֶׁ֥ר עָשָׂ֖ה אַהֲרֹֽן	1	they had made the calf, the one that Aaron made	If your language requires placing the reason before the result you may reorder these clauses.

EXO	33	intro	g5k3			0		# Exodus 33 General Notes<br><br>This chapter is largely about Moses continuing to negotiate for a closer relationship between Yahweh and himself and Yahweh and the people. There are a number of important theological issues addressed especially Yahweh’s holiness and character. Several key terms appear.<br><br>## Potential Translation Issues<br><br>Yahweh’s statement to Moses in verse 5 seems to have happened before the people’s reaction in verse 4, so in some languages you may need to reverse them.<br><br>Verses 7-11 seem to be background, general information about a somewhat unspecified time period. Be sure this is clear in how you structure these verses. See the beginning of verse 7 in the UST. While the term in verses 7-11 is often used interchangeably with the tabernacle that will be built in chapters 35-39, it is a temporary and different tent. One distinguishing feature is that it is well outside the camp while the tabernacle will be in the center of the tent.<br><br>The word **tent** in verses 7-11 refers either to this temporary “tent of meeting” that Moses set up, or to the tents that the Israelites lived in. Pay attention throughout these verses to which tent is referred to.<br>
EXO	33	1	p8xp	figs-quotesinquotes	לֵ⁠אמֹ֔ר לְ⁠זַרְעֲ⁠ךָ֖ אֶתְּנֶֽ⁠נָּה	1	General Information:	The words following **saying** are a second-level quotation. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with second-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation within a quotation.<br>However, you may want to translate this as an indirect quotation in order to reduce the layers of quotations in this passage.

EXO	33	4	cf7g	translate-unknown	עֶדְי֖⁠וֹ	1	jewelry	This may have referred to beautiful clothing as well as chains and rings made from gold or silver that had could have had jewels in them. Alternate translation: “his adornments” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
EXO	33	4	qwuu	translate-versebridge		0	jewelry	Yahweh’s statement to Moses in verse 5 seems to have happened before the people’s reaction in verse 4, so in some languages you may need to reverse them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge]])
EXO	33	5	rn40	grammar-connect-words-phrases	וַ⁠יֹּ֨אמֶר יְהוָ֜ה	1	jewelry	The word **had** places Yahweh’s statement back in time. It can be understood from context as it seems Yahweh’s statement to Moses in verse 5 seems to have happened before the people’s reaction in verse 4. If you are reversing the order of the verses for your language, you should omit it in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])

You may need to restructure this in your language if the order of reason and result is particular. Alternate translation: “If I went up among you for one moment, then I would destroy you because you are a people hard of neck.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])

Some languages may need to reorder this structure. Alternate translation: “So that I will know what I will do to you, take your ornaments down from on you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
EXO	33	5	gb16	figs-explicit	וְ⁠עַתָּ֗ה הוֹרֵ֤ד עֶדְיְ⁠ךָ֙ מֵֽ⁠עָלֶ֔י⁠ךָ	1	a stubborn people	This was a way for the Israelites to show that they were sorry for sinning. If this would not be understood you may need to make it explicit in the text or a footnote. See UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EXO	33	6	tomy	figs-rpronouns	וַ⁠יִּֽתְנַצְּל֧וּ	1	a stubborn people	Here, **themselves** refers to the Israelites, they are both the ones doing the action and the ones the action is done to.

EXO	33	7	fb65		הָ⁠אֹ֜הֶל	1	a stubborn people	The word **tent** in verses 7-11 refers either to this temporary “tent of meeting” that Moses set up, or to the tents that the Israelites lived in. Pay attention throughout these verses to which tent is referred to. Here it refers to the “tent of meeting.”
EXO	33	8	h2us		אָהֳל֑⁠וֹ	1	a stubborn people	This refers to the people’s tents.
EXO	33	9	yt4f		עַמּ֣וּד הֶֽ⁠עָנָ֔ן	1	the pillar of cloud	See how you translated this in [13:21](../13/21.md).

EXO	33	9	ghf8	figs-metonymy	וְ⁠דִבֶּ֖ר	1	would come down	Grammatically, the most likely referent for this pronoun is the **pillar of cloud**. By metonymy and based on [verse 11](../33/11.md) this probably refers to Yahweh. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

EXO	33	11	zrb8	figs-metaphor	פָּנִ֣ים אֶל־פָּנִ֔ים	1	Yahweh would speak to Moses face to face	Speaking directly rather than through dreams and visions is spoken of as if Moses and God saw each other’s faces while they spoke. If your readers would not understand what this image means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “Yahweh would speak directly to Moses” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EXO	33	11	lqe0	figs-simile	כַּ⁠אֲשֶׁ֛ר יְדַבֵּ֥ר אִ֖ישׁ אֶל־רֵעֵ֑⁠הוּ	1	Yahweh would speak to Moses face to face	The metaphor of speaking **face to face** is explained by the simile here.

You may also need to make the phrase active in form and change the abstract noun **favor** into another form.

See how you dealt with the multiple issues in the phrase **you have found favor in my eyes** in [Exodus 33:12](../33/12.md).
EXO	33	13	zi7j	figs-metaphor	הוֹדִעֵ֤⁠נִי נָא֙ אֶת־דְּרָכֶ֔⁠ךָ	1	show me your ways	Here, **ways** is a metaphor either for Yahweh’s plans or for the holy life he requires.

Alternate translation: “Do not take us up from here if your face is not going” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical]])

This verse contains two or three rhetorical questions and the length of the second is debated. The first rhetorical question, **And in what then will it be known that I have found favor in your eyes, I and your people?** is used for emphasis and means, “There is only one way people will know that I and your people please you.” The second, **Is it not in your going with us?** is used to answer the question and means “That way is your going with us.” It is possible that the rest of the verse is (1) a statement further clarifying of how Yahweh’s favor is demonstrated (ULT, UST), (2) an extension of the second rhetorical question (“Is it not in your going with us so that I and your people shall be distinct from all of the people that are on the face of the earth?”), or (3) a separate rhetorical question making the same point (“And shall I and your people be distinct from all of the people that are on the face of the earth?”)<br>Moses used these questions in order to emphasize that if Yahweh does not go with them, no one will know that Yahweh is pleased with Moses and the people. Use whatever forms would be natural in your language to present an argument like this. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
EXO	33	16	d36k	figs-infostructure	וּ⁠בַ⁠מֶּ֣ה	1	For otherwise	This refers back to Moses’ hypothetical situation in the previous verse, that is, Yahweh not going with them. Use whatever connecting forms are necessary to make that clear. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])

They stress Yahweh’s divine prerogative to do whatever he wants. The structure also parallels Yahweh’s I AM statements in [Exodus 3:14](../03/14.md). If this form of parallelism would be misunderstood in your language, consider another form that emphasizes that Yahweh is graciously kind to exactly and only those whom he chooses without outside influence.

You may have to use similes if this would be misunderstood in your culture. Alternate translation: “Then it will be like I stop covering you with a hand and you will see a small part of my glory, like a person’s back, but not my full glory, like a person’s face.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
EXO	33	23	jq7t	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	וּ⁠פָנַ֖⁠י	1	you will see my back	Here, **but my face** is moved to the front of the clause to emphasize contrast with **my back**.

There are a number of difficult terms and concepts.<br>- The biblical metaphor of true worship as sexual fidelity appears in v. 14-16.<br>- Several verses are repeated either exactly or closely from earlier chapters.<br>- In v. 12-26 Yahweh appears to give a different 10 commandments from those in Exodus 20 (but also largely repeated from other earlier parts of Exodus) raising the question of what was actually written on the stone tablets in v. 28.<br>- The concept of Moses’s shining face may be difficult in some cultures.<br><br>### “He will bring the punishment for the fathers’ sin on their children”<br><br>This phrase does not mean that a child is necessarily punished for the sins of their parents.

In this case, people will fear Yahweh when they see what he does. Alternate translation: “for what I am doing with you will cause fear”
EXO	34	10	s7uz	figs-you	עִמָּֽ⁠ךְ	1	I am doing with you	Here **you** refers to Moses and the people of Israel. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
EXO	34	11	xtkf	figs-metonymy	גֹרֵ֣שׁ מִ⁠פָּנֶ֗י⁠ךָ	1	I am doing with you	Here, **from before your faces** means “ahead of you” or “on your behalf.” Yahweh is emphasizing who is doing the driving out. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

EXO	34	12	fmc9			0	General Information:	Verses 12-16 are the first of these ten commandments. The original language is structured such that every clause in these verses is subordinate to the initial, **Guard yourself**. That sort of structure may not be possible in your language (as it is not in English).
EXO	34	12	mnpv	figs-rpronouns	לְ⁠ךָ֗	1	General Information:	Here, **yourself** means that each Israelite should guard against committing these sins. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns]])

Each is introduced by **lest**. Use a marker in your language that introduces a hypothetical situation, but also see the next note. Alternate translation: “If you were to cut a covenant with the inhabitant of the land where you are about to go into, probably he would become as a trap in your midst.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
EXO	34	12	t1hz	grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical	פֶּן־תִּכְרֹ֤ת בְּרִית֙ לְ⁠יוֹשֵׁ֣ב הָ⁠אָ֔רֶץ אֲשֶׁ֥ר אַתָּ֖ה בָּ֣א עָלֶ֑י⁠הָ פֶּן־יִהְיֶ֥ה לְ⁠מוֹקֵ֖שׁ בְּ⁠קִרְבֶּֽ⁠ךָ	1	General Information:	The second of these hypothetical statements is logically dependent on and follows after the first as a result. As you mark these hypotheticals, use a form that communicates that the second is a result of the first. Alternate translation: “because if you cut a covenant with the inhabitant of the land where you are about to go into then he will become as a trap in your midst” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical]])

EXO	34	12	tnka	grammar-collectivenouns	לְ⁠יוֹשֵׁ֣ב…יִהְיֶ֥ה	1	General Information:	The word **inhabitant** is a singular noun that refers to any individual inhabitant or group of inhabitants from the peoples mentioned in the previous verse. The pronoun **he** is agreeing with that singular noun. If your language does not use singular nouns in that way, you can use a different expression. Alternate translation: “with the inhabitants of … they become” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns]])
EXO	34	12	lxz8	figs-simile	פֶּן־יִהְיֶ֥ה לְ⁠מוֹקֵ֖שׁ בְּ⁠קִרְבֶּֽ⁠ךָ	1	they will become a trap among you	People who tempt others to sin are spoken of as if they were a **trap.** Alternate translation: “lest those remaining people tempt you to sin” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
EXO	34	13	wkbx	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	כִּ֤י	1	they will become a trap among you	This word marks a strong contrast with the previous verse. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a strong contrast. Alternate translation: “Do the opposite!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])

You should use whatever form in your language would emphasize or focus on each item that they must destroy. Alternate translation: “as for their altars, break them down! As for their stone pillars, smash them to pieces! As for their trees where they worship the goddess Asherah, cut them all down!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
EXO	34	13	gbp0	grammar-collectivenouns	תִּכְרֹתֽוּ⁠ן	1	they will become a trap among you	For some reason only this pronoun is singular, referring back the singular “inhabitant” in the previous verse. Translate it based on your decision in the previous verse. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns]])
EXO	34	14	fzjz	translate-symaction	לֹ֥א תִֽשְׁתַּחֲוֶ֖ה	1	Yahweh, whose name is Jealous	To **bow to another god** means to worship it. This imagery is throughout scripture and should be retained in translation. Alternate translation: “you shall not bow to worship” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
EXO	34	14	vmx2	figs-metaphor	כִּ֤י יְהוָה֙ קַנָּ֣א שְׁמ֔⁠וֹ אֵ֥ל קַנָּ֖א הֽוּא׃	1	Yahweh, whose name is Jealous	The repeated word **jealous** means that God is concerned to keep his honor. If his people worship other gods, he loses honor, because when his people do not honor him, other people also will not honor him. This is pictured in a metaphor of a jealous spouse who is concerned that his spouse be faithful to him. This is an important Biblical metaphor that should be kept in translation if at all possible. The UST makes this image explicit as a simile, which can be done occasionally but would probably be too long for repeated use in a translation. Alternate translation: “Yahweh jealously guards his reputation. He is a God jealous of his honor.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EXO	34	14	s5sd	figs-metonymy	כִּ֤י יְהוָה֙ קַנָּ֣א שְׁמ֔⁠וֹ	1	whose name is Jealous,	Here, the word **name** represents God’s character. Alternate translation: “Yahweh is always jealous” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EXO	34	15	r70f	grammar-collectivenouns	לְ⁠יוֹשֵׁ֣ב…וְ⁠קָרָ֣א…מִ⁠זִּבְחֽ⁠וֹ	1	General Information:	The word **inhabitant** is a singular noun that refers to any individual inhabitant or group of inhabitants from the peoples mentioned in the previous verse. The pronouns **he** and **his** are agreeing with that singular noun. If your language does not use singular nouns in that way, you can use a different expression. See how you translated this in [verse 12](../34/12.md). Alternate translation: “with the inhabitants of … and they invite … from their sacrifice” or “with the inhabitants of … and one of them invites … from his sacrifice” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns]])
EXO	34	15	udz0	figs-hypo	פֶּן־תִּכְרֹ֥ת בְּרִ֖ית לְ⁠יוֹשֵׁ֣ב הָ⁠אָ֑רֶץ וְ⁠זָנ֣וּ׀ אַחֲרֵ֣י אֱלֹֽהֵי⁠הֶ֗ם וְ⁠זָבְחוּ֙ לֵ⁠אלֹ֣הֵי⁠הֶ֔ם וְ⁠קָרָ֣א לְ⁠ךָ֔	1	Connecting Statement:	Most of this verse is a sort of chain of logically consecutive hypothetical events that Yahweh is warning the Israelites against. Your language may have a specific way this sort of argument must be structured or phrased. One way to see this would be to repeat **lest** before every verb in verse 15-16. Alternate translation: “If you cut a covenant the inhabitant of the land, and if they then prostitute after their gods and sacrifice to their gods, and if he then invites you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
EXO	34	15	f1e3		פֶּן־תִּכְרֹ֥ת בְּרִ֖ית לְ⁠יוֹשֵׁ֣ב הָ⁠אָ֑רֶץ	1	Connecting Statement:	This phrase is exactly the same as the second clause of [verse 12](../34/12.md). It serves as a reminder of the command Yahweh is giving as he begins to expand on the “trap” he mentioned in verse 12. Your language may need to mark this repetition in a particular way. Alternate translation: “Remember: keep yourself lest you cut a covenant with the inhabitant of the land”
EXO	34	15	n4nt	figs-idiom	תִּכְרֹ֥ת בְּרִ֖ית	1	Connecting Statement:	See how you translated this in [verse 12](../34/12.md). Alternate translation: “you make a covenant” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EXO	34	15	gtd8	figs-metaphor	וְ⁠זָנ֣וּ׀ אַחֲרֵ֣י אֱלֹֽהֵי⁠הֶ֗ם	1	for they prostitute themselves to their gods	In this metaphor, Yahweh speaks of people worshiping other gods as if they were prostitutes going to other men. This metaphor is most often used regarding the unfaithfulness of the Israelites. The metaphor is not quite as clear with the other nations because while Yahweh is the only true God, he is not in special covenant with the other nations as their god. However, since the worship is still impurely following false gods, the metaphor is used here. This is an important Biblical metaphor that should be kept in translation if at all possible. Alternate translation: “and they worship their gods” or “because they worship their gods like prostitutes who go to other men” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EXO	34	15	d1m0	figs-metonymy	וְ⁠זָנ֣וּ׀ אַחֲרֵ֣י אֱלֹֽהֵי⁠הֶ֗ם	1	for they prostitute themselves to their gods	This phrase may also be seen as a metonymy because sexual sin was a regular part of worshipping false gods. Alternate translation: “and they worship by fornicating with their gods’ cult prostitutes” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EXO	34	15	vijl	figs-ellipsis	וְ⁠קָרָ֣א לְ⁠ךָ֔	1	for they prostitute themselves to their gods	Here, what the inhabitant will invite the Israelite to is not stated, but can be inferred from context. At the most basic level it is an invitation to eat food the Israelites were forbidden to eat. It is unclear how much more participation in worshipping false gods is implied. If your language requires that you specify what the Israelite is being invited into you may have to add some information. Alternate translation: “and he will invite you to eat from his sacrifice” or “and he will invite you to a feast to honor his gods” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
EXO	34	15	ygd9	grammar-connect-logic-result	וְ⁠אָכַלְתָּ֖ מִ⁠זִּבְחֽ⁠וֹ	1	for they prostitute themselves to their gods	The first part of the sin Yahweh is warning against in this and the next verse is to **eat from his sacrifice**. This clause is the result of disobedience regarding the **covenant** and the logical conclusion of the series of hypothetical events Yahweh presents before this. Alternate translation: “as a result, you will eat from his sacrifice” or “then you will eat from his sacrifice” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
EXO	34	15	hhbc	figs-synecdoche	וְ⁠אָכַלְתָּ֖ מִ⁠זִּבְחֽ⁠וֹ	1	for they prostitute themselves to their gods	Here, **and you eat from his sacrifice** may be a synecdoche for any and all parts of the worship of the other nations’ false gods. Alternate translation: “and you feast to honor his gods” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
EXO	34	15	bj2i	figs-explicit	וְ⁠אָכַלְתָּ֖ מִ⁠זִּבְחֽ⁠וֹ	1	you will eat some of his sacrifice	The consequence of eating food that is sacrificed to another god can be stated clearly. Alternate translation: “and you will eat some of his sacrifice and become guilty of worshiping his gods” or “and you will prostitute yourself to his god by eating some of his sacrifice” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EXO	34	16	jaic	grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical		0	you will eat some of his sacrifice	The string of hypothetical actions, each with its logical result continues throughout this verse. Continue translating the transitions between clauses as you decided in verse 15. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical]])
EXO	34	16	d4ma	figs-metaphor	וְ⁠זָנ֣וּ בְנֹתָ֗י⁠ו אַחֲרֵי֙ אֱלֹ֣הֵי⁠הֶ֔ן	1	you will eat some of his sacrifice	In this metaphor, Yahweh speaks of people worshiping other gods as if they were prostitutes going to other men. This metaphor is most often used regarding the unfaithfulness of the Israelites. The metaphor is not quite as clear with the other nations because while Yahweh is the only true God, he is not in special covenant with the other nations as their god. However, since the worship is still impurely following false gods, the metaphor is used here. This is an important Biblical metaphor that should be kept in translation if at all possible. See how you translated it in the previous verse. Alternate translation: “and his daughters worship their gods” or “and his daughters worship their gods like prostitutes who go to other men” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EXO	34	16	k0lr	figs-metaphor	וְ⁠הִזְנוּ֙ אֶת־בָּנֶ֔י⁠ךָ אַחֲרֵ֖י אֱלֹהֵי⁠הֶֽן	1	you will eat some of his sacrifice	In this metaphor, Yahweh speaks of people worshiping other gods as if they were prostitutes going to other men. The metaphor is clear here since it is referring to Israelite men who should be Yahweh worshippers. This is an important Biblical metaphor that should be kept in translation if at all possible. Alternate translation: “and cause your sons to worship their gods” or “and cause your sons to worship their gods like prostitutes who go to other men” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EXO	34	16	p98a	grammar-connect-logic-result	וְ⁠הִזְנוּ֙ אֶת־בָּנֶ֔י⁠ךָ אַחֲרֵ֖י אֱלֹהֵי⁠הֶֽן	1	you will eat some of his sacrifice	This is the climatic consequence of living in peace the the nations God is driving out before them: complete apostacy from Yahweh and loss of the next generation to wickedness. Specifically it is the result of intermarriage with the pagans, which God has explicitly forbidden for this very reason. If your language marks the final consequence of a string of actions in a particular way it may be appropriate to use it here. Alternate translation: “and in the end, they will cause even your sons to prostitute after their gods” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
EXO	34	17	lgab			0	you will eat some of his sacrifice	The prohibition here is focused on making gods. In your translation make sure that the focus is not on the method, but the god-making.
EXO	34	17	rux0		מַסֵּכָ֖ה	1	you will eat some of his sacrifice	See how you translated **molten metal** in [Exodus 32:4](../32/04.md).
EXO	34	18	s1rr			0	General Information:	This verse is almost identical to most of [Exodus 23:15](../23/15.md).
EXO	34	18	u5be	translate-numbers	שִׁבְעַ֨ת	1	seven days	Alternate translation: “7” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])
EXO	34	18	i5ck	translate-hebrewmonths	הָ⁠אָבִ֑יב…הָֽ⁠אָבִ֔יב	1	in the month of Aviv	This is the name of the first month of the Hebrew calendar. **Aviv** is during the last part of March and the first part of April on Western calendars. See how you translated **Aviv** in [Exodus 13:4](../13/04.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-hebrewmonths]])
EXO	34	19	ly7d			0	General Information:	This verse is similar to [Exodus 13:12](../13/12.md).
EXO	34	20	sbrs			0	buy back	This verse is very similar to [Exodus 13:13](../13/13.md).
EXO	34	20	j4tv	figs-explicit	בְ⁠שֶׂ֔ה…וַ⁠עֲרַפְתּ֑⁠וֹ	1	buy back	You may need to make explicit that either the **lamb** or **donkey** must be killed, as in the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EXO	34	20	c5ow		לֹ֥א תִפְדֶּ֖ה	1	buy back	Alternate translation: “you do not ransom the donkey”
EXO	34	20	yz8x		כֹּ֣ל בְּכ֤וֹר בָּנֶ֨י⁠ךָ֙ תִּפְדֶּ֔ה	1	buy back	Firstborn sons and firstborn donkeys belonged to Yahweh, but Yahweh did not want them sacrificed to Him. Instead, the Israelites were to sacrifice a lamb in their place. This allowed the Israelites to buy the donkeys and sons back from Yahweh.
EXO	34	20	u2p5	figs-doublenegatives	וְ⁠לֹֽא־יֵרָא֥וּ פָנַ֖⁠י רֵיקָֽם	1	No one may appear before me empty-handed	Here understatement is used to emphasize that the Israelites must bring a suitable offering to Yahweh. This portion of the verse is identical to the end of [Exodus 23:15](../23/15.md). Alternate translation: “come to me without a proper offering” or “always bring an offering to me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
EXO	34	21	w9ed			0	General Information:	This command is similar to that in [Exodus 20:9](../20/09.md).
EXO	34	21	n2ka	translate-ordinal	וּ⁠בַ⁠יּ֥וֹם הַ⁠שְּׁבִיעִ֖י	1	General Information:	Alternate translation: “but on day seven” Here **seventh** is the ordinal number for 7. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
EXO	34	21	swm8		בֶּ⁠חָרִ֥ישׁ וּ⁠בַ⁠קָּצִ֖יר	1	Even at plowing time and in harvest	Alternate translation: “Even when you are preparing the soil or gathering the crops”
EXO	34	22	lhxb			0	Festival of Ingathering	This verse is similar to [Exodus 23:16](../23/16.md), however the first festival is named **Festival of Weeks** here and “Festival of the Harvest” in 23:16.
EXO	34	22	d13l		וְ⁠חַג֙ הָֽ⁠אָסִ֔יף	1	Festival of Ingathering	This festival celebrated the final harvesting of all the crops for the year. This festival was also known as the Festival of Shelters or the Festival of Booths. The idea came from the practice of the farmers living in temporary booths, or huts, out in the fields to guard the crop as it ripened. See Deuteronomy 16:13. See how you translated this in [Exodus 23:16](../23/16.md). Alternate translation: “and the Festival of the Ingathering”
EXO	34	22	xqy4	figs-metaphor	תְּקוּפַ֖ת הַ⁠שָּׁנָֽה	1	Festival of Ingathering	Like “the exiting of the year” in [Exodus 23:16](../23/16.md), this refers to the end of the year. Here, the year is pictured as something that can turn. Which, thinking of the planet, is highly astronomically accurate. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EXO	34	23	zh58			0	General Information:	Except for **God of Israel** and dropping “to,” this verse is identical to [Exodus 23:17](../23/17.md).
EXO	34	23	iagy	figs-metonymy	יֵרָאֶה֙…אֶת־פְּנֵ֛י הָֽ⁠אָדֹ֥ן	1	General Information:	Here to **appear before the face of the Lord Yahweh** means to gather to worship. **Before the face** is a metonym for Yahweh’s presence, referring to worship. Alternate translation: “must come to worship the Lord” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EXO	34	25	zx2v			0	General Information:	See the very similar [Exodus 23:18](../23/18.md).
EXO	34	25	e8v2	figs-explicit	דַּם־זִבְחִ֑⁠י	1	the blood of my sacrifice	The fact that the blood is from an animal can be stated clearly. Alternate translation: “the blood of an animal that you sacrifice to me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EXO	34	26	bv0a			0	the blood of my sacrifice	This verse is identical to [Exodus 23:19](../23/19.md).
EXO	34	27	x6j9		כִּ֞י עַל־פִּ֣י׀ הַ⁠דְּבָרִ֣ים הָ⁠אֵ֗לֶּה	1	the blood of my sacrifice	Alternate translation: “for in accordance with these words” or “for according to these words”
EXO	34	27	ybz6	figs-idiom	כָּרַ֧תִּי אִתְּ⁠ךָ֛ בְּרִ֖ית	1	the blood of my sacrifice	See how you translated this in [verse 12](../34/12.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EXO	34	28	j9t4	translate-numbers	עֲשֶׂ֖רֶת	1	forty days	Alternate translation: “10” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])
EXO	34	28	wt1c		אַרְבָּעִ֥ים יוֹם֙ וְ⁠אַרְבָּעִ֣ים לַ֔יְלָה	1	for forty days and nights	Alternate translation: “for 40 days, including the nights”
EXO	34	28	yun2	writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יִּכְתֹּ֣ב	1	He wrote	Here, **he** probably refers to Moses, based on Yahweh’s command in the previous verse. However, [Exodus 34:1](../34/01.md) opens the possibility that Yahweh wrote. It is best to leave it ambiguous, but if you must specify, saying Moses is better. Alternate translation: “Moses wrote” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
EXO	34	29	t1s0	writing-newevent	וַ⁠יְהִ֗י	1	had become radiant	This marks a change of scene which you should mark in a natural way in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])

If this would be misunderstood you may need to state it only once in translation as in the UST. Alternate translation: “Then Moses came down from Mount Sinai. As he was coming down from the mountain, he was carrying the two tablets of the testimony in his hands.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
EXO	34	29	yagj	figs-infostructure	וּ⁠מֹשֶׁ֣ה לֹֽא־יָדַ֗ע כִּ֥י קָרַ֛ן ע֥וֹר פָּנָ֖י⁠ו בְּ⁠דַבְּר֥⁠וֹ אִתּֽ⁠וֹ	1	had become radiant	In some languages it will make more sense to state that Moses’ **face shone** before saying that he **did not know that** as in the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
EXO	34	29	d9zk		קָרַ֛ן	1	had become radiant	Alternate translation: “became radiant”
EXO	34	30	yn9s	grammar-connect-logic-result	וַ⁠יִּֽירְא֖וּ	1	had become radiant	They were afraid because of his bright face. Alternate translation: “because of that, they were afraid” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])

EXO	34	34	fzm1	grammar-connect-time-background		0	he would remove	This and the next verse give a general statement about Moses’s practice for an unstated amount of time (it was probably from this point until his death as he continued to talk to Yahweh). You should mark this with a form in your language that is used for on-going action like **would** and the UST’s “Whenever.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background]])
EXO	34	34	m1sv	figs-activepassive	יְצֻוֶּֽה	1	what he was commanded	If your language does not use the passive form in this way you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

EXO	35	intro	lew9			0		# Exodus 35 General Notes<br><br>## Translation issues in this chapter<br><br><br>- In the last chapter some repetition of Yahweh’s instructions began, mostly around the covenant commands. Starting in this chapter and even more so in chapter 36, the commands regarding the construction of the tabernacle complex are repeated, often word for word, from chapters 25-31. In many verses the only difference will be a change of verb form from instruction to completion. As much as possible, these parallels will be pointed out for the translators with links to the previous verses. Translators should refer back to the previously translated verses for consistency and because notes in this section may not cover everything that was covered in the initial instruction section.<br>- Many items, materials, and processes for building the tabernacle may be unknown, but should have already been addressed in chapters 25-31.<br><br><br>## Structure<br><br>- v. 1-3: reiteration of Sabbath command<br>- v. 4-9: list of materials for donation (see [Exodus 25:1-7](../25/01.md))<br>- v. 10-19: things they need to make for the tabernacle complex<br>- v. 20-29: the people bring all the things listed<br>- v. 30-36:1: appointing of lead craftsmen to build these things

The people of Israel did everything	Here, **thus they did** parallels the whole rest of the sentence. Like the doubling of the terms for **tabernacle** this brings the narrative of building to an emphatic conclusion. If this sort of parallelism would convey a meaning other than this emphatic conclusion in your language you may need to use another natural way to close the narrative with emphasis on the Israelites complete obedience.

The people of Israel did everything	This verse starts a short narrative of the Israelites bringing and presenting the items for the tabernacle to Moses for inspection. It is a summary of the construction and extended conclusion to the last few chapters. Your team may need to decide how to group verse 32 as it both closes the construction narrative and introduces this next section which ends with a very similar summary statement in [verses 42-43](../39/42.md).

The two interchangeable terms are brought together throughout this chapter in a poetic doubling to bring book to a close. If your readers would find this confusing you may need to simplify to one or expand in explanation like in the UST.<br>- This chapter says that Moses did all these things. Just like Bezalel in earlier chapters, it would have been impossible for him to do all this personally. The people helped him set up the tabernacle. In many translations this will more more clear if you make this explicit.<br>- “Yahweh’s glory filled the tabernacle”: This phrase indicates that Yahweh began to dwell within the tabernacle, among Israel, in a special way.

If doubling the words like this would not create this strengthening and marking as exclusive meaning in your language, you may need to find another way to express that this item would become uniquely holy.

The people helped him set up the tabernacle. In many translations this will more more clear if you make this explicit. This applies from here to all the tabernacle assembly listing through [verse 33](../40/33.md).

If your readers might misunderstand this you could use a metaphor from your language or translate the meaning. This is a common biblical metaphor, so you may want to check other places this occurs. The **house of Israel** is equivalent to “sons of Israel” or “Israelites.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
