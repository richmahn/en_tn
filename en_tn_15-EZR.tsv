EZR	front	intro	fa5r			0		# Introduction to Ezra<br>## Part 1: General Introduction<br><br>### Outline of Ezra<br><br>1. The first Jewish exiles return to Jerusalem from Persia (1:1–2:70)<br>1. The people rebuild and dedicate the temple in Jerusalem (3:1–6:22)<br>1. More exiles return; Ezra teaches the Law of Yahweh (7:1-8:36)<br>1. The problem of the people marrying foreigners, and how it is solved (9:1–10:44)<br><br>### What is the Book of Ezra about?<br><br>The Book of Ezra is about how the people of Israel returned from Babylon and tried to worship Yahweh again as the law required. To do this they needed to rebuild their temple so they could sacrifice to Yahweh. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/temple]])<br><br>### How should the title of this book be translated?<br><br>The Book of Ezra is named for the priest Ezra who led the first group of Jews out of exile and back to Judah. Translators can use the traditional title “Ezra.” Or they might choose a clearer title, such as “The Book about Ezra.”<br><br>## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts<br><br>### Why were Israelites not allowed to marry people from other nations?<br><br>Foreigners worshiped many false gods. Yahweh did not allow his people to marry foreigners. He knew this would cause the people of Israel to worship false gods. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/falsegod]])<br><br>### Did all of the people of Israel return to their homeland?<br><br>Many of the Jews remained in Babylon instead of returning to the Promised Land. Many of them were successful in Babylon and desired to remain there. However, this meant that they were unable to worship Yahweh in Jerusalem as their ancestors had done. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/promisedland]])<br><br>## Part 3: Important Translation Issues<br><br>### How does the Book of Ezra use the term “Israel”?<br><br>The Book of Ezra uses the term “Israel” to refer to the kingdom of Judah. It was mostly made up of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin. The other ten tribes had ended their loyalty to any kings descended from David. God allowed the Assyrians to conquer the other ten tribes and take them into exile. As a result, they mixed with other people groups and did not return to the land of Israel. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/israel]])<br><br>### Are the events in the Book of Ezra told in the order that they actually happened?<br><br>Some of the events in the Book of Ezra are not told in the order they actually happened. Translators should pay attention to notes that signal when events are probably out of order.
EZR	1	intro	dd25			0		# Ezra 01 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>The chapter records the story of the first Jews as they return from Persia to Judea.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### King Cyrus<br>King Cyrus allowed them to return because he wanted them to rebuild the temple. Those who stayed behind gave gifts to those who left to help them on their journey and resettlement. This practice was common under the reign of Cyrus and was used as a way to maintain peace throughout his kingdom. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/temple]])<br><br>## Possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br>### Jews<br>Upon return to Judea, the focus of the rest of the Old Testament is on the Jewish people.

This speaks of Yahweh causing Cyrus to want to act as if he “stirred” his spirit. Alternate translation: “Yahweh…made Cyrus want to act” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EZR	1	1	yiq4	figs-metonymy	וַ⁠יַּֽעֲבֶר־קוֹל֙ בְּ⁠כָל־מַלְכוּת֔⁠וֹ	1	his voice went out throughout all his kingdom	The voice is a metonym for the message the voice speaks, and the kingdom is a metonym for the people whom a king rules. Alternate translation: “Cyrus sent a message to everyone over whom he ruled” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EZR	1	1	x1wz	figs-activepassive	בְּ⁠מִכְתָּ֖ב לֵ⁠אמֹֽר	1	what was written was spoken	This can be translated in active form. It might be best to translate so the reader understands that other people might have helped Cyrus get the message to the people over whom he ruled. Alternate translation: “what Cyrus wrote and what his messengers read so people could hear them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EZR	1	2	aqj5	figs-hyperbole	מַמְלְכ֣וֹת הָ⁠אָ֔רֶץ	1	all the kingdoms of the earth	Here “all” is an exaggeration, as there were kingdoms over which Cyrus did not rule. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

EZR	6	intro	y5d8			0		# Ezra 06 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>The completion of the story of the building of the temple and re-establishment of the temple worship occurs in this chapter. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/temple]])<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Temple taxes<br>The king said the Jews were right and ordered money from his taxes to be used to help them with their sacrifices.<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br>### Darius<br>In this chapter, Darius is called the king of Assyria. In reality, besides ruling over the former Assyrian Empire, Darius was also king of Persia. Persia had conquered Babylon, which had previously conquered Assyria. This made the king of Persia, the king of Assyria as well. It was unusual to refer to Darius as the king or ruler of Assyria. Ezra may have referred to him in this way to contrast Darius’ actions with those of the former rulers of Assyria, who had treated the Jews very cruelly. It was those earlier Assyrian rulers who had conquered the northern tribes of Israel and deported them to other lands. It was for this reasons that the northern tribes lost their identity and were no longer a distinct people group.
