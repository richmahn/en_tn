# Ah, Yahweh

The word "Ah" expresses Jonah's feeling of frustration.

# is this not just what I said when I was back in my own country?

Jonah used this rhetorical question to show God how angry he was. Also, what Jonah said when he was back in his own country can be stated explicitly. AT: "When I was still in my own country I knew that if I warned the people of Nineveh, they would repent, and you would not destroy them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# abounding in covenant faithfulness

"very faithful" or "you love people very much"

# you hold back from sending disaster

This means "you say that you will send disaster on sinners, but then you decide not to." AT: "you decide not to punish people who sin"
