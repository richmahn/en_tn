# should I not have compassion for Nineveh, that great city ... cattle?

# in which there are more

# one hundred and twenty thousand people

120,000 people (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])

# who do not know the difference between their right hand and their left hand

This may be a way of saying "they cannot tell the difference between right and wrong."

# also many cattle
