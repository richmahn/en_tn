# Ah, Yahweh

The word "Ah" expresses Jonah's feeling of frustration.

# is this not just what I said when I was back in my own country?

Jonah used this rhetorical question to show God how angry he was. Also, what Jonah said when he was back in his own country can be stated explicitly. AT: "When I was still in my own country I knew that if I warned the people of Nineveh, they would repent, and you would not destroy them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# I acted first and tried to flee to Tarshish

Possible meanings are 1) "I tried to prevent this by fleeing to Tarshish" or 2) "I acted quickly and tried to flee to Tarshish" or 3) "I did all I could to flee to Tarshish."

# abounding in covenant faithfulness

"very faithful" or "you love people very much"

# you hold back from sending disaster

This means "you say that you will send disaster on sinners, but then you decide not to." AT: "you decide not to punish people who sin"

# take my life from me

Jonah's reason for wanting to die can be stated explicitly. AT: "since you will not destroy Nineveh as you said you would, please allow me to die" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# for it is better for me to die than to live

"I would prefer to die than live" or "because I want to die. I do not want to live"
