## God prepared a hot east wind ##

This can be translated as “God caused a hot wind from the east to blow on Jonah.” If your word for wind can only mean a cool or cold wind, then it might work to translate it like this: “God sent a very hot warmth from the east to Jonah.”

## the sun beat down - " ##

"**the sun was very hot"

## on Jonah's head ##

Jonah may have felt the heat most on his head. It can also be translated as "on Jonah" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

## he became faint ##

This could be translated as “he became very weak” or “he lost his strength.”

## It is better for me to die than to live. ##

See how you translated this in [Jonah 4:1](./01.md).

## Is it good that you are so angry about the plant? ##

God used a rhetorical question to scold Jonah for being angry that the plant died but wanting God to kill the people of Nineveh.. In some languages it is more natural to use a statement. "Your anger about the plant dying is not good." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]]) You should be more concerned about the people in Nineveh dying than about the plant dying. (See; [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

## even to death-  ##

**  "Now I am angry enough to die!" (UDB)
