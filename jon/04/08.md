# God prepared a hot east wind

God caused a hot wind from the east to blow on Jonah. If wind can only mean a cool or cold wind then you can try this. Alternate translation: "God sent a very hot warmth from the east to Jonah" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# the sun beat down

"the sun was very hot"

# on Jonah's head

Jonah may have felt the heat most on his head. Alternate translation: "on Jonah" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# he became faint

"he became very weak" or "he lost his strength"

# It is better for me to die than to live

"I would prefer to die than live" or "Because I want to die. I do not want to live." See how you translated this in [Jonah 4:3](./03.md).
