## translationNotes

* **God prepared a hot east wind** - This can be translated as “God caused a hot wind from the east to blow on Jonah.” If your word for wind can only mean a cool or cold wind, then it might work to translate it like this: “God sent a very hot warmth from the east to Jonah.”
* **the sun beat down - "** - "<b>the sun was very hot"
* **on Jonah's head** - Jonah may have felt the heat most on his head. It can also be translated as "on Jonah" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
* **he became faint** - This could be translated as “he became very weak” or “he lost his strength.”
* **It is better for me to die than to live.** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:jon:04:01]].
* **Is it good that you are so angry about the plant?** - God used a rhetorical question to scold Jonah for being angry that the plant died but wanting God to kill the people of Nineveh.. In some languages it is more natural to use a statement. "Your anger about the plant dying is not good." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]]) You should be more concerned about the people in Nineveh dying than about the plant dying. (See; [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
* **even to death- ** - <b>even to death- <b>  "Now I am angry enough to die!" (UDB)
