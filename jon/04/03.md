# take my life from me

Jonah's reason for wanting to die can be stated explicitly. AT: "since you will not destroy Nineveh as you said you would, please allow me to die" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# for it is better for me to die than to live

"I would prefer to die than live" or "because I want to die. I do not want to live"
