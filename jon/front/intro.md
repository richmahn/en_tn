#### What is the Book of Jonah about? ####

This book is a narrative about the prophet Jonah. The purpose of this book is to tell how God showed mercy and grace to Gentiles.
It also tells how the Ninevites were willing to repent and to call out to Yahweh for mercy. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/mercy]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/grace]], and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/repent]])

God sent Jonah to warn the people of Nineveh that he was about to punish them. God said that if they would repent he would not harm them. However, Jonah was an Israeite and he did not want God to forgive the Ninevites. So, he tried to sail away in the opposite direction instead of doing what God told him to do. But, God stopped him by sending a large fish to swallow him. 

Eventually, Jonah repented and went to warn the Ninevites. As a result, God taught him a lesson about his love for all human beings, not just the Israelites.

#### How should the title of this book be translated? ####

During the time of Jonah, Assyria was the most powerful kingdom in the ancient Near East. It was known for its cruelty to its enemies. Eventually, God punished the Assyrians for the wicked things they did.
