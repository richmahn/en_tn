Why people put on sackcloth can be stated more clearly. AT: "They also put on coarse cloth to show that they were sorry for having sinned" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# from the greatest of them down to the least of them

"from the most significant to the least significant people" or "including all the important people and all the unimportant people"
