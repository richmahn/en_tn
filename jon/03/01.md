## The word of Yahweh came to Jonah ##

See how you translated this in [Jonah 1:1](../01/01.md).

## Get up, go to Nineveh, that great city ##

“Go to the important city of Nineveh”​

## proclaim to it the message that I command you to give ##

"tell the people what I tell you to tell them"

## So Jonah got up and went to Nineveh in obedience to the word of Yahweh ##

"This time Jonah obeyed Yahweh and went to Nineveh"

## Now ##

This word is used here to mark a change from the story to information about Nineveh.

## one of three days’ journey ##

"a city of three days' journey". AT: "A person had to walk for three days to completely go through it." (UDB)
