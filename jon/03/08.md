* This is a continuation of what the king told the people of Nineveh.
* **But let both** - "Let both"
* **animal** - The word "animal" refers to animals that people own.
* **let both man and animal be covered with sackcloth** - This can be translated with an active clause: "let people and animals wear sackcloth" or "let people cover themselves and their animals with sackcloth" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
* **cry out loudly to God** - "pray earnestly to God." What they were to pray for can be made explicit: "cry out loudly to God and ask for mercy." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
* **the violence that is in his hands** - This means "the violent things that he does"
* **Who knows?** - The king used this rhetorical question to get the people to think about something that they might not have thought possibleâ€”that if they would stop sinning, God might not kill them. It could be translated as a statement: "We do not know." Or it could be stated as a word and be part of the next sentence: "Perhaps." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **God may relent and change his mind** - This can be translated as "God may decide to do something different" or "God may not do what he said he will do."
