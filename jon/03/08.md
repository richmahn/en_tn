# General Information:

This is a continuation of what the king told the people of Nineveh.

# But let both

"Let both"

# let both man and animal be covered with sackcloth

This can be stated in active form. AT: "let people and animals wear sackcloth" or "let people cover themselves and their animals with sackcloth" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# animal

The word "animal" refers to animals that people own.

# cry out loudly to God

"pray earnestly to God." What they were to pray for can be made explicit. AT: "cry out loudly to God and ask for mercy" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# the violence that is in his hands

This means "the violent things that he does"

# Who knows?

The king used this rhetorical question to get the people to think about something that they might not have thought possible, that if they would stop sinning, God might not kill them. It could be translated as a statement: "We do not know." Or it could be stated as a word and be part of the next sentence: "Perhaps." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# God may relent and change his mind

"God may decide to do something different" or "God may not do what he said he will do"

# we do not perish

"we do not die." Here perish equates to drowning at sea.
