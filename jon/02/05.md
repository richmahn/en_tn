This is a continuation of Jonah's prayer that started in [Jonah 2:1](./01.md).

## The waters ##

"The waters" refers to the sea.

## to take my life ##

"and were about to kill me."

## the deep was all around me ##

"the deep water was all around me"

## seaweed ##

"grass that grows in the sea"

## The earth with its bars closed upon me for ever ##

Jonah used a metaphor to compare the earth to a prison. It can also be translated as a simile. “The earth was like a prison that was about to lock me in forever.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## Yet you brought up my life from the pit ##

"But you saved my life from the place of the dead" or "But you saved me from the place where the dead people are"

## O Yahweh, my God! ##

In some languages it may be more natural to put this at the beginning of the sentence or next to the word "you".
