# General Information:

This is a continuation of Jonah's prayer that started in [Jonah 2:2](./01.md).

# The waters

"The waters" refers to the sea.

# my neck

Some versions understand the Hebrew word in this expression to mean "my life." In that interpretation, the waters were about to take away Jonah's life.

# the deep was all around me

"the deep water was all around me"

# seaweed

grass that grows in the sea

# the earth with its bars closed upon me forever

Jonah used a metaphor to compare the earth to a prison. AT: "the earth was like a prison that was about to lock me in forever" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Yet you brought up my life from the pit

Jonah speaks of the place of the dead as if it were a pit. AT: "But you saved my life from the place of the dead" or "But you saved me from the place where the dead people are" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Yahweh, my God!

In some languages, it may be more natural to put this at the beginning of the sentence or next to the word "you."
