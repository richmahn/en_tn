This is a continuation of Jonah's prayer that started in [Jonah 2:1](./01.md).

## But as for me, I ##

This expression in English shows that there is a contrast between the people Jonah had just spoken about and himself. They paid attention to useless gods but he would worship Yahweh. It can also be translated as "But I."

## I will sacrifice to you with a voice of thanksgiving ##

This means that Jonah would thank God while he offered a sacrifice to him. It is not clear whether Jonah planned to thank God by singing or shouting joyfully.

## Salvation comes from Yahweh ##

"Salvation" is a noun. Its meaning can also be expressed with a verb: Yahweh is the one who saves people."

## upon the dry land ##

"upon the ground" or "onto the shore"
