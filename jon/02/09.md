# General Information:

This is a continuation of Jonah's prayer that started in [Jonah 2:2](./01.md).

# But as for me, I

This expression in English shows that there is a contrast between the people Jonah had just spoken about and himself. They paid attention to useless gods, but he would worship Yahweh. AT: "But I"

# I will sacrifice to you with a voice of thanksgiving

This means that Jonah would thank God while he offered a sacrifice to him. It is not clear whether Jonah planned to thank God by singing or shouting joyfully.

# Salvation comes from Yahweh

This can be reworded so that the abstract noun "salvation" is expressed as the verb "save." "Yahweh is the one who saves people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# upon the dry land

"upon the ground" or "onto the shore"
