# General Information:

This is a continuation of Jonah's prayer that started in [Jonah 2:2](./01.md).

# I called Yahweh to mind

Since Jonah was praying to Yahweh, it might be more clear in some languages to say "I thought about you, Yahweh" or "Yahweh, I thought about you."

# then my prayer came to you, to your holy temple

Jonah speaks as if his prayers could travel to God and his temple. AT: "then you in your holy temple heard my prayer" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
