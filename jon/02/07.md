This is a continuation of Jonah's prayer that started in [Jonah 2:1](./01.md).

## I remembered Yahweh ##

Since Jonah was praying to Yahweh, it might be more clear in some languages to say "I thought about you, Yahweh"  or "Yahweh, I thought about you." (UDB)

## then my prayer came to you, to your holy temple ##

"then you in your holy temple heard my prayer"

## Those who pay attention to useless gods ##

"People who pay attention to useless gods"

## reject your faithfulness toward themselves ##

"are rejecting you, who would be faithful to them"
