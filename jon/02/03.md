# General Information:

This is a continuation of Jonah's prayer that started in [Jonah 2:2](../02/02.md). In verse 4 Jonah spoke of something he had prayed before this prayer.

# into the depths, into the heart of the seas

This speaks of the vastness of the ocean Jonah was in. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# into the heart of the seas

"to the bottom of the sea"

# the currents surrounded me

"the sea water closed in around me"

# waves and billows

These are disturbances on the surface of the ocean. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
