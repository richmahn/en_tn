This is a continuation of Jonah's prayer that started in [Jonah 2:1](./01.md).  In verse 4 Jonah spoke of something he had prayed before this prayer.

## into the heart of the seas ##

"to the bottom of the sea"

## the currents surrounded me ##

"the sea water closed in around me"

## I am driven out ##

This can be translated with an active clause: "You have driven me away" or "You have sent me away." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## from before your eyes ##

"from you." When Jonah said "your eyes" he was speaking about all of Yahweh. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

## How can I ever again gaze at your holy temple?" ##

Jonah used this rhetorical question to show how sad he was that he would never see Yahweh's temple again. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
