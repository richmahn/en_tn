# General Information:

This is a continuation of Jonah's prayer that started in [Jonah 2:2](./01.md). In verse 4 Jonah spoke of something he had prayed before this prayer.

# into the depths, into the heart of the seas

This speaks of the vastness of the ocean Jonah was in. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# into the heart of the seas

"to the bottom of the sea"

# the currents surrounded me

"the sea water closed in around me"

# waves and billows

These are disturbances on the surface of the ocean. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# I am driven out

This can be stated in active form. AT: "You have driven me away" or "You have sent me away" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# from before your eyes

Here Yahweh is represented by his "eyes." AT: "from you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# yet I will again look toward your holy temple

Jonah has hope that, in spite of all he is going through, he will see the temple. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
