## translationNotes

* **Then they said to Jonah** - "Then the men who were working on the ship said to Jonah"
* **Please tell us who is the cause of this evil that is happening to us.** - "Who caused this bad thing that is happening to us?"
* **What is this that you have done?** - The men on the ship used this rhetorical question to show how upset they were with Jonah. This could also be translated as "Why have you done this?" or "You have done a terrible thing." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **he was running away from the presence of Yahweh** - "Jonah was running away from Yahweh"
* **because he had told them** - What Jonah said can be made explicit: "because he had told them 'I am trying to get away from Yahweh.'" In the UDB, "I am trying to get away from Yahweh" appears with the rest of the things Jonah said to them. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
