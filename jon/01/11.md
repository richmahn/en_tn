# they said to Jonah

"the men on the ship said to Jonah" or "the sailors said to Jonah"

# do to you so that the sea will calm down

"do with you in order to make the sea become calm"

# the sea became more and more violent

This was the reason that the men asked Jonah what they should do. This reason can also be put at the beginning of verse 11 as in the UDB.

# for I know that it is because of me that this great storm is happening to you

"because I know this huge storm is my fault"

# Nevertheless, the men rowed hard to get them back to the land

The men did not want to throw Jonah into the sea, so they rowed hard as if they were digging into the water to get back to land. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# the sea was becoming more and more violent

"the storm became worse, and the waves became bigger"
