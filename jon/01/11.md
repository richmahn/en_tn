## they said to Jonah ##

"the men on the ship said to Jonah" or "the sailors said to Jonah"

## do to you so that the sea will calm down ##

"do with you in order to make the sea become calm" (UDB)

## the sea became more and more violent ##

This was the reason that the men asked Jonah what they should do. The reason can also be at the beginning of the verse 11 it is in the UDB.

## for I know that it is because of me that this great storm is happening to you ##

"because I know this large storm is my fault"

## Nevertheless, the men rowed hard to get them back to the land ##

The reason they did this can be stated explicitly: "But the men did not want to throw Jonah into the sea, so they rowed hard to get back to land." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

## sea grew more and more violent ##

"the storm became worse and the waves became bigger"
