# they said to Jonah

"the men on the ship said to Jonah" or "the sailors said to Jonah"

# do to you so that the sea will calm down

"do with you in order to make the sea become calm"

# the sea became more and more violent

This was the reason that the men asked Jonah what they should do. This reason can also be put at the beginning of verse 11 as in the UDB.
