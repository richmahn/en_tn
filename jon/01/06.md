# So the captain came to him and said to him

"The man in charge of the ship went to Jonah and said"

# What are you doing sleeping?

"Why are you sleeping?" He used this rhetorical question to scold Jonah. Alternate translation: "Stop sleeping!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Get up!

This refers to doing some activity. For Jonah, the Captain is telling him to wake up and pray to his god for safe passage. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# Call upon your god!

"Pray to your god!" "Call" refers to getting the attention of someone. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# Maybe your god will notice us and we will not perish

The implicit information that Jonah's god might save them could be made explicit. Alternate translation: "Maybe your god will hear and save us so that we will not die" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
