# Leviticus 01 General Notes

#### Structure and formatting

In Hebrew, this chapter begins with the word "and" indicating a connection with the previous book (Exodus). The first five books of the Bible should be seen as a single unit.

#### Special concepts in this chapter

##### Atonement
In order to offer a sacrifice for the people, the priest first had to make an atonement for himself, in order to make himself clean. Only then would he be clean and be allowed to perform a sacrifice. These sacrificed animals had to be perfect, the best of all of the animals. A person was not allowed to bring an inferior animal to be sacrificed to Yahweh. These sacrifices also had to be offered in a very specific way. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/atonement]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/priest]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/clean]])
