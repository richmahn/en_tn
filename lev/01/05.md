# General Information:

Yahweh continues telling Moses what the people must do.

# Then he must kill the bull

Here "he" refers to the one making the offering. It can be stated in second person. Alternate translation: "Then you must kill the bull" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# before Yahweh

"in the presence of Yahweh"

# will present the blood

It is implied that the priests would catch the blood in a bowl as it drained out of the animal. Then they would bring the bowl with the blood in it and present it to Yahweh at the altar. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
