# Then he must skin the burnt offering and cut it to pieces

As indicated in 1:9, the person must also wash the inner parts and the legs of the animal with water. The person would do this before giving the pieces to the priests so they could place them on the altar. As in the UDB, you can state here the instructions to wash the inner parts and legs. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-events]])

# Then he must skin

Here "he" refers to the one making the offering.
