# lay his hand on the head

This is a symbolic action that identifies the person with the animal he is offering. In this way the person is offering himself through the animal to Yahweh, so that God will forgive the person's sins when they kill the animal. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
