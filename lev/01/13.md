See how you translated many of these words in [Leviticus 1:9](./09.md).

# Then the priest will offer the whole, and burn it on the altar

"Then the priest will burn everything on the altar"

# it will produce a sweet aroma for

Yahweh being pleased with the sincere worshiper who offered the sacrifice is spoken of as if God were pleased with the aroma of the burning sacrifice. See how you translated this in [Leviticus 1:9](../01/09.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# it will be an offering made to him by fire

Yahweh tells Moses that the priests must burn their offerings with fire. This can be translated in active form. Alternate translation: "it will be a burnt offering to me" or "it will be a burnt offering to Yahweh" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
