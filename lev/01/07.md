# General Information:

Yahweh continues telling Moses what the people must do so their offerings will be acceptable to him.

# will put fire on the altar and arrange wood on the fire

This may mean that the priests placed hot coals on the altar, then placed the wood on the coals. Or you may need to reorder this as in the UST. Alternate translation: "will put wood on the altar and light a fire" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-events]])
