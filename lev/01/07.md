Yahweh continues telling Moses what the people must do.

## to feed the fire ##

AT: "to keep the fire burning" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

## he must wash ##

Here "he" refers to the one making the offering.

## an offering made to me by fire ##

AT: "a burnt offering to me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
