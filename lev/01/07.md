# General Information:

Yahweh continues telling Moses what the people must do so their offerings will be acceptable to him.

# will put fire on the altar and place wood to feed the fire

This may mean that the priests placed hot coals on the altar, then placed the wood on the coals. Or you may need to reorder this as in the UDB. AT: "will put wood on the altar and light a fire" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-events]])

# to feed the fire

This is an idiom that means to keep putting wood in the fire. Translate this idiom so it is understood that the fire on the altar must be kept burning. AT: "to keep the fire burning" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
