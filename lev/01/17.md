# it will produce a sweet aroma for Yahweh

Yahweh being pleased with the sincere worshiper who offered the sacrifice is spoken of as if God were pleased with the aroma of the burning sacrifice. See how you translated this in [Leviticus 1:9](../01/09.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# it will be an offering made to him by fire

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "it will be a burnt offering to me" or "it will be a burnt offering to Yahweh" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
