# General Information:

Yahweh continues telling Moses what the people must do.

# He is to cut it

Here "he" refers to the person offering the sacrifice. It can be stated in second person. Alternate translation: "Then you must cut it" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# pieces ... head ... fat ... on the wood that is on the fire that is on the altar

See how you translated these words in [Leviticus 1:7-9](./07.md).
