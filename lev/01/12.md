Yahweh continues telling Moses what the people must do.

## Then he must cut...made to him by fire ##

For 1:12-13 see how you translated many of these words in [Leviticus 1:7](./07.md).

## it will be an offering made to him by fire ##

AT: "it will be a burnt offering to me" or "it will be a burnt offering to Yahweh" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
