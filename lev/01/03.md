# General Information:

Yahweh continues telling Moses what the people must do so that their sacrifices will be acceptable to Yahweh.

# If his offering ... he must offer

Here "his" and "he" refer to the person bringing an offering to Yahweh. It can be translated in the second person as it is in [Leviticus 1:2](../01/02.md). Alternate translation: "If your offering ... you must offer" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# so that it may be accepted before Yahweh

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "so that Yahweh will accept it" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
