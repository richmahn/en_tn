# Then the land will enjoy its Sabbaths

The people were supposed to obey the Sabbath law by not farming the land every seventh year. God speaks about this as if the land were a person that would obey the Sabbath law and rest. Alternate translation: "Then the land will rest according to the Sabbath law" or "Then, as required by the Sabbath law, the land will not be farmed" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
