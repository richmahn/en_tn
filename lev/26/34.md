## translationNotes

* **Then the land will enjoy its Sabbaths** - Yahweh speaks about the land as if it were a person resting from work. This means that while the people are in exile no one will plant seed and grow crops. This allows the land to rest. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
* **so that even the sound of a leaf blowing in the wind will startle them** - This is an exaggeration that emphasizes that the people will become very afraid even of things that do not matter. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
