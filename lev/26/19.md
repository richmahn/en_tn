# I will break your pride in your power

Using force to cause them not to be proud is spoken of as if he were to break their pride. Alternate translation: "I will punish you and so end the pride that you feel about your power" or "I will punish you so that you will no longer be proud of your power" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# I will make the sky over you like iron and your land like bronze

This means God will stop the rain from falling from the sky. This will make the ground hard so that people cannot plant seed or grow crops. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
