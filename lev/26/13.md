# I have broken the bars of your yoke

God speaks of their slavery as if they had to wear a yoke that animals wear in order to do hard work. Breaking the bars of the yoke represents setting them free. AT: "I have set you free from the hard labor they made you do" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
