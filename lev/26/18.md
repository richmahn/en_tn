## seven times ##

Here, "seven times" is not literal. It means Yahweh will multiply how severely he will punish them.

## I will break your pride in your power ##

"I will punish you so that you no longer take pride in your own power"

## I will make the sky over you like iron and your land like bronze ##

This means Yahweh will stop the rain from falling from the sky. This will make the ground hard so that people cannot plant seed or grow crops. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

## Your strength will be used up for nothing ##

AT: "Your hard work will be for nothing" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
