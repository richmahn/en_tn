# walk in my laws and keep my commandments and obey them

These are three ways of saying the same thing. They emphasize that the people must obey everything that God commands them to do. Alternate translation: "If you carefully obey my laws and commands" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# walk in my laws

Behaving according to the laws is spoken of as if they were to walk in the laws. Alternate translation: "If you behave according to my laws" or "if you live according to my laws" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
