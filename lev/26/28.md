# I will walk against you

Walking represents behavior. Walking against someone represents opposing him or fighting against him. AT: "I will oppose you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# I will punish you even seven more times as much

Here "seven more times" is not literal. It means Yahweh will increase the severity of his punishment. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
