# I will turn your cities into ruins and destroy your sanctuaries

Because God would send armies to do these things, he speaks as if he would do them. AT: "I will send enemy armies to turn your cities into ruins and destroy your sanctuaries" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# your sanctuaries

These were places where people worshiped idols instead of God.

# I will not be pleased with the aroma of your offerings

Normally the Lord's pleasure with the aroma represents his pleasure with those who burn the offering. But in this case, people would burn offerings, but God would not be pleased with them. AT: "You will burn offerings, but I will not be pleased with you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
