# they will fall before you by the sword

Here "falling" represents dying, and "the sword" represents either attacking people with a sword or battle in general. AT: "they will die when you attack them with the sword" or "you will kill them in battle" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# Five of you will chase away a hundred, and a hundred of you will chase ten thousand

This means the Israelites will have victory against larger armies.

# Five ... hundred ... ten thousand

"5 ... 100 ... 10,000" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])
