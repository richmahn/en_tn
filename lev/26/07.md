# they will fall before you by the sword

Here "falling" represents dying, and "the sword" represents either attacking people with a sword or battle in general. Alternate translation: "they will die when you attack them with the sword" or "you will kill them in battle" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
