# your enemies' land will itself devour you

Yahweh speaks about the enemies' land as if it were a wild animal that would eat the Israelites. The word "devour" emphasizes that most of the Israelites will die there. Alternate translation: "you will die in your enemies' land" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
