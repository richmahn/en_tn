# General Information:

Yahweh continues describing what will happen to the Israelites when they are forced to go to their enemies' countries.

# as though you were running from the sword

The sword represents either someone who is ready to kill using a sword or an attack from an enemy army. Alternate translation: "as though you were running away from someone who was chasing you with a sword" or "as though you were running away from an enemy army" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# to stand before your enemies

Standing before the enemies represents not falling when the enemies attack and fighting against them. Alternate translation: "to resist your enemies when they attack you" or "to fight back against your enemies" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
