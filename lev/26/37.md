# General Information:

Yahweh continues describing what will happen to the Israelites when they are forced to go to their enemies' countries.

# as though you were running from the sword

The sword represents either someone who is ready to kill using a sword or an attack from an enemy army. AT: "as though you were running away from someone who was chasing you with a sword" or "as though you were running away from an enemy army" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# to stand before your enemies

Standing before the enemies represents not falling when the enemies attack and fighting against them. AT: "to resist your enemies when they attack you" or "to fight back against your enemies" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# your enemies' land will itself devour you

Yahweh speaks about the enemies' land as if it were a wild animal that would eat the Israelites. The word "devour" emphasizes that most of the Israelites will die there. AT: "you will die in your enemies' land" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# Those who are left among you

"Those of you who do not die"

# waste away in their sins

Wasting away in their sins represents wasting away because of their sins.

# their fathers' sins

Here "their fathers" represents their ancestors. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
