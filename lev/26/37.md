Yahweh continues describing how frightened the Israelites will be while in exile.

## your enemy's land will itself devour you ##

Yahweh speaks about the land as if it were a wild animal. This emphasizes that most of the Israelites will not survive in the land of their enemies. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
