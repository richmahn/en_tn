## translationNotes

* Yahweh continues describing how frightened the Israelites will be while in exile.
* **your enemy's land will itself devour you** - Yahweh speaks about the land as if it were a wild animal. This emphasizes that most of the Israelites will not survive in the land of their enemies. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
