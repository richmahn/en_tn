# will eat your bread to the full

Here bread represents food. "To the full" means until their stomachs were full of food. Alternate translation: "will eat food until you are full" or "will have plenty of food to eat" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
