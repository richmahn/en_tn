## The land will be abandoned by them ##

AT: "The people of Israel will abandon their land" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## so it will be pleased with its Sabbaths ##

Yahweh speaks about the land as if it were a person who is happy about resting. This means while the people are in exile no one will plant seed or grow crops. This allows the land to rest. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
