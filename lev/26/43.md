* **The land will be abandoned by them** - AT: "The people of Israel will abandon their land" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
* **so it will be pleased with its Sabbaths** - Yahweh speaks about the land as if it were a person who is happy about resting. This means while the people are in exile no one will plant seed or grow crops. This allows the land to rest. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
