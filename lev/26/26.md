# When I cut off your food supply

Destroying the food that people have stored or stopping people from being able to get it is spoken of as cutting off the supply of food. Alternate translation: "When I destroy the food you have stored" or "When I stop you from being able to get food" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# ten women will be able to bake your bread in one oven

This implies that there will be so little flour that one small oven will be able to hold all the bread that many women can put into it.

# they will distribute your bread by weight

This means there will be so little food that they will have to measure how much each person gets.
