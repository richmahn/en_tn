# to produce a sweet aroma

Yahweh being pleased with the sincere worshiper who offered the sacrifice is spoken of as if God were pleased with the aroma of the sacrifice. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Leviticus 1:9](../01/07.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# a representative offering

The handful of the grain offering represents the whole grain offering. This means the whole offering belongs to Yahweh. See how you translated this in [Leviticus 2:2](../02/01.md).
