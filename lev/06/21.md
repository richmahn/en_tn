# in a baking pan

This is a thick plate made of either clay or metal. The plate was placed over a fire, and the dough cooked on top of the plate. See how you translated "flat iron pan" in [Leviticus 2:5](../02/05.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

# When it is soaked

"When the flour is completely wet with oil"

# you will bring it in

Here "you" refers to the person offering the sacrifice. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# to produce a sweet aroma for Yahweh

Yahweh being pleased with the sincere worshiper who offered the sacrifice is spoken of as if God were pleased with the aroma of the burning sacrifice. See how you translated this in [Leviticus 1:9](../01/09.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
