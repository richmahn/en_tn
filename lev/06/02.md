# acts unfaithfully against Yahweh

"disobeys one of Yahweh's commandments"

# deceiving his neighbor regarding something held in trust

This can be translated in active form. Alternate translation: "lying to his neighbor about something the neighbor let him borrow" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# his neighbor

Here "neighbor" means any Israelite, not just someone who lives nearby.
