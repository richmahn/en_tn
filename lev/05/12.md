# He must bring it

"He must bring the fine flour"

# a representative offering

The handful that the priest burns on the altar represents the entire offering. This means the whole offering belongs to Yahweh. See how you translated this in [Leviticus 2:2](../02/02.md).

# on top of the offerings made by fire for Yahweh

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "on top of the burnt offerings to Yahweh" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
