Yahweh continues speaking.

## The land must not be sold to a new  permanent owner ##

AT: "You may not sell your land permanently to another person" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## the right of redemption ##

The original owners were legally allowed to buy back any of their land that they sold.

## you must allow the land to be bought back by the family from whom you bought it ##

AT: "you must allow the family from whom you bought the land to buy the land back"
