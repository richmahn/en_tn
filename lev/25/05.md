# You must not conduct ... who live with you may gather food

In 25:5-6 Yahweh means he will not allow the owner of a field to organize his workers and harvest the land as he does the other six years. However, Yahweh will allow individuals to go through the fields to pick and eat the fruit they find.

# your unpruned vines

This means that no one has taken care of the vines and cut them as they do during the other six years. This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "your vines that you do not prune" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
