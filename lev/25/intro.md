# Leviticus 25 General Notes #

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Over-farming #####
There is a provision made in this chapter to prevent over-farming of the land. If a land is farmed every year with the same crops, it will quickly become unable to grow anything. 

##### Sabbath and Jubilee Years #####

Every seventh year, the land should not be planted. Every fiftieth year Israelite slaves must be freed and all land that has been bought returned to its original owners. This prevented people from getting trapped by their poverty.
