# so that nothing in the house will be made unclean

Once the priest declared the house to be unclean, everything in the house became unclean, as well. This can be translated in active form. AT: "so that he does not need to declare anything left in the house to be unclean" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# the house will be made unclean

The house that Yahweh has stated is unfit for people to touch or live in is spoken of as if it were physically unclean. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# in the depressions in the wall's surface

This means the priest is to determine whether mildew has gone deeper that just the surface of the walls.
