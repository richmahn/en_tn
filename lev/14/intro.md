##### Skin disease and mildew #####

This chapter addresses the ways a priest was to decide if a person had a skin disease, which would make a person unclean. This was important because these diseases could have easily spread among the people in the ancient Near East. This was also true for the things which could have touched a person's skin. This chapter explains how the priest was to treat the person suffering with a skin disease. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/priest]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/unclean]])
