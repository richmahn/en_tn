# he must be brought to the priest

The priests determined if a disease was spreading. This can be translated in active form. AT: "someone must bring him to the priest" or "he must go to the priest" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# if there is raw flesh in the swelling

Here "raw flesh" could refer to open sores on the skin or it could refer to new skin that has grown, but the area around it is still diseased. Either one indicates that the skin disease is not healing properly.

# chronic skin disease

This is a disease that continues or reoccurs over a long period of time.

# the priest must pronounce him unclean ... he is already unclean

The man whom other people must not touch is spoken of as if he were physically unclean. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
