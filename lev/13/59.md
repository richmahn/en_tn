# mildew in a garment ... made with leather

See how you translated these words in [Leviticus 13:47-48](./47.md).

# so that you may pronounce it

"so that a priest may declare it"

# clean or unclean

Something that God has declared to be fit for people to touch is spoken of as if it were physically clean and something that God has declared to be unfit for people to touch is spoken of as if it were physically unclean. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
