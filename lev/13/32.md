Yahweh continues telling Moses and Aaron what the people must do when someone has a skin disease.

## then he must be shaved, but the diseased area must not be shaved ##

AT: "the person must shave the hair near the sore but not the hair on the sore" (UDB) (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
