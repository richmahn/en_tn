# General Information:

Yahweh continues telling Moses and Aaron what the people must do when someone has a skin disease.

# the priest must pronounce the person ... clean ... he will be unclean

The man whom other people may touch is spoken of as if he were physically clean and the man whom other people must not touch is spoken of as if he were physically unclean. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
