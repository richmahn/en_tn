# General Information:

Yahweh finishes telling Moses what the people must not do.

# the persons ... will be cut off from among their people

People being excluded from the community is spoken of as if they had been cut off from their people, as one would cut a piece of cloth or cut a branch from a tree. This can be translated in active form. Alternate translation: "the persons ... may no longer live among their people" or "you must separate the persons ... from their people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
