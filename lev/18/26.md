Yahweh forcibly removing the people from the land is spoken of as if the land were a person who vomited the people out. See how you translated this metaphor in [Leviticus 18:25](./24.md). AT: "so that I do forcibly remove you from the land ... as I forcibly removed the people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
