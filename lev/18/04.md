# My laws are what you must do, and my commandments are what you must keep

These two phrases mean basically the same thing and emphasize that the people must obey everything that Yahweh has commanded them to do. You can translate this parallelism into one statement that conveys the requirement to keep all of Yahweh's commands. Alternate translation: "You must obey all of my laws and commandments" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# so that you walk in them

Obeying Yahweh's commandments is spoken of as if the commandments were a path on which the person walks. Alternate translation: "so that you conduct your behavior according to them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
