# Do not lie with

This is a polite way of speaking of sexual relations. You may have to use other words in your translation. Alternate translation: "Do not have sexual relations with" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])

# This would be wicked

Here "wicked" refers to a violation of the natural order of things as Yahweh intended them to be.
