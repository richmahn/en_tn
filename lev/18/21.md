Yahweh continues telling Moses what the people must NOT do that would defile them.

## give any of your children to pass through the fire ##

AT: "burn your children alive" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

## profane the name of your God ##

AT: "dishonor my reputation" or "bring shame on me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
