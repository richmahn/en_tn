# General Information:

Yahweh continues telling Moses what the people must not do that would defile them.

# You must not give any of your children to put them into the fire

The phrase "to pass through the fire" means to burn something with fire as a sacrifice. Alternate translation: "You must not burn your children alive" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# you must not profane the name of your God

Here the word "profane" means to dishonor. The word "name" represents God himself. Alternate translation: "you must not dishonor your God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
