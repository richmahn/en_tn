This can be stated in active form. AT: "burnt offering" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# that person must be cut off from his people

A person being excluded from his community is spoken of as if he had been cut off from his people, as one would cut a piece of cloth or cut a branch from a tree.
