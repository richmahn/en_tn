# any unclean thing

Something that Yahweh has stated is unfit to touch or eat is spoken of as if it were physically unclean. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# whether uncleanness of man, or of unclean beast

Here "man" means humans in general. AT: "whether of a person or a beast"

# or of some unclean and disgusting thing

"or of some unclean thing that disgusts Yahweh"

# that person must be cut off from his people

A person being excluded from his community is spoken of as if he had been cut off from his people, as one would cut a piece of cloth or cut a branch from a tree. This can be translated in active form. See how you translated this in [Leviticus 7:20](./19.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
