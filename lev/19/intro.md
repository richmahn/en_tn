# Leviticus 19 General Notes

#### Special concepts in this chapter

##### Obeying Yahweh

Being holy meant obeying Yahweh in all matters of a person's life. It is not limited to offering correct sacrifices. The law helped to establish righteousness in a person's life, as well as justice in Israel. In Israel, these concepts are closely related.
