# When you reap the harvest of your land, you must not completely reap the corners of your field

"When you gather your crops, do not gather all the way to the edges of your fields"

# neither will you gather all the produce of your harvest

This refers to the practice of going back over the fields a second time to gather any produce that remained after the first time. The full meaning of this statement can be made explicit. AT: "and do not go back and pick up all that you left behind" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
