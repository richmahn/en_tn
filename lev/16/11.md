# General Information:

Yahweh continues telling Moses what Aaron must do on the Day of Atonement.

# he must kill the bull

Aaron would catch the blood of the bull in a bowl so he could later sprinkle it on the atonement lid. The full meaning of this statement can be made explicit. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
