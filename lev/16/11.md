Yahweh continues telling Moses what Aaron must do on the Day of Atonement.

## He must make atonement for himself and his family, so he must kill the bull as a sin offering for himself ##

"He must kill the bull as a sin offering to make atonement for himself and his family"

## he must kill the bull ##

Aaron would catch the blood of the bull in a bowl so he could later sprinkle it on the atonement lid. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
