This is the altar of sacrifice just inside the courtyard of the tabernacle.

## and make atonement for it ##

Like the holy place and tent of meeting, the altar is unclean because of the sins of the people.

## horns of the altar ##

This refers to the corners of the altar. See how you translated this in [Leviticus 4:6](../04/06.md).
