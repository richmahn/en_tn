## translationNotes

* **he must go out to the altar that is before Yahweh** - This is the altar of sacrifice just inside the courtyard of the tabernacle.
* **and make atonement for it** - Like the holy place and tent of meeting, the altar is unclean because of the sins of the people.
* **horns of the altar** - This refers to the corners of the altar. See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:lev:04:06]].
