# General Information:

Yahweh continues telling Moses what Aaron must do on the Day of Atonement.

# He must sprinkle it on the atonement lid and then before the atonement lid

Aaron sprinkled the blood in the same manner that he did with the bull's blood. See how you translated the previous instructions in [Leviticus 16:14](./14.md).

# He must make atonement for the holy place because of the unclean actions of the people of Israel

The sins of the people of Israel made the holy place unclean.

# unclean actions ... rebellion ... sins

These words mean basically the same thing. They emphasize that the people have committed all kinds of sins.

# unclean actions

Sinful actions which make people unacceptable to Yahweh are spoken of as if they were physically unclean actions. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# in the presence of their unclean actions

The phrase "their unclean actions" represents the people who commit sinful actions. AT: "in the presence of people who commit sinful actions" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
