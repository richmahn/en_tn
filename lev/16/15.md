# General Information:

Yahweh continues telling Moses what Aaron must do on the Day of Atonement.

# He must sprinkle it on the atonement lid and then before the atonement lid

Aaron sprinkled the blood in the same manner that he did with the bull's blood. See how you translated the previous instructions in [Leviticus 16:14](../16/14.md).
