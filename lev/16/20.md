## he must present the live goat ##

This is the same as the scapegoat mentioned in 16:10.

## Aaron must lay both of his hands on the head of the live goat ##

This shows that Aaron is placing sins of the people from the past year on the goat who will take them away.

## wickedness...rebellion...sins ##

These all mean basically the same thing. Aaron is confessing every kind of sin that the people committed.

## the wilderness ##

A place where no one could live for long. Many people thought of such a place as belonging to evil spirits.

## Then he must put that sinfulness on the head of the goat...let the goat go free ##

The goat now represents all the sins of the people. By setting it free into the wilderness, it represents God removing the guilt of the people.
