## It will always be a statute for you...you must humble yourselves and do no work ##

Yahweh repeats this in 16:31 for emphasis.

## for you ##

Yahweh is speaking to the people of Israel. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

## atonement will be made for you ##

AT: "Aaron will make atonement for you" or "Aaron will atone for your sins" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## It is a solemn Sabbath of rest for you ##

This is not the same as the Sabbath they observed every week on the seventh day. This was a special Sabbath on the day of atonement.
