## translationNotes

* **It will always be a statute for you...you must humble yourselves and do no work** - Yahweh repeats this in 16:31 for emphasis.
* **for you** - Yahweh is speaking to the people of Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
* **atonement will be made for you** - AT: "Aaron will make atonement for you" or "Aaron will atone for your sins" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
* **It is a solemn Sabbath of rest for you** - This is not the same as the Sabbath they observed every week on the seventh day. This was a special Sabbath on the day of atonement.
