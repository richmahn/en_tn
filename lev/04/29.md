# lay his hand on the head

This is a symbolic action that identifies the person with the animal he is offering. In this way the person is offering himself to Yahweh through the animal. See how you translated this in [Leviticus 1:4](../01/04.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
