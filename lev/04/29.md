# lay his hand on the head

This is a symbolic action that identifies the person with the animal he is offering. In this way the person is offering himself to Yahweh through the animal. See how you translated this in [Leviticus 1:4](../01/03.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])

# The priest will take some of the blood

It is implied that the priest will catch the blood in a bowl as the blood drains from the animal. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# horns of the altar

This refers to the corners of the altar, which are shaped like the horns of an ox. See how you translated this in [Leviticus 4:7](./06.md).

# all the rest of the blood

"all the blood remaining in the bowl"
