# The priest will take the blood

It is implied that the priest will catch the blood in a bowl as the blood drains from the goat. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# horns of the altar

This refers to the corners of the altar. They are shaped like the horns of an ox. See how you translated this in [Leviticus 4:7](./07.md).
