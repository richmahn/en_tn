# will lay their hands on the head

This is a symbolic action that identifies the people with the animal they are offering. In this way the people are offering themselves to Yahweh through the animal. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Leviticus 1:4](../01/04.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])

# the bull will be killed

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "and they will kill the bull" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
