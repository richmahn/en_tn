#### Special concepts in this chapter

##### Unintentional sins
Many scholars have taken special note that all of the sacrifices concern sins that are unintentional and that no provision is offered for sins intentionally committed. Many have suggested that it is only the sacrifice of Jesus' life that can be offered for these sins. Many also believe that this offering parallels the sacrifice of Jesus.
