# Connecting Statement:

Yahweh continues telling Moses what the people must do every year.

# must be cut off from his people

Being excluded is spoken of as being cut off. See how you translated this idea in [Leviticus 7:20](../07/19.md). AT: "must be excluded from his people" or "you must separate that person from his people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
