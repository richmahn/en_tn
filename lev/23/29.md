# must be cut off from his people

Being excluded is spoken of as being cut off. See how you translated this idea in [Leviticus 7:20](../07/20.md). Alternate translation: "must be excluded from his people" or "you must separate that person from his people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
