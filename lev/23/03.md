# General Information:

Yahweh continues telling Moses what the people must do on special days and times.

# the seventh day is a Sabbath of complete rest

This is something the people must do habitually. After every six days in which they can work, they must rest on the seventh day.

# a holy assembly

The requirement that people assemble to worship God on that day is spoken of as if that day were the assembly. Alternate translation: "a holy day, when you must assemble together to worship me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
