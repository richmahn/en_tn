# General Information:

Yahweh continues telling Moses what the people must do.

# two-tenths of an ephah

An ephah is 22 liters. AT: "four and a half liters" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bvolume]])

# a fourth of a hin

A hin is 3.7 liters. AT: "one liter" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bvolume]])

# nor roasted or fresh grain

"nor cooked or uncooked grain"

# This will be a permanent statute throughout your people's generations

This means that they and their descendants must obey this command forever. See how you translated this in [Leviticus 3:17](../03/15.md).
