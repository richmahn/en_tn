# General Information:

Yahweh continues telling Moses what the people must do.

# made from two-tenths of an ephah. They must be made from fine flour and baked with yeast

This can be stated in active form. AT: "that you have made from two-tenths of an ephah of flour and then baked with yeast" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# two-tenths of an ephah

This is approximately 4.5 liters. AT: "four and a half liters" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bvolume]])

# producing a sweet aroma for Yahweh

The Lord's pleasure with the aroma represents his pleasure with the person who burns the offering. AT: "Yahweh will be pleased with you" or "that pleases the Yahweh" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
