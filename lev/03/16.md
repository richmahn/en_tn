# will burn all that on the altar as a burnt offering of food

Translate this in a way that it does not seem like Yahweh actually eats the food. AT: "will burn those things on the altar to be an offering to Yahweh. It will be as though they are food given to Yahweh"

# to produce a sweet aroma

Yahweh is pleased with the aroma of burning meat when he is pleased with the worshiper's sincerity. See how you translated this in [Leviticus 1:9](../01/09.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
