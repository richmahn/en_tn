"Moses placed the breastpiece on Aaron"

# the breastpiece

This is a special garment that Yahweh commanded the people to make for the priests. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# the Urim and the Thummim

It is not clear what these are. They were objects that the priest somehow used to determine the will of God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
