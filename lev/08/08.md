## translationNotes

* **He placed the breastpiece on him** - "Moses placed the breastpiece on Aaron"

* **turban** - a head covering
* **the golden plate, the holy crown** - These refer to the same thing. It was a plate of pure gold attached to the turban. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
