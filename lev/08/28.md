# Moses took them

Here "them" refers to the fat, thigh, and all of the bread.

# from off their hands

Here "hands" represents the whole person. Alternate translation: "from Aaron and his sons" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# They were a consecration offering

"They were an offering for setting Aaron and his sons apart for service to Yahweh"

# an offering made by fire to Yahweh

This can be translated in active form. Alternate translation: "a burnt offering to Yahweh" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# produced a sweet aroma

Yahweh being pleased with the sincere worshiper who offered the sacrifice is spoken of as if God were pleased with the aroma of the burning sacrifice. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Leviticus 1:9](../01/09.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
