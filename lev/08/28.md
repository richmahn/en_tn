Here "them" refers to the fat, thigh, and all of the bread.

# They were a consecration offering

"They were an offering for setting Aaron and his sons apart for service to Yahweh"

This can be translated in active form. AT: "a burnt offering to Yahweh" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# produced a sweet aroma

Yahweh being pleased with the sincere worshiper who offered the sacrifice is spoken of as if God were pleased with the aroma of the burning sacrifice. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Leviticus 1:9](../01/07.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
