# laid their hands on the head

This is a symbolic action that identifies Aaron and his sons with the animal they are offering. In this way they are offering themselves to Yahweh through the animal. See how you translated this in [Leviticus 1:4](../01/04.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
