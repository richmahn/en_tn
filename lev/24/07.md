# Connecting Statement:

God continues giving Moses instructions about the things in the tent of meeting.

# You must put pure incense along each row of loaves

The incense was probably next to the loaves, rather than directly on the loaves. AT: "You must put pure incense next to the loaves in each row" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# as a representative offering

What the incense would represent can be stated clearly. AT: "to represent the loaves as an offering" or "to be an offering that represents the loaves" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# This incense will be burnt for Yahweh

This can be stated in active form. AT: "You will burn the incense for Yahweh" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
