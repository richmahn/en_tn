## it must be done to him ##

AT: "you must do to him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth ##

These phrases emphasize that a person should receive the harm he did to someone else. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

## anyone who kills a person must be put to death ##

AT: "you must put to death anyone who kills a person"
