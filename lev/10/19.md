## translationNotes

* **this thing has happened** - Aaron is referring to the death of his two sons.
* **Would it have been pleasing in the sight of Yahweh?** - These sacrifices were to be eaten with joy and happiness. Aaron uses a question to emphasize that Yahweh would not be pleased for him to eat the sacrifices since he is sad because of his sons' deaths. AT: "Certainly, Yahweh would not have been pleased."
