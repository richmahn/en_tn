# this thing has happened

Aaron is referring to the death of his two sons.

# would it have been pleasing in the sight of Yahweh?

These sacrifices were to be eaten with joy and happiness. Aaron uses a question to emphasize that Yahweh would not be pleased for him to eat the sacrifices since he is sad because of his sons' deaths. This question may be translated as a statement. AT: "certainly, Yahweh would not have been pleased." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
