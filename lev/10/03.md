This has a quotation within a quotation. A direct quotation can be stated as an indirect quotation. AT: "This is what Yahweh was talking about when he said that he would reveal his holiness ... who come near him, and that he will be glorified ... people." (See:[[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])

# I will reveal my holiness to those who come near me

The phrase "those who come near me" refers to the priests that serve Yahweh. "I will show those that come near to serve me that I am holy" or "Those who come near to serve me must treat me as holy"

# I will be glorified before all the people

This second part of Yahweh's statement still concerns the priest, who are the ones who come near to Yahweh. This can be translated in active form. AT: "They must glorify me before all the people" or "They must honor me in the presence of all the people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
