Yahweh continues telling Moses what the people must do.

## No grain offering that you offer to Yahweh is to be made with yeast ##

AT: "Do not use yeast in a grain offering that you offer to Yahweh" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## as an offering made by fire ##

AT: "as a burnt offering"

## You will offer them ##

"You will offer the grain offering"
