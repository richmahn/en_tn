# He is to take

"He must take"

# take out a handful

"take out what he can hold in his hand"

# a representative offering

The handful of the grain offering represents the whole grain offering. This means the whole offering belongs to Yahweh.

# It will produce a sweet aroma for Yahweh

Yahweh being pleased with the sincere worshiper who offered the sacrifice is spoken of as if God were pleased with the aroma of the sacrifice. See how you translated this in [Leviticus 1:9](../01/09.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# it will be an offering made to him by fire

This can be translated in active form. Alternate translation: "it will be a burnt offering to him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
