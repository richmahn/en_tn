Yahweh continues telling Moses what the people must do.

## that is roasted with fire ##

AT: "that you have cooked over a fire" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## to gratefully think about Yahweh's goodness. This is an offering made by fire to Yahweh ##

See how you translated this in [Leviticus 2:1](./01.md).
