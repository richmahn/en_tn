Yahweh continues telling Moses what the priests must do.

## on whose head the anointing oil has been poured, and who has been consecrated ##

AT: "on whose head they poured anointing oil and consecrated him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## must not wear his hair loose or tear his clothes ##

These are signs of mourning. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

## must not leave the sanctuary area ##

This does not mean he could never leave. God did not allow him to leave in order to grieve over someone who has died.
