# You will set him apart

"You people must treat the priest as holy"

# for he is the one who offers bread to your God

Here "bread" represents food in general. Yahweh does not actually eat these offerings. Translate this in a way that makes it clear that Yahweh does not actually eat the food. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# He must be holy to you

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "You must regard him as holy" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
