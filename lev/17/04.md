# before his tabernacle

"before Yahweh's tabernacle"

# that man must be cut off from among his people

A person being excluded from his community is spoken of as if he had been cut off from his people, as one would cut a piece of cloth or cut a branch from a tree. This can be translated in active form. See how you translated this in [Leviticus 7:20](../07/20.md). Alternate translation: "that person may no longer live among his people" or "you must separate that person from his people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
