## translationNotes

* **I will set my face against that person** - "I will turn my face away from you." This means Yahweh will reject the person. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
* **For the life of an animal is in its blood...that atones for the life** - This means God uses the blood to pay for the sins of the people because the blood is life. The people should not consume the blood because it has this special purpose.
