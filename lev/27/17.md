# the year of Jubilee

This occurs every 50 years. See how you translated "Jubilee" in [Leviticus 25:10](../25/10.md).

# the valuation of it will stand

"Stand" represents "remain" or "remain the same." AT: "its value will remain the same" or "its value will be the full amount" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
