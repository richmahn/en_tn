# is in fact unclean, so that Yahweh will not accept it

If Yahweh will not accept a certain animal as an offering, the animal is spoken of as if it were physically dirty. It may be unclean because it is a certain kind of animal or because it has a defect. Alternate translation: "is in fact one that Yahweh will not accept" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
