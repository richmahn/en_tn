## When a manâ€¦use the following values ##

'If a man solemnly promises to set apart another person to belong only to Yahweh, Yahweh will be willing to set that person free from having to do that if the responsible man pays the priest an amount of money. The priest must calculate the amount of money in terms of the silver coins that they use in Yahweh's sacred tent.' (UDB)
