# If anyone makes a special vow to Yahweh

In this case the vow would involve giving oneself or another person to God. This can be stated clearly. AT: "If anyone vows to give someone to Yahweh" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# use the following valuations

Instead of giving the person, he would give the Lord a certain amount of silver. AT "use the following values as your gift to the Lord in place of the person" or "give the Lord the following amounts of silver instead of the person" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
