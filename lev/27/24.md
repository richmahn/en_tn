# the man from whom it was bought ... the land's owner

These two phases refer to the same person. Normally the land would be bought from its owner.

# the man from whom it was bought

This can be stated in active form. AT: "the man who sold it" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# All the valuations must be set

This can be stated in active form. AT: "The priests must determine the estimated values" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# by the weight of the sanctuary shekel

There were shekels of different weights. This is the one that people had to use in the sanctuary of the sacred tent. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bweight]])

# Twenty gerahs must be the equivalent of one shekel

The purpose of this sentence is to tell how much the sanctuary shekel weighs. The gerah was the smallest unit of weight that the Israelites used. AT: "One shekel must equal twenty gerahs" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bweight]])

# Twenty gerahs must be the equivalent of one shekel

If it is necessary to use modern weight units, here is a way to do it. AT: "One shekel must weigh ten grams" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bweight]])
