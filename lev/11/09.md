# General Information:

Yahweh continues telling Moses and Aaron what he permits the people to eat and what he forbids them to eat.

# fins

the thin, flat part that the fish uses to move through the water

# scales

the small plates that cover the body of the fish

# all living creatures that do not have fins and scales in the ocean or rivers

"all creatures that live in the ocean or rivers that do not have fins and scales"

# they must be detested by you

Yahweh commands the people to reject and despise eating these creatures. This can be translated in active form. AT: "you must detest them" or "you must completely reject them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
