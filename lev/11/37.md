# seeds for planting

"seeds that you intend to plant"

# those seeds will still be clean ... they will be unclean

Seeds that God has declared to be acceptable for the people to plant are spoken of as if they are physically clean, and those which are unacceptable are spoken of as if they were unclean. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
