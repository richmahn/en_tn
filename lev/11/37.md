# seeds for planting

"seeds that you intend to plant"

# those seeds will still be clean

Seeds that God has permitted the people to plant are spoken of as if they are physically clean, and those that he has not permitted are spoken of as if they were unclean. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
