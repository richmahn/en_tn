# they will be unclean

Seeds that God has permitted the people to plant are spoken of as if they are physically clean, and those that he has not permitted are spoken of as if they were unclean. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# But if water is put on the seeds

This can be translated in active form. Alternate translation: "But if you put water on the seeds" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
