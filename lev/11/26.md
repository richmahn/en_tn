# General Information:

Yahweh continues telling Moses and Aaron which animals the people are to consider unclean.

# Every animal ... is unclean to you

These animals that God declared to be unfit for the people to eat are spoken of as if they were physically dirty. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# split hoof

This means a hoof that is split into two parts instead of being one whole. See how you translated these in [Leviticus 11:3](../11/03.md).

# chew the cud

This means an animal that brings its food up from its stomach and chews it again. See how you translated these in [Leviticus 11:3](../11/03.md).

# Everyone who touches them will be unclean

A person who is unacceptable for God's purposes because he has touched one of these animals is spoken of as if he were physically unclean. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
