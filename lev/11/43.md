# General Information:

Yahweh continues telling Moses and Aaron which animals the people are to consider unclean.

# You must not make yourselves unclean ... you should be made impure by them

Yahweh repeats the same idea twice in order to strengthen the command that they are not to eat any unclean animal. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# You must not make yourselves unclean

A person who is unacceptable for God's purposes is spoken of as if he were physically unclean. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# that you should be made impure by them

This can be translated in active form. AT: "so that you are no longer pure because of them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
