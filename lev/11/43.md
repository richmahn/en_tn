Yahweh continues telling Moses and Aaron what the people can eat and must avoid eating.

## You must not make yourselves unclean...you should be made impure by them ##

In 11:43 Yahweh says the same thing in three different ways for emphasis. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## that you should be made impure by them ##

AT: "that they should make you impure" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
