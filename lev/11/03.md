# General Information:

Yahweh continues telling Moses and Aaron what he permits the people to eat and what he forbids them to eat.

# split hoof

This means a hoof that is split into two parts instead of being one whole.

# chews the cud

This means an animal that brings its food up from its stomach and chews it again.

# some animals either chew the cud or have a split hoof

That is, they have one or the other, but not both.

# the camel is unclean for you

The camel being unfit for the people to eat is spoken of as if it were physically unclean. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
