# make atonement for yourself and for the people ... offer the sacrifice for the people to make atonement for them

These are two different sacrifices. The first sacrifice is to atone for the sins of the high priest. When the high priest sins it also makes the people guilty ([Leviticus 4:3](../04/03.md)). The second sacrifice is to atone of the sins the people themselves commit.
