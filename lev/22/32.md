# You must not profane my holy name

Here the word "name" represents Yahweh himself and his reputation and "profane" means to remove the honor that belongs to God as Creator and Lord of the universe. Alternate translation: "You must not dishonor me, for I am holy" or "You must not dishonor my holy reputation" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# I must be acknowledged as holy by the people of Israel

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "The people of Israel must acknowledge me as holy" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
