# throughout your generations

"from now on"

# while he is unclean

A person who is not acceptable for God's purposes is spoken of as if the person were physically unclean. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# that person must be cut off from before me

A priest no longer being able to serve Yahweh is spoken of as if that person had been cut off from Yahweh's presence, as one would cut a piece of cloth or cut a branch from a tree. This can be translated in active form. Alternate translation: "that person will no longer be able to serve as a priest" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
