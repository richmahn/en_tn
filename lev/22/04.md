# infectious skin disease

a disease on the skin easily spread from one person to another

# an infection flowing from his body

"a bodily discharge"

# from his body

This is a polite way of referring to a man's private parts. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Leviticus 15:1](../15/01.md). Alternate translation: "from his private parts" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])

# until he is clean

A person who is acceptable for God's purposes is spoken of as if the person were physically clean. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Whoever touches anything unclean

Something that Yahweh has said is unfit to touch or eat is spoken of as if it were physically unclean. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# through contact with the dead

"by touching a dead body"

# the sacrifices made to Yahweh

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "the sacrifices that someone has offered to Yahweh" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
