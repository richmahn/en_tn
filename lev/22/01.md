# tell them to keep away from the holy things

"tell them when they should keep away from the holy things." Yahweh is about to describe situations where a priest is unclean and not allowed to touch holy things.

# profane my holy name

The word "profane" here means to dishonor. The word "name" represents Yahweh's character. AT: "dishonor my reputation" or "dishonor me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# throughout your generations

"from now on"

# while he is unclean

A person who is not acceptable for God's purposes is spoken of as if the person were physically unclean. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# that person must be cut off from before me

A priest no longer being able to serve Yahweh is spoken of as if that person had been cut off from Yahweh's presence, as one would cut a piece of cloth or cut a branch from a tree. This can be translated in active form. AT: "that person will no longer be able to serve as a priest" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
