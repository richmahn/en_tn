# must not present the bread of your God

Here "bread" represents food in general. God did not actually eat the sacrifices. Priests would offer the sacrifice on God's altar, and they would eat some of the meat. Alternate translation: "must not present an animal as a food offering to your God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# from the hand of a foreigner

The word "hand" represents the whole person. It is implied that Israelites could not use animals as a sacrifice to God if they bought it from a foreigner, because foreigners castrated their animals making them unacceptable to God. Alternate translation: "that a foreigner has given you, because they castrate their animals" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# they will not be accepted for you

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "Yahweh will not accept them from you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
