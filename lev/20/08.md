# General Information:

Yahweh continues telling Moses what the people must do.

# You must keep my commands and carry them out

The words "keep" and "carry out" mean basically the same thing. They are used together in order to emphasize that the people must obey God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
