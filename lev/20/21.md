# If a man marries his brother's wife

This is a euphemism. Alternate translation: "If a man marries his brother's wife" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])

# I will take away from their children any property they may have inherited from their parents

Many versions of the Bible translate this as "they will die childless."
