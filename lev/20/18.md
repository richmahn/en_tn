# must be cut off from

A person being excluded from his community is spoken of as if he had been cut off from his people, as one would cut a piece of cloth or cut a branch from a tree. This can be translated in active form. See how you translated this idea in [Leviticus 7:20](../07/20.md). Alternate translation: "that person may no longer live among his people" or "you must separate that person from his people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# menstrual period

the time every month when a woman bleeds from her womb

# he has uncovered her flow, the fountain of her blood

This phrase compares having sex with a woman during her menstrual period to removing the cover off of something that should remain hidden. The fact that this was a shameful thing to do can be stated clearly. Alternate translation: "he has done a shameful thing by uncovering the flow of her blood" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# a man lies with a woman

This is a euphemism. Alternate translation: "a man has sexual relations with a woman" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])

# Both the man and woman must be cut off

It can be stated clearly why this must be done. Alternate translation: "Because they have done this shameful thing, both the man and woman must be cut off" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
