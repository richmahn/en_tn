The bridegroom praises the woman he loves (2:8–3:5)\n1. The bridegroom arrives and praises the bride (3:6–5:1)\n1. The bride longs for the bridegroom (5:2–6:9)\n1. The bridegroom praises the beauty of his bride (6:1–8:4)\n1. Final thoughts about love between a man and a woman (8:5–14)\n\n### What is the Song of Songs about?\n\nThe Song of Songs is a poem or a series of poems that celebrate love and intimacy between a man and a woman. Jews traditionally have interpreted the book as a picture of God’s love for his people Israel. In the same way, many Christians interpret it as a picture of love between Christ and his bride, the church of all believers.\n\n### Who wrote the Song of Songs?\n\nThe first verse of the book (“The Song of Songs, which is Solomon’s”) gives the idea that King Solomon of Israel wrote it. However, people have interpreted this verse in different ways, so not everyone is persuaded that Solomon wrote it.\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nThis book is traditionally titled “Song of Songs,” which means the very best song, or “Song of Solomon.” It may also be called “Songs of Love,” “Great Poems of Love,” or “The Love Songs of Solomon.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### What place do the descriptions of sexual behavior have in the Song of Songs?\n\nThe Song of Songs approves of sexual behavior expressing love between a husband his wife.\n\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\n\n### How many characters are in the Song of Songs?\n\nThe two main characters in this book are the man and the woman, who love each other. The woman also speaks to a group of women called the “daughters of Jerusalem,” and these women make comments. However, it is possible that the group of women is not real and the woman is only imagining them.\n\nSome interpreters believe there may be more characters than these, but this is not certain. The ULT and UST versions recognize only the man, the woman, and the group of women.\n\n### What are the lines about people speaking?\n\nThe Song of Songs is a poem that shows the thoughts and words of a man, a woman, and the woman’s friends. Throughout the poem, the author does not identify the speakers and their audience. So to help readers understand the poem, some translations attempt to identify the speaker and the audience. It is not always certain who the speaker is, so sometimes translations disagree about who is speaking.\n\nBefore each speech, the ULT identifies the speaker and the audience like this: “The woman speaking to the other women,” “The woman speaking to the man,” “The man speaking to the woman,” or “The woman speaking to herself.” Translators are encouraged to include these ways of identifying the speaker and the audience, and to format them differently from the scripture text. The translators should also include a note explaining that these explanations are not actually part of the scripture.\n\n### How should one translate the Song of Songs if the readers will view certain terms as coarse, vulgar, or improper?\n\nReaders might consider many images or forms appearing in the Song of Songs as improper when translated. The translator should try to avoid offensive language if possible, by using expressions that will not cause offense. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])\n\n### How do I translate metaphors and similes in this book?\n\nThere are many metaphors and similes in this book. These figures of speech are often unclear. If they have sexual meanings, figures of speech describing feelings or emotions are often used to avoid offense by hiding their meaning. However, since their meanings are often unclear, ambiguity in translation is encouraged. You can translate the words as they are written in order to avoid committing to a specific meaning. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1:intro	xrm2				0	# Song of Songs 1 General Notes\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Kisses\n\nThe kisses in this chapter are a type of kiss that was only done between a husband a wife. It is an intimate kiss. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])\n\n### Love and affection\n\nThis chapter is centered on the feelings of love, affection, and attraction. Different cultural standards may make translation difficult and the translator may use euphemisms to avoid offending people. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### Metaphors\n\nIn the ancient Near East, it was common to describe a woman using metaphors involving animals. In many cultures today, this can be considered offensive. Different metaphors of beauty are used in different cultures. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### “I am dark”\nIn the ancient Near East, rich people usually had lighter skin because they did not need to work outside in the sun. This young woman had to work out in the sun, and her skin became darker than it was when she was younger.

In the authors culture pleasant smelling spices were mixed into olive oil in order to make a pleasant smelling perfume which was then put on the skin.

Alternate translation: “your colognes—they are good” or “your scented oils—they are good” or “your skin—it is good” or “your body—it is good”
1:3	z9t3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	שֶׁ֖מֶן תּוּרַ֣ק שְׁמֶ֑⁠ךָ	1	The woman is describing the man she loves and his reputation by association with his **name**.

1:4	vpdi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הַ⁠מֶּ֜לֶךְ	1	Here, the woman speaks of the man she loves as if he were **The king**. Here, the term **king** is a term of endearment and is an affectionate way for the woman to refer to the man she loves. The woman is not speaking of an actual king but rather this is a poetic way of speaking. The woman is still speaking of the same man that she was speaking of in [1:2-3](../01/02.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning by using a simile. Alternate translation: “He whom I love is like a king to me and” or “He who is like a king to me”
1:4	ieqb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הֱבִיאַ֨⁠נִי הַ⁠מֶּ֜לֶךְ	1	The original language word which the ULT translates as **he has brought me** could be describing: (1) a request or wish that the woman has.

Alternate translation: “Let you and I be glad and rejoice in you. Let you and I profess your love more than wine”\n 
1:4	isr6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	נָּר֑וּצָה…נָגִ֤ילָה…נַזְכִּ֤ירָה	1	The word *us** is inclusive all three times that it occurs in this verse. Your language may require you to mark these forms. (See also: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
1:4	ku0t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	נָגִ֤ילָה וְ⁠נִשְׂמְחָה֙	1	The terms **glad** and **rejoice** mean similar things. The author is using the two terms together for emphasis.

1:4	so9x			מֵישָׁרִ֖ים אֲהֵבֽוּ⁠ךָ	1	Here the speaker could be: (1) the woman speaking to the man about the young women who admire him.

1:4	ag8r			מֵישָׁרִ֖ים אֲהֵבֽוּ⁠ךָ	1	Alternate translation: “it is right that other young women adore you” or “no wonder other young women adore you” 
1:5	ez2x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	שְׁחוֹרָ֤ה אֲנִי֙	1	Here, **I am black** means “My skin is black” or “My skin is very dark.” If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “My skin is black” or “My skin is very dark”
1:5	jpj9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	וְֽ⁠נָאוָ֔ה	1	Here, the word **but** is introducing a contrast. What follows the word **But** is in contrast to what was expected, because in the author’s culture it was not considered attractive for a woman to have skin that was dark as a result of much exposure to the sun. Use a natural form in your language for introducing a contrast. Alternate translation: “yet lovely” or “but still lovely” 
1:5	ck9k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	בְּנ֖וֹת יְרוּשָׁלִָ֑ם	1	The woman is using the possessive form to poetically describe where the young women (whom she calls **daughters**) live. The phrase **daughters of Jerusalem** refers to the young women who were from the city of Jerusalem (These are probably the same women as the “marriageable women” in [1:3](../01/03.md) and the women referred to as “they” in [1:4](../01/04.md)). If your language would not use the possessive form for this, you could indicate the association between these young women and **Jerusalem** in a way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “daughters from Jerusalem” or “young women from Jerusalem” 
1:5	rbb3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	כְּ⁠אָהֳלֵ֣י קֵדָ֔ר כִּ⁠ירִיע֖וֹת שְׁלֹמֹֽה	1	The Kedar were a tribe of people who used black goat skins to make their tents, thus their tents were dark in color. The woman is comparing her skin to these tents which were dark in color. The phrase **the curtains of Solomon** refers to the curtains in Solomon’s palace which were very beautiful. The point of the first comparison is that the woman’s skin was dark (referring back to and further describing the word **black**) and the point of the second comparison is that the woman was beautiful (referring back to and further describing the word **lovely**). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use equivalent comparisons from your culture or you could retain these similes and express these meanings as plainly as possible. Alternate translation: “like the dark color of the tents of the people of the tribe Kedar, like the curtains of Solomon’s palace” or “as dark as the color of the tents of Kedar, as beautiful as the curtains in Solomon’s palace” 
1:6	avcq			אַל־ תִּרְא֨וּ⁠נִי֙	1	The phrase **Do not look at me** could mean: (1) that the woman does not want people to look at her with contempt. Alternate translation: “Do not look at me with contempt” or “Do not look down on me” or “Do not look at me disapprovingly” (2) that the woman does not want people to stare at her in admiration of her beauty. Alternate translation: “Do not stare at me because I am so beautiful”  
1:6	gy5l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	שֶׁ⁠אֲנִ֣י	1	The word **that** indicates that what follows is a reason for what came before. Use a connector in your language that makes it clear that what follows is a reason for what came before. Alternate translation: “because” 
1:6	nqqb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	שֶׁ⁠אֲנִ֣י שְׁחַרְחֹ֔רֶת	1	Here, **I am black** means “my skin is black” or “my skin is very dark” as it did in [1:5](../01/05.md). If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “that my skin is black” or “that my skin is very dark”
1:6	im6w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	שֶׁ⁠שֱּׁזָפַ֖תְ⁠נִי הַ⁠שָּׁ֑מֶשׁ	1	The word **that** indicates that what follows is a reason for what came before. Use a connector in your language that makes it clear that what follows is a reason for what came before. Alternate translation: “because the sun scorched me” 
1:6	thz7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	שֶׁ⁠שֱּׁזָפַ֖תְ⁠נִי הַ⁠שָּׁ֑מֶשׁ	1	The phrase **the sun scorched me** refers to sunlight shining on the skin and means “the sun burned me” or “the sun tanned my skin dark.” If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “that the sun burned me” or “that the sun turned my skin brown” or “that the sun tanned my skin.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]]) 
1:6	v86f			נֹטֵרָ֣ה אֶת־הַ⁠כְּרָמִ֔ים כַּרְמִ֥⁠י שֶׁ⁠לִּ֖⁠י לֹ֥א נָטָֽרְתִּי	1	Alternate translation: “as caretaker of the vineyards—my vineyard that is mine, I have not taken care of”
1:6	w18k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	כַּרְמִ֥⁠י שֶׁ⁠לִּ֖⁠י לֹ֥א נָטָֽרְתִּי	1	The woman is probably using the phrase **my vineyard** to refer to her complexion. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “my skin, I have not protected from the sun” or “my complexion, I have not protected from the sun” 
1:7	f9hi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	שֶׁ֤⁠אָהֲבָה֙ נַפְשִׁ֔⁠י	1	The woman is using one part of herself, her **soul**, to represent all of her. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your culture or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “you whom I love” 
1:7	mpbu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	אֵיכָ֣ה תִרְעֶ֔ה	1	The woman is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could supply these words from the context. Alternate translation: “where do you graze your flock” or “where do you graze your sheep”
1:7	wsmm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	אֵיכָ֣ה תִרְעֶ֔ה אֵיכָ֖ה תַּרְבִּ֣יץ בַּֽ⁠צָּהֳרָ֑יִם	1	The phrase **where do you graze** and the phrase **Where do you make your flocks lie down at noontime** mean basically the same thing. The second phrase emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if saying very similar things twice might confuse your readers, you could combine the phrases into one. Alternate translation: “Where do you pasture your flocks in the middle of the day”  
1:7	v54w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	שַׁ⁠לָּ⁠מָ֤ה אֶֽהְיֶה֙ כְּ⁠עֹ֣טְיָ֔ה עַ֖ל עֶדְרֵ֥י חֲבֵרֶֽי⁠ךָ	1	The woman is not asking for information, but is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate her words as a statement, a request, or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “I do not want to be like a woman who covers herself\nbeside the flocks of your companions” or “Please do not let me be like a woman who covers herself\nbeside the flocks of your companions” or “Tell me so that I will not be like a woman who covers herself\nbeside the flocks of your companions”
1:7	f5eb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	כְּ⁠עֹ֣טְיָ֔ה עַ֖ל עֶדְרֵ֥י חֲבֵרֶֽי⁠ךָ	1	The phrase **covers herself** means **covers herself with a veil** and the phrase **your companions** refers to the other shepherds who pastured their animals near the flocks of the man and were probably his friends. If it would help your readers, you could express these phrases explicitly. Alternate translation: “like a woman who covers herself with a veil beside the flocks of the other shepherds”
1:7	v6rs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	שַׁ⁠לָּ⁠מָ֤ה אֶֽהְיֶה֙ כְּ⁠עֹ֣טְיָ֔ה עַ֖ל עֶדְרֵ֥י חֲבֵרֶֽי⁠ךָ	1	In the authors culture women who were prostitutes often covered their faces with a veil so that people would not recognize them. It would not be normal for a young unmarried woman to be wandering among shepherds and the woman did not want to be mistaken for a prostitute. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the basis of this comparison. Alternate translation: “Tell me where you pasture your flocks so that I will not need to wander around among the flocks of your companions like a prostitute when I am looking for you” or “For why should I be like a prostitute who covers herself with a veil and wanders about\nbeside the flocks of your companions”
1:8	lc64		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical	אִם־ לֹ֤א תֵדְעִי֙ לָ֔⁠ךְ הַ⁠יָּפָ֖ה בַּ⁠נָּשִׁ֑ים צְֽאִי־ לָ֞⁠ךְ	1	If it would help your readers to see that this is a conditional statement then you could supply a word like “then” in your translation. Alternate translation: “If you do not know, most beautiful among women, then go out”
1:8	fu4f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	אִם־ לֹ֤א תֵדְעִי֙ לָ֔⁠ךְ הַ⁠יָּפָ֖ה בַּ⁠נָּשִׁ֑ים	1	If it would be more natural in your language you could begin this verse with the phrase **most beautiful among women**. Alternate translation: “Most beautiful among women, if you do not know”
1:8	nky4			הַ⁠יָּפָ֖ה בַּ⁠נָּשִׁ֑ים	1	Alternate translation: “you who are the most beautiful of all women”
1:8	sy7k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	צְֽאִי־ לָ֞⁠ךְ	1	Your language may say “come” rather than **go** in contexts such as this. Use whichever is more natural. Alternate translation: “come out”
1:8	al9c			וּ⁠רְעִי֙ אֶת־ גְּדִיֹּתַ֔יִ⁠ךְ	1	Alternate translation: “and let your young goats graze” or “and graze your young goats” 
1:8	fis9			וּ⁠רְעִי֙ אֶת־ גְּדִיֹּתַ֔יִ⁠ךְ	1	Alternate translation: “graze your young goats” or “let your young goats eat”
1:9	j8xv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	לְ⁠סֻסָתִ⁠י֙ בְּ⁠רִכְבֵ֣י פַרְעֹ֔ה דִּמִּיתִ֖י⁠ךְ רַעְיָתִֽ⁠	1	If it would be more natural in your language you could begin this verse with the phrase **my darling**. Alternate translation: “My darling, I liken you to a mare among the chariots of Pharaoh” 
1:9	gw76		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	לְ⁠סֻסָתִ⁠י֙ בְּ⁠רִכְבֵ֣י פַרְעֹ֔ה דִּמִּיתִ֖י⁠ךְ	1	Here, it is implied that the man is comparing the woman to the beauty of a mare and not to other other qualities of a horse. The king of Egypt’s horses were known to be the best in the world and so they would have been very beautiful. If it would help your readers you could explain the point of this comparison. Alternate translation: “Your beauty is like the beauty of Pharaoh’s chariot horses” or “I compare your beauty to the beauty of Pharaoh’s chariot horses” 
1:9	zyj5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בְּ⁠רִכְבֵ֣י פַרְעֹ֔ה	1	The man is using the phrase **the chariots** to mean “the horses that pull the chariots.”  If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “among the horses that pull Pharaoh’s chariots” or “among the horses that pull the chariots of Pharaoh”
1:9	lnbo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	פַרְעֹ֔ה	1	Here, the term **Pharaoh** does not refer to a specific Egyptian king but is a title used to designate the acting king of Egypt. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “the king of Egypt”
1:10	hrjd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	בַּ⁠תֹּרִ֔ים	1	The term the man uses, which the ULT translates as **earrings**, is a term which refers to strings of small ornaments or jewels which apparently hung down the side of one’s face. If your readers would not be familiar with this type of jewelry you could use a more general term and, if you are using footnotes, you could make a footnote explaining this type of jewelry. Alternate translation: “with neck ornaments” or “strings of jewels” 
1:10	u7h9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	בַּ⁠חֲרוּזִֽים	1	**necklaces** are a type of jewelry worn around the neck in order to make a person look more attractive. If your readers would not be familiar with **necklaces**, you could use the name of something similar in your area worn around the neck for the purpose of looking nice or you could use a more general term and, if it would help your readers, you could make a footnote explaining what a necklace is if you are using footnotes.

If your readers would not be familiar with *nard** plants, you could use a general expression or describe what **nard** is. Alternate translation: “my perfumed oil” or “my pleasant smelling perfume made from the nard plant”

The woman makes a comparison between the enjoyable experience of having a bag of myrrh near her and the enjoyable experience of having the man she loves near her. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use a simile to show the comparison. Alternate translation: “I enjoy having my beloved near me throughout the night like I enjoy the smell of a bag of myrrh”
1:13	d77b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	הַ⁠מֹּ֤ר	1	**myrrh** was a pleasant smelling incense that was made from resin taken from the bark of a certain kind of tree. One of the things it was used for was to make a person smell good. If your readers would not be familiar with **myrrh**, you could use the name of something pleasant smelling in your area that might be used for this purpose or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “pleasant smelling perfume”

Alternate translation: “My beloved stays very close to me during the night, like a bundle of myrrh hanging near my chest”
1:13	bl0z			יָלִֽין	1	Here, the original language word that the ULT translates with the phrase **it stays** is ambiguous regarding what it is that **stays**. This word could: (1) indicate that the **bundle of myrrh** is what **stays**, in which case it should be translated as something similar to **it stays** as modeled by the ULT.  (2) mean that the man **stays**. Alternate translation: “he stays”  
1:13	jw0u			יָלִֽין	1	Here, the word **stays** could: (1) refer to staying in one place for a prolonged period of time in which case you could translate this word with something similar to **stays** as modeled by the ULT. (2) refer to lying down. Alternate translation: “it lies”
1:14	a6jk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	הַ⁠כֹּ֤פֶר	1	The phrase **henna blossoms** refers to **blossoms** from the **henna** plant which produces clusters of flower blossoms which have a pleasant smell. If your readers would not be familiar with this plant, you could use the name of a plant in your area that has a pleasant smell, you could explain in your translation that henna is a plant that produces fragrant blossoms, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “fragrant flowers” or “fragrant blossoms from the henna plant” 
1:14	zh75		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אֶשְׁכֹּ֨ל הַ⁠כֹּ֤פֶר ׀ דּוֹדִ⁠י֙ לִ֔⁠י בְּ⁠כַרְמֵ֖י עֵ֥ין גֶּֽדִי	1	Here, **vineyards of En Gedi** is probably a reference to the woman’s body because at that time **vineyards** were often used to convey a sexual meaning and because the phrase **in the vineyards of Engedi** is in parallel to phrase in the previous verse in which the woman refers to her body by saying that her “beloved” is like a “bundle of myrrh“ which “stays” (the night) “between” her “breasts.” In this verse the woman makes a comparison between the pleasurable experience of the smell of henna blossoms and her enjoyment of having the man she loves near her body. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use a simile to show the comparison. Because the woman describes her body in a poetic way with images, it is recommended that you either maintain these images or select images from your context and language that communicate the same concepts. Alternate translation: “I enjoy being near my beloved’s body like I enjoy the smell of the henna flowers in the vineyards of Engedi” or “I delight in my beloved being near my body like I enjoy the smell of the henna flowers in the vineyards of Engedi”

1:16	xed8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	רַעֲנָנָֽה	1	Here, the original language word that the ULT translates as **leafy** refers to plants that are the green color. You could translate **leafy** in a general way such as “green” or if it would help your readers you could indicate specifically what vegetation the word **leafy** refers to. Here, **leafy** could refer to: (1) the grass that the couple layed down on. Alternate translation: “grass” (2) the branches above their meeting place in the forest.

If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly or use a simile as modeled by the UST.

If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly, explain the comparison, or use a simile as modeled by the UST. The reason the woman compares herself to these wildflowers is to express that she thinks she has only common beauty and is no more attractive than the other young women her age. Alternate translation: “I am as common as a wildflower of Sharon or a lily of the valleys” or “my beauty is as common as a wildflower in Sharon or a lily of the valleys”
2:1	ps9x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	חֲבַצֶּ֣לֶת	1	The original word which the ULT translates as **flower** refers to a specific type of flower which grows on the ground. The exact type of flower that the original word refers to cannot be known with certainty so you could use the name of a pretty wildflower in your area or you could use a general term as modeled by the ULT.
2:1	gh6w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הַ⁠שָּׁר֔וֹן	1	**Sharon** was the name of a specific plain (a flat area). The word **Sharon** refers to a flat, wide area and so by using the word **Sharon** the woman is probably referring to “plains” in general and expressing that she is like a wildflower that grows on the plains. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly as modeled by the UST.

The second phrase emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if saying very similar things twice might confuse your readers, you could combine the phrases into one. Alternate translation: “I am a wildflower that grows in the plains and the valleys”

The point of this comparison is that in the same way that **a lily** is much more beautiful than **thorns** so the woman is much more beautiful than the other young women. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent comparison or express this meaning in plain language.

2:3	yr6x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	כְּ⁠תַפּ֨וּחַ֙	1	An **apple tree** is a tree that produces pleasant tasting fruit and has a pleasant smell.

The word **shadow** refers to the shade of an apple tree which would give both protection from the sun and refreshment. To **sit** represents being near or in the presence of the man and his **fruit** being **sweet** means that he causes the woman to experience pleasurable feelings in a way that is comparable to eating sweet fruit. If it is possible in your language you should try to retain the images used here, or substitute a comparable image if needed. If you are not able to retain the metaphors without causing misunderstanding, you could use similes or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “He provides me with refreshment and protection when I am in his presence, he gives me great pleasure” or “I sit in his presence and he refreshes and protects me, he is delightful to me like sweet fruit”

The original language word which the ULT translates here as **He brought me** could be describing: (1) a request or wish that the woman has and not something that has already happened. If it would help your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “May he bring me” or ”I desire him to bring me” (2) an action that has already happened.

The phrase does not necessarily indicate a **house** or building so here it could be referring a private location that used as their meeting place, possibly the “house” (location) where they spent time together in the forest (described in [1:17](../01/17.md)). If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly or use a general expression that allows for either meaning. Alternate translation: “the place where wine is drunk” or ”the place where wine is served” or ”our meeting place”
2:4	hxuz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	בֵּ֣ית הַ⁠יָּ֔יִן	1	Here, **house of wine** most likely does not refer to a literal **house of wine** but instead the woman is probably using this phrase to poetically describe a private meeting place where they could enjoy expressing their love for each other. She is describing their meeting place by using an image that was meaningful in that culture. If it would be helpful in your language, you could retain the literal translation **house of wine** and explain the meaning in a footnote (if you are using them), or you could express the meaning using a different expression that is meaningful in your culture, or you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “our meeting place so that we could enjoy our love” or ”the place where we could celebrate our love for each other” or ”the place where we could consummate our love”

2:4	jgbx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	וְ⁠דִגְל֥⁠וֹ	1	A **banner** is a flag made out of a large piece of cloth that is attached to the top of a long wooden pole. People groups and kings had their own unique banners by which they identified themselves. If your readers would not be familiar with this term, you could use the name of something used for a similar purpose in your area or you could use a more general term. Alternate translation: “and his flag”

In the author’s culture both raisins and **apples** were believed to give people strength for love.The second phrase emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if your readers are unfamiliar with raisins and/or **apples** and you do not have an equivalent food or foods that you could substitute for them here you could combine these two phrases into one and use a general expression. Alternate translation: “Sustain and refresh me with fruit” or “strengthen me with fruit” or “strengthen me for love with fruit” 
2:5	ukb7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-plural	סַמְּכ֨וּ⁠נִי֙…רַפְּד֖וּ⁠נִי	1	The phrases **Sustain me** and **refresh me** are plural imperative forms in the original language. The woman is addressing the man using plural forms to show the intensity of her feelings. Your language may allow you to do the same thing. The ULT indicates the intensity that these two plural forms indicate by placing an exclamation point at the end of this verse. Use a natural form in your language for showing intensity of emotion.

Alternate translation: “Because I am sick with love, sustain me with raisin cakes and refresh me with apples”
2:5	khc1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	בָּֽ⁠אֲשִׁישׁ֔וֹת	1	A **raisin** is a dried grape. Raisin cakes were cakes made of dried grapes pressed together.

Alternate translation: “with cakes made of dried fruit”
2:5	gs2a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	בַּ⁠תַּפּוּחִ֑ים	1	An **apple** is a round pleasant tasting fruit that grows on a tree and is about the size of an adult human’s fist. If your readers would not be familiar with this type of fruit, you could use the name of something similar in your area or you could use a more general term. Alternate translation: “fruit”
2:5	y4qy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	כִּי־חוֹלַ֥ת אַהֲבָ֖ה אָֽנִי	1	The woman speaks of feeling **sick with love** because her feelings of love are so strong for the man that they overwhelm her body as if they were a kind of sickness. She is exaggerating in order to emphasize the strength of her feelings for the man. Alternate translation: “for my love for you is so strong that I feel as if I were sick with love” or “because my love for you overwhelms me like a sickness”
2:5	ijwy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	אַהֲבָ֖ה	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **love**, you could express the same idea with a verbal form as modeled by the UST.

(2) a request or wish that the woman has and not something that has already happened. Alternate translation: “ I hope he puts his left arm under my head\nand holds me close with his right arm” or ”I want him to put his left arm under my head\nand hold me close with his right arm”

Because the author does this intentionally for poetic effect it is suggested that you do the same. If it would be helpful in your language, you could indicate this in a footnote if you are using them.

You can use a natural way of making a promise in your culture that would be appropriate in this context. Alternate translation: “I urge you to promise me … with the female gazelles or the does of the field as our witnesses” or “Please, promise me … with the female gazelles or the does of the field as our witnesses” or “I want you to make an oath … with the female gazelles or the does of the field listening”

If your language would not use the possessive form for this, you could explain the meaning of the phrase **of the field** in your translation. Alternate translation: “by the wild female gazelles and does” 
2:7	sz5c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	בִּ⁠צְבָא֔וֹת א֖וֹ בְּ⁠אַיְל֣וֹת	1	A gazelle is an animal that is a small antelope and looks like a deer, moves quickly like a deer, and is very similar in size to a deer. If your readers would not be familiar with this type of animal, you could use the name of something similar in your area or if you do not have two deer-like animals in your area or if your language does not have two different words for deer-like animals you could combine the terms **female gazelles** and **does** into one term. Alternate translation: “by the female deer of” or “by the female gazelles of”
2:7	nt79		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	בְּ⁠אַיְל֣וֹת	1	**Does** are female deer. If it would be helpful to your readers you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “the female deer of”

If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “do not encourage people to love romantically until the appropriate time” or “do not encourage people’s romantic feelings until the appropriate time” 
2:7	fz3j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	אִם־תָּעִ֧ירוּ ׀ וְֽ⁠אִם־ תְּעֽוֹרְר֛וּ	1	Here, the words **awaken** and **stir** mean basically the same thing. The repetition is used for emphasis. If your language does not use repetition to do this, you could use one phrase and provide emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “do not awaken”
2:7	z2xm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	הָ⁠אַהֲבָ֖ה	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **love**, you could express the same idea with a verbal form as modeled by the UST.
2:8	aay2				0	# General Information:\n\nThe second part of the book begins here. It is not clear whether the woman is speaking to herself or to the daughters of Jerusalem.
2:8	fq0o		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	 ק֣וֹל דּוֹדִ֔⁠י	1	Here the original language word which the ULT translates as **voice** is being used to get the readers attention. If it would help your readers you can indicate that explicitly in your translation. Alternate translation: “Listen, I hear my beloved speaking” or “Listen, I hear my beloved approaching” 
2:8	okuh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamation	הִנֵּה	1	**Behold** is an exclamation word that is used to bring attention to something. Here it is used to bring attention to the man’s approach. Use an exclamation that is natural in your language for communicating this. See how you translated “Behold” in [1:15](../01/015.md). Alternate translation: “Look” 
2:8	happ		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	בָּ֑א	1	Your language may say “going” rather than **coming** in contexts such as this. Use whichever is more natural. Alternate translation: “is going” 
2:8	tymi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	מְדַלֵּג֙ עַל־ הֶ֣⁠הָרִ֔ים מְקַפֵּ֖ץ עַל־ הַ⁠גְּבָעֽוֹת	1	These two phrases mean the same thing. The woman says the same thing twice, in slightly different ways, to give emphasis to what she is saying. If saying the same thing twice might be confusing in your language, or if you do not have two words for steeply elevated inclines you could combine these two phrases and provide emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “jumping over the mountains!” or “leaping over the hills!”

Alternate translation: “My beloved resembles a gazelle or a young stag, leaping over the mountains, jumping over the hills” or “My beloved is like a gazelle or a young stag, leaping over the mountains, jumping over the hills” 
2:8	j2nl				0	This could mean: (1) “Listen carefully to what I am about to say.” You could use a word in your language that tells the hearer to listen carefully, or (2) “Listen so you can hear him coming.”

2:9	s6z4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamation	הִנֵּה־זֶ֤ה עוֹמֵד֙	1	**Behold** is an exclamation word that is used to bring attention to something. Here it is used to draw attention to the man’s arrival. Use an exclamation that is natural in your language in this context. Alternate translation: “Look! Here he is! Standing”  
2:9	pppj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	זֶ֤ה	1	Here, the phrase **this one** refers to the man who the woman calls **My beloved** in the first part of this verse. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “this man” or “my beloved” 
2:9	umf5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	אַחַ֣ר כָּתְלֵ֔⁠נוּ	1	Here, the word **our** refers to the woman and her family and does not include the man, so use the exclusive form of that word in your translation if your language marks that distinction. Alternate translation: “behind the wall of my house” or “on the other side of the wall of my family’s house”
2:9	kf9u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	מַשְׁגִּ֨יחַ֙ מִן־הַֽ⁠חֲלֹּנ֔וֹת מֵצִ֖יץ מִן־הַֽ⁠חֲרַכִּֽים	1	These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if it would be helpful to your readers, you could connect the phrases with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: “gazing through the windows, yes, looking through the lattice”
2:9	nuxr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-plural	הַֽ⁠חֲלֹּנ֔וֹת…הַֽ⁠חֲרַכִּֽים	1	Here, the words **windows** and **lattices** are plural forms and could: (1) be used with singular meanings here. Because the author says that the man **is standing** instead of indicating that he is walking around the outside of the house, it is likely that these terms have singular meanings here. Alternate translation: “the window … the lattice” (2) have a plural meaning indicating that the man was walking around the house and looking into the house through different windows and lattices. If you decide that these two terms have a plural meaning here you can translate them in a similar way to the ULT.
2:9	s9xt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	הַֽ⁠חֲרַכִּֽים	1	A “lattice” is a cover inside a window frame that is made by weaving strips of wood together. **lattices** have holes that people can look through. If your readers would not be familiar with **lattices**, you could use the name of something similar in your area or you could describe **lattices** as modeled by the UST. Alternate translation: “the screen” 
2:10	gr22		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	וּ⁠לְכִי־לָֽ⁠ךְ	1	Your language may say “go” rather than **come** in contexts such as this. Use whichever is more natural. Alternate translation: “and go” 
2:11	yv91		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamation	הִנֵּ֥ה ה⁠סתו	1	The man is using the term **Behold** to focus attention on what he is about to say. Use an exclamation that is natural in your language for communicating this. Alternate translation: “see that the winter”
2:11	jmbh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	כִּֽי	1	Here, the word **for** indicates that what follows is the motivation or reason for what came before.

2:11	e658		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ה⁠סתו	1	In Israel **winter** is the time of year when it is cold and rains more heavily than during other seasons. If the seasons do not vary much in your location, you could explain this with a general expression such as “the cold season” as modeled by the UST. Alternate translation: “the cold rainy season” or “the cold wet season” 
2:11	asu3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	ה⁠סתו עָבָ֑ר הַ⁠גֶּ֕שֶׁם חָלַ֖ף	1	These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could connect the clauses with a word that shows that the second clause is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: “the winter has gone; yes, the rain has passed”
2:11	qxz4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	עָבָ֑ר	1	Your language may not say **gone** in contexts such as this. Alternate translation: “is finished” or “is over”

If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “is over and gone” or “has gone away” 
2:12	j8f3			בָ⁠אָ֔רֶץ	1	Alternate translation: “throughout the land”
2:12	zmw4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וְ⁠ק֥וֹל הַ⁠תּ֖וֹר נִשְׁמַ֥ע	1	The phrase **the turtledove is heard** can be translated in active form. If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who did the action, it is clear from the context that it is people. Alternate translation: “and people hear the voice of the turtledove” or “and people hear the turtledove cooing”
2:13	mk2y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	הַ⁠תְּאֵנָה֙ חָֽנְטָ֣ה פַגֶּ֔י⁠הָ	1	The word **tree** is a singular noun that refers to all the fig trees in that region.

2:14	m3n1			יוֹנָתִ֞⁠י	1	Here, the phrase **My dove** could be: (1) a form of address in which the man is speaking directly to the woman. Alternate translation: “O my dove” (2) the man speaking about the woman rather than addressing her directly. Alternate translation: “The woman I love is a dove” 
2:14	wv7q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	יוֹנָתִ֞⁠י בְּ⁠חַגְוֵ֣י הַ⁠סֶּ֗לַע בְּ⁠סֵ֨תֶר֙ הַ⁠מַּדְרֵגָ֔ה	1	Here, the man uses a term of affection for the woman, speaking of her as if she were a **dove**. He then explains the way in which she is like a dove. If it would be helpful in your language, you could turn this metaphor into a simile and explain the basis of the comparison. Alternate translation: “O my one who is like a dove. You are like a gentle and timid dove which hides in the clefts of the rock and in the hiding places of the cliff” or “You are like a dove. You are like a gentle and shy dove which hides in the clefts of the rock and in the hiding places of the cliff” or “You are like a dove. Far away in the clefts of the rock, in the hiding places of the cliff”

The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea (that the woman seems difficult to reach and far away) with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if it would be helpful to your readers, you could connect the phrases with a word such as **yes** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating a similar idea to the first one, not saying something additional. However, if saying similar things twice would confuse your readers you could combine the two lines as modeled by the UST. Alternate translation: “in the clefts of the rock, yes,\nin the hiding places of the cliff” 
2:14	zje5			בְּ⁠חַגְוֵ֣י הַ⁠סֶּ֗לַע	1	Alternate translation: “in the cracks of the rock” or “in the cracks of the rock cliff”

2:14	be0w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	הַרְאִ֨י⁠נִי֙ אֶתּ־ מַרְאַ֔יִ⁠ךְ הַשְׁמִיעִ֖י⁠נִי	1	The phrases **show me** and **make me hear** are imperatives, but they communicate a polite request rather than a command. Use forms in your language that communicate a polite request. It may be helpful to add an expression such as “please” or “let” to make this clear. Alternate translation: “please let me see your appearance, please make me hear” or “let me see you, let me hear” 
2:14	datu			קוֹלֵ֥⁠ךְ עָרֵ֖ב	1	Alternate translation: “your voice is sweet-sounding” or “your voice sounds beautiful”

One interpretation is that the harmful things which **the foxes** symbolize are other men. Catching **the foxes** represents removing these harmful things or protecting against them. The term **vineyards** represents the love the man and woman have for each other. The phrase **in blossom** means that the love they have for each other is developing positively and growing, similar to how a plant blossoms and grows. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning of this verse plainly. Alternate translation: “Get rid of the harmful things that hinder and ruin our relationship, for our relationship is blossoming” or “Remove the little things that destroy our growing relationship” or “There are other men who are like little foxes that ruin vineyards; do not allow those men to attack me”
2:15	dac9			לָ֨⁠נוּ֙ שֽׁוּעָלִ֔ים שֽׁוּעָלִ֥ים קְטַנִּ֖ים	1	The original language word that the ULT translates as **foxes** could refer to: (1) **foxes** in which case you could translate the term as the ULT does. (2) “jackals” which are a wild dogs that resemble wolves and coyotes. Alternate translation: “the jackals for us, the little jackals” 
2:15	170A		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	לָ֨⁠נוּ֙ שֽׁוּעָלִ֔ים שֽׁוּעָלִ֥ים קְטַנִּ֖ים	1	Both **foxes** and jackals are land animals that are similar to small dogs and would ruin vineyards by digging up and eating the budding blossoms that could eventually produce grapes. If your readers would not be familiar with these animals and their habits, you could describe the animal you chose to use in your translation (a fox or a jackal) in general terms or use the name of something similar in your area. Alternate translation: “the dog-like animals for us, the little dog-like animals”
2:15	v31m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	לָ֨⁠נוּ֙ & וּ⁠כְרָמֵ֖י⁠נוּ	1	Here, the words **us** and **our** refer to the woman and the man, so use the exclusive forms of these words if your language marks that distinction.

2:16	zb2r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	דּוֹדִ֥⁠י לִ⁠י֙ וַ⁠אֲנִ֣י ל֔⁠וֹ	1	The woman is speaking as if she is talking about the man to another person even though she is most likely speaking directly to the man. This is common in Hebrew poetry. If this would not be natural in your language you can translate this in a way that indicates that the woman is speaking directly to the man. Alternate translation: “My beloved, you belong to me, and I belong to you”
2:16	lxy4			הָ⁠רֹעֶ֖ה בַּ⁠שּׁוֹשַׁנִּֽים	1	The phrase **the man grazing among the lilies** could mean: (1) that the man himself is grazing among the lilies in which case you can translate this phrase as the ULT does. (2) that the man grazes his flock of animals among the lilies. Alternate translation: “the man grazing his flock among the lilies” 
2:16	n6c3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הָ⁠רֹעֶ֖ה בַּ⁠שּׁוֹשַׁנִּֽים	1	The woman is speaking of the man as if he were “a gazelle or a young stag” ([2:9](../02/09.md)) that eats **among the lilies**. She is using **lilies** to represent herself as she did in [2:1](../02/01.md). Here, **the lilies** probably specifically represent the woman’s lips. The meaning here is that the man finds sustenance and enjoyment through being with the woman and kissing her lips. If it would help your readers, you could state the meaning plainly as modeled by the UST or you could explain the meaning in a footnote if you are using footnotes in your translation. Alternate translation: “my beloved gets pleasure grazing among the lilies” or “my beloved gets pleasure as he grazes among the lilies”

Alternate translation: “the evening time when the breeze blows and the shadows cast by the sun disappear” (2) the morning when the light from the sun dawns and the morning breeze blows (**breathes**). Alternate translation: “dawn tomorrow morning, when the darkness disappears” If it would be helpful to your readers you could express the meaning you choose in plain language.\n
2:17	h2b1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	וְ⁠נָ֖סוּ הַ⁠צְּלָלִ֑ים	1	Here, the author is leaving out the word **until** which in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete.

If you choose this option then in your translation you can spell it the way it sounds in your language as modeled by the ULT. (2) be used generically here as a general description for **the mountains**. Alternate translation: “the cleft mountains” or  “the rugged mountains” or “the mountain gorges” 
3:intro	t72h				0	# Song of Songs 3 General Notes\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Longing\n\n[3:1-3](../03/01.md) describes the feeling of longing that the woman had for the man she loved and it describes her diligently seeking the man loved. [3:4](../03/04.md) describes the woman finding the man that she loved and her response to finding him, holding onto him and bringing him to her mother’s house. \n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n\n### Whether [3:1-4](../03/01.md) describe a dream, a real event or something imagined\n\nBible scholars do not know for certain whether the events described in [3:1-4](../03/01.md) are a real event or something that the woman dreamed in a dream or something that the woman imagined. Many Bible scholars think that [3:1-4](../03/01.md) describe a dream. If you are using footnotes you may wish to explain this in a footnote or you could indicate in a section header whether you think this is a dream, a real event or something that the woman imagined. You could also use a general section header such as “The woman searches for the man she loves at night and finds him” which does not comment on whether this was a dream, a real event or something imagined.
3:1	gagz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	עַל־ מִשְׁכָּבִ⁠י֙ בַּ⁠לֵּיל֔וֹת	1	Because Bible scholars do not know if the events described in [3:1-4](../03/01.md) describe real events, things that happened in a dream or things the woman imagined, you should not expand on or explain the phrase **On my bed in the night** in the actual text of your translation (by adding a phrase like “I dreamed I was” or “I imagined I was”) though you may wish to use a header or a footnote. See the section “Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter” in the Introduction to this chapter for more information. 
3:1	eds0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-plural	בַּ⁠לֵּיל֔וֹת	1	In the original language the phrase **in the night** uses a plural form of **night** and could mean: (1) that the woman sought the man during the night. Alternate translation: “during the night” (2) that the woman sought the man throughout the night. Alternate translation: “throughout the night” or “all night long” (3) that the woman sought the man on many nights. Alternate translation: “night after night” or “night upon night”

Not all cultures share the same the same standards of beauty.\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### Metaphors\n\nIn the ancient Near East, it was common to describe a woman using metaphors involving animals. In many cultures today, this can be considered offensive. Different metaphors of beauty are used in different cultures. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n### “My sister, my bride”\nThe woman described is not the sister of her husband. They are not related. Instead, this is a reference to a woman who is a fellow Israelite.

Goats in Israel were black so the original readers would have understood this comparison to mean that the woman’s hair was black. Seen from a distance, a flock of black goats descending down from the high elevation of **Mount Gilead** would have created a majestic visual effect because the goats would have looked like one long flowing mass of black. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state explicitly these two points of comparison.

She has not lost any of her teeth. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the basis of this comparison.

Also, if it would help your readers you could use a term for a material that is thicker than **thread** such as ribbon.

A long neck was considered beautiful in the authors culture. King David built some of his towers of beautiful white marble rock. It is probable that this tower was made from white marble rock since this tower is being used here in comparison with the beauty of the woman’s neck. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the basis of this comparison.

Hebrew poetry often used this kind of parallel statement, in which the second line gives additional information, so it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could connect these two parallel phrases with “each of which” or “each one” in order to show that the second phrase is not repeating the first one, but rather is saying something additional.

The context does not explicitly indicate how exactly the woman’s **two breasts** are like two young gazelles so you could simply say that they resemble young gazelles or if it would be helpful to your readers, you could use a general point of comparison such as their beauty as modeled by the UST. Alternate translation: “Your two breasts resemble two young twin gazelles grazing among lilies”

The man is discreetly indicating that the woman’s breasts are pleasant smelling and that he wants to enjoy them (The man and the woman are now married). It would be good to retain this discreet and beautiful poetic imagery if possible. If you are using footnotes you could indicate what these two metaphors mean there. If you decide that it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning using a simile. Alternate translation: “I myself will go to your breasts which are like two sweet-smelling mountains” or “I myself will be close to your breasts, which are like two pleasant smelling hills”

This is poetry and the author is not literally indicating that the woman is physically in the mountains and near wild and dangerous animals. Rather, the that author is using this metaphor to express the man’s feelings regarding being physically distant from the woman and his strong desire to have the woman near him and away from anything that could harm her. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly using a simile as modeled by the UST.
4:8	h4yw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	אִתִּ֤⁠י…תָּב֑וֹאִי	1	Your language may say “come” rather than **go** in contexts such as this. Use whichever is more natural. Alternate translation: “Go with me … go”

4:8	l03h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	מִ⁠מְּעֹנ֣וֹת אֲרָי֔וֹת מֵֽ⁠הַרְרֵ֖י נְמֵרִֽים	1	These two phrases mean very similar things. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same general idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if saying the same thing twice might be confusing for your readers, you could combine the phrases into one as modeled by the UST.
4:9	d7n7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	לִבַּבְתִּ֖⁠נִי…לִבַּבְתִּ֨י⁠נִי֙	1	The phrase translated as **you have enchanted my heart** is an idiom which could mean: (1) to steal or capture a persons heart. In Jewish thinking the **heart** was the center of a persons thinking. To capture a persons **heart** probably also had the added meaning of causing them to be so in love that they could not think clearly because they were so overcome with feelings of love. Alternate translation: “You have captured my heart … you have captured my heart” or “It is as though you have captured my heart … it is as though you have captured my heart” or “You have made me feel so in love with you that it is as if I have lost my mind … you have made me feel so in love with you that it is as if I have lost my mind“ (2) the the woman had made the man’s **heart** beat faster. Alternate translation: “You have caused my heart to beat fast … you have caused my heart to beat fast” (3) that the woman had encouraged the man’s **heart**. Alternate translation: “You have encouraged my heart … you have encouraged my heart” or “You have given me heart … you have given me heart”
4:9	vdf7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אֲחֹתִ֣⁠י	1	The man and woman are not actually brother and sister. The phrase **my sister** is a term of endearment which expresses affection between lovers. This phrase indicates that the man and woman have a close companionship and deep emotional bond. If calling a lover **my sister** would be offensive or socially inappropriate in your culture you could use a different term of endearment or indicate the meaning of **my sister** with a footnote. Alternately, you could indicate the meaning explicitly as modeled by the UST.

4:10	d1m6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	שְׁמָנַ֖יִ⁠ךְ	1	Here, **oils** refers to perfumes. In the authors culture pleasant smelling spices were mixed into olive oil in order to make a pleasant smelling perfume which was then put on the skin. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “your scented oils” or “the perfumed oils on your skin”
4:10	ts8k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	שְׁמָנַ֖יִ⁠ךְ	1	The author is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could supply the words “is better” from the context as modeled by the UST.

Not all cultures share the same standards of beauty.\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### Metaphors\n\nIn the ancient Near East, it was common to describe a woman using metaphors involving animals. In many cultures today, this can be considered offensive. Different metaphors of beauty are used in different cultures.
