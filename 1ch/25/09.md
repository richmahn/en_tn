# General Information:

This begins the list of 24 lots that were cast to choose the order in which families would serve. This list ends in [1 Chronicles 25:31](../25/31.md).

# The first lot ... the second

"Lot number 1 ... lot number 2." This shows the order in which the families were chosen by lots. If this is unnatural in your language you may use "The initial" for "The first" and "the next" for all of the following ones. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])

# The first lot fell to Joseph's family

For all of the other people in the list, the text specifies that there were "twelve persons in number." Since this was true for Joseph's family too, you may want to state it clearly. Alternate translation: "The first lot fell to Joseph's family, twelve persons in number" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# the second 

This refers to the second lot. The word "lot" may be supplied here. Alternate translation: "the second lot" or "lot number 2" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# Gedaliah

See how you translated this man's name in [1 Chronicles 25:3](../25/03.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# twelve persons in number

"12 people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])
