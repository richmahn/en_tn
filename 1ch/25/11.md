# Connecting Statement:

This continues the list begun in [1 Chronicles 25:9](../25/09.md) of 24 lots that were cast to choose the order in which families would serve.

# the fourth

"lot number 4." This shows the order in which the families were chosen by lots. If this is unnatural in your language you may use "the next lot." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal])

# Izri

This name of this man is spelled Zeri in [1 Chronicles 25:3](../25/03.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
