If this is unnatural in your language you may use "The initial" for "The first" and "the next" for all of the following ones. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])

# Joseph ... Zaccur ... Nethaniah

See how you translated the names of these men in [1 Chronicles 25:2](./01.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
