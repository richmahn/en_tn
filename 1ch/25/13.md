# Connecting Statement:

This continues the list begun in [1 Chronicles 25:9](../25/09.md) of 24 lots that were cast to choose the order in which families would serve.

# the sixth ... the ninth

"lot number 6 ... lot number 7 ... lot number 8 ... lot number 9." This shows the order in which the families were chosen. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])

# the sixth fell to

This refers to the sixth lot. The word "lot" may be supplied here and to the phrases concerning the rest of the lots. Alternate translation: "the sixth lot fell to" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# Bukkiah ... Mattaniah

See how you translated the names of these men in [1 Chronicles 25:4](../25/04.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# twelve persons

"12 people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])
