# more cedar trees than could be counted

This is an exaggeration to show that there was a very large number of cedar trees. This can be stated in active form. AT: "so many cedar trees that no one could count them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# The Sidonians and the Tyrians brought too many cedar logs to David to count

This is background information to explain who provided so many logs. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
