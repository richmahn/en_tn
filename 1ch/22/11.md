# Connecting Statement:

David continues speaking to Solomon.

# Now

David uses this word to introduce something important he is about to say.

# May you build

Solomon would not personally do the building, but he would direct others to do it. Alternate translation: "May you direct people to build" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
