# Connecting Statement:

David continues speaking to Solomon.

# Now

David uses this word to introduce something important he is about to say.

# May you build

Solomon would not personally do the building, but he would direct others to do it. AT: "May you direct people to build" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# when he places you in charge over Israel

"when he makes you king of Israel"

# Be strong and courageous ... Do not fear or be discouraged

These two sentences mean the same thing, stated in different ways in order to emphasize that Solomon should not be afraid. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
