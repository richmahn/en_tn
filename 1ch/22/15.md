# Connecting Statement:

David continues speaking to Solomon.

# stonecutters, masons

These are both workers who cut stone and prepare it for builders to use in walls and buildings.

# carpenters

persons who work with wood

# skillful craftsmen without number of every kind

Here "without number" is an exaggeration to emphasize that there were a large number of them. Alternate translation: "a very large number of every kind of skillful craftsmen" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
