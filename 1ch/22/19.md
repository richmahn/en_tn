This word introduces something important that David is about to say.

# seek Yahweh your God

Seeking Yahweh represents either 1) asking God for help or 2) thinking about God and obeying him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# your ... you

Here these pronouns are plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# with all your heart and your soul

Here "heart" and "soul" refer to the whole person. Alternate translation: "with your whole being" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# Get up and build the holy place

It is understood that Solomon will not do the work personally, but he will direct others to do it. Alternate translation: "Get up and direct the workers as they build the holy place" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# the house built for Yahweh's name

Here "name" refers to honor. This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "the temple you will build to honor Yahweh" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
