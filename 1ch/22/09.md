## on every side ##

This means in every place surrounding Israel.

## in his days ##

"while he rules over Israel"

## a house for my name ##

AT: "a temple to honor me‚Äù (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## He will be my son, and I will be his father ##

God will treat Solomon as if he were God's own son. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel forever ##

Here "throne" refers to the authority to rule as king. AT: "I will make his descendants rule over Israel forever"
