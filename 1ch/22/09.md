# Connecting Statement:

David continues telling Solomon what Yahweh said to him.

# be a peaceful man

"live at peace with everyone"

# give him rest from all his enemies

"cause there to be peace between him and all his enemies"

# on every side

This means in every place surrounding Israel.

# For his name will be Solomon

The name "Solomon" sounds like the Hebrew word for "peace." This can be made explicit. Alternate translation: "His name will be Solomon, which sounds like the word for peace" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# in his days

"while he rules"
