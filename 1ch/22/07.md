# commanded him to build ... my intention to build

The readers should understand that David intended for laborers to do the actual work. Alternate translation: "commanded him to oversee the building of a house for Yahweh ... my plan to oversee the building of the house myself" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# it was my intention

"I intended"

# to build a house myself

The reflexive "myself" means that David originally planned to build the temple. Alternate translation: "that I would be the one to build the temple" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns]])

# for the name of Yahweh my God

Here "name" represents God's honor. Alternate translation: "in order to honor Yahweh my God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
