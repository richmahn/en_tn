# Connecting Statement:

God continues his answer to David's question.

# When you hear the sound of marching in the wind blowing through the balsam treetops

This speaks of the sound of the leaves rustling as wind blows through them as if it were the sound of marching. Alternate translation: "When the wind blowing through the tops of the balsam trees sounds like men marching" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
