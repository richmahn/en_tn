# Connecting Statement:

This continues the list of the children who were born to David in Jerusalem. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# Elishama, Beeliada, and Eliphelet

These are names of men. These names appear also in [1 Chronicles 3:8](../03/08.md), although there "Beeliada" is spelled "Eliada." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
