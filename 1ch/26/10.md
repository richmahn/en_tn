This continues the list of gatekeepers which started in [1 Chronicles 26:1](./01.md).

# Hosah ... Merari ... Shimri ... Hilkiah ... Tabaliah ... Zechariah

These are the names of men. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# the second ... the third ... the fourth

This shows the order in which the sons were born. If it is more natural in your language, you may say "the next" for each son. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])

# All of Hosah's sons and kinsmen were thirteen in number

"There were 13 of Hosah's sons and kinsmen." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])
