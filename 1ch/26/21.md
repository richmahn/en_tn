# Ladan ... Gershon

Translate the names of these men the same as you did in [1 Chronicles 23:7](../23/07.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# descended from Gershon through him and who were leaders of the families of Ladan the Gershonite

Since it is obvious that Ladan's descendants were also descendants of Ladan's ancestor Gershon, the information about them being Gershom's descendants can be left implicit. Alternate translation: "who were leaders of the families of Ladan the Gershonite" (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit)

# Gershonite

A descendant of Gershon. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# Jehieli
This is the name of a man. This is the same person as in [1 Chronicles 23:8](../23/08.md), but there his name is spelled "Jehiel." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
