# Connecting Statement:

This continues the list of gatekeepers that started in [1 Chronicles 26:1](../26/01.md).

# Ammiel ... Issachar ... Peullethai

These are names of men. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# the sixth ... the seventh ... the eighth

This shows the order in which the sons were born. If it is more natural in your language, you may say "the next" for each son. The word "son" may be supplied here. Alternate translation: "the sixth son ... the seventh son ... the eighth son" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
