# General Information:

This continues the list of gatekeepers which started in [1 Chronicles 26:1](./01.md).

# Obed Edom

See how you translated this man's name in [1 Chronicles 16:38](../16/37.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# Shemaiah ... Jehozabad ... Joah ... Sakar ... Nethanel ... Ammiel ... Issachar ... Peullethai

These are the names of men. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# the second ... the third ... the fourth ... the eighth

"the 2nd ... the 3rd ... the 4th ... the 8th" or "number 2 ... number 3 ... number 4 ... number 8." This shows the order in which the sons were born. If it is more natural in your language, you may say "the next" for each son. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])

# who ruled over their families

"who were leaders in their father's family." This means that they were leaders among their clan.
