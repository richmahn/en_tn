# Connecting Statement:

This continues the list of gatekeepers that started in [1 Chronicles 26:1](../26/01.md).

# Elam ... Jehohanan ... Eliehoenai

These are names of men. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# the fifth ... the sixth ... the seventh

This shows the order in which the sons were born. If it is more natural in your language, you may say "the next" for each son. The word "son" may be supplied here. Alternate translation: "the fifth son ... the sixth son ... the seventh son" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
