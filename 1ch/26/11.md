# Connecting Statement:

This ends the list of gatekeepers that started in [1 Chronicles 26:1](../26/01.md).

# Hilkiah ... Tabaliah ... Zechariah ... Hosah

These are names of men. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# the second ... the third ... the fourth

This shows the order in which the sons were born. If it is more natural in your language, you may say "the next" for each son. The word "son" may be supplied here. Alternate translation: "the second son ... the third son ... the fourth son" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# All of Hosah's sons and kinsmen were thirteen in number

"There were 13 of Hosah's sons and kinsmen." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])
