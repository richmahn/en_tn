# threw lots

"cast lots"

# both young and old

This refers to all of the men by describing the extremes. See how you translated a similar phrase in [1 Chronicles 25:8](../25/06.md). Alternate translation: "all of them, including the young men and the old men" or "men of all ages" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
