# Connecting Statement:

This continues the list of gatekeepers that started in [1 Chronicles 26:1](../26/01.md).

# Meshelemiah ... Zechariah

See how you translated the names of these men in [1 Chronicles 9:21](../09/21.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# Jediael ... Zebadiah ... Jathniel

These are names of men. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# the second ... the third ... the fourth ... the fifth

This shows the order in which the sons were born. If it is more natural in your language, you may say "the next" for each son. The word "son" may be supplied here. Alternate translation: "the second son ... the third son ... the fourth son ... the fifth son" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
