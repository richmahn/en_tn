# Meshelemiah ... Zechariah

See how you translated the name of these men in [1 Chronicles 9:21](../09/21.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# Jediael ... Zebadiah ... Jathniel ... Elam ... Jehohanan ... Eliehoenai

These are the names of men. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# the second ... third ... fourth ... seventh

This shows the order in which the sons were born. If it is more natural in your language, you may say "the next" for each son. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
