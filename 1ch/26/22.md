# The descendants of Ladan ... Jehieli, the sons of Jehieli, Zetham, and Joel his brother. They were in charge of the storehouses

"Jehieli and his sons were the descendants of Ladan, who descended from Gershon and belonged to Ladan. Jehieli and his sons were leaders of the families of Ladan the Gershonite. Jehieli and his sons, Zetham and Joel his brother, were in charge of the storehouses"

# Jehieli
This is the name of a man. This is the same person as in [1 Chronicles 23:8](../23/08.md), but there his name is spelled "Jehiel." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# Zetham ... Joel

Translate the names of these men the same as you did in [1 Chronicles 23:8](../23/08.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
