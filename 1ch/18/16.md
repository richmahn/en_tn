# Ahitub ... Abiathar ... Shavsha

These are the names of men. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# Ahimelech

This spelling represents a correction of the spelling "Abimelech," which some versions follow. The corrected spelling makes this verse agree with [2 Samuel 8:17](../08/17.md).
