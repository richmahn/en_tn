# Zeruiah ... Ahilud ... Ahitub ... Abiathar ... Shavsha ... Benaiah ... Jehoiada

These are the names of men. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# Ahimelech

This spelling represents a correction of the spelling "Abimelech," which some versions follow. The corrected spelling makes this verse agree with [2 Samuel 8:17](../08/17.md).

# Zadok son of Ahitub and Ahimelech son of Abiathar were priests

Some versions correct this to say that Ahitub and Ahimelech were high priests.
