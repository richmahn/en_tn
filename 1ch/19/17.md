# Connecting Statement:

This verse continues to describe a second battle when the Arameans who fled from Joab in [1 Chronicles 19:15](../19/15.md) were reinforced by other Arameans and attacked Israel again.

# When David was told this

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: When David's messengers told him that a larger Aramean army was coming" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# he gathered ... He arranged

David did not do these things alone. His official and officers helped him. Alternate translation: "David and his officials gathered ... David and his officers arranged" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# all Israel

This is a generalization. Not every person in Israel came to fight. Alternate translation: "a very large number of Israelites" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# He arranged

"He organized"

# they fought him

Here "him" refers to David's soldiers, in addition to David. Alternate translation: "the Arameans fought David and his soldiers" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
