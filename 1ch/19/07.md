# a thousand talents ... thirty-two thousand chariots

"1,000 talents ... 32,000 talents" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])

# Naharaim ... Maacah ... Zobah ... Medeba

These are the names of cities. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# thirty-two thousand chariots

It is not clear if the Ammonites paid the entire thousand talents to the king of Maacah, or if they paid him only a portion of that amount and gave the rest to the other cities that sent additional chariots and horsemen.
