# Jaaziah ... Shoham ... Zaccur ... Ibri

These are the names of men. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# from Jaaziah: Beno, Shoham

It seems Jaaziah is another son of Merari. And, Beno is the son of Jaaziah. Beno is mentioned in both verses 26 and 27 because he is a leader in his family. However, some Bibles translate "Beno" as "his son" rather than as a proper name. Those Bibles read like this: "from Jaaziah, his son: Shoham."
