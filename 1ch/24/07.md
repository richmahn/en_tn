# General Information:

This begins a list of 24 lots that were cast to decide how the descendants of Eleazar and Ithamar would be divided into groups for their work as priests. This list ends in [1 Chronicles 24:18](../24/18.md).

# The first lot ... the second

"Lot number 1 ... lot number 2." This shows the order in which the families were chosen by lots. If this is unnatural in your language you may use "The initial" for "The first" and "the next" for all of the following ones. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])

# Jehoiarib ... Jedaiah

See how you translated the names of these men in [1 Chronicles 9:10](../09/10.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# the second

This refers to the second lot. The word "lot" may be supplied here. Alternate translation: "the second lot" or "lot number 2"  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
