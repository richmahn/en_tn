# Merari ... Mahli ... Mushi

Translate the names of these men as in [1 Chronicles 23:21](../23/21.md).

# Jaaziah

This is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# from the son of Jaaziah: Beno

It seems Jaaziah is another son of Merari. And, Beno is the son of Jaaziah. Beno is mentioned in both verses 26 and 27 because he is a leader in his family. However, some Bibles translate "Beno" as "his son" rather than as a proper name. Those Bibles read like this: "and from his sons, Jaaziah, his son."
