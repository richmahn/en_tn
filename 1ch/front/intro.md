#### What are 1 and 2 Chronicles about? ####

First Chronicles retold the list of descendants from Adam to Jacob. It then retold the list of descendants from Jacob to the first king of Israel. Second Chronicles retold the history of Israel beginning at the time of Solomon. It ended when the Babylonian army attacked Judah and took some of the people to Babylon. The writers of Chronicles probably wrote these books for the Jews who returned from exile in Babylon. The purpose was to instruct the people to avoid disobeying God as their ancestors did.

#### How should the title of this book be translated? ####

You may also call this book "The Events of the Kings of Judah and Israel, Book 1" or "The First Book of the Events of the Kings of Judah and Israel."

#### Who wrote 1 and 2 Chronicles? ####

It is uncertain who wrote these books. The writers of Chronicles mentioned that they used other books to help with their writing. The names of these other books are "The Chronicles of Samuel the Seer," "The Chronicles of Nathan the Seer," "The Chronicles of Gad the Seer," "The History of Nathan the Prophet," "The Chronicles of Shemaiah the Prophet and Iddo," "The Story of the Prophet Iddo" and "The books of the kings of Judah and Israel."

#### Why are there multiple books which give the history of the kings of Israel? ####

The books of Chronicles and the books of Kings told much of the same history, but they are not exactly the same. The writers of Chronicles were not simply retelling history. They wanted the people to know that Yahweh will still do what he promised in his covenant.

The writers of 1 and 2 Chronicles wanted the Jews to think carefully about David and Solomon. They also wanted the Jews to think about how Jehoshaphat, Hezekiah, and Josiah caused their ancestors to repent and to worship Yahweh. The writers wanted to encourage the Jews and their leaders to obey the law and to honor God's covenant with them. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/covenant]])

## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts ##

#### Why did God punish the people of Israel? ####

God punished the people of Israel because they disobeyed him and worshiped false gods. God punished the people by causing disasters and causing them to lose in battle. However, God forgave the people and caused them to prosper again if they repented and obeyed him. The writers of 1 and 2 Chronicles continually reminded the readers that God punished his people because they disobeyed. They wanted the readers to understand that they must obey God or he will punish them also. 

#### Why are alliances with foreign countries seen as evil in these books? ####

Yahweh was the true leader of Israel and the protector of their nation. The people of Israel should have trusted him instead of relying on other nations to protect them. 

## Part 3: Important Translation Issues ##

#### What is the meaning of the term "Israel"? ####

The name "Israel" is used in many different ways in the Bible. There was a man named Jacob. God changed his name to Israel. The descendants of Jacob became a nation also called Israel. Eventually, the nation of Israel split into two kingdoms. The northern kingdom was named Israel. The southern kingdom was named Judah.

#### What does it mean to "seek God"? ####

The writers of 1 and 2 Chronicles often wrote about "seeking God." To "seek God" means to make an effort to please and honor God. It can also mean to ask God for help. It does not imply that God is hidden. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

#### What does the phrase "to this day" mean? ####

The writers used the phrase "to this day" to refer to the time when they were writing. The translator should be aware that "to this day" refers to a time which has already passed. The translator might decide to say, "to this day, at the time when this is being written," or, "to this day, at the time of writing." This Hebrew phrase occurs in 1 Chronicles 4:41, 43; 5:26; 13:11; 20:26; 21:10; 35:25.
