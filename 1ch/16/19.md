# Connecting Statement:

The words "you," "they," "them," and "their" in these verses refer to Israel.

# strangers in the land

It is implied that "the land" refers to Canaan. AT: "foreigners in the land of Canaan" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another

These two phrases have similar meanings and are used together for emphasis. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# for their sakes

"for their own well-being"

# Do not touch my anointed ones

Here "touch" means to harm. It is an exaggeration Yahweh used to strengthen his warning to not harm his people. AT: "Do not harm the people I have anointed" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
