# 1 Chronicles 16 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Chapters 15 and 16 tell how David organized the priests and Levites. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/priest]])

Many translations set apart poetry and lists by indenting them. The ULB indents each line in the poetic song in 16:8-36.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### David's psalm #####
As David organized the priests in their work in the tent, he wrote a psalm of praise to Yahweh.
