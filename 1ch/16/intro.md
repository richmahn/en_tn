# 1 Chronicles 16 General Notes

#### Structure and formatting

Chapters 15 and 16 tell how David organized the priests and Levites. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/priest]])

Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetic song in 16:8-36.

#### Special concepts in this chapter

##### David's psalm
As David organized the priests in their work in the tent, he wrote a psalm of praise to Yahweh.
