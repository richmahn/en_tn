# 1 Chronicles 16 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Chapters 15 and 16 tell how David organized the priests and Levites. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/priest]])

Some translations set each line of poetry further to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetic song in 16:8-36.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### David's psalm #####
As David organized the priests in their work in the tent, he wrote a psalm of praise to Yahweh.
