This means Abishai was the leader of the three who went and got water for David.

# three hundred

"300 men" or "300 warriors" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])

# He is mentioned along with the Three

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "People often mentioned him when they spoke of the Three" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
