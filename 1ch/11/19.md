# May it be that I should never do this!

"May I never do something like this!" or "This is something I should never do!"

# Should I drink the blood of these men who have risked their lives?

David speaks of the water as if it were blood because the men risked their lives to bring the water to him. He uses a question to emphasize this. This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: "I should not drink this water, which would be like drinking the blood of these men who have risked their lives to bring it to me."
