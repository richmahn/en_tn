# David took the stronghold of Zion

Here the word "took" is an idiom that means "captured" or "conquered." Since David led the army, his name here is a synecdoche for the whole army who attacked the city. Alternate translation: "David captured the stronghold of Zion" or "David and the Israelite army captured the stronghold of Zion" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# the stronghold of Zion ... the city of David

Both of these names refer to Jerusalem.
