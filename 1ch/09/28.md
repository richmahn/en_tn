# Some of them

"Some of the guards"

# they counted the articles when they were brought in and when they were taken out

This can be translated in active form. AT: "they counted the articles that people took out to use, and they counted the articles when people brought them back" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# Some of them also were assigned to take care of

It is not clear who assigned these men, so if you have to translate in active form, use your language's most general way of doing so. AT: "The leaders also assigned some of them to take care of" or "Some of them also took care of" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
