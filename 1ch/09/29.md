# Some of them also were assigned to take care of

It is not clear who assigned these men, so if you have to translate in active form, use your language's most general way of doing so. Alternate translation: "The leaders also assigned some of them to take care of" or "Some of them also took care of" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
