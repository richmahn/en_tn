# David assembled all Israel at Jerusalem

Here the word "all" is a generalization. The phrase "all Israel" means that David assembled people from all over Israel, not that he assembled every person in Israel. Alternate translation: "David assembled at Jerusalem people from all over Israel" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
