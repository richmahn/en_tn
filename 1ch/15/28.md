# So all Israel brought up the ark

Here the word "all" is a generalization. Alternate translation: "So a great crowd of Israelites brought up the ark" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# cymbals

two thin, round metal plates that are hit together to make a loud sound. See how you translated this in [1 Chronicles 13:8](../13/08.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
