# General Information:

David continues to speak to the Israelites.

# He said to me

"God said to me"

# my house

The word "house" refers to the temple of Yahweh.

# I have chosen him to be my son, and I will be his father

This does not mean that Solomon becomes an actual son of God, but it describes the personal relationship that he and God will have. AT: "I have chosen to treat him like a son, and I will be like a father to him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# my commandments and decrees

These two words basically mean the same thing and refer to everything that Yahweh had commanded. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# as you are this day

The word "you" here refers to David. Also, the understood word "committed" may be supplied. AT: "just as you are committed this day" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
