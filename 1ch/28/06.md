David continues to speak to the Israelites.

## He said to me ##

AT: "God said to me"

## my house ##

The word "house" refers to the temple of Yahweh.

## I have chosen him to be my son, and I will be his father ##

This does not mean that Solomon becomes an actual son of God, but it describes the personal relationship that he and God will have. AT: "I have chosen to treat him like a son, and I will be like a father to him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## my commandments and decrees ##

These two words basically mean the same thing and are used together to emphasize the importance of doing what God says. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

## as you are this day ##

The word "you" here refers to David. AT: "just as you are committed this day" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
