# my commandments and decrees

These two words basically mean the same thing and refer to everything that Yahweh had commanded. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# as you are this day

The word "you" here refers to David. Also, the understood word "committed" may be supplied. AT: "just as you are committed this day" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
