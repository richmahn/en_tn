# General Information:

David continues speaking to the Israelites.

# chose me ... to be king over Israel forever

One possible meaning is that here David is a metonym for David and his descendants who will rule Israel forever. Alternate translation: "chose me and my descendants ... to be kings over Israel forever" Another is that David will continue to be the king of Israel after he is resurrected from the dead. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# all Israel

"the whole land of Israel" or "all the Israelites"
