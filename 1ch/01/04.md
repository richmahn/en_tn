# The sons of Noah

Noah was Lamech's son. AT: "The sons of Lamech's son Noah" 

# The sons of Noah were Shem, Ham, and Japheth

Some versions, including the ULB and UDB, include "The sons of" in order to make it clear that Shem, Ham, and Japheth were brothers to each other and sons of Noah. Otherwise, the reader would assume that each person represented one generation farther away from Noah, their ancestor.
