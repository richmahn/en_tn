# General Information:

David continues his prayer of praise to Yahweh.

# But who am I, and who are my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly these things?

David uses this rhetorical question to express that he and his people deserve no praise for giving anything to God. Alternate translation: "My people and I should definitely offer these things to you willingly!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
