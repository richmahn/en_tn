# General Information:

David continues his prayer of praise to Yahweh.

# But who am I, and who are my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly these things?

David uses this rhetorical question to express that he and his people deserve no praise for giving anything to God. AT: "My people and I should definitely offer these things to you willingly!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# we are strangers and travelers before you

This speaks of people's lives being short as if they were travelers only here on earth for a short time. AT: "For our lives are short and we are like strangers and travelers who pass before you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Our days on the earth are like a shadow

This speaks of people's lives being short as if they were a shadow that is only visible for a short time. A person's lifetime is represented by his "days." AT: "Our time here on earth is like a shadow that disappears quickly" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
