# Connecting Statement:

David continues his prayer of praise to Yahweh.

# In your hand is power and might

This speaks of Yahweh having control over whether people are powerful or not as if "power and might" were something in hand that he had control over. Alternate translation: "You determine who has power and might" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# power and might

The words "power" and "might" mean the same thing and emphasize the greatness of Yahweh's power. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
