David continues his prayer of praise to Yahweh.

## In your hand is power and might ##

These two words "might" and "power" mean the same thing and are used together here to emphasize that Yahweh controls everything and no one is more powerful than Yahweh. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
