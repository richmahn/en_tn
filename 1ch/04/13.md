# General Information:

It may be helpful to create a verse bridge and to put verse 15 together with verse 13 since Kenaz was a descendant of Jephunneh and Caleb. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge]])

# Kenaz ... Othniel ... Seraiah ... Hathath ... Meonothai

These are names of men. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
