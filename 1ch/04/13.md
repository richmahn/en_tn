# General Information:

It may be helpful to create a verse bridge and to put verse 15 together with verse 13 since Kenaz was a descendant of Jephunneh and Caleb. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge]])

# Kenaz ... Othniel ... Seraiah ... Hathath ... Meonothai ... Ophrah ... Joab ... Jephunneh ... Iru ... Elah ... Naam ... Jehallelel ... Ziph ... Ziphah ... Tiria ... Asarel

These are the names of men. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
