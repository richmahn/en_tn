# General Information:

It may be helpful to create a verse bridge and to put verse 15 together with verse 13 since Kenaz was a descendant of Jephunneh and Caleb. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge]])

# Kenaz ... Othniel ... Seraiah ... Hathath ... Meonothai ... Ophrah ... Joab ... Jephunneh ... Iru ... Elah ... Naam ... Jehallelel ... Ziph ... Ziphah ... Tiria ... Asarel

These are the names of men. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# Ge-Harashim, whose people were craftsmen

Ge-Harashim means "Valley of Craftsmen." This can be made explicit with an explanation. AT: "Ge-Harashim, which means 'Craftsmen's Valley.' It was called this because its people were craftsmen" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# craftsmen

people skilled at making or building things
