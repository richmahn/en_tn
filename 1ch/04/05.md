# Ashhur ... Tekoa

See how you translated these men's names in [1 Chronicles 2:24](../02/23.md).

# Ahuzzam ... Hepher ... Zereth ... Zohar ... Ethnan ... Koz ... Anub ... Hazzobebah ... Aharhel ... Harum

These are the names of men. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# Temeni ... Haahashtari

These are understood here as the names of men. However, some versions understand them as the names of clans that were begun by the sons of Ashhur.

# Helah ... Naarah

These are the names of women. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# bore him

"gave birth to his sons"

# and of the clans descended from Aharhel son of Harum

A new sentence can start here. "Koz also became the ancestor of Harum and the clans that descended from Harum's son Aharhel"
