# General Information:

This begins a list of the men from the tribe of Gad who joined David. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# whose faces were as fierce as the faces of lions

Here the word "faces" represents the men and the lions. Their faces express the fierceness with which they fight battles. Alternate translation: "who were as fierce in battle as lions hunting prey" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# They were as swift as gazelles on the mountains

This hyperbole compares how swiftly these men were able to run with how swiftly gazelles are able to run over rugged mountain terrain. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# gazelles

animals similar to deer that can run quickly over hills and rough ground
