# David assembled all Israel together

Here the word "all" is a generalization. The phrase means that David assembled people from all over Israel, not that he assembled every person in Israel. Alternate translation: "David assembled people together from all Israel" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# Lebo Hamath ... Kiriath Jearim

These are the names of places. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
