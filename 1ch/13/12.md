# How can I bring the ark of God home to me?

David uses this question to emphasize that he is afraid to take the ark to Jerusalem. This can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: "I am too afraid to bring the ark of Yahweh with me to Jerusalem." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
