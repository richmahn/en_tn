# the king's word was enforced against Joab

"the command of the king prevailed despite Joab's objections"

# So Joab left and went throughout all Israel

It is understood from David's command in [1 Chronicles 21:2](../21/01.md) that Joab went to count the people of Israel. It can be stated clearly. Alternate translation: "So Joab left and went throughout all Israel to count the people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
