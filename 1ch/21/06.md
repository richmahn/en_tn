# But Levi and Benjamin were not counted among them

The Levites were supposed to lead worship and not to fight. It is unclear why Joab did not count Benjamin. This can be stated in active voice. AT: "But Joab did not count the men from the tribes of Levi and Benjamin" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# the king's command had disgusted Joab

This can be stated in active form. AT: "Joab was offended by what David had commanded" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# by this action

Here "this action" refers to David's plan to count all the men of Israel who are able to fight.

# so he attacked Israel

The nature of this attack is not clear. It was apparently enough to cause David to realize that Yahweh was angry with him for counting the people.

# take away your servant's guilt

This is an idiom. Forgiveness is here spoken of as having guilt taken away. AT: "forgive me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# your servant's guilt

David refers to himself as God's servant. AT: "my guilt" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
