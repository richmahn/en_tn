# Connecting Statement:

Yahweh continues describing his promises to King David through the prophet Nathan.

# I will be a father to him, and he will be my son

The prophecy in 17:11-14 refers to Solomon, David's son. But, aspects of the prophecy will be fulfilled by Jesus. So, here it is best to translate the words "father" and "son" with your normal words for a biological father and son.

# I will not take my covenant faithfulness away from him, as I took it from Saul

The abstract noun "faithfulness" can be translated as "faithfully." Alternate translation: "I will never stop faithfully loving him, as I stopped loving Saul" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
