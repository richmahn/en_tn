# General Information:

The words "your" and "you" in this verse refers to David.

# Connecting Statement:

Yahweh continues describing his promises to King David through the prophet Nathan.

# from the days

Here "days" represents a longer period of time. Alternate translation: "from the time" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# I commanded judges

After the people of Israel entered the land of Canaan and before they had kings to rule them, God appointed leaders called "judges" to lead them in times of trouble.

# to be over my people Israel

To be in authority is referred to as being over someone. Alternate translation: "to rule my people Israel" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# subdue

make a person or animal unable to attack

# build you a house

Here the metonym "house" refers to David's ancestors continuing on as the rulers of Israel. In [1 Chronicles 17:4](../17/04.md) God told David he would not be the one to build a house for Yahweh. There "house" represented a temple. If your language has a word that can express both ideas, use it here and in 17:4. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
