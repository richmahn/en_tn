This has quotations within quotations. It may be necessary to translate them as indirect quotations. Alternate translation: "saying, 'Go and tell David my servant that he will not be the one to build a house in which I will live" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])

# build me a house
