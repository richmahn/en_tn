Cedar is a kind of tree that is known for its strength. If you have an equivalent type of tree in your culture, you can use that name, otherwise you can reword this. Alternate translation: "I am living in a strong, permanent house" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

Tents are temporary dwellings. If you do not have tents in your culture, you can word this differently. Alternate translation: "the ark of the covenant of Yahweh is staying in a temporary place" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
