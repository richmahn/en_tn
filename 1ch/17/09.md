# Connecting Statement:

Yahweh continues describing his promises to King David through the prophet Nathan.

# I will appoint a place

"I will choose a place"

# will plant them there

God causing the people to live in the land permanently and securely is spoken of as if he would plant them in the land. Alternate translation: "I will settle them there" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# be troubled no more

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "no one will ever trouble them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
