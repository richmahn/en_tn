# Connecting Statement:

David continues to speak to Yahweh.

# your servant's sake

Here David refers to himself as "your servant." This can be stated in first person. Alternate translation: "my sake" or "my benefit" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# to fulfill your own purpose

"to accomplish what you planned to do"
