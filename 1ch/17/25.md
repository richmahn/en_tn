# Connecting Statement:

David continues to speak to Yahweh.

# your servant

David refers to himself as "your servant." This can be expressed in the first person. Alternate translation: "me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# that you will build him a house

Here the metonym "house" refers to David's ancestors continuing on as the rulers of Israel. In [1 Chronicles 17:4](./03.md) Yahweh tells David he would not be the one to build a house for Yahweh. There "house" represented a temple. If your language has a word that can express both ideas, use it here and in 17:4. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# I, your servant, have found courage

The abstract noun "courage" can be expressed here as the verb "encouraged." Alternate translation: "I, your servant, am encouraged"
