# Connecting Statement:

David continues to speak to Yahweh.

# your servant

David refers to himself as "your servant." This can be expressed in the first person. AT: "me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# that you will build him a house

Here the metonym "house" refers to David's ancestors continuing on as the rulers of Israel. In [1 Chronicles 17:4](./03.md) Yahweh tells David he would not be the one to build a house for Yahweh. There "house" represented a temple. If your language has a word that can express both ideas, use it here and in 17:4. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# I, your servant, have found courage

The abstract noun "courage" can be expressed here as the verb "encouraged." AT: "I, your servant, am encouraged"

# Now

This does not mean "at this moment," but is used to draw attention to the important point that follows.

# your servant's house

David speaks of himself in the third person. This can be expressed in the first person. AT: "my house" or "my family" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# You, Yahweh, have blessed it, and it will be blessed forever

These two phrases have about the same meaning and are repeated here for emphasis. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# it will be blessed forever

This can be stated in active form. AT: "you will continue to bless it forever" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
