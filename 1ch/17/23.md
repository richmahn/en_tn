# Connecting Statement:

David continues to speak to Yahweh.

# So now

Here "now" does not mean "at this moment," but is used to draw attention to the important point that follows.

# may the promise that you made concerning your servant and his family be established forever

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "may you do what you promised to me and my family, and may your promise never change" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# your servant and his family

David is speaking about himself in the third person. This can be stated in the first person. Alternate translation: "me and my family" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
