# When every man of Israel

This is probably a generalization. AT: "When the men of Israel" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# they had fled

"the Israelite soldiers had fled"

# the Philistines came and lived in them

"the Philistines came and lived in the cities from which the Israelites had fled." This probably happened after the events in verses 8-12.
