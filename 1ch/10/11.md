# When all Jabesh Gilead heard of all that the Philistines

Both instances of the word "all" are generalizations. The name of the town is a metonym for the people who live in the town, and the people group name is a metonym for that people group's soldiers. Alternate translation: "When the people of Jabesh Gilead heard what the soldiers of the Philistine army" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
