## when Israel had finished killing all the inhabitants ... when all of them ... had fallen by the edge of the sword ##

The writer uses both of these sentences, which mean almost the same thing, to strongly say that the Israelites had obeyed God's command to kill everyone in Ai. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## had fallen by the edge of the sword ##

"had been killed with swords by the army of Israel" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
