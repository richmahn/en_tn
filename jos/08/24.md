## translationNotes

* **when Israel had finished killing all the inhabitants ... when all of them ... had fallen by the edge of the sword** - The writer uses both of these sentences, which mean almost the same thing, to strongly say that the Israelites had obeyed God's command to kill everyone in Ai. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
* **had fallen by the edge of the sword** - "had been killed with swords by the army of Israel" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
