# Joshua 21 General Notes #

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

This chapter is about the land given to the tribe of Levi. Even though they did not receive a large piece of land like the other tribes, they did receive small pieces of land to live on and for their animals. It will be difficult to fully understand their locations without a map. Further research may be needed to understand the locations of their land. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
