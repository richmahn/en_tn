# clans of the Kohathites

The priests in this group were descendants of Levi's son Kohath. A portion of them were also descendants of Aaron, Kohath's grandson. See how you translated this in [Joshua 21:2](./02.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# casting of lots

A random method of choosing to remove the choice from the leader's will, often done with the idea that God will decide the outcome. See how you translated this in [Joshua 19:1](../19/01.md).
