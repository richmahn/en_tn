# Not one of their enemies could defeat them

This is stated in a negative way to strengthen the statement. Alternate translation: "They defeated every one of their enemies" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])

# gave all their enemies into their hand

Here "into their hand" means "into their power." Alternate translation: "gave them power to defeat all their enemies" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
