# Joshua 17 General Notes #

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Manasseh's lack of faith #####
Even though they were one of the largest and most powerful tribes of Israel, the tribe of Manasseh lacked faith in the power of Yahweh. This caused them many problems. It would also cause their descendants many problems. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]])

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

This chapter is about the land given to the tribe of Manasseh, one of Joseph's sons. It will be difficult to fully understand their locations without a map. Further research may be needed to understand the locations of their land. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
