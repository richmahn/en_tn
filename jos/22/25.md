# General Information:

The tribes of Reuben, Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh continue their answer.

# For Yahweh has made the Jordan ... nothing to do with Yahweh

This is the continuation of the hypothetical accusation that the three tribes think the children of the other tribes may make sometime in the future. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])

# the Jordan

This is a short name for the Jordan River.

# So your children might make our children cease to worship Yahweh

The three tribes built the altar to avoid this hypothetical situation from happening in the future. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
