# committed this breach of faith against him

"broken your promise to him"

# you have rescued the people of Israel out of the hand of Yahweh

Here "the hand of Yahweh" refers to his punishment. Protecting the people is spoken of as rescuing them from his hand. Alternate translation: "you have kept Yahweh from punishing us" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
