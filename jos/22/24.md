# General Information:

The tribes of Reuben, Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh now give their answer.

# your children might say to our children ... God of Israel?

This is a hypothetical accusation that the three tribes think the children of the other tribes may make sometime in the future. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])

# What have you to do with Yahweh, the God of Israel?

The three tribes use this rhetorical question to emphasize the situation they are trying to avoid. This can be written as a statement. Alternate translation: "You have nothing to do with Yahweh, the God of Israel!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
