## translationNotes

* **Achan and Zerah** - Names of people. Translate Achan the same way as in Joshua 7:1, 10, 18-20, 24. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
* **Did not Achan, the son of Zerah, break faith in the matter of those things that had been reserved for God? And did not wrath fall on all the people of Israel?** - These questions are to emphasize the past experience for the hearer. Those asking assume they already know the answer. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
