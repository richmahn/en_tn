# whose inheritance had not been assigned

The land that the tribes would receive is spoken of as if it were an inheritance that they would receive as a permanent possession. This can be stated in active form. AT: "to whom Joshua had not assigned land as an inheritance" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
