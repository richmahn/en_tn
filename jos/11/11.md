# They struck with the sword every living creature that was there ... so there was not any living creature left alive

These two phrases share similar meanings and emphasize complete destruction. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# he set them apart to be destroyed

The word "he" refers to Joshua and represents himself and his army. Completely destroying every living thing in the city is spoken of as if those living things were dedicated for destruction. Alternate translation: "the army completely destroyed them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
