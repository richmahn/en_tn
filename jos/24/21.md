This refers to the Israelites.

# turn your heart to Yahweh

Deciding to obey Yahweh only is spoken of as turning their heart towards him. Here "heart" represents the whole person. In this case, "heart" is plural because it refers to all the Israelites as a single group. However, it may be best to translate it in the plural since "your" is plural. AT: "turn yourselves to Yahweh" or "decide to obey Yahweh" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
