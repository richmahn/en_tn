# General Information:

Joshua continues quoting what Yahweh said about his dealings with his people.

# brought you out ... brought your ancestors out

Yahweh continually alternates between these two phrases, which both refer to all the Israelites, past and present. The word "you" is plural throughout this speech and refers to the entire nation of Israel. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
