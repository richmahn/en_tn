# Joshua 10 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

The ULB sets the lines in 10:12-13 farher to the right on the page than the rest of the text because they are a poem.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### "For Yahweh was waging war on behalf of Israel" #####
Israel's conquest of the Promised Land was Yahweh's war on the ungodly Canaanites more than Israel's war. This type of war was different from other wars and God gave Israel special instructions. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/promisedland]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/ungodly]])

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter ####

##### Idiom #####
 
The people of Gibeon used an idiom when they called for help from Israel: "Do not withdraw your hands," meaning "do not stop protecting." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
