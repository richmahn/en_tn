# Eglon

This is the name of a city. See how you translated this in [Joshua 10:3](./03.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# They captured it and struck with the sword

The sword represents the army of Israel and striking expresses the idea of slaughter and destruction. AT: "They captured and killed and destroyed" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# They completely destroyed every living creature in it, leaving no survivors ... He completely destroyed it, and every living creature in it.

These two sentence are saying basically the same thing and are combined for emphasis. Together they emphasize the completeness of the destruction of Hebron. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
