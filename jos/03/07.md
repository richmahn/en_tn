# General Information:

Yahweh tells Joshua what the priest are to do.

# I will make you a great man in the eyes of all Israel

The eyes represent seeing, and seeing represents thoughts or judgment. Alternate translation: "the people will see what I do and realize that I have made you a great man" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
