#### What is the Book of Joshua about? ####

The Book of Joshua is about the Israelites entering the Promised Land and occupying it. Joshua was the leader that replaced Moses. He led the Israelites in battle to fight the people living in the Promised Land. This book also tells how the Israelites divided the land among the twelve tribes. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/promisedland]])

#### How should the title of this book be translated? ####

Translators may create a short title such as "The Book about When Joshua Led Israel." Translators should avoid a title that suggests Joshua as the writer of the book.

#### Who wrote the Book of Joshua? ####

The book does not indicate who wrote it. However, there are verses in the book that indicate that Joshua may have written some it. Since ancient times, Jews have thought that Joshua wrote most of the book.

## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts ##

#### How does the Book of Joshua present the cause of historical events ####

In the ancient Near East, people assumed that the gods caused world events to happen in a certain way. The Book of Joshua has some similarities with this view, but there are important differences. In Joshua, these events occurred because Yahweh promised the Israelites that he would give them the Promised Land. However, the results of the events were also based on whether the Israelites obeyed or disobeyed Yahweh.

## Part 3: Important Translation Issues ##

#### What does the phrase "to this day" mean? ####

This phrase was used by the writer to refer to the time when he was writing. The translator should be aware that "to this day" refers to a time which has already passed. He must avoid giving the impression to readers that "to this day" means the present day. The translator might decide to say "to this day, at the time when this was being written," or "to this day, at the time of writing." This Hebrew phrase occurs in Joshua 4:9; 6:25; 7:26; 8:28, 29; 10:27; 13:13; 14:14; 15:63; 16:10.

#### What does the phrase "all Israel" mean? ####

This phrase appears many times in the Book of Joshua, but it does not always mean every Israelite in the nation. At times it means the Israelite army. At other times it means the representatives of the twelve tribes of Israel. In still other passages it probably means many people in the nation of Israel.

#### When should Joshua be translated? ####

The Book of Joshua should probably not be translated before Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. This is because the historical events of Joshua will not be understood without the information provided by these previous books.
