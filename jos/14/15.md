# Then the land had rest from war

The people no longer fighting wars is spoken of as if the land were a person who rested from war. See how you translated this phrase in [Joshua 11:23](../11/23.md). Alternate translation: "Then the people no longer fought wars in the land" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
