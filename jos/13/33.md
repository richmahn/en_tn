# Yahweh, the God of Israel, is their inheritance

The writer speaks of the great honor that the Levites had by serving Yahweh as priests as if Yahweh were something that they would inherit. Alternate translation: "Yahweh, the God of Israel, is what they have" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
