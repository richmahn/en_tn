#### Structure and formatting ####

This chapter begins a section about dividing the land between the tribes of Israel.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Division of the land #####

There was still much land to be captured west of the Jordan River, but the tribe of Reuben, Gad and half of the tribe of Mannasah received their land east of the Jordan.  This land had been promised to them in Numbers 32.

##### Driving out the people #####

While Yahweh achieved many great victories through Joshua, Israel was still supposed to drive out the rest of the Canaanites. Israel's success in this would depend on their faith in Yahweh. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]])
