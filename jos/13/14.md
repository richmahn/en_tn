# Moses gave no inheritance

The land that Moses assigned to the tribes of Israel is spoken of as if it were an inheritance that they received as a permanent possession. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# The offerings of Yahweh ... are their inheritance

The writer speaks of the great honor that the Levites had by serving Yahweh as priests as if the offerings were something that they would inherit. Alternate translation: "The offerings of Yahweh ... are what they will have for their provision" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# offerings of Yahweh

"offerings that the people were to bring to Yahweh"

# made by fire
