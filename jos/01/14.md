# your little ones

"your little children"

# beyond the Jordan

This refers to the east side of the Jordan River. Later most of the Israelites would live west of the Jordan, so they called the east side "beyond the Jordan." But at this time they were all still on the east side. Alternate translation: "east of the Jordan River" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
