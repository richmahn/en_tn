Yahweh continues speaking to Joshua.

## your land ##

The word "your" refers to the tribes of Israel, and not Joshua only.  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

## to stand before you ##

In verse 5 the words "you" and "your" refer to Joshua. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

## I will not abandon you or leave you ##

The words "abandon" and "leave" mean basically the same thing. Yahweh combines them to emphasize that he will not do these things. AT: "I will certainly stay with you always" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
