# I have given you every place

God giving the land to the Israelites in the future is spoken of as if he gave it to them in the past. This emphasizes that he will certainly give it to them. Alternate translation: "I will give to you every place" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture]])

# I have given you

The word "you" refers to both Joshua and the nation of Israel. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# every place where the sole of your foot will walk

This refers to all the places Joshua and the Israelites will travel when they cross the Jordan River. Alternate translation: "everywhere you go in this land" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
