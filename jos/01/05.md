# to stand before you

In verse 5 the words "you" and "your" refer to Joshua. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# I will not abandon you or leave you

The words "abandon" and "leave" mean basically the same thing. Yahweh combines them to emphasize that he will not do these things. Alternate translation: "I will certainly stay with you always" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
