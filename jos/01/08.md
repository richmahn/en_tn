Yahweh continues speaking to Joshua.

## You will always speak ##

This means that Joshua should speak of the book of the law often. The word "always" adds emphasis or intensity. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

## prosperous and successful ##

These two words mean basically the same thing and emphasize great prosperity. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
