These Isrelites were specifically the Reubenites, Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh that replied to Joshua.

# rebels against your commands and disobeys your words

These two phrases mean basically the same thing and emphasize that any form of disobedience will be punished. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# will be put to death

This can be stated in active form. AT: "we will put to death" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# be strong and courageous

Israel and God considered both traits important for Joshua to pursue as their leader. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
