# Connecting Statement:

Yahweh continues telling Joshua what he must tell the people.

# you must present yourselves by your tribes

There were twelve tribes that made up the people of Israel. The phrase "by your tribes" means "each tribe." Alternate translation: "each of your tribes must present themselves to Yahweh" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# The tribe that Yahweh selects will come near by their clans

The tribe was made up of multiple clans. Alternate translation: "From the tribe that Yahweh selects, each clan will come near" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# The tribe that Yahweh selects

The leaders of Israel would toss lots, and by doing this, they would learn which tribe Yahweh had selected. This can be stated clearly. Alternate translation: "The tribe that Yahweh selects by lot" or "The tribe that Yahweh selects when we toss lots"

# The clan that Yahweh selects must come near by each household

The clan was made up of multiple households. Alternate translation: "From the clan that Yahweh selects, each household must come near" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# The household that Yahweh selects must come near one by one

The household was made up of multiple people. Alternate translation: "From the household that Yahweh selects, each person must come near" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
