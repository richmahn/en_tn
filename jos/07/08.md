Joshua expresses frustration to God.

## Lord, what can I say, after Israel has turned their backs before their enemies! ##

AT: O Lord, I have no more words to say to you. Israel has run away in defeat. We have turned our backs in shame as we ran away from our enemies." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## so what will you do for your great name ##

The phrase "your great name" here represents the reputation and power of God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
