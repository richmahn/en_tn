# the things that were set apart

These are the things "marked for destruction" from [Joshua 6:18-19](../06/18.md). Alternate translation: "the cursed things" or "those things which God has cursed"

# They have stolen and then also hidden their sin

Hiding their sin represents trying to keep others from knowing that they have sinned. Alternate translation: "They have stolen those things, and then they tried to keep people from knowing that they sinned" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
