# his fame spread throughout the land

This refers to Joshua's fame, not Yahweh's. Becoming known among the people throughout the land is spoken of as if his fame spread. Alternate translation: "Joshua became famous throughout the land" or "people throughout the land learned about Joshua" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
