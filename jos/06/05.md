# Connecting Statement:

God continues telling Joshua what the people must do.

# they must sound a long blast with the ram's horn ... of the trumpet

The word "they" refers to the seven priests. The "ram's horn" and "trumpet" refer to the trumpets of rams' horns that the priests were blowing in [Joshua 6:4](../06/04.md).

# the wall of the city

"the outer wall of the city" or "the wall surrounding the city"
