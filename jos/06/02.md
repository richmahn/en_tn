# I have delivered Jericho into your hand, its king, and its trained soldiers

Yahweh is telling Joshua that he will certainly do this by saying that he has already done it. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture]])

# into your hand

The word "hand" is a metonym for the control that the hand exercises. Alternate translation: "so that you can control it" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
