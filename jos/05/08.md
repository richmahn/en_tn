# This day I have rolled away the disgrace of Egypt from you

Their disgrace is spoken of as if it were a large stone that blocked their path. Here "rolled away" means "removed." AT: "This day I have removed the disgrace of Egypt from you" or "You were disgraced when you were slaves in Egypt. But, today I have caused you to no longer be disgraced" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
