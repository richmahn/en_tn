## translationNotes

* **their hearts melted, and there was no longer any spirit in them** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing and emphasize the intensity of their fear. AT: “they were terrified” (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
