# he lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, a man was standing

Here looking up is spoken of as if Joshua literally lifted his eyes in his hands. AT: "he looked up and saw that a man was standing" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# behold

The word "behold" alerts us to pay special attention to new information. Your language may have a way of doing this.

# he had drawn his sword and it was in his hand

Here the words "he" and "his" refer to the man who was standing in front of Joshua.
