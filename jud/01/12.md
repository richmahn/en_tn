# Connecting Statement:

Jude uses a series of metaphors to describe the ungodly men. He tells the believers how to recognize these men when they are among them.

# These are the ones

The word "These" refers to the "ungodly men" of [Jude 1:4](../01/04.md).

# hidden reefs

Reefs are large rocks that are very close to the surface of water in the sea. Because sailors cannot see them, they are very dangerous. Ships can easily be destroyed if they hit these rocks. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# twice dead, torn up by the roots

A tree that someone has uprooted is a metaphor for death. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# torn up by the roots

Like trees that have been completely pulled out of the ground by their roots, the ungodly people have been separated from God, who is the source of life. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
