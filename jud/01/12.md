## translationNotes

* Jude continues with a series of metaphors
* **These are the ones** - "These" refers to the ungodly men.
* **who are hidden reefs** - Like under water rocks that can sink ships, these people are a danger to the believers. Alternate Translation: "who are like dangerous rocks hidden under the water." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **in your love-feasts, when they feast with you** - feasts, when they feast with you** - "in your fellowship meals, when they eat with you".
* **clouds without water** - Like clouds that do not provide water to the gardens, these people do not care for the believers. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **autumn trees without fruit** - As some trees do not produce fruit at the end of summer, so these ungodly people do not have faith and works of righteousness. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **without fruit, twice dead** - Like trees that have been killed twice such as by frost would not give fruit, so the ungodly men have no values and contain no life within them.(See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **torn up by the roots** - Like trees that have been completely pulled out of the ground by their roots, the ungodly people have been separated from God who is the source of life. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **wild waves of the sea** - As the sea's waves are blown by a strong wind, so the ungodly people had no foundation of faith and were easily moved in many directions.(See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **foaming out of their own shame** - As wind causes wild waves to stir up dirty foam, so these men through their false teaching and actions shame themselves. Alternate translation: "just like waves bring up foam and dirt, these men pollute others with their shame." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **wandering stars for whom the blackness of darkness has been reserved forever** - Just like stars that move move across the sky making it difficult to follow them, so you should not follow these people. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
