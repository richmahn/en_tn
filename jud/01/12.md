Jude continues with a series of metaphors

## These are the ones ##

"These" refers to the ungodly men.

## who are hidden reefs ##

Like under water rocks that can sink ships, these people are a danger to the believers. Alternate Translation: "who are like dangerous rocks hidden under the water." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## in your love-feasts, when they feast with you ##

"in your fellowship meals, when they eat with you".

## clouds without water ##

Like clouds that do not provide water to the gardens, these people do not care for the believers. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## autumn trees without fruit ##

As some trees do not produce fruit at the end of summer, so these ungodly people do not have faith and works of righteousness. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## without fruit, twice dead ##

Like trees that have been killed twice such as by frost would not give fruit, so the ungodly men have no values and contain no life within them.(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## torn up by the roots ##

Like trees that have been completely pulled out of the ground by their roots, the ungodly people have been separated from God who is the source of life. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## wild waves of the sea ##

As the sea's waves are blown by a strong wind, so the ungodly people had no foundation of faith and were easily moved in many directions.(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## foaming out of their own shame ##

As wind causes wild waves to stir up dirty foam, so these men through their false teaching and actions shame themselves. Alternate translation: "just like waves bring up foam and dirt, these men pollute others with their shame." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## wandering stars for whom the blackness of darkness has been reserved forever ##

Just like some stars that move unpredictably making them unreliable for navigation, so you should not follow these people. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
