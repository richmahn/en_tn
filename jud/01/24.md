## to keep you from stumbling ##

Just as one can trip over a stone when walking, so one can stumble by sinning before God. Alternate translation: "to help to continue trusting him." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## and to place you before the presence of his glory ##

His glory is brilliant light that represents his greatness. Alternate translation: "and to allow you to enjoy and worship his glory."

## without blemish in exceeding joy ##

"without sin and in great joy." or "and you will not have any sin and you will be full of joy"

## to the only God our Savior, through Jesus Christ our Lord, ##

"to the only God, who saved us because of what  Jesus Christ did."

## be glory, majesty, dominion and power, before all time, and now, and for evermore. Amen ##

God always had, has, and will have glory, absolute leadership and complete control of all things.
