## some people who are in doubt ##

"some people who do not yet believe that God is God"

## snatching them out of the fire ##

"so that they will not go into the lake of fire"

## and on some have mercy with fear ##

"and be kind to others but be afraid of sinning like them."

## as you hate even the garment spotted by the flesh ##

"hate even their clothes, because they are made unclean by sin." They are so full of sin that their clothes are even considered unclean.
