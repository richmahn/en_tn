# to the only God our Savior through Jesus Christ our Lord

"to the only God, who saved us because of what Jesus Christ did." This emphasizes that God the Father as well as the Son is the Savior.

# be glory, majesty, dominion, and power, before all time, now, and forevermore

God has always had, now has, and always will have glory, absolute leadership, and complete control of all things.
