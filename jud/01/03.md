# Connecting Statement:

Jude tells the believers his reason for writing this letter.

# General Information:

The word "our" in this letter includes both Jude and believers. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-inclusive]])

# our common salvation

"the salvation we share"

# I had to write

"I felt a great need to write" or "I felt an urgent need to write"

# to exhort you to struggle earnestly for the faith

"to encourage you to defend the true teaching"

# once for all

"finally and completely"

# believers

"saints." Some versions translate this as "holy ones." It gives the idea of Christian believers with no special emphasis on their moral qualities, but rather believers who are made saints by belief in Jesus' death for salvation.

# For certain men have slipped in secretly among you

"For some men have come in among the believers without drawing attention to themselves"

# men who were marked out for condemnation

This can also be put into the active voice. AT: "men whom God chose to condemn" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# who pervert the grace of our God into sensuality

God's grace is spoken of as if it were a thing that could be changed into something horrible. AT: "who change the grace of our God into filthy lust" or "who teach that God's grace permits one to continue to live in sexual sin" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# deny our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ

Possible meanings are 1) they teach that he is not God or 2) these men do not obey Jesus Christ.
