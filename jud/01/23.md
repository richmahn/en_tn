# snatching them out of the fire

The picture is that of pulling people from a fire before they start to burn. AT: "doing for them whatever needs to be done to keep them from dying without Christ. This is like pulling them from the fire" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# To others be merciful with fear

"Be kind to others, but be afraid of sinning the way they did"

# Hate even the garment stained by the flesh

Jude exaggerates to warn his readers that they can become like those sinners. AT: "Treat them as though you could become guilty of sin just by touching their clothes" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
