# General Information:

These verses begin a new section in the book. Here Yahweh is speaking to the people of Israel.

# Your words against me have been strong

Here "strong" stands for "harsh" or "terrible." And "Your words" stands for "What you have said." AT: "What you have said about me is terrible" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# What have we said among ourselves against you?

The people ask this question in order to claim that they have said nothing against God. This can be expressed as a statement. AT: "We have not said anything among ourselves against you." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
