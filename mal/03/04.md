# General Information:

Malachi continues speaking in verse 4, but Yahweh begins speaking again in verse 5.

# the offering of Judah and Jerusalem

Here "Judah" and "Jerusalem" stand for the people in those places. AT: "the offerings brought by the people of Judah and Jerusalem" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# as in the days of old, and as in ancient years

These two phrases mean basically the same thing and emphasize that the offering was once pleasing to Yahweh. AT: "as it was in the distant past" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# Then I will approach you for judgment

Here "judgment" refers to the act of judging. AT: "Then I will approach you in order to judge you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# oppress the hired worker in his wages

"cause the hired worker to suffer by not paying him for his work"

# turn away the foreigner

That is, turning away the foreigner from gaining his rights. Depriving people of their rights is spoken of as if it were physically turning them away from oneself. Perhaps the idea is turning away someone who comes for a wrong to be set right. AT: "deny foreigners living in Israel the rights that they should have" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
