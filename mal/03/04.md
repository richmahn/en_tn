# General Information:

Malachi continues speaking in verse 4, but Yahweh begins speaking again in verse 5.

# the offering of Judah and Jerusalem

Here "Judah" and "Jerusalem" stand for the people in those places. AT: "the offerings brought by the people of Judah and Jerusalem" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# as in the days of old, and as in ancient years

These two phrases mean basically the same thing and emphasize that the offering was once pleasing to Yahweh. AT: "as it was in the distant past" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
