# General Information:

Yahweh continues to speak to the people of Israel.

# Would a person rob God?

This question implies that the idea of robbing God is very wicked. This can be expressed as a statement. God speaks of himself in the third person AT: "A man should certainly not rob God." or "No one should ever rob me." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# How have we robbed you?

This question implies that the people do not think they have robbed God. AT: "We have certainly not robbed you." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# In tithes and offerings

This reply from Yahweh implies a fuller answer. AT: "You have robbed me by withholding from me your tithes and offerings" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
