# Then I will approach you for judgment

Here "judgment" refers to the act of judging. Alternate translation: "Then I will approach you in order to judge you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# oppress the hired worker in his wages

"cause the hired worker to suffer by not paying him for his work"

# turn away the foreigner

That is, turning away the foreigner from gaining his rights. Depriving people of their rights is spoken of as if it were physically turning them away from oneself. Perhaps the idea is turning away someone who comes for a wrong to be set right. Alternate translation: "deny foreigners living in Israel the rights that they should have" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
