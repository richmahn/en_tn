# But who will be able to endure the day of his coming? Who will be able to stand when he appears?

These rhetorical questions imply that no one will be able to resist Yahweh when he comes. They can be combined into one statement. AT: "However, no one will be able to resist Yahweh when he comes to judge them." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# the day of his coming

Here "day" stands for "time." AT: "the time when he comes"

# be able to stand

Here standing represents resisting someone's attack or accusations. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# For he will be like a refiner's fire and like laundry soap

This sentence gives the reason why no one will be able to resist God when he comes. God's power to judge the people and to stop them from sinning is spoken of as if it were the power of strong soap to clean clothes, or the power of fire to melt an object. These are ways of saying that God's power to do these things cannot be stopped. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
