## translationNotes

* Yahweh is speaking to the people of Israel.
* **See** - AT: “Look” or “Listen” or “Pay attention to what I am about to tell you.”
* **But who can endure the day of his coming? And who will stand when he appears?** - AT: "Absolutely no one is going to be able to resist or stand against Yahweh.
* **For he is like a refiner’s fire, and like laundry soap.** - God is comparing his ability to judge the people and to cleanse them from sin to the power of a strong soap to clean clothes or the power of fire to melt an object. It's another way of saying that God's power to do this is unstoppable. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
* **and he will purify the sons of Levi** - "and he will correct and cleanse the sons of Levi from sin"
* **He will refine them like gold and silver** - God will remove sin from the Levites to make them more pure. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]]).
* **and they will bring offerings of righteousness to Yahweh** - "and they will bring acceptable offerings of worship to Yahweh."
