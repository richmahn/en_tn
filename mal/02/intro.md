# Malachi 02 General Notes #

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Levites #####
The priests are given a strong warning in this chapter. They have not followed the law of Moses and have led the people in the wrong direction. Yahweh has not accepted their sacrifices. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/priest]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]])

##### Marital unfaithfulness #####
Because the Jews lived under a covenantal arrangement with Yahweh, their relationship is described using the imagery of a marriage. Marital unfaithfulness indicates a person's unfaithfulness to Yahweh. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/covenant]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faithful]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
