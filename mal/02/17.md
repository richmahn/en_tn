# You have wearied Yahweh

Yahweh is spoken of as if human behavior could make him tired, but God cannot grow weary in a physical or emotional sense. This statement probably means that Yahweh has become offended or exasperated. AT: "You have offended Yahweh" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# How have we wearied him?

This question is meant to deny that the people have done any wrong. This can be expressed as a statement. AT: "We have certainly not wearied him." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# By saying

The complete idea here is, "You have wearied him by saying." This is the prophet's answer to the rhetorical question. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# in the eyes

The eyes represent seeing, and seeing represents thoughts or judgment. AT: "in the opinion" or "in the judgment" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Where is the God of justice?

The priests ask this question in order to claim either that Yahweh does not care whether people do evil or not, or that he never punishes evildoers. AT: "God certainly does not punish evil people!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# the God of justice

the God who punishes evildoers justly
