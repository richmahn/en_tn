# Why does he not?

The full thought is "Why does he not turn toward the offering or accept it with favor from our hand?" (See: [Malachi 2:13](../02/13.md)) Some translators may decide to provide this entire thought in their versions. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# the wife of your youth

"the woman you married when you were young"

# Yahweh was a witness between you and the wife of your youth

This statement assumes that this woman is still living. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])

# a witness between you and the wife of your youth

Here a witness to an agreement between two people is thought of as standing between them in order to testify about what they agreed to, in case a dispute arises between the two people. This sentence also was meant to remind the people that Yahweh would punish any Israelite who broke the covenant of marriage. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])

# she was your companion and your wife by covenant

This statement implies that many of the Israelites had divorced their wives. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])

# by covenant

"by the covenant of marriage that you agreed to"
