# General Information:

Yahweh speaks of the tribe of Levi as though they are Levi. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# My covenant with him was life and peace

Here the intended results of the covenant are spoken of as if they were the covenant itself. AT: "The purpose of my covenant with Levi was for the priests to live in prosperity and peace" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# fear, and he feared me

This expression continues the same metaphor, but leaves out an idea that is implied in the text. This can begin a new sentence. AT: "My covenant with him was also fear, and he feared me" or "In my covenant with him, I required him to fear me, and he did fear me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# in awe of my name

Here "my name" stands for God himself. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
