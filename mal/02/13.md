# General Information:

Malachi continues to speak to his fellow Israelites.

# You cover the altar of Yahweh with tears

This sarcastically exaggerates the amount of tears the people cry to show that Yahweh knows that the people do not really feel sad. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])

# with weeping and sighing

The words "weeping" and "sighing" share similar meanings and intensify the idea of weeping. AT: "with great weeping" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# does not turn toward the offering

Here turning toward a gift stands for receiving it and showing favor to the giver. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# does not turn toward the offering

This implies that those who are weeping at Yahweh's altar have offered sacrifices to him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# from your hand

Here "hand" stands for the person giving the offering. AT: "from you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
