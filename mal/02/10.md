# General Information:

Here the prophet Malachi begins to speak to his fellow Israelites.

# Is there not one father for us all? Has not one God created us?

Malachi asks these questions in order to remind his fellow Israelites about what they already know. Alternate translation: "You know that we all have one father, that our God has created a nation out of us." or "You all know that God is the father of all us Israelites, because he is the one who made our nation." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Has not one God created us?

This question is meant to express a statement. Alternate translation: "Certainly it is the same God who has created us." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# created us

This probably refers to God forming the Hebrews into a nation.

# Why are we faithless each man against his brother, profaning the covenant of our fathers?

Malachi asks this question in order to rebuke his fellow Israelites. This question may be expressed as a statement. Alternate translation: "We should certainly not mistreat our brothers and disrespect God's covenant by disobeying his commands, as you have been doing." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
