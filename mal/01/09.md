# Now you keep asking the face of God, that he may be gracious to us

Malachi is no longer speaking for God. He is talking directly to the Israelites; he is criticizing them for daring to think that God will have mercy on them.

# keep asking the face of God

Here "face" stands for God and also for his presence. AT: "keep asking God in his presence" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# with such an offering in your hand, would he lift up any of your faces?

Here Yahweh is asking a question in order to make a statement of rebuke. AT: "if you offer unacceptable offerings, he will certainly not lift up your faces." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# with such an offering in your hand

This difficult phrase in Hebrew is interpreted in many different ways by modern versions.

# in your hand

Here "hand" stands for the people bringing the offering. AT: "brought by you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# would he lift up any of your faces

Lifting up someone's face refers to accepting him with favor. AT: "would he accept any of you with favor" or "would he agree to help any of you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
