# General Information:

Yahweh rebukes the priests using an imaginary conversation in which the priests protest that they are doing right and Yahweh tells them what they are doing wrong.

# despise my name

Here "my name" stands for Yahweh himself. Alternate translation: "treat me as though you hate me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# How have we despised your name?

Here the priests are asking a question in order to state that they have not really despised Yahweh. This can be expressed as a statement. Alternate translation: "We have not really despised your name." or "Tell us how we have despised your name, because we do not think that we have done so." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
