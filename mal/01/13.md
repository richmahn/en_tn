* **disdainfully snort** - show great disrespect by making noises through the nose (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])

* **Cursed be the deceiver, who has a male animal in his flock and vows to give it to me** - "I will cause bad things to happen to anyone who lies to me who has a physically perfect male animal in his herd and promises to give it to me as an offering"
* **and yet sacrifices to me, the Lord, what is flawed** - "and then sacrifices to me, the Lord, an animal that is not physically perfect"
