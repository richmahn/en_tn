# General Information:

In this verse the pronouns "his" and "him" refer to the godless person, who represents godless people in general. It may be helpful to readers to use the plural pronouns "they" and "their." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])

# if this person is destroyed out of his place

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "if someone pulls him out of his place" or "if a gardener tears him out of the garden" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# his place

"the rocky ground" or "the garden"

# that place will deny him and say, 'I never saw you.'

The garden is spoken of as if it had human ability to speak. The garden immediately forgets that he existed. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
