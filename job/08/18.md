# if this person is destroyed out of his place

This can be stated in active form. AT: "if someone pulls him out of his place" or "if a gardener tears him out of the garden" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# his place

"the rocky ground" or "the garden"

# that place will deny him and say, 'I never saw you.'

The garden is spoken of as if it had human ability to speak. The garden immediately forgets that he existed. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
