# General Information:

It is unclear if verses 11-14 are the teaching of Bildad, or if Bildad is quoting the sayings of the ancestors of [Job 8:8-10](./08.md). In verses 14-18, the pronouns "he" and "his" refer to the godless person who represents godless people in general. It may be helpful to readers to use the plural pronouns "they" and "their." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])

# So also are the paths of all who forget God

Here "the paths" represents a person's future and the events that will happen to them. Alternate translation: "The same thing will happen to everyone who forgets God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# the hope of the godless will perish

"the things the godless person desires will not happen"
