# Does God pervert justice? Does the Almighty pervert righteousness?

Here "God" and "the Almighty" both refer to Yahweh. These questions can be translated as statements. Alternate translation: "God does not pervert justice; the Almighty does not pervert righteousness." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# pervert justice? ... pervert righteousness?

"approve of and do what is not just? ... approve of and do what is not righteous?"
