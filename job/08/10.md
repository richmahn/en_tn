# Will they not teach you and tell you? Will they not speak words from their hearts?

Bildad uses these rhetorical questions to rebuke Job for not agreeing with Bildad and the ancestors. They can be translated as statements. Alternate translation: "They will teach you and tell you and speak what they sincerely believe." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# from their hearts

Here the word "hearts" represents their inner beliefs. Alternate translation: "that they sincerely believe" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
