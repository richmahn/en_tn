# General Information:

It is unclear if this verse is the teaching of Bildad, or if Bildad is quoting the sayings of the ancestors of [Job 8:8-10](./08.md). In this verse the pronoun "his" refers to the godless person, who represents godless people in general. It may be helpful to readers to use the plural pronouns "they" and "their." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])

# His confidence will break apart ... his trust is as weak as a spider's web

These two phrases mean the same thing and emphasize that the godless person is trusting in something that cannot save him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# his trust is as weak as a spider's web

Here Bildad compares the trust of the godless person to a spider's web; the slightest force will break both. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
