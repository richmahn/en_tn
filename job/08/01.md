## Then Bildad the Shuhite answered ##

"Bildad" is the name of a man who is a member of the tribe of Shuah.  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

## How long will the words of your mouth be a mighty wind? ##

Bildad poses this question to rebuke Job for complaining to God.  In this metaphor, both Job's words and the wind are empty and insubstantial.  AT: "The words of your mouth are a mighty wind." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## Does God pervert justice? Does the Almighty pervert righteousness? ##

Here the writer uses two parallel rhetorical questions, which Bildad poses to rebuke Job.  AT: "God does not act unjustly; the Almighty does not fail to do what is right." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
