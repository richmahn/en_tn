# How long will the words of your mouth be a mighty wind?

Bildad speaks of Job's words as if they are as empty and insubstantial as the wind. This can be translated as a statement. AT: "The words of your mouth are as insignificant as a mighty wind." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Does God pervert justice? Does the Almighty pervert righteousness?

Here "God" and "the Almighty" both refer to Yahweh. These questions can be translated as statements. AT: "God does not act unjustly; the Almighty does not fail to do what is right." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
