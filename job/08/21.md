# He will yet fill your mouth with laughter, your lips with shouting

These two phrases mean the same thing and emphasize how happy Job would be if he were innocent. The word "he" refers to God and "your" refers to Job. Alternate translation: "God will make you very happy again if you are innocent" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# fill your mouth with laughter

God causing Job to laugh is spoken of as if God had poured laughter into Job's mouth. Alternate translation: "cause you to continually laugh" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# your lips with shouting

The verb "fill" is understood from the previous clause. God causing him to shout for joy is spoken of as if God had poured joy into Job's mouth. Alternate translation: "God will cause you to shout for joy" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
