# this is the "joy" of such a person's behavior

Bildad is speaking with irony to express that there is not any real joy for the godless person. AT: "this is all the joy they will receive from their godless actions" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])

# other plants will sprout out of the same soil in his place

Bildad continues the metaphor from [Job 08:16-18](./16.md). Other godless people are spoken of as plants who take the place of the first godless man when he dies. AT: "when one wicked man dies, another will take his place" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# sprout

"grow"

# the same soil

"the rocky ground" or "the garden"

# in his place

"in the place of the godless man"

# God will not cast away an innocent man

This can be stated in positive form. AT: "God will accept an innocent man"

# neither will he take the hand of evildoers

Here "take the hand" refers to help or support. AT: "God will not support people who do evil things" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
