## 'joy' ##

the reward, the result of a person's evil behavior that Bildad scornfully voices as 'joy.' (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])

## behavior ##

"actions" or "way of life"

## other plants will sprout up from the same soil in his place ##

Here the writer continues the metaphor from [Job 8:16](./16.md). Godless people are compared to plants that take the place of the first ones that grow among rocks. AT: "When one wicked man dies, another will take his place" or "From the soil, another will grow." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## sprout up ##

"grow"

## same soil ##

"the rocky ground"

## in his place ##

"in the place of the godless man"

## neither will he take the hand of evildoers ##

"Hand" represents the whole person. "he will not support evildoers" or "he will not strengthen evildoers" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
