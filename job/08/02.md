# How long will the words of your mouth be a mighty wind?

Bildad speaks of Job's words as if they are as empty and insubstantial as the wind. This can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: "The words of your mouth are as insignificant as a mighty wind." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
