# General Information:

Bildad continues to use parallelism in each of these verses to emphasize that their ancestors agree with the things Bildad is telling Job. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# give your attention to what our ancestors learned

"study carefully what our ancestors discovered" or "consider the things our forefathers learned"

# our days on earth are a shadow

The shortness of life is spoken of as if it were a shadow which quickly disappears. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Will they not teach you and tell you? Will they not speak words from their hearts?

Bildad uses these rhetorical questions to rebuke Job for not agreeing with Bildad and the ancestors. They can be translated as statements. AT: "They will teach you and tell you and speak what they sincerely believe." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# from their hearts

Here the word "hearts" represents their inner beliefs. AT: "that they sincerely believe" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
