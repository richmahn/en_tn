# General Information:

Bildad says that God would treat Job well if he was pure, but Bildad does not believe that Job is pure. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])

# If you are pure and upright

"If only you were pure and righteous" or "If only you would obey God and do what is right"

# stir himself on your behalf

Here Yahweh is spoken of as if he woke from sleep to help Job. Alternate translation: "help you" or "do good things for you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# restore you to your rightful place

This refers to giving back to Job the things he lost, including his family, wealth, and honor.
