# But suppose you diligently sought God and presented your request to the Almighty

Bildad is saying what would have happened if Job had correctly spoken to God, but Bildad does not believe that Job really did this. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])

# diligently sought God ... presented your request to the Almighty

These two phrases both refer to Job asking God for help or pleading with God for mercy. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# diligently sought God

"earnestly asked God for help"
