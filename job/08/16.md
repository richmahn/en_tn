# General Information:

Here pronouns "he" and "his" refer to the godless person who represents godless people in general. It may be helpful to readers to use the plural pronouns "they" and "their." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])

# Under the sun he is green, and his shoots go out over his entire garden

Here Bildad compares the godless person to a plant that is healthy. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Under the sun he is green

The meaning of the Hebrew text is unclear. Possible meanings are 1) he is healthy during the day or 2) he is watered before the sun rises.

# His roots are wrapped about the heaps of stone ... they look for good places among the rocks

These two phrases have similar meaning, but the meaning is unclear. Possible meanings are 1) he appears to be well-rooted in the rocks, taking advantage of every opening or 2) his roots cannot find fertile ground and must try to find nutrients among the rocks. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# if this person is destroyed out of his place

This can be stated in active form. AT: "if someone pulls him out of his place" or "if a gardener tears him out of the garden" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# his place

"the rocky ground" or "the garden"

# that place will deny him and say, 'I never saw you.'

The garden is spoken of as if it had human ability to speak. The garden immediately forgets that he existed. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
