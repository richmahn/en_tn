# General Information:

Here pronouns "he" and "his" refer to the godless person who represents godless people in general. It may be helpful to readers to use the plural pronouns "they" and "their." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])

# Under the sun he is green, and his shoots go out over his entire garden

Here Bildad compares the godless person to a plant that is healthy. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Under the sun he is green

The meaning of the Hebrew text is unclear. Possible meanings are 1) he is healthy during the day or 2) he is watered before the sun rises.
