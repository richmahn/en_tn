# While they are still green and not cut down, they wither before any other plant

It is implied that they wither when there is no water. This can be stated explicitly. Alternate translation: "Without water, they stop growing and wither faster than any other plant, even if no one cuts them down" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# wither

"dry up"
