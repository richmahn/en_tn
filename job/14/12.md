# As water disappears from a lake ... and do not rise again

The fact that death cannot be reversed is compared to water that dried up and cannot return. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# so people lie down

Lying down represents dying. Alternate translation: "so people die" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# do not rise again

Rising again represents living again. Alternate translation: "do not live again" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# they will not awake nor be roused out of their sleep

These two phrases mean the same thing and are used together to emphasize that death is final. Sleeping represents dying and awaking represents living again. Alternate translation: "people who die will not live again and be raised from death" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
