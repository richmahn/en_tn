# Do you look at any of these?

Job implies that he does not want God to pay so much attention to him. Alternate translation: "You do not look at any of these." or "You do not pay so much attention to these. Please do not pay so much attention to me." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# look at

Here looking at some one represents paying attention to him in order to judge him. Alternate translation: "pay attention to" or "look for faults in"

# Do you bring me into judgment with you?

Job uses this question to show his surprise that God judges him even though Job is so insignificant like the flowers. Alternate translation: "But you judge me." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
