## even mountains fall ... even rocks are moved ... the waters wear down ... its flooding washes away ... ##

These four lines talk about the same idea, namely that time will make everything that seems stable disappear. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## fall and come to nothing ##

These two verbs mean basically the same thing and are repeated to emphasize how surely mountains will disappear. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

## Like this, you destroy the hopes of man ##

This makes the whole chunk into a simily. If it is easier in your language, you can put this phrase at the beginning of verse 18 and adjust the text accordingly. AT: "You destroy the hopes of man, just like ..." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

## you destroy ##

The word "you" refers to God.

## the hopes of man ##

AT: "the things a man hopes for"
