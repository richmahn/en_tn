## translationNotes

* **even mountains fall ... even rocks are moved ... the waters wear down ... its flooding washes away ...** - These four lines talk about the same idea, namely that time will make everything that seems stable disappear. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
* **fall and come to nothing** - These two verbs mean basically the same thing and are repeated to emphasize how surely mountains will disappear. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
* **Like this, you destroy the hopes of man** - This makes the whole chunk into a simily. If it is easier in your language, you can put this phrase at the beginning of verse 18 and adjust the text accordingly. AT: "You destroy the hopes of man, just like ..." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
* **you destroy** - The word "you" refers to God.
* **the hopes of man** - AT: "the things a man hopes for"
