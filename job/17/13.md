Job continues to speak.

AT: "I think of sheol as my home" or "Sheol is like my home" or "I will soon be at home among other dead people"

## have spread my couch in the darkness ##

AT: "have made my bed in the darkness" or "have prepared myself to go and sleep among the dead" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## I have said to the pit... and to the worm ... ##

These two lines are a variation to each other and are used together to emphasize how desperate Job is. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## You are my mother or my sister ##
