# These people, these mockers

# change the night into day

This speaks of the people claiming that night is day as if they actually changed night into day. AT: "claim it is daytime when it is night" or "say the opposite of what is true, just as night is the opposite of day" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# light is near to darkness

It is implied that the mockers claim that it is light when it is close to dark. AT: "they claim that light is near to darkness" or "they claim that when it is becoming dark, that it is getting light" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
