# Job 17 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

The ULB sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is a poem. This chapter is a continuation of Job's response to Eliphaz, but it is more directly addressed to Yahweh.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Job's grief #####
Job expresses grief or great sadness in this chapter. He awaits the justice and intercession of Yahweh as he awaits his own death. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/curse]] and  [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/intercede]])

##### Advocate #####
Job describes the need for someone to intercede for him in heaven. This person would be his advocate and provide a witness for him. Although this is probably not intended as a prophecy, it closely parallels the way Jesus intercedes for people in heaven. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/heaven]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/testimony]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]])
