# General Information:

Job continues his thoughts about dying before he was born.

# Or I would have been lying ... that never see the light

This describes something that might have happened but did not happen. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])

# I would have been lying with princes

"I would be resting with princes." In this phrase, the words "lying" and "resting" are a polite way of saying "no longer alive." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])

# who once had gold, who had filled their houses with silver

Job uses parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
