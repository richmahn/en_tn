# May the day on which I was born perish, the night

Job speaks of that day and night as if they were people. Alternate translation: "I wish that I had never been born" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# the night that said, 'A boy has been conceived.'

This expression intensifies the statement of Job's grief by going even further back in time from his birth to his conception. Alternate translation: "the night that said, 'A boy has been conceived' perish." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# the night that said

Here the night is spoken of as if it were a person who could speak. The translator may choose, however, to translate it in a less metaphorical way. Alternate translation: "the night about which people said" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# A boy has been conceived

This may be put into active form. Alternate translation: "his mother has conceived a male child"
