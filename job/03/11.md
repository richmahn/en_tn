# General Information:

This passage contains four rhetorical questions, which Job asks in order to really make a series of statements.

# Why did I not die when I came out from the womb?

"Why did I not die at birth?" Job poses this question in order to curse the day of his birth and to express his anguish. AT: "I wish I had died the day I was born" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Why did I not give up my spirit when my mother bore me?

Job means to say that he should not have been born alive. AT: "I wish I had died when I came out of the womb." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# give up my spirit

This refers to dying. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# Why did her knees welcome me?

This perhaps refers to the lap of Job's mother. His mother's knees are spoken of as if they were people who could welcome a newborn baby. AT: "I wish there had been no lap to receive me." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# Why did her breasts receive me so that I should suck?

Job's mother's breasts are spoken of as if they also were people who could welcome a newborn baby. AT: "I wish there had been no breasts for me to nurse." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
