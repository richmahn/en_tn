# General Information:

Job changes his talk from dying to life after death.

# There the wicked cease from trouble; there the weary are at rest

Job uses parallelism to emphasize that the lowly will find rest from those causing them hardship. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# There the wicked cease from trouble

Job is talking about the place where people go after they stop living. Alternate translation: "In that place, evil people stop causing trouble" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
