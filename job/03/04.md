# General Information:

The expressions in these verses are all wishes that the day of Job's birth would no longer exist. This may imply that the day, although in the past, still existed somehow. The UST translates them as expressions of sadness about what that day was like.

# May that day be dark ... neither may the sun shine on it

These two clauses describe the darkness of the day of Job's birth, thus repeating Job's regret that he had been born. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# May that day be dark

This is a wish for that day to not exist any longer. Alternate translation: "may that day disappear" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
