# Connecting Statement:

Job begins talking about what would have been true if he had never been born. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
# For now I would have been lying down quietly. I would have slept and been at rest

Job uses two sentences to think about what it would be like if he had never been born or had died at birth. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])

# I would have been lying down quietly

Job imagines something that could have happened in the past but which did not happen, as noted above. Alternate translation: "I should have been lying down quietly" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])

# lying down quietly

"asleep, resting peacefully"

# been at rest

Here the word "rest" means to sleep peacefully, but also that Job would not be experiencing the pain that he does. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
