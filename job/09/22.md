# It makes no difference

"It is all the same" or "It does not matter"

# he destroys blameless people and wicked people together

Here "blameless" and "wicked" are two extremes for a merism that include everything in between. Alternate translation: "he brings everyone to an end, whether they are blameless or wicked" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
