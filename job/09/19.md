# If it is a matter of strength

"If there is a contest of strength"

# behold, he is mighty

"look and you will see that he is mighty" or "pay attention to what I am about to tell you: he is mighty"

# he is mighty

"he is the strong one"

# who can summon him?

This question expects an answer of "No one" to make the point that no one is able to bring God to court. This can be reworded as a statement. AT: "no one can summon him." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
