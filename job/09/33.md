# There is no judge between us

This means there is no judge who is greater than God who could decide what is right between him and Job.

# lay his hand upon us both

Here "lay his hand upon" means having power or authority over. Alternate translation: "take hold of both of us" or "have authority over both of us" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
