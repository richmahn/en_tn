# plunge me in a ditch

"throw me into a pit"

# my own clothes would be disgusted with me

Job's clothing is spoken of as if it would have a negative response to Job after God plunged him into a ditch. Alternate translation: "I would be too filthy for my own clothing" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
