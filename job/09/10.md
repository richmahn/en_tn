The writer continues to use parallelism in each of these verses, conveying a single idea using double statements to emphasize that God is mighty, unseen, and beyond grasp. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## It is the same God who does great things, incomprehensible things ##

"He does unsearchably great things" or "He does things so great that no one can search them"

## Indeed, marvelous things without number ##

"marvelous things that cannot be counted"

## he passes on also, but I do not perceive him ##

"God moves by, but I do not realize it."

## If he catches a victim ##

"If he tears someone away" or "If he snatches someone away"
