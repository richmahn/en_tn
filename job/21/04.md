# Connecting Statement:

Job continues speaking to his friends.

# As for me, is my complaint to a person? Why should I not be impatient?

Job uses questions to emphasize that he thinks it is fair for him to complain to God. Alternate translation: "I am not complaining to a person. I have the right to be impatient" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
