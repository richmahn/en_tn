# The clods of the valley will be sweet to him

Job imagines that the dead person will even enjoy the dirt that is put on him. This means the wicked person will even have a good death and a nice burial after a fulfilling life. "Clods" refer to the earth that covers the grave. AT: "He will enjoy being covered with the dirt of the valley" or "He will enjoy being buried in the dirt of the valley" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# all people will follow after him, as there were innumerable people before him

Job emphasizes that a large crowd of people will be in the funeral procession of this imaginary wicked man to honor him. AT: "a huge number of people go to the grave site; some go in front of the procession and some come behind" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
