# Connecting Statement:

Job continues speaking to his friends.

# Why do wicked people continue to live, become old, and grow mighty in power?

Job uses this question to show that his friends are wrong to think evil men always suffer. Alternate translation: "Wicked people indeed continue to live, become old, and become wealthier." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
