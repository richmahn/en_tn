Job continues speaking to his friends.

## Can anyone teach God knowledge since he judges even those who are high? ##

Job uses a question for emphasis. AT: "Obviously, no one can teach anything to God since he even judges those in heaven." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## One man dies in his full strength ##

Job is comparing this man who dies in complete health and peace to the man who dies in sorrow and pain. See how you will translate this in [Job 21:25](./25.md)

## His body is full of milk, and the marrow of his bones is moistened and in good health ##

Both of these mean that the person is very healthy. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
