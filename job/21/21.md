# Let him pay it himself ... cut off?

Job now begins to state his own opinion. It may be helpful to state this explicitly. Alternate translation: "But I say, 'Let him pay it himself ... cut off?'" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# For what does he care about his family after him when the number of his months is cut off?

Job uses this question to show that punishing the evil man's children is not effective. This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "For the wicked man does not care what happens to his family after he has died!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# the number of his months is cut off

This is a polite way of saying that he dies. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])

# the number of his months

This refers to the length of his life.
