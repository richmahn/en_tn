# Connecting Statement:

Job continues speaking to his friends.

# Have you never asked traveling people? Do you not know the evidence they can tell ... from the day of wrath?

Job uses these questions to rebuke his friends for not learning from people who travel. Alternate translation: "You should listen to those who have traveled to distant places. Even they will tell you ... from the day of wrath." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
