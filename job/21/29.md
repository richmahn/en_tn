# Connecting Statement:

Job continues speaking to his friends.

# Have you never asked traveling people?

Job uses these questions to rebuke his friends for not learning from people who travel. Alternate translation: "You should listen to those who have traveled to distant places." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
