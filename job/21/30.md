# Connecting Statement:

Job finishes asking a rhetorical question that begins with the words "Do you not know" in verse 29.

# the wicked man is kept ... from the day of wrath?

Job uses these questions to rebuke his friends for not learning from people who travel. "Those who have traveled to distant places will tell you ... from the day of wrath." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# the wicked man is kept from the day of calamity ... he is led away from the day of wrath

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "God keeps the wicked man from the day of calamity ... God leads him away from the day of wrath" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
