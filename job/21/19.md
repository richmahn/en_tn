Job continues speaking to his friends.

## God lays up one's guilt for his children to pay ##

AT: "God keeps a record of a person's sins, then he punishes the person's children for his wicked deeds"

## Let his eyes see ##

AT: "Let him see" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

## let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty ##

Job wants the wicked person to experience God's punishment. Job compares "drink" to "feel" or "experience." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## For what does he care about his family after him when the number of his months is cut off? ##

Job uses a question for emphasis. AT: "For the wicked man does not care about his family after he has died" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
