# Connecting Statement:

Job continues speaking to his friends.

# You say

These words are added by most versions in order to make it clear that the Job is quoting his friends in the next statement.

# God lays up one's guilt for his children to pay

Guilt is spoken of as something that can be stored for later use. Here "to pay" refers to punishment for sin. AT: "God keeps a record of a person's sins, then he punishes the person's children for his wicked deeds" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Let him pay it himself ... cut off?

Job now begins to state his own opinion. It may be helpful to state this explicitly. AT: "But I say, 'Let him pay it himself ... cut off?'" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
