# How often is it ... the storm carries away?

Job uses this third question to emphasize that it seems to him that God does not punish the wicked very often. Alternate translation: "It is not often ... the storm carries away." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# they become like stubble before the wind or like chaff that the storm carries away

The death of the wicked is spoken of as if they were worthless less chaff and stubble that blows away. This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "God takes them away like the wind blows away the chaff" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
