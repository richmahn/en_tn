Job continues speaking with his friends.

## Where now is the house of the prince? Where is the tent in which the wicked once lived? ##

Job believes his friends will ask these question in order to scold him. Both questions mean the same thing. AT: "See, the house of the evil ruler is gone. The tent of the wicked man has disappeared." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
