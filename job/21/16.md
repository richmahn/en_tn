# Connecting Statement:

Job continues speaking to his friends.

# See, is not their prosperity in their own hands?

Here "hands" refers to their power or control. Job uses this question to challenge his friends. Alternate translation: "Look, these wicked people claim that they make themselves prosper!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
