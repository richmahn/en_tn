## Who will condemn the wicked manâ€™s way to his face? Who will repay him for what he has done? ##

Job uses questions to teach his friends and cause them to think deeply about what he is saying. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## to his face ##

This means no one will go directly to the wicked person and condemn him personally. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

## Yet he will be borne ##

AT: "Yet people will carry him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## The clods of the valley will be sweet to him ##

Job imagines that the dead person will even enjoy the dirt that is put on him. This means the wicked person will even have a good death and a nice burial after a fulfilling life. "Clods" refer to the earth that covers the grave. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

## all people will follow after him as there were innumerable people before him ##

Job emphasizes his idea by including the many before and after this man who will have the same life and death as this imaginary wicked person. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
