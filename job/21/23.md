# One man dies in his full strength

Job contrasts this man who dies in health and peace to the man who dies in sorrow and pain in [Job 21:25](../21/25.md). You can make this explicit. Alternate translation: "If there are two men, one may die in his full strength" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
