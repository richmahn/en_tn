# Should anyone who wishes to criticize try to correct the Almighty?

Yahweh is rebuking Job. This can be translated as a statement. AT: "No one who wants to criticize me should try to argue with me, for I am Almighty God." or "You, a person, want to criticize me, Almighty God, but you should not try to correct me." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# He who argues with God, let him answer

Yahweh speaks of Job and himself as if they were two other people to remind Job that no person anywhere should argue with God. AT: "You want to argue with me, so answer me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pronouns]])
