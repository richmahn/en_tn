See how you translated this in [Job 40:19](./19.md)

## banks ##

sides of the river

## though a Jordan River should surge up to his snout ##

AT: " even if the flood comes up to his nose."

## Can anyone capture him with a hook, â€¦ a snare? ##

This is a rhetorical question to be answered in the negative. AT: "No one can capture him even with a hook or a snare." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
