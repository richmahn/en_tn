# While he was still speaking

"he" refers to the first messenger

# another also came

This refers to another messenger. Alternate translation: "another messenger also came" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# I alone have escaped to tell you

See how you translated this in [Job 1:15](../01/15.md).
