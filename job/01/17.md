# As for the servants, they have struck them with the edge of the sword. I alone have escaped to tell you

Here "edge" represents the part of swords that kill people, that is, either the point or the sharp edge. Also, all the swords of the Chaldeans are spoken of as if they were only one sword. See how you translated this in [Job 1:15](../01/15.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])
