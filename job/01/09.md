* **Does Job fear God for nothing?** - "Does Job respect God for no reason?" Satan responds to God by presenting and answering his own question that Job obeys God only because God blesses him. AT: "Job has a reason for obeying God." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **Have you not made a hedge around him, around his house, and around all that he has on every side?** - Satan states the facts to support his argument . AT: "You have protected him, his family and everything he owns." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **made a hedge around him** - Just as a hedge is a row of small bushes or trees planted close together to form a wall of protection around one's land, God has surrounding Job with his protection. AT: "protected him" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
