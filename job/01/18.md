# Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother's house

See how you translated this in [Job 01:13](./13.md).

# A strong wind

"A tornado" or "A desert storm"

# the four corners of the house

"the structural supports of the house"

# It fell on the young people

"The house fell on your sons and daughters"

# I alone have escaped to tell you

See how you translated this in [Job 01:15](./13.md).
