# Job 01 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

This chapter introduces a story about a man named Job who lives during a time long before the author.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Wealth #####
Job is very rich. During his time, a man's wealth is measured by the number of animals he owns. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

##### Feasts #####
Job is a very godly man and celebrates Yahweh's provision by having feasts. It must be remembered that Job lives prior to the law of Moses, so his religious practices are different than the Hebrew people after Moses. The events of this book occur about the same time as the life of Abraham. Therefore, this book corresponds more with Genesis 12-50 than the rest of the Old Testament. (See:[[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/godly]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]])

##### Job's faith #####
Satan believes that Job's faith is based on Yahweh's blessings. He challenges Yahweh to remove these blessings from Job's life because he thinks that Job will no longer trust in Yahweh if this happens. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/bless]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/trust]])
