# On each son's assigned day, he would give

The word "day" perhaps refers to the day when they celebrated the son's birth. But it at least refers to the idea that the sons each took a turn in holding a feast. AT: "On each son's birthday, the son would give" or "Each son in turn would give"

# he would give ... They would send and call for ... Job would send ... he would consecrate ... He would rise early in the morning and offer ... he would say

"he habitually gave ... They habitually sent and called for ... Job habitually sent ... he habitually consecrated ... He habitually rose early in the morning and offered ... he habitually said"

# with them

The word "them" refers to the seven sons and the three daughters but does not include Job.

# When the days of the feast were over

"When the feast was over" or "After the feast"

# Job would send for them

"Job habitually sent someone to call them to come to him"

# he would consecrate them

Here "consecrate" means to ask God to take away any ritual impurities that Job's children might have brought upon themselves as they happily feasted together. Job did this by making sacrifices to God for them.

# cursed God in their hearts

Their "hearts" represent their thoughts. Often such thoughts could come unintentionally, without the person wanting to think them. AT: "cursed God in their thoughts" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
