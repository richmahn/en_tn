# Have you not put a barrier around him, around his house, and around all that is his from every side

Satan states the facts to support his argument. Alternate translation: "You have protected him, his family and everything he owns" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# put a barrier around him, around his house, and around all that is his from every side

Just as a barrier such as a wall or a hedge surrounds and protects one's land, God has surrounded Job with his protection. Alternate translation: "protected him and his house and all that is his" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the deeds of his hands

"everything that he does"

# his cattle have burst forth in the land

"he has more and more livestock in the land"
