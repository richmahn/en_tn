# General Information:

Job continues describing situations in which he would deserve God's punishment, but he knows they are not true. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])

# If ... I have hidden my sins

Here "have hidden my sins" represents trying to keep people from knowing that he had sinned. AT: "If ... I have tried to keep my sins a secret" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# by hiding my guilt inside my tunic

This represents trying to keep people from knowing that he is guilty. AT: "by hiding the evidence of my guilt inside my tunic" or "like one who hides the evidence of his guilt inside his tunic" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# because I feared the great multitude, because the contempt of families terrified me

This would be the reason for hiding his sins. These mean the same thing. They emphasize that a person may hide his sin because he fears what other people may think about him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# then bring charges against me

This phrase is not in the original language or in other versions of the Bible. It was added here to help preserve the meaning of Job's statement in this long sentence.
