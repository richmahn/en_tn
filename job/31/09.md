Job continues describing situations in which he would deserve God's punishment, but he knows they are not true. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])

## If my heart has been attracted to another woman ##

AT: "If I have desired another man's wife" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## if I have lain in wait at my neighborâ€™s door for his wife ##

"and I have waited for him to leave his house so I could sleep with her"

## then let my wife grind grain for another man ##

Possible meanings are 1) this is a way of saying another man will have sex with Job's wife (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]]) or 2) it means she will become a slave and work for another man.

## and let other men crouch down on her ##

This refers to other men having sex with Job's wife. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
