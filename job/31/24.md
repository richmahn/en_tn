# General Information:

# If I have made gold my hope

The abstract noun "hope" can be translated with the verbs "trust" or "hope." Alternate translation: "If I trusted in gold" or "If I hoped that having a lot of gold would make me secure" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# if I have said to fine gold, 'You are what I am confident in'

This line means the same as the previous line. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
