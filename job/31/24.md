# General Information:

Job continues describing situations in which he would deserve God's punishment, but he knows they are not true. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])

# If I have made gold my hope

The abstract noun "hope" can be translated with the verbs "trust" or "hope." AT: "If I trusted in gold" or "If I hoped that having a lot of gold would make me secure" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# if I have said to fine gold, 'You are what I am confident in'

This line means the same as the previous line. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# my hand had gotten many possessions

Here "my hand" represents Job's ability to do things. AT: "I have gained many possessions by my own ability" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# then bring charges against me

This phrase is not in the original language or in other versions of the Bible. It was added here to help preserve the meaning of Job's statement in this long sentence.
