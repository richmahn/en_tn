# if I have lifted up my hand against fatherless people

Lifting up the hand against someone represents threatening to harm him. AT: "if I have threatened to harm fatherless people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# I saw my support in the city gate

Here "saw" is a metaphor for "knew," "support" is a metaphor for "approval," and "the city gate" is a metonym for the leaders who sit at the city gate. AT: "I knew that the leaders at the city gate would approve of me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# in the city gate

This is where the important men of the city would gather to make decisions.

# then bring charges against me
