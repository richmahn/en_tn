# General Information:

Job continues describing situations in which he would deserve God's punishment, but he knows they are not true. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])

# If my step has turned aside from the way

Here "my step" is a metaphor for Job's behavior, and "turned out of the right way" is a metaphor for changing from living right. Alternate translation: "If I have changed from living right" or "If I have stopped doing what is right" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# if my heart has gone after my eyes

Here "my heart" and "my eyes" are metonyms for what Job desires and sees. The heart going after the eyes is a metaphor for desiring to do what he sees. It is implied that this refers to sinful things that Job sees. Alternate translation: "if I have have wanted to do any sinful things that I see" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# if any spot has stuck to my hands

This is a metaphor for being guilty. Alternate translation: "if I am guilty of any sin at all" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
