Job uses these questions to emphasize that he is no different from his servants. He implies that God would be angry if Job were to treat his servants as less valuable than himself. AT: "The one who made me in the womb also made them. He formed us all in the womb." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
