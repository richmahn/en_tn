# General Information:

Job continues speaking.

# I have made a covenant with my eyes

Job speaks of making a promise about what he would look at as though his eyes were a person and he made a covenant with them. AT: "I have made a firm promise about what I will look at" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# I have made a covenant with my eyes

What job promised can be stated clearly. AT: "I made a promise that I will not look lustfully on a virgin" or "I promised that I will not look lustfully on a virgin" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# how then should I look with desire on a virgin?

Job uses this question to emphasize that he would never break his promise. AT: "So I certainly will not look with lust at a virgin." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
