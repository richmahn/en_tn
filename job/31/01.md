Job continue speaking.

## I have made a covenant with my eyes ##

AT: "I have promised myself that I would not look with lust at a woman" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

## how then should I look with desire on a virgin? ##

Job uses a question to emphasize that he would never break his promise. AT: "So I certainly will not look with lust at a virgin" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## For what is the portion from God above, the inheritance from the Almighty on high? ##

Both of these mean the same thing. Job uses a question to emphasize that God would not give him anything good if he sins and breaks his promise. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
