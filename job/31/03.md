Job continues speaking.

## Does not God see my ways and count all my steps? ##

Here "my ways" and "my steps" refer to Job's behavior. Job uses a question for emphasis. AT: "Certainly God watches me and knows everything that I do" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
