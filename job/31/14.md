# what then would I do when God rises up to accuse me? When he comes to judge me, how would I answer him?

Job uses these questions to emphasize that if God were to judge him, Job would not be able to make himself appear to be good. Alternate translation: "then there would be absolutely nothing I could say to defend myself when God comes to judge me." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
