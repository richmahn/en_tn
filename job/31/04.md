# Does not God see my ways and count all my steps?

Here "my ways" and "my steps" are metaphors for Job's behavior. Here "see my ways" and "count all my steps" are metaphors for knowing everything Job does. Job uses this question to emphasize that God does know all he does. Alternate translation: "Certainly God watches me and knows everything that I do." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Does not God see my ways and count all my steps?

Job may be implying that God should know that Job is righteous and does not deserve calamity and disaster. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
