# then let me sow, and let another eat, and let my crops be uprooted

Job is saying that if he really has sinned, then this bad thing should happen to him. He would do the hard work of sowing his fields, but he would not be able to eat any of it.

# let my crops be uprooted

This can be stated in active form. AT: "let someone else come and take the harvest from my field" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
