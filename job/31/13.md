## translationNotes

* Job continues describing situations in which he would deserve God's punishment, but he knows they are not true. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
* **what then would I do when God rises up to accuse me? When he comes to judge me, how would I answer him?** - Job uses a question for emphasis. AT: "then there would absolutely nothing I could say to defend myself when God comes to judge me" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **Did the one who made me in the womb not make them also? Did not the same one mold us all in the womb?** - AT: "God, who certainly made me in the same way he made them should judge me with the same sense of justice as he judges them." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
