# General Information:

Job continues describing situations in which he would deserve God's punishment, but he knows they are not true. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])

# at the destruction of anyone who hated me

The abstract noun "destruction" can be translated with the verb "destroy." AT: "when anyone who hated me was destroyed" or "when bad things happened to anyone who hated me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# when disaster overtook him

"when he experienced disasters"

# then bring charges against me

This phrase is not in the original language or in other versions of the Bible. It was added here to help preserve the meaning of Job's statement in this long sentence.
