# my hand had gotten many possessions

Here "my hand" represents Job's ability to do things. AT: "I have gained many possessions by my own ability" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# then bring charges against me

This phrase is not in the original language or in other versions of the Bible. It was added here to help preserve the meaning of Job's statement in this long sentence.
