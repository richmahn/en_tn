# Job 31 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

The ULB sets the lines of this chapter further to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is a poem. This chapter is a continuation of Job's statement and it is directly addressed to Yahweh. 

In this chapter, Job presents his case to Yahweh that he is upright and not guilty of the sins he is being accused of. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/upright]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/guilt]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])
