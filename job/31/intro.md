# Job 31 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers, or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of this chapter, which is an extended quotation. This chapter is a continuation of Job's statement and it is directly addressed to Yahweh. 

In this chapter, Job presents his case to Yahweh that he is upright and not guilty of the sins he is being accused of. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/upright]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/guilt]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])
