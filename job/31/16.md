# General Information:

Job continues describing situations in which he would deserve God's punishment, but he knows they are not true. He does not finish his sentence in verses 16 and 17. Instead he explains in verse 18 why they are not true. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])

# If I have withheld poor people from their desire

"If I have kept poor people from getting what they desire"

# if I have caused the eyes of the widow to grow dim from crying

Here "to grow dim" refers to the widow having bad eyesight from crying a lot. Alternate translation: "if I have caused a widow to cry in great sadness" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
