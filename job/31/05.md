# General Information:

Job continues speaking.

# If I have

In 31:5-40 Job describes different situations in which he would deserve God's punishment. But, he knows that they are not true and he is innocent. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])

# walked with falsehood, if my foot has hurried to deceit

Here "walked" and "hurried" are metaphors that represent how Job lived. AT: "done anything false or purposely deceived anyone" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
