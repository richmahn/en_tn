Job continues to speak to his three friends.

## If indeed you will boast against me ##

"Since indeed you act as though you are better than me"

## am disgraced ##

AT: "have done something disgraceful." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## has caught me in his net ##

Job compares God with a hunter that has violently caught an innocent animal in his net. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
