# use my humiliation against me

How his friends would do this can be stated clearly. AT: "claim that my humiliation is proof against me" or "use my humiliation as evidence that I am guilty" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# use my humiliation against me

The abstract noun "humiliation" can be expressed with the verb "humiliate." AT: "claim that what has happened to humiliate me proves that I am guilty" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# has caught me in his net

Job speaks as if God were a hunter that has trapped Job in his net. This metaphor represents God taking control of Job and Job's feeling of helplessness. AT: "has trapped me" or "has taken control of me" or "has control of what happens to me, so that I am helpless" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
