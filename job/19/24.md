# Oh, that with an iron pen and lead they were engraved in the rock forever

This exclamation tells what Job wishes for. It can be stated in active form. AT: "I wish that someone would use an iron pen and lead to carve them in the rock forever" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# an iron pen

"an iron chisel." This was a tool used for writing. It was made of iron so that people could carve words in rock.

# lead

Lead is a soft metal. We do not know how people used lead when carving rock. They may have filled the letters of the inscription with lead in order to make the inscription last longer.
