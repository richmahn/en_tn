# have erred

"have sinned by accident" or "mistakenly sinned"

# my error remains my own concern

Job implies that his friends are not responsible for continuing to rebuke him since he is the one who made the error. Alternate translation: "my error is my own responsibility, so you should not continue to rebuke me" or "my error did not hurt you, so you should not continue to rebuke me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# my error

"my sin" or "my mistake"
