# has caught me in his net

Job speaks as if God were a hunter that has trapped Job in his net. This metaphor represents God taking control of Job and Job's feeling of helplessness. Alternate translation: "has trapped me" or "has taken control of me" or "has control of what happens to me, so that I am helpless" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
