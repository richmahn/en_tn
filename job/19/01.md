## Then Job answered and said ##

See how you translated this in [Job 6:1](../06/01.md).

## How long will you make me suffer and break me into pieces with words ##

AT: "Stop making me suffer and breaking me into pieces with words." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## will you make me suffer ##

The word "you" refers to the three friends of Job, Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar.

## break me into pieces with words ##

Job uses this image to say that his words make him feel very sad and hopeless. AT: "and torment me with your words." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
