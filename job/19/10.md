## translationNotes

* Job continues to speak to his three friends.
* **he has broken me down on every side** - Job compares himself to a building that God is smashing. AT: "God destroys me like someone destroys a building."  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **and I am gone** - "and I am completely destroyed"
* **he has plucked up my hopes like a tree** - Job compares his hopes to a tree that someone pulls out of the ground. AT: "What I wanted most, God has pulled up like a tree." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
* **He has also kindled his wrath against me** - Job compares the anger of God to a fire. AT: "God has also lit a fire of anger against me."  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **he regards me as one of his adversaries** - "God treats me like one of his enemies"
* **His troops come on together** - Job compares the way that God is attacking him to the way that an army attacks a city. AT: "God sends his army to attack me."   (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **they cast up siege mounds against me** - The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain. It may describe the way an army piles up dirt against a city wall in order to climb over the wall and attack the city. AT: "the soldiers pile up dirt in order to climb over my city wall."   (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
