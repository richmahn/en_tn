# General Information:

Job continues to speak to his three friends.

# He has broken me down on every side

Job speaks of God ruining him as if Job were building that God is smashing down. Alternate translation: "He has ruined me in every way" or "He has attacked me in every way" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# I am gone

The metaphor "being gone" represents being completely destroyed. Alternate translation: "I am completely destroyed" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# he has pulled up my hope like a tree

Job speaks of God causing Job not to have hope as if Job's hope were a tree that God has pulled with its roots out of the ground. Alternate translation: "he has completely taken away all my hope" or "because of what he has done, I can no longer hope for anything good" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# like a tree

This simile is also an ellipsis. You may need to supply the omitted words. Alternate translation: "the way a man pulls a tree up by its roots" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
