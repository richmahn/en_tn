Job continues to speak to his three friends.

## he has broken me down on every side ##

Job compares himself to a building that God is smashing. AT: "God destroys me like someone destroys a building."  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## and I am gone ##

"and I am completely destroyed"

## he has plucked up my hopes like a tree ##

Job compares his hopes to a tree that someone pulls out of the ground. AT: "What I wanted most, God has pulled up like a tree." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

## He has also kindled his wrath against me ##

Job compares the anger of God to a fire. AT: "God has also lit a fire of anger against me."  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## he regards me as one of his adversaries ##

"God treats me like one of his enemies"

## His troops come on together ##

Job compares the way that God is attacking him to the way that an army attacks a city. AT: "God sends his army to attack me."   (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## they cast up siege mounds against me ##

The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain. It may describe the way an army piles up dirt against a city wall in order to climb over the wall and attack the city. AT: "the soldiers pile up dirt in order to climb over my city wall."   (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## and encamp around my tent ##

AT: "they camp around my house and prepare the attack."  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
