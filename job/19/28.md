Job continues to speak to his three friends.

## How we will persecute him ##

This is also a question requesting ways to make Job suffer. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]]) AT: "How can we make him suffer as much as possible"

## because the root of the matter is found in him ##

AT: "and if you say that I am the cause of my own suffering." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

## then be afraid of the sword ##

The sword represents God's anger and judgement. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## because wrath brings the punishment ##

The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain. Possible meanings are 1) the things that Job's friends have been saying bring punishment or 2) God's anger brings punishment.

## there is a judgment ##

"God punishes sinners"
