# General Information:

Job continues to speak to his three friends.

# My bones cling to my skin and to my flesh

"I am just skin and bones" or "My skin sticks to my bones." Job speaks of his bones, skin, and flesh to describe his appearance. He was extremely thin, and people could easily see the shape of his bones. Some languages have idioms for this.

# I survive only by the skin of my teeth

This idiom means that he is barely surviving, that he almost does not survive. Alternate translation: "I am barely alive" or "I hardly survive" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
