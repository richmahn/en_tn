* **an iron pen** - "an iron chisel." This was a tool made out of hard iron that people used to carve rocks.
* **and lead** - Lead is a soft metal. We do not know how people used lead when carving rock. They might have filled the letters of the inscription with lead in order to make the inscription last longer.
