# He has walled up ... darkness in my path

Job uses these images to describe how God has made him feel helpless and hopeless. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# He has walled up my way so that I cannot pass

"God has put a wall on the road that I am walking on" or "He has blocked the way so I cannot keep going"
