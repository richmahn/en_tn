# General Information:

Job continues to speak to his three friends.

# My breath is offensive to my wife

Here "breath" represents the smell of his breath. If something is offensive to someone, it means that he hates it. Alternate translation: "My wife hates the smell of my breath" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# those who were born from my mother's womb

Job refers to his brothers and sisters this way to imply that they are people who should love him. The full meaning of this can be made clear. Alternate translation: "my own brothers who should love me" or "my brothers and sisters who should love me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
