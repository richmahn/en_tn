# Job 19 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers, or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of this chapter, which is an extended quotation. This chapter is Job's response to Bildad.

Verses 25-27 are very important to this book. They show the great depth of Job's faith in Yahweh after his most difficult time. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]])
