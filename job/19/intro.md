# Job 19 General Notes

#### Structure and formatting

The ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is a poem. This chapter is Job's response to Bildad.

Verses 25-27 are very important to this book. They show the great depth of Job's faith in Yahweh after his most difficult time. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]])
