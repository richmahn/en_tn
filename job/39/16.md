# Connecting Statement:

Yahweh continues to challenge Job.

# She deals roughly

The word "She" refers to the female ostrich.

# her labor

the work that she does when she lays the eggs

# might have been in vain

If the chicks die, all of her work was useless. Alternate translation: "might have been useless if the chicks die" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
