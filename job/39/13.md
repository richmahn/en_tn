# Connecting Statement:

Yahweh continues to challenge Job.

# The wings of the ostrich ... pinions and plumage of love?

Yahweh uses this question to emphasize that Job cannot explain why ostriches behave the way they do. AT: "You do not know whether the pinions and plumage of the ostrich represent love when they wave their wings proudly." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# ostrich

a very large bird that can run very fast but cannot fly

# wave proudly

"move with joy"

# pinions

the very long feathers on the wings of birds

# plumage

the smaller feathers that cover the body of a bird

# of love

The Hebrew word is uncertain. Possible meanings are 1) "of faithfulness" or 2) "of a stork." The name of the stork meant "the faithful one" or "the loving one" because people knew that storks take very good care of their chicks.

# on the earth

"on the ground"

# crush them

The word "them" refers to the eggs.
