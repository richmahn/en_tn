# with fierceness and rage

The horse is very excited, so he moves quickly and strongly.

# at the trumpet's sound

It can be stated that someone blows the trumpet. AT: "when someone blows a trumpet to announce that a battle has begun" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# he cannot stand in one place
