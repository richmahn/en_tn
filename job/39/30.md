# His young

"The baby eagles." It may be helpful to state that this happens after the eagle kills and animal. Alternate translation: "After an eagle kills an animal, the baby eagles"

# drink up blood

"drink the blood of the animal that he killed"

# where killed people are

"where there are dead people." This phrase refers to dead bodies that are lying out in the open, not to bodies that are buried in the ground.

# there he is

It can be made explicit that he comes to eat the dead bodies. Alternate translation: "he is there to eat them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
