The word "they" refers to the goats and the deer.

"make their offspring come out"

## then they finish their labor pains ##

The word "labor pains" refers to the offspring of the goats and deer because they are the result of the mother's labor and pain. AT: "send out their offspring from their womb." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

## the open fields ##
