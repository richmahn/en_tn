# Connecting Statement:

Yahweh continues to challenge Job.

# Is it at your orders ... nest in high places?

Yahweh uses this question to prove that Job is not powerful enough to command the eagles. The implicit answer to this question is "no." Alternate translation: "You are not able to command the eagle to mount up and build his nest in high places." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# at your orders

The abstract noun "orders" can be stated as a verb. Alternate translation: "because you tell it to do so" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# mounts up

This means he flies upward. Alternate translation: "flies up into the sky" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
