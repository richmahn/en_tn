Yahweh continues to challenge Job.

## Will you trust...your threshing floor ##

Yahweh uses these questions to emphasize that Job cannot control the wild ox. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## trust him ##

The word "him" refers to the "wild ox."

## leave your work to him to do ##

"have him do your hard work for you"
