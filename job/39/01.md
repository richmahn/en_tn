* **Can you watch when the deer are having their fawns** - "When the deer give birth can you watch to make sure everything goes well"
* **are having their fawns** - "give birth"
* **that they gestate** - "to make sure that they complete their pregnancy" or "to make sure that they get to full term"
* **they** - The word "they" refers to the goats and the deer.
* **gestate** - "are pregnant"
* **the time when they bear their young** - "when they give birth"
