# Connecting Statement:

Yahweh continues to challenge Job.

# he searches for victims

Here the word "he" refers to the eagle.

# for victims

"for animals that he can kill and eat"

# his eyes see them

Here "his eyes" refer to the eagle. Alternate translation: "he sees them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
