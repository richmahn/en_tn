# General information

Yahweh uses two questions to emphasize that he is greater than Job because Yahweh takes care of the wild donkeys and Job does not. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Connecting Statement:

Yahweh continues to challenge Job.

# Who let the wild donkey go free?

This can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: "I am the one who let the wild donkey go free." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# the wild donkey ... the swift donkey

These are different names for the same kind of donkey.

# Who has untied the bonds of the swift donkey

This can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: "I am the one who untied the bonds of the swift donkey" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# bonds

ropes, chains, or straps that hold an animal and keep it from running away
