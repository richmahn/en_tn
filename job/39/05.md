# Connecting Statement:

Yahweh continues to challenge Job.

# Who let ... the salt land?

Yahweh uses two questions to emphasize that he is greater than Job because Yahweh takes care of the wild donkeys and Job does not. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Who let the wild donkey go free?

This can be translated as a statement. AT: "I am the one who let the wild donkey go free." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# the wild donkey ... the swift donkey

These are different names for the same kind of donkey.

# Who has untied the bonds ... in the salt land?

This can be translated as a statement. AT: "I untied the bonds ... in the salt land." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# bonds

ropes, chains, or straps that hold an animal and keep it from running away

# whose home I have made in the Arabah

Yahweh describes the donkey as though he were a person that had a house. "I gave him the Arabah as a place to live" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# the salt land

the land around the Salt Sea that has a lot of salt in it
