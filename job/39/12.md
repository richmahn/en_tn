# Will you depend on him ... grain for your threshing floor?

These two clauses basically mean the same thing. This question can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: "You will not be able to depend on him ... grain for your threshing floor." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
