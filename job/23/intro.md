# Job 23 General Notes

#### Structure and formatting

The ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is a poem. This chapter is Job's response to Eliphaz.

#### Special concepts in this chapter

##### Court
This chapter uses an extended metaphor of a court case to describe Job's "case," which he seeks to bring to Yahweh, who is a judge. Cultures without a legal system will have difficulty translating this chapter. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
