# Connecting Statement:

Job continues speaking.

# But he is one of a kind, who can turn him back?

Job uses this question to emphasize that there is no one like God and no one can force him to change. AT: "But there is no one like him, and nobody can make him change his mind." or "But he alone is God, and no one can influence him." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# What he desires, he does

"He does whatever he wants to do"
