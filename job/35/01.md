# Do you think this is just ... 'My right before God'?

Elihu uses questions to challenge Job. AT: "You must think you are right ... 'My right before God.'" or "It is not just ... 'My right before God.'" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Do you think this is just when you say

"Do you think it is right for you to say"

# Do you think

Here "you" is singular and refers to Job. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# My right before God

Possible meanings are 1) Job is claiming to be innocent before God or 2) Job is claiming that he, rather than God, is right.

# For you ask, 'What use is it to me?' and, 'Would I be better off if I had sinned?'

Elihu quotes Job as saying the these two rhetorical questions. AT: "For you say, 'It does not benefit me' and, 'I am no better off than if I had sinned.'" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
