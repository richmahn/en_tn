# If you are righteous, what can you give to him? What will he receive from your hand?

The two rhetorical questions mean basically the same thing, that Job's righteousness adds nothing to God. Alternate translation: "If you are righteous, that does not enable you to give anything to him, and there is nothing that he will receive from your hand." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# receive from your hand

Here the word "hand" represents Job. Alternate translation: "receive from you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
