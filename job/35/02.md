# Do you think this is just ... 'My right before God'?

Elihu uses questions to challenge Job. Alternate translation: "You must think you are right ... 'My right before God.'" or "It is not just ... 'My right before God.'" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Do you think this is just when you say
