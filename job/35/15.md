# General Information:

Elihu continues speaking.

# How much less will he answer you ... concerned about people's pride

Elihu says that it is even less likely that God will answer Job's prayers since Job is saying these things about God that are untrue.

# he never punishes anyone in anger

"he never punishes anyone because he is angry"

# he piles up words without knowledge

Elihu speaks of "words" as if they were objects, and of speaking many words as if it were piling those objects one on top of the other. The word "knowledge" can be translated with a verbal phrase. AT: "he speaks many words without knowing what he is talking about" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
