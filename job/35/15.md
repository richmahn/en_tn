# General Information:

Elihu continues speaking.

# Now you say that his anger does not punish, and he does not take even a litte notice of transgression

Because Job is saying these things about God that are untrue, it is even less likely that God will answer Job's prayers.

# his anger does not punish

Here "his anger" is a metonym for "him." AT: "he never punishes anyone because he is angry" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs-metonymy]])

# he piles up words without knowledge

Elihu speaks of "words" as if they were objects, and of speaking many words as if it were piling those objects one on top of the other. The word "knowledge" can be translated with a verbal phrase. AT: "he speaks many words without knowing what he is talking about" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
