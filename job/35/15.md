# General Information:

Elihu continues speaking.

# Now you say that his anger does not punish, and he does not take even a litte notice of transgression

Because Job is saying these things about God that are untrue, it is even less likely that God will answer Job's prayers.

# his anger does not punish

Here "his anger" is a metonym for "him." AT: "he never punishes anyone because he is angry" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
