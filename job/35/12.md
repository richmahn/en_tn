# Connecting Statement:

Elihu continues speaking.

# they cry out

"the oppressed people cry out"

# How much less will he answer you ... that you are waiting for him!

Since God will not hear the prayers of prideful, evil men, it is even less likely that he will hear Job, who is complaining against him. AT: "So he certainly will not answer you ... that you are waiting for him!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations]])

# that your case is before him

"you have presented your case to him"

# you are waiting for him

"you are waiting for him to respond"
