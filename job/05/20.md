# General Information:

The shift in pronoun from "he" to "you" which began in [Job 5:19](../05/19.md) continues through the end of Eliphaz's speech in [Job 5:27](./26.md).

# In famine he will ransom you

Here rescuing is spoken of as if it were ransoming, buying back. Alternate translation: "In famine God will rescue you from danger" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the hands of the sword

Here "hands" probably represents the people who attack with weapons, including swords. Alternate translation: "violent people" or "people who attack you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
