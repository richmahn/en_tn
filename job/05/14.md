# They encounter darkness in the daytime

Here the cunning, wicked people whom God confuses are spoken of as if they unexpectedly are in the dark at noon, when the sun is at its highest position in the sky. They cannot do anything they wish to do, because they cannot see. AT: "Those who are cunning are in the dark, even at noontime" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# But he saves the poor person from the sword in their mouths
