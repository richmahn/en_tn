# General Information:

The writer continues to use parallelism in each verse, conveying a single idea using two different statements to emphasize how God debases those who are cunning and saves those who are poor. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# They encounter darkness in the daytime

Here the cunning, wicked people whom God confuses are spoken of as if they unexpectedly are in the dark at noon, when the sun is at its highest position in the sky. They cannot do anything they wish to do, because they cannot see. Alternate translation: "Those who are cunning are in the dark, even at noontime" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# grope

feel around like a blind person

# noonday

the middle of the day, when the sun is highest and brightest
