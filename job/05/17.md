# General Information:

The writer continues to use parallelism in verses 18 and 19, conveying a single idea using two different statements to emphasize God's acts of chastening and healing. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# God corrects ... chastening of the Almighty

God is pictured as a parent correcting or instructing a child.

# blessed is the man whom God corrects

"God really favors the man whom he corrects"

# do not despise

"do not reject" or "do not consider worthless"

# chastening

"instruction" or "correction" or "discipline"
