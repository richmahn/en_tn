# General Information:

The writer continues to use parallelism in verses 18 and 19, conveying a single idea using two different statements to emphasize God's acts of chastening and healing. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# God corrects ... chastening of the Almighty

God is pictured as a parent correcting or instructing a child.

# blessed is the man whom God corrects

"God really favors the man whom he corrects"

# do not despise

"do not reject" or "do not consider worthless"

# chastening

"instruction" or "correction" or "discipline"

# For he wounds and then binds up; he wounds and then his hands heal

"For he wounds but binds up; he crushes but his hands heal"

# his hands heal

Here "his hands" represents God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# He will rescue you out of six troubles; indeed, in seven troubles, no evil will touch you

The use of increasing numbers such as "six" and "seven" represents the idea of many, many times. AT: "He will rescue you out of trouble over and over again; indeed, time after time, no evil will touch you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
