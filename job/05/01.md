# To which of the holy ones will you turn?

Eliphaz poses this question to make the point that there is no one Job can turn to for help. Alternate translation: "Is there a holy one to whom you may turn?" or "There is no holy one to whom you can turn for help." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# holy ones

This refers to supernatural beings of some kind, whether angels or other spirits.
