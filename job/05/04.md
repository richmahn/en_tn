# General Information:

These verses continue the earlier use of parallelism, here emphasizing in different ways the idea that the children of foolish people are never safe. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# His children are far from safety

"His" refers to the foolish person or the foolish people in [Job 5:02](./01.md). AT: "Their children are never safe"

# are crushed

Here being crushed represents being oppressed, taken advantage of, at court. This idea may be put into active form. AT: "someone crushes them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# city gate

The city gate, functioning as a court, was the place where disputes were resolved and where judgments were given.

# There is no one to rescue them

"There is no one to help the foolish people's children out of their hardship"

# they even take it from among the thorns

This perhaps refers to parts of a field where the worst crops grow, because of thorn plants present.

# The thirsty pant for their wealth

Here greedy people are spoken of as if they were thirsty, and the wealth of the foolish person is spoken of as if it were something that they could drink. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
