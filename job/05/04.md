# General Information:

These verses continue the earlier use of parallelism, here emphasizing in different ways the idea that the children of foolish people are never safe. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# His children are far from safety

"His" refers to the foolish person or the foolish people in [Job 5:2](../05/02.md). Alternate translation: "Their children are never safe"

# are crushed

Here being crushed represents being oppressed, taken advantage of, at court. This idea may be put into active form. Alternate translation: "someone crushes them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# city gate

The city gate, functioning as a court, was the place where disputes were resolved and where judgments were given.

# There is no one to rescue them

"There is no one to help the foolish people's children out of their hardship"
