## For difficulties do not come forth from the soil ##

"For difficulties do not come forth from the dust"

## But mankind makes his own trouble just as sparks fly upward ##

The writer compares the trouble in people's lives to sparks shooting up from a fire.  Both are inevitable.  "But people have troubles from the time they are born just as surely as sparks shoot up from a fire" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
