# General Information:

The writer continues to use parallelism in each verse, conveying a single idea using two different statements to emphasize how God lifts those who are lowly and debases those who are cunning. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# He does this in order to set up on high those who are low

Humble people in distress are spoken of as if they were in a low position. When God rescues them, they receive honor. When this happens, they are spoken of as being raised up and put into a high position. AT: "God does this in order to rescue and honor the humble who have been suffering" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
