# He does this in order to set up on high those who are low

Humble people in distress are spoken of as if they were in a low position. When God rescues them, they receive honor. When this happens, they are spoken of as being raised up and put into a high position. AT: "God does this in order to rescue and honor the humble who have been suffering" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# He breaks the plans

Here stopping the plans of crafty people is spoken of as if they were things that could be physically broken. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# He traps wise people in their own crafty actions

Here making wise people suffer for their own evil actions is spoken of as if it were catching them in traps. Their own actions are spoken of as if they were those traps. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# twisted people

Here being evil in a clever way is spoken of as if it were being twisted. AT: "those who are cunning" or "those who are devious" or "those who are shrewd" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
