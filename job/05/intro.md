# Job 05 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

The ULB sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is a poem. This chapter is a continuation of the advice of Job's friend, Eliphaz. 

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Eliphaz's advice #####
Eliphaz tells Job to curse Yahweh. The advice Eliphaz gives to Job is bad advice. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/curse]])

##### Sickness and sin #####
In the ancient Near East, it was common to believe that a person's illness was caused by sin. It was seen as the punishment of a god. While Yahweh may punish people because of their sin, not all sicknesses are caused by sin. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/believe]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter ####

##### Rhetorical questions #####
Eliphaz uses many different rhetorical questions in this chapter in order to try to convince Job that he is wrong. These questions help to build Eliphaz's argument. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
