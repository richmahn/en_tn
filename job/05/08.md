In these verses, Eliphaz continues his speech from [Job 4:1](../04/01.md). The writer continues to use parallelism in each verse, conveying a single idea using two different statements to emphasize that Job needs to plead his case to God who does wonderful things. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## great and profound things, marvelous things without number ##

"great things that cannot be understood, wonders that cannot be counted"

## marvelous things ##

"wonderful things" or "wonders"
