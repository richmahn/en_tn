# General Information:

In these verses, Eliphaz continues his speech from [Job 4:01](../04/01.md). The writer continues to use parallelism in each verse, conveying a single idea using two different statements to emphasize that Job needs to plead his case to God who does wonderful things. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# great and unsearchable things, marvelous things without number

"great things that cannot be understood, wonders that cannot be counted"

# unsearchable things

This refers to things that mankind cannot understand. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# great and unsearchable things

Here the writer uses two independent words connected by "and" to emphasize the greatness of God's actions. AT: "greatly profound things" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])

# marvelous things

"wonderful things" or "wonders"
