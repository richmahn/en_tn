# your seed will be great

Here "seed" represents a person's descendants. Alternate translation: "your descendants will be many" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# your offspring will be like the grass on the ground

Here "offspring" are spoken of as if they were as many as blades of grass, and probably as thriving, too. Alternate translation: "your descendants will be as many and as alive as the grass that grows" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
