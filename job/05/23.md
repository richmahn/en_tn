# General Information:

The writer continues to use parallelism in each of these verses, conveying a single idea using two different statements to emphasize security with regard to the natural world, the homestead, and one's descendants. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# you will have a covenant with the stones in your field

Here the stones in farmers' fields are spoken of as if they were people that someone could have a covenant with. AT: "the stones in your fields will be like people who promise that they will not make any trouble for you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the beasts of the field

This refers to dangerous wild animals. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# You will know that your tent is in safety

Here "tent" represents a person's family, household, and all his possessions. AT: "You will know that your family, servants, and everything you own are safe" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# you will visit your sheepfold and you will not miss anything

"when you visit where your flock stays at night, you will find all your sheep there"

# your seed will be great

Here "seed" represents a person's descendants. AT: "your descendants will be many" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# your offspring will be like the grass on the ground
