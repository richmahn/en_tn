## translationNotes

* The writer continues to use parallelism in each of these verses, conveying a single idea using two different statements to emphasize security with regard to the natural world, the homestead, and one's descendants. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
* **you will have a covenant with the stones in your field** - This sentence uses figurative language to convey harmony with the natural world.  AT: "your covenant is with the stones of the field"
* **you will be at peace with the wild beasts** - "the wild animals will be at peace with you"
* **wild beasts** - animals that have not been tamed or trained
* **You will know that your tent is in safety** - "You will know that your tent is peaceful"
* **you will visit your sheepfold and find nothing missing** - "you will visit your flock and find nothing missing"
* **You will know that your posterity will be great, that your offspring will be like the grass on the ground** - In this simile, "offspring" is pictured as numerous as blades of grass.  "You will know that your descendants will be many, that your offspring will be like grass growing on the earth" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
