# you will have a covenant with the stones in your field

Here the stones in farmers' fields are spoken of as if they were people that someone could have a covenant with. AT: "the stones in your fields will be like people who promise that they will not make any trouble for you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the beasts of the field

This refers to dangerous wild animals. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
