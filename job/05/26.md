# You will come to your grave at a full age

"You will die at a very old age"

# like a stack of grain sheaves that goes up at its time

"like a stack of grain sheaves that is carried up to the threshing floor"

# See, we have examined this matter; it is like this; listen to it, and know it for yourself

The words "we" refers to Job's friends but not to Job. AT: "Look, we have thought about this matter. Listen to what I am saying and know that it is true" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
