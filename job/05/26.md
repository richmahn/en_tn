## translationNotes

* **You will come to your grave at a full age** - "You will die at a ripe old age when it is your time"
* **like a stack of grain sheaves that is carried up to the threshing floor** - Eliphaz is using simile to make his point that Job will die when it is time for him to die. AT: "Just as grain is harvested at the appointed time, so shall you die when it is your appointed time." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
* **See, we have examined this matter; it is like this; listen to it, and know it for yourself** - "We" refers to Job's friends, including Eliphaz, who is speaking. AT: "Look, we have thought about this matter.  Listen to what I'm saying and know that it is true."  (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive]])
