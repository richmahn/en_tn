# Connecting Statement:

Yahweh continues to challenge Job.

# Who shut up the sea ... of the womb

This can be translated as a command. Alternate translation: "Tell me who shut up the sea ... of the womb" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# shut up the sea with doors

Yahweh compares the way that he prevented the sea from covering all of the earth to holding it back with doors. Alternate translation: "prevented the water from flooding over the land" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# as if it had come out of the womb

Yahweh compares his creation of the sea to childbirth. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
