# Can you fasten chains ... over the earth?

These can be translated as statements. AT: "Tell me if you can fasten chains on the Pleiades, or undo the cords of Orion. Tell me if you can lead the constellations to appear at their proper times, or guide the Bear with its children. Tell me if you know the regulations of the sky, or whether you could set in place the sky's rule over the earth." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
