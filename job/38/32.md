# Connecting Statement:

Yahweh continues to challenge Job.

# Can you lead the constellations ... proper times? Can you guide ... children?

These rhetorical questions can be translated as statements. Alternate translation: "You cannot lead the constellations ... proper times. You cannot guide ... children."  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# constellations

groups of stars that seem like they form a particular shape in the sky

# to appear at their proper times

"so that they appear at the right time"

# the Bear

This is the name of a constellation. Translate as in [Job 9:9](../09/09.md).

# its children

"its cubs"
