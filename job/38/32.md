# the Pleiades ... Orion ... the Bear

These are the names of constellations. See how you translated them in [Job 9:9](../09/09.md).

# constellations

groups of stars that seem like they form a particular shape in the sky

# to appear at their proper times

"so that they appear at the right time"

# its children

"its cubs"
