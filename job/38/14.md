# The earth is changed in appearance like clay changes under a seal

At nighttime, people cannot see clearly, but in the morning the light reveals the distinct shape of everything, just like a seal creates distinct images in clay. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# all things on it stand out clearly like the folds of a piece of clothing

Here "it" refers to the earth. This phrase has a similar meaning to the first phrase in this verse. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# From wicked people their 'light' is taken away

This can be stated in active form. AT: "The morning takes away the 'light' of wicked people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# their 'light'

The wicked consider darkness to be their light, because they do their evil deeds in the darkness and they are familiar with the darkness. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])

# their uplifted arm is broken

The raised arm of the wicked represents their power and intention to do evil things, but the wicked stop doing those evil things when the morning light comes. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
