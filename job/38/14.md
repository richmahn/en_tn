# The earth is changed in appearance like clay changes under a seal

At nighttime, people cannot see clearly, but in the morning the light reveals the distinct shape of everything, just like a seal creates distinct images in clay. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# all things on it stand out clearly like the folds of a piece of clothing

Here "it" refers to the earth. This phrase has a similar meaning to the first phrase in this verse. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
