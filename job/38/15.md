# their 'light'

The wicked consider darkness to be their light, because they do their evil deeds in the darkness and they are familiar with the darkness. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])

# their uplifted arm is broken

The raised arm of the wicked represents their power and intention to do evil things, but the wicked stop doing those evil things when the morning light comes. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
