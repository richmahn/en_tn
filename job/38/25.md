# General Information:

Yahweh questions Job to emphasize that he causes it to rain and thunder and Job does not. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Connecting Statement:

Yahweh continues to challenge Job.

# Who has created the channels for the floods of rain, or who has made ... sprout with grass?

This can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: "Only I have created the channels for the floods of rain, and only I have made ... grass sprout up." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# the floods of rain

"the torrents of rain"

# a path for the thunder

"a way for the rumble of thunder to be heard."
