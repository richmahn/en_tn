# General Information:

Yahweh questions Job to emphasize that he causes it to rain and thunder and Job does not. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Connecting Statement:

Yahweh continues to challenge Job. He begins to ask a series of rhetorical questions. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Who has created the channels for the floods of rain

This can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: "Only I have created the channels for the floods of rain" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# or who has made a path for the thunder

This can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: "and only I have made a path for the thunder" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# the floods of rain

"the torrents of rain"

# a path for the thunder

"a way for the rumble of thunder to be heard."
