## Who can number the clouds by his skill ##

This phrase means: "Who can wisely control how many thin clouds are in the sky." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

## the water skins ##

skins that people sewed together so that they could hold water. Yahweh refers to the thick clouds as "waters skin" because they hold a lot of water just like water skins. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
