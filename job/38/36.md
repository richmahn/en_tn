# General Information:

Yahweh uses three questions to emphasize to Job that he rules the clouds and rain and Job does not. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Connecting Statement:

Yahweh continues to challenge Job.

# Who has put wisdom in the clouds or has given understanding to the mists?

These questions can be translated as statements. Alternate translation: "I am the one who has put wisdom in the clouds and given understanding to the mists." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# has put wisdom in the clouds

"has given wisdom to the clouds"
