* **has put wisdom in the clouds** - "has given wisdom to the clouds." Yahweh describes the clouds as though they were people and gives them wisdom so that they know what to do. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
* **Who can number the clouds by his skill** - This phrase means: "Who can wisely control how many thin clouds are in the sky." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
* **the water skins** - skins that people sewed together so that they could hold water. Yahweh refers to the thick clouds as "waters skin" because they hold a lot of water just like water skins. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
* **when the dust runs into a hard mass** - "when the rain molds the dirt together into one piece." The rain makes the loose dry dirt stick together like one piece of dirt. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
