# Have the gates of death been revealed to you

Death is spoken of as if it were a city that had gates through which people enter into it. This can be expressed in active form. Alternate translation: "Has anyone shown the gates of death to you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# the shadow of death

See how you translated this in [Job 3:5](../03/05.md).
