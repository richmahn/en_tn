# General Information:

Yahweh uses five questions to emphasize to Job that he rules the heavens and Job does not. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Connecting Statement:

Yahweh continues to challenge Job.

# Can you fasten chains ... over the earth?

These can be translated as statements. Alternate translation: "You cannot fasten chains on the Pleiades, and you cannot undo the cords of Orion." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# fasten chains on

"bind chains onto" or "tie the bonds of"

# the Pleiades ... Orion

These are the names of constellations. See how you translated them in [Job 9:9](../09/09.md).

# undo the cords of Orion

"loosen the cords that hold Orion"
