# General Information:

Yahweh uses a question to emphasize that he rules over the natural world and Job does not. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Connecting Statement:

Yahweh continues to challenge Job.

# Have you entered the storehouses for the snow, or have you seen the storehouses for the hail ... and war?

These questions expect a negative answer. They can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: "You have never entered the storehouses for the snow, or seen the storehouses for the hail ... and war." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Have you entered the storehouses for the snow, or have you seen the storehouses for the hail

These two phrases are similar in meaning. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# storehouses for the snow ... storehouses for the hail

Snow and hail are pictured as being stored by Yahweh to do his will. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# hail

balls of ice (usually small) that sometimes fall down from the sky during a storm
