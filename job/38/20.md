# Can you lead light and darkness to their places of work? Can you find the way back to their houses for them?

These questions expect a negative answer. They can be expressed as statements. Alternate translation: "You cannot lead light and darkness to their places of work, or find the way back to their houses for them." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# to their places of work

"to their territory." Light and darkness are spoken of as being led out and back each day to accomplish Yahweh's purposes. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
