Yahweh begins to challenge Job with a series of questions that emphasize he created the earth and Job did not. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Where were you when I laid the earth's foundations? Tell me, if you have so much understanding

This can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: "Tell me where you were when I laid the foundations of the earth, if you have so much understanding" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# I laid the earth's foundations

Yahweh describes creating the earth as though he was building a structure. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# if you have so much understanding
