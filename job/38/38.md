# Who has put wisdom ... tightly together?

These questions can be translated as statements. Alternate translation: "Tell me who has put wisdom in the clouds and given understanding to the mists. Tell me who can number the clouds by his skill. Tell me who can pour out the water skins of the sky when the dust runs into a hard mass and the clods of earth clump tightly together." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# when the dust runs into a hard mass and the clods of earth clump tightly together

These two lines mean similar things. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# when the dust runs into a hard mass

The rain makes the loose dry dirt stick together like one piece of dirt. This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "when the rain molds the dirt into a hard mass" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# the clods of earth clump tightly together

"the lumps of soil stick together"
