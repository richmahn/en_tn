# Does the rain have a father, or, who fathers the drops of dew? Out of whose womb did the ice come? Who bore the white frost out of the sky?

These can be translated as statements. Alternate translation: "Tell me whether the rain has a father, and who has engendered the raindrops. Tell me out of whose womb the ice came, and who bore the white frost out of the sky." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
