Yahweh continues to challenge Job.

## Have you ever...be shaken out of it ##

Yahweh uses this question to emphasize that only he has power over the morning and Job does not. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## since your own days began ##

This phrase means "since you were born" or "on any of the days that you have lived."

## given orders to the morning ##

Yahweh describes the morning as though it were a person who could receive orders. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

## caused the morning dawn to know its place in the scheme of things ##

"let the dawn know where it belongs" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

## dawn ##

the light that appears in the morning before the sun rises

## might take hold of the sides of the earth ##

Yahweh describes dawn as a person holding the horizons of the earth like the edges of a rug. Dawn looks like it holds the sides of the earth because its light first appears on the horizons. AT: "would appear on the horizons of the earth." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## so that it ##

The word "it" refers to the dawn.

## so that the wicked might be shaken out of it ##

"and shake the wicked out of the earth." The light of the dawn makes wicked people go away like shaking a rug gets the dirt out. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
