# Connecting Statement:

Yahweh continues to challenge Job.

# Have you ... shake the wicked out of it?

# given orders to the morning

Yahweh describes the morning as being able to receive orders and know things like a person. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# caused the dawn to know its place
