# Who can number the clouds by his skill?

"Who is able to count the clouds?"

# the water skins

These are skins that people sew together so that they can hold water. Yahweh refers to the thick clouds as "waters skins" because they hold much water just like water skins. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
