# Can you raise ... 'Here we are'?

These can be translated as statements. AT: "Tell me if you can raise your voice up to the clouds, so that an abundance of rainwater may cover you. Tell me if you can send out bolts of lightning that they may go out, that they say to you, 'Here we are!'" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Here we are

This pictures the lightning bolts as servants saying they are ready to follow commands. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
