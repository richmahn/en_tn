# Have you gone ... in its expanse?

These questions expect negative answers. They can be expressed as statements. Alternate translation: "You have not gone to the sources of the waters of the sea, or walked in the lowest parts of the deep. The gates of death have not been revealed to you, and you have not seen the gates of the shadow of death. You do not understand the earth in its expanse." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# the earth in its expanse

"the great broad places of the earth"

# if you know it all

"if you know all about these things"
