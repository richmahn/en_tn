# General Information:

Yahweh uses two questions to emphasize to Job that he rules the rain clouds and lightning and Job does not. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Connecting Statement:

Yahweh continues to challenge Job.

# Can you raise ... 'Here we are'?

These can be translated as statements. Alternate translation: "Tell me if you can raise your voice up to the clouds, so that an abundance of rainwater may cover you. Tell me if you can send out bolts of lightning that they may go out, that they say to you, 'Here we are!'" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# an abundance of rainwater

The abstract noun "abundance" can be translated as the adjective "abundant." Alternate translation: "an abundant amount of rainwater" or "a flood of waters" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
