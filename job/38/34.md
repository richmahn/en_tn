Yahweh continues to challenge Job.

## Can you raise...Here we are ##

Yahweh uses these question to emphasize that Job cannot control the clouds, the rain, or the lightning. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## so that an abundance of rainwater may cover you ##

"so that plenty of water will cover you"

## Can you send out bolts of lightning that they may go out ##

"Can you command the lightning bolts to go where you want them to and they actually go"

## that they say to you ##

"and will they say to you"

## Here we are ##

This phrase means, "We are here so that you can tell us what you want us to do." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
