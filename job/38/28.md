# General Information:

Yahweh uses four questions to emphasize to Job that he makes rain, dew, ice, and frost and Job does not. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
Each of the two lines in these three verses mean similar things. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
Rain, dew, ice, and frost are spoken of as though they could be born like people are. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# Connecting Statement:

Yahweh continues to challenge Job.

# Does the rain have a father, or, who fathers the drops of dew? Out of whose womb did the ice come? Who bore the white frost out of the sky?

These can be translated as statements. Alternate translation: "Tell me whether the rain has a father, and who has engendered the raindrops. Tell me out of whose womb the ice came, and who bore the white frost out of the sky." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# fathers the drops of dew

Becoming the father of the dew is a metaphor for creating it. Alternate translation: "causes the drops of dew to exist" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
