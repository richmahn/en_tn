# Connecting Statement:

Yahweh begins a series of four questions to emphasize to Job that he makes rain, dew, ice, and frost and Job does not. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]]) Rain, dew, ice, and frost are spoken of as though they could be born like people are. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# Connecting Statement:

Yahweh continues to challenge Job.

# Does the rain have a father, or, who fathers the drops of dew?

These can be translated as statements. Alternate translation: "Tell me who the rain's father is, and tell me who has become the father of the drops of dew." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# fathers the drops of dew

Becoming the father of the dew is a metaphor for creating it. Alternate translation: "causes the drops of dew to exist" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
