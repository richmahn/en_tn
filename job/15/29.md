# He will not be rich; his wealth will not last

These two litotes express that he will be the opposite of rich, that he will be poor. AT: "he will be poor; all his money will disappear" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])

# not even his shadow will last on the earth

This repeats the idea that all the possessions of the wicked will disappear. Other translations may read: "nor will his possessions spread out on the earth."

# out of darkness

Darkness here represents death. AT: "out of the darkness of death" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# a flame will dry up his stalks

Here the flame represents God's judgment and the drying up of his stalks represents either the fact that his possessions disappear, or that he will die. AT: "God will take everything he owns away, like a fire dries out the moist branches of a tree" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the breath of God's mouth

Here God's "breath" represents his judgement. AT: "God's breath" or "God's judgment" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# he will go away

This refers to him dying. AT: "he will die" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
