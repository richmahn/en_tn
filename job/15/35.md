# They conceive mischief and give birth to iniquity; their womb conceives deceit

The same thought is repeated three times to emphasize how much evil these people produce. This speaks of a person planning to do evil things and doing them as if the person were conceiving and giving birth to these things as a woman conceives and gives birth to a child. Alternate translation: "They plan to cause mischief and do evil things; they are always planning to deceive others" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# their womb conceives

Here the "womb" is used to refer to the person to emphasize conception, as it is in the womb that conception takes place. Alternate translation: "they conceive" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
