## This is true ##

"This" refers to the wicked man who "runs at God with a stiff neck" in the previous verse.

## he has covered his face with his fat and gathered fat upon his loins ##

This wicked man is described as fat and weak, while believing himself to be strong enough to defeat God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])

## he has covered his face with his fat ##

AT: "his face looks fat and chubby"

## gathered fat upon his loins ##

"loins" are often considered the location of physical strength and generative power. To cover them with fat would be to destroy his power and ability to fight.

## heaps ##

AT: "disorganized piles"
