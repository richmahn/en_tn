# With us are both the gray-headed and the very aged men

Eliphaz speaks of him and the other men having learned wisdom from older men and wisdom that had been passed down from men of previous generations as if these older men were physically present with them. Alternate translation: "We acquired wisdom from old gray-haired people, from people who were born before your father was" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
