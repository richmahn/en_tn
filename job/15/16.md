# abominable and corrupt

These two words basically mean the same thing and emphasize how wicked humans are. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# who drinks iniquity like water

This describes iniquity as if it were water you can drink. It compares how the evil man desires to commit sin to how readily he desires to drink cool water. Alternate translation: "who love iniquity as much as they love a cup of fresh water" or "who commit evil deeds as often as they drink water" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
