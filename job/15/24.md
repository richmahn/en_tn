# Distress and anguish make him afraid; they prevail against him

The words "distress" and "anguish" mean basically the same thing and emphasize the intensity of the emotion. Here these feelings are spoken of as if they were an enemy who is attacking the wicked man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# prevail against

"overpower" or "defeat"

# as a king ready for battle

This compares how his distress and anguish overpower him to how a king, who is ready for battle, would prevail against him. Alternate translation: "just like a king, who is ready for a battle, would prevail against him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
