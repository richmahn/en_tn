# Should a wise man answer with useless knowledge and fill himself with the east wind?

Eliphaz uses this rhetorical question to rebuke Job. This can be written as a statement. Alternate translation: "A wise man should not answer with useless knowledge nor fill himself with the east wind." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# fill himself with the east wind

The wind represents emptiness. This phrase speaks of a person speaking empty and meaningless words as if that person were full of the wind. Alternate translation: "fill himself with empty words" or "only have meaningless words" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the east wind

"hot air" or "the desert wind"
