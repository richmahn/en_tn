## translationNotes

* **surely my lips will not speak ... neither will my tongue speak ...** - These two phrases have basically the same meaning and are used together for emphasis. When it says "my lips" and "my tongue," Job is referring to himself. AT: "Surely I will not speak unrighteousness or deceit." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
* **unrighteousness ... deceit** - AT: "unrighteous words ... deceitful words"
* **that you are right** - The word "you" here is plural. It refers to Job's friends. (See [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_youdual]])
* **deny** - AT: "give up"
