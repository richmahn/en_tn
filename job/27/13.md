# This is the portion of a wicked man with God

"This is what God has planned for the wicked man"

# the heritage of the oppressor that he receives from the Almighty

Here "the heritage of the oppressor" is a metaphor representing what will happen to the oppressor. What God will do to him is spoken of as if it were an inheritance that God will give him. Alternate translation: "what the Almighty will do to the oppressor" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
