# it sweeps him out of his place

Job speaks of the wind blowing the wicked man out of his house as if the wind were a person sweeping dust out of a house with a broom. Alternate translation: "the wind sweeps him out of his place like a woman who sweeps dirt out of a house" or "the wind easily blows him out of his place" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# his place

"his home"
