# Will he delight himself in the Almighty and call upon God at all times?

Job uses this question to say that the godless man will not do these things. This question can be translated as a simple statement. AT: "He will not delight himself in the Almighty and call upon God at all times." or "He will not be happy about what the Almighty does and he will not pray to God often." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
