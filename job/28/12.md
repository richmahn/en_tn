## Where will wisdom be found? Where is the place of understanding? ##

Both of these questions have the same meaning and are seeking the same answer. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## its price ... is it found ... It is not ##

The word "it" in these verses refers to "wisdom".

## The deep waters ... say, ‘It is not in me;’ the sea says, ‘It is not with me.’ ##

AT: "It is not in the deep waters under the earth, nor is it in the sea" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
