# Job 28 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

The ULB sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is a poem. This chapter is a continuation of Job's response to Bildad.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Yahweh's wisdom #####

Despite being upset about his circumstances, Job does not curse God. Instead, he recognizes Yahweh's wisdom and authority. This chapter especially focuses on Yahweh's wisdom as he controls the circumstances of Job's life. Men cannot understand because they do not have Yahweh's wisdom. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/curse]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/wise]])
