# General Information:

In verses 18-20 Job tells about the things he used to say before bad things happened to him.

# I broke the jaws of ... I plucked the victim

Job speaks of unrighteous people who persecute others as if they were wild animals that attack their victims by picking them up between their teeth. Alternate translation: "I made unrighteous people stop persecuting people, like someone who breaks the jaw of a wild animal and rescues its victim from between its teeth" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
