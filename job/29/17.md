# General Information:

In verses 18-20 Job tells about the things he used to say before bad things happened to him.

# I broke the jaws of ... I plucked the victim

Job speaks of unrighteous people who persecute others as if they were wild animals that attack their victims by picking them up between their teeth. AT: "I made unrighteous people stop persecuting people, like someone who breaks the jaw of a wild animal and rescues its victim from between its teeth" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# I will die in my nest

Here "nest" represents Job's home and family. Job used to speak as if he were a bird that lived in a nest with his baby birds. AT: "I will die at home with my family" or "I will die in the safety of my home" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# I will multiply my days like the grains of sand

There are more grains of sand on the shore than anyone can count. To say that he would live more days than anyone could count is an exaggeration to express that he would live a very long time. AT: "I will live a very long time" or "I will live many years" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# My roots ... my branches

Job used to speak of his strength as if he were strong like a well-watered tree. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
