# I will die in my nest

Here "nest" represents Job's home and family. Job used to speak as if he were a bird that lived in a nest with his baby birds. AT: "I will die at home with my family" or "I will die in the safety of my home" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# I will multiply my days like the grains of sand

There are more grains of sand on the shore than anyone can count. To say that he would live more days than anyone could count is an exaggeration to express that he would live a very long time. AT: "I will live a very long time" or "I will live many years" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
