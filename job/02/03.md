# General Information:

This verse is the same as [Job 1:8](../01/08.md), except for the addition of "He still holds fast to his integrity, although you misled me against him, to destroy him without cause."

# Have you considered my servant Job?

This rhetorical question actually makes a statement.See how you translated this in [Job 1:8](../01/08.md). Alternate translation: "Consider my servant Job." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# a blameless and upright man

The words "blameless" and "upright" share similar meanings and emphasize that Job was a righteous man. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Job 1:1](../01/01.md). Alternate translation: "one who did what was right before God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# one who fears God and turns away from evil

See how you translated this in [Job 1:1](../01/01.md).

# still holds fast to his integrity

"remains completely dedicated to doing what is good and right"

# misled me against him

"persuaded me without cause to attack him"

# to destroy him

Here "destroy" represents "make poor." Alternate translation: "to make him a poor man"
