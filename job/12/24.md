* **he causes them to wander** - "he causes them to go in the wrong direction" or "he causes them to go astray"
* **in a wilderness where there is no path** - "in a wasteland with no paths" or "in an unmarked wasteland"
* **They grope in the dark without light** - "AT: They feel around like a blind man" or "They try to find their way like a blind man"
* **he makes them stagger like a drunk man** - "he makes them wander and wobble like a person who has had too much alcohol." Job compared the actions of the leaders to a person's attempts to walk while under the influence of alcohol - both lack direction and purpose. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
