# No doubt you are the people; wisdom will die with you

Job mocks how they are acting and shows how ridiculous they sound. Alternate translation: "Surely you are such important people that wisdom cannot exist without you" or "You all act like you are the only wise people and that when you die, wisdom will disappear" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])

This is plural in verses 2 and 3. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
