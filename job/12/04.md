## translationNotes

* **I am something for my neighbor to laugh at—I, one who called on God and who was answered by him! I, a just and perfect man—I am now something to laugh at** - Two statements convey one idea. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
* **he thinks in a way that brings more misfortune to those whose foot is slipping.** - AT: "His way of thinking brings more trouble to those who are already in trouble."
* **foot is slipping** - The foot represents the whole person who is already starting to have trouble come to him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
* **The tents of robbers prosper, / and those who provoke God feel secure; /
* This is a parallelism that has 3 (instead of 2) different statements that state a single idea. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]]) AT: "The tents of robbers swell with goods so that these people feel secure even while offending God. Their own abilities become their source of strength."
* **their own hands** - "Hands" represents the abilities of a person. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
