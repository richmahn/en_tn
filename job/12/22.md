## He reveals deep things from darkness ##

"He shows us deep places from darkness"

## and brings out to light the shadows where the dead are ##

"and makes shadows deep as death clear to see"

## He makes nations strong ##

"he makes people groups strong"

## and he also destroys them ##

"and he also wipes them out"

## He enlarges nations ##

"He causes the extent of the land of people groups to become bigger"

## and he also leads them along as prisoners ##

AT: "and he also leads them along"
