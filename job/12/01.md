# No doubt you are the people; wisdom will die with you

Job mocks how they are acting and shows how ridiculous they sound. AT: "Surely you are such important people that wisdom cannot exist without you" or "You all act like you are the only wise people and that when you die, wisdom will disappear" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])

# No doubt

"Surely"

# you

This is plural in verses 2 and 3. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# you are the people

"you are the important people who know everything"

# Indeed, who does not know such things as these?

Job used this question to express a truth that should be obvious to his listeners. It can be expressed as a statement. AT: "Certainly there is no one who does not know such things as these." or "Certainly everyone knows these things." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
