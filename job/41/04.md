# Connecting Statement:

Yahweh continues to rebuke Job. He uses rhetorical questions to remind Job that Job is not powerful like Leviathan.

# Will he make a covenant with you, that you should take him for a servant forever?

This question can be translated as a statement. AT: "You know that he will not make a covenant with you, that you should take him for a servant forever." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# he ... him

The words "he" and "him" refer to Leviathan.
