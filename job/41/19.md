# Out of his mouth go burning torches, sparks of fire leap out

God expresses the same idea in two different ways in order to emphasize the terrifying appearance of Leviathan. You can make this clear by adding the omitted words. Alternate translation: "Out of his mouth go burning torches, sparks of fire leap out of his mouth" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# his

The word "his" refers to Leviathan.
