# shields

The word "shields" is a metaphor for Leviathan's hide. Both shields and Leviathan's hide protect well and deflect arrows and other weapons. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# tight together as with a close seal

This means the "shields" are very close to one another and nothing can get between them.
