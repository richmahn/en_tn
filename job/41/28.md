# to him sling stones become chaff

Chaff cannot hurt Leviathan, and sling stones are just as ineffective as chaff. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# him ... he ... His

The words "him," "he," and "his" refer to Leviathan.

# Clubs are regarded as straw

A club made of straw would not hurt him, and a club made of wood would not hurt him. This can be translated in active form. AT: "He thinks of clubs as if they were straw" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# he laughs at the whirring flight of a spear

The person throwing the spear hopes that the spear will kill Leviathan, but the writer speaks as if Leviathan knows the spear will not kill him and so laughs. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# he leaves a spreading trail in the mud as if he were a threshing sledge

Just as a threshing sledge goes over grain on a threshing floor and turns it to powder, so Leviathan's tail leaves a trail in the mud as he wags it when he walks. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
