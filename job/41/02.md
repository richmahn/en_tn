# Can you put a rope into his nose ... with a hook?

God uses this question to remind Job that Job is not powerful like Leviathan. This question can be translated as a statement. AT: "You know that you cannot put a rope into Leviathan's nose ... with a hook." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
