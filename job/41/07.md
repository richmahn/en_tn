# Connecting Statement:

Yahweh continues to rebuke Job. He uses rhetorical questions to remind Job that Job is not powerful like Leviathan.

# Can you fill his hide with harpoons or his head with fishing spears?

This question can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: "You cannot pierce his skin with your hunting weapons, nor can you pierce his head with fishing spears." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# his

Leviathan's

# harpoons

large spears with barbed points that people use to hunt large sea creatures
