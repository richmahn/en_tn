# He makes the deep to foam up like a pot of boiling water

"As he passes through the water, he leaves a trail of bubbles behind him, like the bubbling of boiling water in a pot"

# He

The word "he" refers to Leviathan.

# he makes the sea like a pot of ointment

The ointment in a pot is cloudy if someone shakes it, and the sea is muddy when Leviathan swims in it. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# one would think the deep had gray hair

This is because the bubbles in his wake are white.
