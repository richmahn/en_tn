# Job 41 General Notes

#### Structure and formatting

Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers, or songs. The ULT and many other English translations set the lines of this chapter, which is an extended quotation of Yahweh, farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text. It is a continuation of the previous chapter.
