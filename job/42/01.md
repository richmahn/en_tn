# I know that you can do all things, that no purpose of yours can be stopped

You may want to repeat the words "I know." AT: "I know that you can do all things. I know that no purpose of yours can be stopped" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# no purpose of yours can be stopped

This can be translated in active form. AT: "no one can stop any of your plans" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# Who is this who without knowledge conceals plans

Most modern versions agree that Job is loosely quoting God's own words from [Job 38:2](../38/01.md). You may decide, as does the UDB, to make it clear that God asked this question of Job and that Job is now remembering it. AT: "You said to me, 'Who is this who has no knowledge, but who dares to hide my plans'" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# conceals plans

That is, hides or misrepresents God's plans. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
