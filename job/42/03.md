# Who is this

The ULT and most modern versions agree that Job is loosely quoting God's own words from [Job 38:2](../38/02.md). You may decide, as does the UST, to make it clear that God asked this question of Job and that Job is now remembering it. Alternate translation: "You said to me, 'Who is this" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# conceals plans

That is, hides or misrepresents God's plans. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
