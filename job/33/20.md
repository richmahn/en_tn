# so that his life abhors food, and his soul abhors delicacies

These two phrases mean basically the same thing, that the person is in so much pain that he cannot even eat. The person is represented by his "life" and his "soul." Alternate translation: "the result is that he does not desire any food, not even very special food" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# abhors delicacies

"hates even very special food"
