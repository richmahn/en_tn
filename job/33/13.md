## Why do you struggle against him? ##

AT: "You should not even try to argue with God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## He does not account for any of his doings ##

"He does not have to explain to us anything he does"

## God speaks onceâ€”yes, twice ##

AT: "God speak again and again in different ways" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

## a dream, in a vision of the night ##

These mean the same thing. AT: "a dream, which is a vision in the night" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

## when deep sleep falls upon men, in slumber on the bed ##

AT: "when people are fully asleep on their bed"
