# General Information:

Elihu continues speaking to Job.

# for him

This does not refer to a specific person. Elihu continues speaking about any person in general.

# one out of a thousand

In some languages it may be more natural to refer to "a great number" instead of "a thousand." Alternate translation: "one from the great number of angels" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])
