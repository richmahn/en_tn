The place where people go when they die is referred to here as "the pit." AT: "the place where dead people are" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# I have found a ransom for him

This means that the angel has found a way to pay for the sins of the man so that he does not have to die. AT: "for I have found a way for you to keep him from dying" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
