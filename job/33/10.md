Elihu continues quoting what he heard Job say.

## puts my feet in the stocks ##

"Stocks" are wooden blocks a jailer puts around a prisoner's feet to restrict his movement. AT: "I feel like God's prisoner" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## my paths ##

This refers to Job's actions.

## I will answer you ##

Elihu is speaking to Job.
