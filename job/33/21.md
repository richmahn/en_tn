# General Information:

Elihu continues speaking to Job.

# His flesh is consumed away so that it cannot be seen; his bones, once not seen, now stick out

This can be stated in active form. "His flesh" refers to his fat and muscles, not to his body's outer skin. AT: "Disease makes his body weak and thin so that a person can see his bones" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# his soul draws close to the pit

Here a person is represented by his "soul." AT: "he is close to going into the grave" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# the pit

The place where people go when they die is referred to here as "the pit." AT: "the place where dead people are" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# his life to those who wish to destroy it

Here the person is represented by his "life." The phrase "those who wish to destroy it" refers to the place where people go after they die. AT: "and he is close to going to the place where dead people go" or "and he will soon go to the place of the dead" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
