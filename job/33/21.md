# General Information:

Elihu continues speaking to Job.

# His flesh is consumed away so that it cannot be seen; his bones, once not seen, now stick out

This can be stated in active form. "His flesh" refers to his fat and muscles, not to his body's outer skin. AT: "Disease makes his body weak and thin so that a person can see his bones" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
