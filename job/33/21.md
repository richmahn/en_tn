Elihu continues speaking to Job.

## His flesh is consumed away so that it cannot be seen; his bones, once not seen, now stick out ##

AT: "Disease makes his body weak and thin so that a person can see his bones" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## his soul draws close to the pit ##

AT: "he is close to going into the grave" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

## his life to the those who wish to destroy it ##

The phrase "those who wish to destroy it" may refer to the people who are already in the place where dead people go. It may also refer to the angel of death that comes and causes the person to die. AT: "he is close to dying" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
