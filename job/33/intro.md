# Job 33 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

According to Elihu, instead of being punished for his sins, Job is sinning in the midst of these difficulties. This is a continuation of the first of Elihu's four statements and it is addressed to Job. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]] and  [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/witness]])

The ULB sets the lines of this chapter farher to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is a poem. This quotation is a continuation of the previous chapter.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### God's mercy #####
While Job has been complaining about the lack of justice and response from Yahweh, Elihu shows Job that Yahweh has shown him great mercy along the way. He is still alive because of Yahweh's mercy. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/mercy]])
