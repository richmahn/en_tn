# General Information:

Elihu continues speaking to Job.

# The Spirit of God ... has given me life

These two lines mean the same thing. Elihu is emphasizing that God has made him and so gives authority to what he is saying. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# set your words in order before me and stand up

This speaks of Job preparing what he will say as if he were setting up and organizing physical objects. AT: "prepare what you will say, and stand up and answer me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
