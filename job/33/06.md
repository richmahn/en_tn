## I also have been formed out of the clay ##

AT: "God has also made me out the clay" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

AT: "I will not oppress you with what I say" or "I will speak gently to you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
