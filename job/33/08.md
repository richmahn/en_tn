Elihu continues speaking to Job.

## I have heard the sound of your words saying ##

AT: "I have heard you say" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## I am clean and without transgression; I am innocent, and there is no sin in me ##

All of these statements mean the same thing. AT: "I am completely innocent of any wrong doing" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
