Elihu continue speaking to Job.

## then God opens the ears of men ##

AT: "then God reveals things to people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## God keeps man's life back from the pit, his life from crossing over to death ##

Both of these statements mean the same thing. AT: "God saves people from the grave and from death" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
