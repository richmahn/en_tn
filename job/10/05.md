# Connecting Statement:

Job begins to ask a rhetorical question. He is saying that God lives forever but people live only for a short time, so God should not worry about Job's sins. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# your days like the days of mankind ... your years like the years of people

These two phrases have nearly the same meaning. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# your days

"the number of your days"

# your years

"the number of your years"
