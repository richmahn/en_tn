# although you know ... from your hand?

This is the end of the rhetorical question that begins with the words "Are your days" in verse 5. The whole question can be translated as a statement. "Your days are not like the days of mankind, and your years are not like the years of people, so you should not inquire after my iniquity and search after my sin, because you know I am not guilty and there is no one who can rescue me from your hand." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# from your hand

Here "your hand" represents God's power. Alternate translation: "from your power" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
