# Do you have eyes of flesh? Do you see like a man sees?

These two questions have nearly the same meaning. These questions expect a negative answer to emphasize that God does not see or understand things the same way a man does. They can be expressed as statements. AT: "You do not have eyes of flesh, and you do not see like a man sees."
