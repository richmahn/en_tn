Elihu continues speaking.

## teach me what I cannot see ##

AT: "teach me what I have done wrong and did not even know it" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## Do you think that God will punish that personâ€™s sin, since you dislike what God does? ##

Elihu uses a question for emphasis. AT: "Even though you do not like what God does, surely even you do not think that God will punish this person" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
