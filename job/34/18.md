Elihu continues speaking.

## God, who says to a king, ‘You are vile,’or says to nobles, ‘You are wicked? ##

This continues the question from the previous verse. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## vile ##

"evil" or "worthless" (UDB)

## for they all are the work of his hands ##

Here "hands" refer to power. AT: "for God made them all" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## at midnight the people will be shaken and will pass away ##

"Midnight" is the time when one day ends and another begins. AT: "when a person's time is over, God strikes him and he dies" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

## the mighty will be taken away, but not by human hands ##

AT: "it is God and not humans who causes important people to die." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
