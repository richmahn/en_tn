# General Information:

Elihu continues speaking.

# God, who says to a king, 'You are vile,' or says to nobles, 'You are wicked'?

This continues the rhetorical question from the previous verse, emphasizing to Job that he cannot condemn God. This can be written as a statement. AT: "He says to some kings, 'You are vile,' and he says to some nobles, 'You are wicked.'" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# God, who says to a king

This is part of the previous question. The understood words from the previous verse, "will you condemn God," may be supplied. AT: "Will you condemn God, who says to a king" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# vile

"evil" or "worthless"
