## translationNotes

* Elihu continues speaking.
* **When he stays silent, who can condemn him?** - Elihu uses a question to teach Job. AT: "No one can criticize God if he decides to remain silent" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **If he hides his face, who can perceive him?** - Elihu uses another question for the same reason. AT: "No one can go and see him if he decides to hide himself" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
* **no one to entrap the people** - This compares a godless ruler to a hunter who traps his prey. AT: "no one to harm the people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
