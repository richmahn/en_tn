Elihu continues speaking.

## When he stays silent, who can condemn him? ##

Elihu uses a question to teach Job. AT: "No one can criticize God if he decides to remain silent" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## If he hides his face, who can perceive him? ##

Elihu uses another question for the same reason. AT: "No one can go and see him if he decides to hide himself" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

## no one to entrap the people ##

This compares a godless ruler to a hunter who traps his prey. AT: "no one to harm the people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
