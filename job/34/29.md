# General Information:

Elihu continues speaking.

# When he stays silent, who can condemn him? If he hides his face, who can perceive him?

These two questions speak of God not punishing wicked people as if he were being silent and hiding his face. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# When he stays silent, who can condemn him?

Elihu uses this rhetorical question to teach Job. This question can be written as a statement. Alternate translation: "No one can criticize God if he decides to remain silent" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# If he hides his face, who can perceive him?

Elihu uses this rhetorical question to teach Job. This question can be written as a statement. Alternate translation: "No one can go and see him if he decides to hide his face" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# his face

Here God is represented by his "face." Alternate translation: "himself" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
