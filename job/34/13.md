Elihu continues speaking.

## Who put him in charge over the earth? Who put the whole world under him? ##

Both of these mean the same thing. AT: "No one was needed to give permission to God to take responsibility over all the earth. He is the rightful one to rule the world." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## If he ever ##

Elihu is describing a situation that he does not believe would ever happen. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])

## his spirit and his breath ##

<b>his spirit and his breath</b> AT: "his spirit and breath which gives us life" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

## all flesh ##

AT: "all living things" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
