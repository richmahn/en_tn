# General Information:

Elihu continues speaking.

# Who put him in charge over the earth? Who put the whole world under him?

Both of these rhetorical questions have the same meaning and emphasize that no one needed to grant God authority because it was already his. These questions can be written as statements. Alternate translation: "No one needed to give permission to God to take responsibility over all the earth. He is the rightful one to rule the world."
