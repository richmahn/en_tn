## translationNotes

* Elihu continues speaking.
* **now** - Elihu uses this word to bring attention to something important he is about to say.
* **you have** - Here "you" is singular and refers to Job. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
* **listen to the sound of my words** - This means the same as the previous part of the sentence. AT: "listen to what I say" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
* **Can one who hates justice govern? Will you condemn God, who is righteous and mighty?** - AT: "One who hates justice cannot be expected to rule over people. So you really cannot criticize God, who is righteous and powerful, and you cannot say that what he has done is wrong. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
