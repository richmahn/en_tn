# For the ear tries words as the palate tastes food

Elihu means people listen carefully to determine what is right or wrong just like we taste food to determine if it is good or bad. Here people are referred to by their "ear" and their "palate" to emphasize that they are tasting and hearing. AT: "For we listen to words to know what is good and bad, just as we taste foods to know what is good to eat" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
