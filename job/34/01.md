## Elihu ##

See how you translated this [Job 32:1](../32/01.md).

## Listen to my words ##

AT: "Listen to what I say" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## you wise men...you who have knowledge ##

Elihu is criticizing Job and his friends. He does not think they are actually wise. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])

## For the ear tries words as the palate tastes food ##

Elihu means people listen carefully to determine what is right or wrong just like we taste food to determine if it is good or bad. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
