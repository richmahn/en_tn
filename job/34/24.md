Elihu continues speaking.

## He breaks mighty men into pieces ##

AT: "He destroys rulers" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

## for their ways that need no further investigation ##

"because he already knows what they have done"

## he puts others in their places ##

"and he chooses other people to rule in their places"

## in the night ##

AT: "when they are not expecting it"
