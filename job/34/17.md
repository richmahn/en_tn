# Can one who hates justice govern? Will you condemn God, who is righteous and mighty?

Elihu uses this question to rebuke Job for implying that God hates justice. AT: "One who hates justice cannot be expected to rule over people. So you really cannot criticize God, who is righteous and powerful, and you cannot say that what he has done is wrong." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Can one who hates justice govern?

The implicit answer to this rhetorical question is "no." This question implies that God could not rule the world if he hated justice. This can be written as a statement. AT: "One who hates justice cannot govern the world." or "God could certainly never hate what is right and still rule the world." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# Will you condemn God, who is righteous and mighty?

This rhetorical question is used to emphasize that Job does not have the authority or a reason to condemn God. AT: "You cannot condemn God, who is righteous and mighty!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
