# Job 34 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

According to Elihu, instead of being punished for his sins, Job is sinning in the midst of these difficulties. This is the second of Elihu's four statements and it is addressed first to Job's friends and then to Job. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]] and  [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/testimony]])

The ULB sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is a poem. Elihu uses many of Job's statements against him. His attitude is not too different from Job's friends.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Yahweh's justice #####
Elihu defends the justice of Yahweh after Job claimed that Yahweh was being unjust. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/justice]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/justice]])
