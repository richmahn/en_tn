# Do you think that God will punish that person's sin, since you dislike what God does?

"Since you dislike what God does, do you think that God should punish this person's sin?" Elihu uses this rhetorical question to emphasize that he should not think that God will not punish this man. This can be written as a statement. AT: "Even though you do not like what God does, surely even you do not think that God will punish this person" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# that person's sin

Here punishing the person because of his sin is referred to as punishing the "person's sin." AT: "that person because of his sin" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# since you dislike

"because you dislike"

# what it is that you know
