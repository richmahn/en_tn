# Did I say to you, 'Give something to me?' Or, 'Offer me a gift from your wealth?' Or, 'Save me from my adversary's hand?' Or, 'Ransom me from the hand of my oppressors?'

Job uses rhetorical questions to emphasize that he did not ask his friends to give him anything or to help him. Alternate translation: "I did ask you to give me money or a gift. Nor did I ask you to save me from my adversary or oppressors." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
