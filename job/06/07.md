The writer continues to use parallelism in each of these verses, conveying a single idea using two different statements to emphasize Job's intense suffering and his desire for death. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## I refuse to touch them ##

"Them" refers to bad tasting foods.  Here Job continues to use the image of bad food as a metaphor for his unpalatable circumstances. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]]).

## Oh that I might have my request; oh, that God would grant me the thing that I long for ##

AT: "Oh that God would do what I have been asking him to do"

## that it would please God to crush me once ##

AT: "That God would go ahead and crush me"

## that he would let loose his hand and cut me off from this life ##

AT: "that he would act quickly and cut short my life"

## let loose his hand ##

"act quickly" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
