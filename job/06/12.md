The writer uses parallel rhetorical questions in each of these verses, conveying a single idea using two different statements to emphasize Job's lack of strength to endure suffering. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## Is my strength the strength of stones? Or is my flesh made of bronze? ##

Job contrasts the weakness of his body to tough, durable building materials to emphasize his lack of strength.  AT: "I am not as strong as the rocks. My body is not made of metal." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## Is it not true that I have no help in myself? ##

AT: "It is true that I have no strength left." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## wisdom has been driven out of me ##

"my success has been taken from me" or "or "inner strength has been driven out of me" This passive clause can be written as an active clause: "My inner strength is gone." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
