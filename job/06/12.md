# Is my strength the strength of stones? Or is my flesh made of bronze?

Job describes the weakness of his body by saying that he is not as strong as rocks and bronze to emphasize his lack of strength. These rhetorical questions may be written as statements. Alternate translation: "I am not as strong as the rocks. My flesh is not as strong as metal." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
