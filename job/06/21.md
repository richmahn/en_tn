# General Information:

In these verses, Job poses four questions to rebuke his friends and to emphasize that he did not ask for help from any of them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# For now

Job uses this phrase to introduce the main part of what he is saying.

# you friends are nothing to me

"you friends have not helped me at all"

# are afraid

This means that they see the trouble Job has and are afraid of being in the same situation. AT: "you are afraid that God might do similar things to you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
