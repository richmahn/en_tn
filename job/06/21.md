# General Information:

In these verses, Job poses four questions to rebuke his friends and to emphasize that he did not ask for help from any of them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# For now

Job uses this phrase to introduce the main part of what he is saying.

# you friends are nothing to me

"you friends have not helped me at all"

# are afraid

This means that they see the trouble Job has and are afraid of being in the same situation. AT: "you are afraid that God might do similar things to you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# Did I say to you, 'Give something to me?' Or, 'Offer me a gift from your wealth?' Or, 'Save me from my adversary's hand?' Or, 'Ransom me from the hand of my oppressors?'

Job uses rhetorical questions to emphasize that he did not ask his friends to give him anything or to help him. AT: "I did ask you to give me money or a gift. Nor did I ask you to save me from my adversary or oppressors." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Save me from my adversary's hand ... Ransom me from the hand of my oppressors

Both of these statements mean the same thing. Also, here "hand" represents power or control. AT: "Save me from my adversary or my oppressors" or "Save me from my adversary" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# Ransom me

"Rescue me"
