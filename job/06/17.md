# When they thaw out, they vanish ... when it is hot, they melt out of their place

These two phrases have the same meaning. They describe how the streambed dries up in the hot season. Alternate translation: "When it is hot, the ice melts and the streambeds dry up" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
