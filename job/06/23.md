# Did I say to you, 'Give something to me?' Or, 'Offer me a gift from your wealth?' Or, 'Save me from my adversary's hand?' Or, 'Ransom me from the hand of my oppressors?'

Job uses rhetorical questions to emphasize that he did not ask his friends to give him anything or to help him. AT: "I did ask you to give me money or a gift. Nor did I ask you to save me from my adversary or oppressors." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Save me from my adversary's hand ... Ransom me from the hand of my oppressors

Both of these statements mean the same thing. Also, here "hand" represents power or control. AT: "Save me from my adversary or my oppressors" or "Save me from my adversary" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# Ransom me

"Rescue me"
