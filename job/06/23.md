# or, 'Save me from my adversary's hand' or, 'Ransom me from the hand of my oppressors'?

These words are the last of a series of rhetorical questions that begins in verse 22. Job uses these questions to emphasize that he has not asked his friends to give him anything or to help him. "I never said to you, 'Give ... me' or, 'Offer ... wealth' or, 'Save ... hand' or, 'Ransom ... oppressors'." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# my adversary's hand ... the hand of my oppressors

The word  "hand" represents power or control. Alternate translation: "having my adversary control me ... having my oppressors control me" or "my adversary's power ... my oppressors' power" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# Ransom me

"Rescue me"
