## if only my anguish were weighed; if only all my calamity were laid in the balance! ##

Here the writer uses two different statements to convey a single idea, the burden of Job's suffering.  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## in the balance ##

"on a scale"

## For now it would be heavier than the sand of the seas ##

Job compares the burden of his suffering to the weight of wet sand; both can crush a person.  "The burden of my anguish and troubles is heavier than the sand on the seashore."  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
