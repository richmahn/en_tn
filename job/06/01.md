# if only my anguish were weighed; if only all my calamity were laid in the balance

Here the writer uses two different statements to convey a single idea, the burden of Job's suffering. This can be stated in active form. AT: "if only I could weigh my anguish and all my calamities in the balance" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# in the balance

"on a scale"

# For now it would be heavier than the sand of the seas

Job compares the burden of his suffering to the weight of wet sand; both can crush a person. AT: "For my anguish and calamities would be heavier than the sand on the seashore" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# my words were reckless

"I spoke recklessly" or "I spoke rashly"
