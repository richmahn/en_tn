The writer continues to use parallelism in each of these verses, conveying a single idea using two different statements to emphasize Job's intense suffering as the grounds for his complaint. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## For the arrows of the Almighty are in me ##

This is a metaphor for Job's suffering. He compares his many troubles to arrows that pierce his body. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]]).

## my spirit drinks up the poison ##

The metaphor continues.  Suffering has penetrated Job to his core. AT: "I feel the pain to my very core."  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]]).

## The terrors of God have arranged themselves in array against me ##

AT: "All the awful things that could happened have come against me at one time."

## in array ##

"like an army regiment" or "like a band of soldiers"

## Does the wild donkey bray in despair when he has grass? Or does the ox low in hunger when it has fodder? ##

Job poses these questions to emphasize that he has good reason to complain.  AT: "Would I be complaining if everything was all right?" or "I would not complain without reason." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## bray ##

the sound a donkey makes

## low ##

the sound an ox makes

## fodder ##

animal food

## Can that which has no taste be eaten without salt? Or is there any taste in the white of an egg? ##

Even the food, or circumstances, in Job's life are painful. Job compares his life to a meal that has no seasoning or flavor.  "My life has no savor; it is like the tasteless white of an egg." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## Can that which has no taste be eaten ##

This passive question can be translated as an active statement: "A person cannot eat bad tasting food without salt."  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
