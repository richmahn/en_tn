## translationNotes

* The writer continues to use parallelism in each of these verses, conveying a single idea using two different statements to emphasize Job's intense suffering as the grounds for his complaint. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
* **For the arrows of the Almighty are in me** - This is a metaphor for Job's suffering. He compares his many troubles to arrows that pierce his body. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]).
* **my spirit drinks up the poison** - The metaphor continues.  Suffering has penetrated Job to his core. AT: "I feel the pain to my very core."  (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]).
* **The terrors of God have arranged themselves in array against me** - AT: "All the awful things that could happened have come against me at one time."
* **in array** - "like an army regiment" or "like a band of soldiers"
* **Does the wild donkey bray in despair when he has grass? Or does the ox low in hunger when it has fodder?** - Job poses these questions to emphasize that he has good reason to complain.  AT: "Would I be complaining if everything was all right?" or "I would not complain without reason." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **bray** - the sound a donkey makes
* **low** - the sound an ox makes
* **fodder** - animal food
* **Can that which has no taste be eaten without salt? Or is there any taste in the white of an egg?** - Even the food, or circumstances, in Job's life are painful. Job compares his life to a meal that has no seasoning or flavor.  "My life has no savor; it is like the tasteless white of an egg." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **Can that which has no taste be eaten** - This passive question can be translated as an active statement: "A person cannot eat bad tasting food without salt."  (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
