# General Information:

The writer continues to use parallelism in each of these verses, conveying a single idea using two different statements to emphasize Job's intense suffering as the grounds for his complaint. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# For the arrows of the Almighty are in me

This is a metaphor for Job's suffering. He compares his many troubles to arrows that that God has shot his body with. AT: "It is as though the Almighty has shot arrows into my body" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# my spirit drinks up the poison

"my spirit drinks up the arrows' poison." This continues the metaphor of the arrows, by implying that they had tips of poison and that Job feels the pain in his spirit. He speaks of feeling this pain as if his spirit drank the poison. AT: "I feel the pain of their poison in my inner being" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the terrors of God have arranged themselves in array against me

Job speaks of the terrible things that have happened to him as if they were soldiers that God had lined up to attack him all at once. AT: "God has caused all the terrible things that could happen to happen to me all at once" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# the terrors of God have arranged themselves in array against me

God causing many things to terrify Job is spoken of as if God's terrors were soldiers lined up to attack Job. AT: "the terrors of God have arranged themselves like soldiers in an army" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
