# Job 36 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

According to Elihu, instead of being punished for his sins, Job is sinning in the midst of these difficulties. This is the last of Elihu's four statements and it is addressed first to Job's friends and then to Job. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]] and  [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/witness]])

The ULB indents the lines of this chapter because it is a poem. His attitude is not too different from Job's friends.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Yahweh's justice #####
This chapter focuses on the justice of Yahweh. It is important to remember that justice won't always come in this life. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/justice]])
