# they see those deeds only from far away

# See

"Indeed." The word "See" here adds emphasis to what follows.

# the number of his years is incalculable

This refers to how long God has existed. AT: "people cannot know how long he has lived" or "people cannot know his age" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
