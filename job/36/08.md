# If they are bound in chains

Here the word "they" refers righteous people whom God will discipline if they sin. This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "If someone binds them in chains" or "If someone makes them a prisoner" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# trapped in cords of suffering
