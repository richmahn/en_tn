# Can your wealth benefit you, so that you will not be in distress, or can all the force of your strength help you?

Elihu asks these questions to state that money and power will not be able to help Job if he acts unjustly. AT: "Your wealth cannot cause you to no longer be in distress, and all the force of your strength cannot help you." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# all the force of your strength

"all of your great strength" or "all of your mighty efforts"

# when peoples are cut off in their place

Possible meanings are 1) that "peoples" refers to people in general and "cut off in their place" is a metaphor for oppressing others by dragging them away from their homes. AT: "when people drag others away from their homes" or 2) that "peoples" represents nations and "cut off in their place" is a metaphor for nations being destroyed. AT: "when nations will perish" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
