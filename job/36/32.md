# He fills his hands with the lightning

Elihu speaks of the lightning that storms cause as if God were holding the lightning in his hand and directing it to strike where he wills. Possible meanings are 1) that God holds the lightning bolts in his hands in order to throw them, or 2) that God hides the lightning bolts in his hands until he is ready to use them.
