# my words will not be false

"what I say will not be false"

# someone who is mature in knowledge is with you

The word "someone" refers to Elihu himself. He speaks of being very knowledgeable as if it were being mature in knowledge. Alternate translation: "I, who am with you, am very knowledgeable" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
