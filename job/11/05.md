# that God would speak ... open his lips against you

The words "open his lips" are a metonym that means speak. These two phrases mean the same thing and are used together to emphasize Zophar's desire that God would speak harshly against Job. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
