# My beliefs are pure

"My understanding is correct"

# I am blameless in your eyes

The eyes represent sight, which is a metaphor for God's evaluation of Job. Possible meanings are 1) that Job is saying that God judges him as blameless. AT: "You say that I am blameless" or 2) that Job believes he has been blameless and that God should judge him as blameless. AT: "You should recognize that I am blameless" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
