# Job 32 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Job's friends give up on trying to convince him that he is being punished for sinning. This chapter introduces Elihu who was a witness to these interactions between Job and his friends. According to Elihu, instead of being punished for his sins, Job is sinning in the midst of these difficulties. This is the first of Elihu's four statements. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]] and  [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/witness]])

Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers, or songs. The ULB and many other English translations set the lines of 32:6-22, which is an extended quotation, farher to the right on the page than the rest of the text. This quotation continues through the next chapter.
