# my breast is like fermenting wine that has no vent; like new wineskins, it is ready to burst

While wine is fermenting, gas collects in the container. If the gas is not let out the container will burst. Elihu means that he has so much to say that if he does not speak he feels like he will burst. Also, these two phrases are parallel and have the same meaning. Alternate translation: "I feel like my breast is about to burst, like a container of fermenting wine that has no vent" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# my breast is

This represents Elihu, specifically his spirit. Alternate translation: "my spirit is" or "I am" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
