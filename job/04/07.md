## translationNotes

* **Think about this, I beg you** - "Please recall"
* **who has ever perished when innocent?** - Eliphaz uses this question to prompt Job to search his life for sin (and God's righteous judgment) as the cause of his loss. AT: "No one has ever perished when innocent." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **when was the upright person ever cut off?** - This question has the same purpose as the previous question.  AT: "Who has ever perished when innocent?" or "No one has ever cut off an upright person." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
* **plow iniquity … sow trouble … reap** - The words "plow," "sow," and "reap" are agricultural terms used figuratively here to suggest that people sometimes bring trouble upon themselves through their choices and actions.
* **By the breath of God they perish; by the blast of his anger they are consumed** - The writer explains a single idea using two different statements. This is a form of Hebrew poetry used for emphasis, clarity, teaching, or all three. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
