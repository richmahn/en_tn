# Who has ever perished when innocent?

Eliphaz uses this question to prompt Job to search his life for sin (and God's righteous judgment) as the cause of his loss. Alternate translation: "No one has ever perished when innocent." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# when were the upright people ever cut off

This question also means to make a statement, and may be put into active form. Alternate translation: "No one has ever cut off an upright person" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# cut off

Here being cut off represents being destroyed. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
