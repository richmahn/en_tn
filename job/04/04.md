# General Information:

The writer uses parallelism in each of these verses to make one idea using two different statements to emphasize 1) the support that Job has given others in the past, 2) the effect on him of his present troubles, and 3) his piety before God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# supported

Someone who has been encouraged is spoken of as if he were kept from falling down. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# falling

# you have made feeble knees firm
