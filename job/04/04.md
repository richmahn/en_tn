The writer uses parallelism in each of these verses make one idea using two different statements to emphasize 1) the support that Job has given others in the past, 2) the effect on him of his present troubles, and 3) his piety before God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## supported ##

"held up" like catching someone from falling to the ground when they stumble on a rock

## falling ##

"stumbling"

## you have made feeble knees firm ##

"you encouraged others when they were in extreme sorrow."

## But now trouble has come to you ##

"But now you suffer from disasters"

## you faint ##

"you are emotionally weak"

## your fear of God ##

"your piety"

## Is not your fear of God your confidence; is not the integrity of your ways your hope? ##

Eliphaz asks these questions to make Job consider that the cause of his suffering is sin in his life despite his piety and integrity.  AT: "Your piety is your confidence. The integrity of your ways is your hope." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
