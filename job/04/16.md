## translationNotes

* The writer uses parallelism in verse 17, conveying a single idea using two different statements to emphasize a question about the purity of man before God.  (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
* **The spirit stood still** - "It stood still," with "it" referring to the "someone" or the "spirit" or the "ghost" in [[en:bible:notes:job:04:12]] and [[en:bible:notes:job:04:14]].
* **and I heard** - "then I heard"
* **Can a mortal man be more righteous than God?** - Eliphaz poses this question so that Job will consider, "Do I regard myself as more righteous than God?" or "Am I justified before God?" AT: "A mortal man cannot be more righteous than God" or "A mortal man cannot be righteous before God." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **be more righteous than God** - AT: "be righteous before God" or "be justified before God"
* **Can a man be more pure than his Maker?** - This question has the same purpose as the previous question. AT: "A man cannot be more pure than his Maker" or "A man cannot be pure before his Maker."
* **Maker** - "Creator"
