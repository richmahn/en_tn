# General Information:

The writer uses parallelism in verse 17, conveying a single idea using two different statements to emphasize a question about the purity of man before God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# A form was before my eyes

"Something was before my eyes," "I saw something"

# and I heard

"then I heard"
