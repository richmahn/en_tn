# General Information:

The writer uses parallelism in verse 17, conveying a single idea using two different statements to emphasize a question about the purity of man before God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# A form was before my eyes

"Something was before my eyes," "I saw something"

# and I heard

# Can a mortal man be more righteous than God?

Eliphaz poses this question so that Job will consider, "Do I regard myself as more righteous than God?" or "Am I justified before God?" AT: "A mortal man cannot be more righteous than God." or "A mortal man cannot be righteous before God." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Can a man be more pure than his Maker?

This question has the same purpose as the previous question. AT: "A man cannot be more pure than his Maker." or "A man cannot be pure before his Maker." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
