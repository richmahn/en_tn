# General Information:

The writer uses parallelism in these verses, conveying a single idea using different statements to emphasize God's destruction of wicked people. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# The roaring of the lion, the voice of the fierce lion, the teeth of the young lionsâ€”they are broken.

Here a lion's roar, his voice, and his teeth being broken are used as pictures of the wicked being destroyed. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# they are broken

This may be put into active form. Alternate translation: "something breaks them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
