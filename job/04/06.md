# your fear

"the fact that you honor God"

# Is not your fear your confidence, and the integrity of your ways your hope?

Eliphaz asks these questions in order to tell Job that it is because of his sin that he is suffering. Alternate translation: "Everyone thinks that you honor God; everyone thinks that you are an honest man. But these things must not be true, because you do not trust God any longer." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# your fear

Eliphaz means Job's fear of God. Alternate translation: "your fear of God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# your ways

Here "your ways" represents "your conduct," "how you behave." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
