# Connecting Statement:

This concludes Eliphaz's speech to Job.

# the one with lowered eyes

Here "lowered eyes" refers to humility. AT: "the humble person" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# He will rescue even the man who is not innocent; who will be rescued through the cleanness of your hands

Job being innocent is spoken of as if his hands were physically clean. The phrase "who will be rescued" can be stated in active form. AT: "Yahweh will rescue even the person who is not innocent because you do what is right" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# He will rescue even the man who is not innocent; who will be rescued through the cleanness of your hands

Some versions of the Bible read, "He rescues the innocent person; so he will rescue you when your hands are clean"
