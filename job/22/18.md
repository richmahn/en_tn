# Connecting Statement:

Eliphaz continues speaking to Job.

# Yet he filled

"Yet God filled"

# the plans of wicked people are far from me

The idiom "far from me" means Eliphaz rejects them. AT: "but I will not listen to their wicked plans" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# see their fate

"know what will happen to the wicked"

# laugh them to scorn

"mock the wicked people"

# They say

"The righteous say"

# Surely those who rose up against us are cut off

Here "those who rose up" refers to the wicked people. This can be stated in active form. AT: "Surely God has destroyed the wicked people who harmed us" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
