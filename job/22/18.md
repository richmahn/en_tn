Eliphaz continues speaking to Job.

## the plans of wicked people are far from me ##

AT: "but I will not listen to their wicked plans"

## see their fate ##

AT: "know what will happen to the wicked"

## laugh them to scorn ##

AT: "mock the wicked people"

## those who rose up against us are cut off ##

AT: "God has destroyed those who harmed us" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
