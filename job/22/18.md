# Connecting Statement:

Eliphaz continues speaking to Job.

# Yet he filled

"Yet God filled"

# the plans of wicked people are far from me

The idiom "far from me" means Eliphaz rejects them. Alternate translation: "but I will not listen to their wicked plans" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
