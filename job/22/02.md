# Can a man be useful to God? Can a wise man be useful to him?

Both questions mean basically the same thing. Eliphaz uses questions to emphasize that a person's actions and wisdom do not benefit God. AT: "A man cannot be useful to God. A wise man cannot be useful to him." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
