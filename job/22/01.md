# Eliphaz the Temanite

See how you translated this man's name in [Job 2:11](../02/11.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# Can a man be useful to God? Can a wise man be useful to him?

Both questions mean basically the same thing. Eliphaz uses questions to emphasize that a person's actions and wisdom do not benefit God. AT: "A man cannot be useful to God. A wise man cannot be useful to him." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Is it any pleasure to the Almighty if you are righteous? Is it gain to him if you make your ways blameless?

Both of these statements mean the same thing. Eliphaz uses questions to emphasize that Job's actions do not help God. AT: "The Almighty does not receive any pleasure if you are righteous. He does not gain anything if you make your ways blameless." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
