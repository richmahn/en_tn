## Eliphaz the Temanite ##

See how you translated this in [Job 2:11](../02/11.md).

## Can a man be useful to God? Can a wise man be useful to him? ##

Eliphaz uses questions to emphasize that a person's actions or wisdom do not benefit God.  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## Is it any pleasure to the Almighty if you are righteous? Is it gain to him if you make your ways perfect? ##

Both of these statements mean the same thing. Eliphaz uses questions again for emphasis. AT: "It does not benefit God if you are perfectly righteous" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
