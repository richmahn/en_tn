# Connecting Statement:

Eliphaz continues speaking to Job.

# Is it because of your reverence for him that he rebukes you and takes you to judgment?

Eliphaz uses questions to scold Job and accuse him of committing terrible sins. Alternate translation: "It is certainly not because you have been devoted to him that God rebukes you and takes you to judgment!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
