# Connecting Statement:

Eliphaz continues speaking to Job.

# Is not God in the heights of heaven?

Eliphaz uses this question to say that God sees Job's sin and will judge him. AT: "God is in the heights of heaven and sees everything that happens on earth." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# Look at the height of the stars, how high they are!

Eliphaz implies that God is higher than the stars. This can be made explicit. AT: "Look at how high the stars are. God is even higher than the stars!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# What does God know? Can he judge through the thick darkness?

Eliphaz uses these questions to imply that Job has said these things against God. AT: "God does not know what happens on earth. He sits in dark clouds and cannot see to judge us." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# he walks on the vault of heaven

Here "vault" refers to the barrier that ancient people believed separated the earth from heaven. AT: "he lives too far away in heaven to see what happens here" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
