# Connecting Statement:

Eliphaz continues speaking to Job.

# Is not God in the heights of heaven?

Eliphaz uses this question to say that God sees Job's sin and will judge him. Alternate translation: "God is in the heights of heaven and sees everything that happens on earth." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# Look at the height of the stars, how high they are!

Eliphaz implies that God is higher than the stars. This can be made explicit. Alternate translation: "Look at how high the stars are. God is even higher than the stars!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
