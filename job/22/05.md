# Is it because of your reverence for him that he rebukes you and takes you to judgment? Is not your wickedness great? Is there no end to your iniquities?

Eliphaz uses questions to scold Job and accuse him of committing terrible sins. Alternate translation: "It is certainly not because you have been devoted to him that God rebukes you and takes you to judgment! No, as you know, he judges you because your wickedness is great and you keep on sinning!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
