# it will be confirmed for you

This can be stated in active form. AT: "God will cause you to succeed" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# light will shine on your paths

God's blessing is compared to a light on all of Job's paths. AT: "it will be like a light shining on the road in front of you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
