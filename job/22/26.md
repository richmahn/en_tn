Eliphaz continues speaking to Job.

## you will lift up your face to God ##

This means Job will no longer be ashamed but will trust in God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

## it will be confirmed for you ##

AT: "God will cause you to succeed" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## light will shine on your ways ##

This means God will bless all that Job does. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
