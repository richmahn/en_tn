# Connecting Statement:

Eliphaz continues speaking to Job.

# You have sent widows away empty

"You made widows go away with nothing"

# widows

women whose husbands have died

# the arms of the fatherless have been broken

Here "arms" refer to power. This can be stated in active form. AT: "you even oppressed orphans" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
