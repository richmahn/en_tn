Eliphaz continues speaking to Job.

## You have sent widows away empty ##

"You made widows go away with nothing"

## widows ##

women whose husbands have died

## the arms of the fatherless have been broken ##

Here "arms" refer to power. AT: "You even oppressed orphans" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## snares are all around you...there is darkness...an abundance of water ##

All of these mean that there are troubles and dangers all around Job because of his sin. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
