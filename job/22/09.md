# Connecting Statement:

Eliphaz continues speaking to Job.

# You have sent widows away empty

"You made widows go away with nothing"

# widows

women whose husbands have died

# the arms of the fatherless have been broken

Here "arms" refer to power. This can be stated in active form. AT: "you even oppressed orphans" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# snares are all around you ... There is darkness ... an abundance of waters covers you

Each of these metaphors means troubles and dangers are all around Job because of his sin. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# an abundance of waters

"a flood"
