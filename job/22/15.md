Eliphaz continues speaking to Job.

## Will you keep the old way that wicked men have walked ##

AT: "Will you continue to do the things that evil people do"

## those who were snatched away ##

AT: "those who died" or "those whom God took away" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## those whose foundations have washed away like a river ##

This means the wicked people thought they were safe and secure but God destroyed them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

## What can the Almighty do to us? ##

Eliphaz quotes the wicked people who use this question to mock God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
