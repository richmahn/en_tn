# Connecting Statement:

Eliphaz continues speaking to Job.

# you will be built up

Eliphaz compares Job's restoration to the rebuilding of a house that has fallen. This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "he will heal you and make you prosper again" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# if you put unrighteousness far away from your tents

Unrighteousness is pictured as a person who is living in Job's tent who must be removed. Alternate translation: "if you and everyone in your house stops sinning" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
