Eliphaz continues speaking to Job.

## you will be built up ##

Eliphaz compares Job's restoration to a person rebuilding a house that has fallen. AT: "he will heal you and make you prosper again" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## if you put unrighteousness far away from your tents ##

"if you and everyone in your house stops sinning"

## Lay your treasure down in the dust ##

AT: "Let your riches be treated as unimportant as dust". (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

## Ophir ##

This is the name of a region famous for its gold. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

## and the Almighty will be your treasure, precious silver to you ##

This means God will be a great joy to Job. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
