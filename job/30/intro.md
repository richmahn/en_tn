# Job 30 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

The ULB indents the lines of this chapter because it is a poem. This chapter is a continuation of Job's statement, but now it is directly addressed to Yahweh. 

In this chapter, Job laments his current condition as others insult him. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lament]])
