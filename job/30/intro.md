# Job 30 General Notes

#### Structure and formatting

The ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is a poem. This chapter is a continuation of Job's statement, but now it is directly addressed to Yahweh.

In this chapter, Job laments his current condition as others insult him. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lament]])
