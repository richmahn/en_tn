# God has unstrung the string to my bow

A bow that is unstrung is not useful. The phrase "has unstrung the string of my bow" is a metaphor for making Job powerless. AT: "God has taken away my power to defend myself" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# those who taunt me

"those who mock me"

# cast off restraint before my face

A restraint keeps a person from moving freely and doing what he wants. Here "restraint" represents refraining from doing something, and "cast off restraint" represents not refraining from doing something. In this case the mockers did not refrain from being cruel to Job. AT: "do not refrain from being cruel to me" or "do whatever cruel things they want to do to me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
