## translationNotes

* **does no one reach out ... does no one in trouble call out ... Did I not weep ... Did I not grieve** - All of these questions can be put into the form of statements (see UDB). Job asks these questions, expecting affirmative ("yes") responses. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **I waited for light ... darkness came** - Here "light" represents God's blessing and favor and "darkness" represents trouble and suffering. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
