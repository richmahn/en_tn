Bildad continues speaking to Job.

## Indeed, the light...his lamp above him will be put out ##

Bildad uses these images to say that the wicked will experience sudden and complete disaster or death. Light represent prosperity, joy, and life. Darkness poverty, sorrow, and death. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## will be put out ##

"will go out" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## The light will be dark ##

AT: "The light will turn into darkness"
