# Terrors will make him afraid on every side

"Terrors all around will make him afraid"

# they will chase him at his heels

This speaks of the things that terrify the wicked person as if they were enemies who chased him. AT: "it will be as if the terrors will chase him all around" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
