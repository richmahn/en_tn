# General Information:

Bildad continues to describe the wicked person.

# His roots will be dried up ... branch be cut off

This speaks of the wicked man dying and having no descendants as if he were a tree whose roots dried up and branches withered, producing no fruit. Alternate translation: "He will die and leave no descendants, he will be like a tree whose roots have dried up and whose branches have all withered" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# will his branch be cut off

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "his branches will wither" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
