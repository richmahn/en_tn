Bildad continues to describe the wicked person.

## His roots will be dried up...branch be cut off ##

This compares a wicked person to a sick tree that looses its roots and branches. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## His memory will perish...no name in the street ##

These phrases are used together to emphasize the fact that nobody will remember him anymore. AT: "Everybody in the world will forget about him." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
