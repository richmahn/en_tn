# General Information:

Bildad continues to speak and uses three parallel images to describe how suddenly the wicked person will experience disaster. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# A trap will take him ... a snare will ... A noose is ... and a trap for him in the way

These four phrases speak of the wicked man experiencing disaster as if he were caught in a trap. AT: "It will be as though a trap will take him ... a snare will ... A noose is ... and a trap for him in the way" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# A trap

People used this kind of trap to catch birds. The trap snapped shut and held on to the foot of the bird.

# will take him by the heel

Here the "heel" refers to the whole foot. AT: "will take hold of his foot" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
