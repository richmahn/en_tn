Bildad continues speaking to Job.

## Why are we regarded as beasts ##

AT: "You should not think that we are like animals." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## Why are we ##

The word "we" probably refers to Bildad and Job's other friends.

## why have we become stupid in your sight ##

AT: "We are not stupid like you think we are."

## stupid ##

Possible meanings are 1) dumb or 2) unclean.

## You who tear at yourself in your anger ##

See how you translated a similar phrase in [Job 16:9](../16/09.md). Here, Bildad says that it is not God who tore Job in his wrath, but rather it is Job who tore himself in his own wrath.

## should the earth be forsaken for you ##

This phrase suggests that letting a guilty man go free would be like changing the laws of nature. AT: "Asking God to let a guilty man go free is as silly as asking him to change the entire order of the world." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## should the earth be forsaken ##

AT: "should everyone leave the earth?" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## should the rocks be removed out of their places ##

AT: "should God move mountains around?"
