## translationNotes

* Bildad continues speaking to Job.
* **Why are we regarded as beasts** - AT: "You should not think that we are like animals." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **Why are we** - The word "we" probably refers to Bildad and Job's other friends.
* **why have we become stupid in your sight** - AT: "We are not stupid like you think we are."
* **stupid** - Possible meanings are 1) dumb or 2) unclean.
* **You who tear at yourself in your anger** - See how you translated a similar phrase in [[en:bible:notes:job:16:09]]. Here, Bildad says that it is not God who tore Job in his wrath, but rather it is Job who tore himself in his own wrath.
* **should the earth be forsaken for you
* This phrase suggests that letting a guilty man go free would be like changing the laws of nature. AT: "Asking God to let a guilty man go free is as silly as asking him to change the entire order of the world." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **should the earth be forsaken** - AT: "should everyone leave the earth?" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
* **should the rocks be removed out of their places** - AT: "should God move mountains around?"
