# General Information:

Bildad continues speaking to Job.

# Why are we regarded as beasts, stupid in your sight?

Bildad uses this rhetorical questions to emphasize to Job that he should not consider his friends as animals who cannot think or speak. It can be written as a statement in active form. Alternate translation: "We should not be regarded as beasts, as stupid in your sight." or "You should not regard us as beasts or think of us as stupid." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# Why are we

The word "we" probably refers to Bildad and Job's other friends and so is exclusive. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

# regarded

Regarding, looking, is a metonym here for thinking well or badly of someone. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# in your sight

Here sight represents judgment or evaluation. Alternate translation: "in your judgment" or "in your thinking" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# your sight

The word "your" here is plural. Bildad is using sarcasm to tell Job that Job should not think of himself as a great man. Alternate translation: "your sight, you who wrongly think you are great" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])
