# General Information:

Bildad continues to describe the wicked person.

# He will be driven from light into darkness ... and be chased out of this world

These phrases together emphasize the fact that the wicked person will be sent to Sheol, the place of the dead. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# He will be driven from light into darkness

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "God will drive the wicked person from light into darkness" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# from light into darkness

The word "light" refers to life, and the word "darkness" refers to death. Alternate translation: "from the light of life to the darkness of death" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# be chased out of this world

This speaks of God making him leave earth and go where dead people go as if he were chasing him. Alternate translation: "God will make him leave this world" or "God will send him to the place where dead people go" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
