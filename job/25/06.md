# How much less man ... a son of man, who is a worm

These two lines say the same thing and are used together to emphasize that man is not perfect. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# who is a worm

Bildad states that human beings are as worthless as worms. Alternate translation: "who is as worthless as a worm" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# a son of man

This is another way of referring to a person. Alternate translation: "a person" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
