Bildad continues speaking.

## How then can man ... How can he who is born ... ##

These two questions are used together to emphasize the impossibility of a man being good enough for God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## How then can man be righteous with God? ##

The implicit reaction is that he cannot. AT: "A man can never be righteous for God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## How can he who is born ... acceptable to him? ##

The implicit reaction is that he cannot. AT: "He who is born of a woman cannot be clean or acceptable to him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## clean, acceptable to him ##

AT: "clean—that is, acceptable to him"

## he who is born of a woman ##

AT: "any man" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

## See ##

The word “behold” here adds emphasis to what follows. AT: “Indeed”

## the moon has no brightness to him ##

AT: "the moon is not bright enough for God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

## the stars are not pure in his sight ##

AT: "he does think even the stars are perfect"

## How much less man ... a son of man ... ##

These two lines say the same thing and are used together to emphasize that man is not perfect. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## who is a worm ##

Bildad compares human beings to worms. AT: "who is as worthless as a worm" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## a son of man ##

AT: "a man" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
