# Job 25 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

The ULB sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is a poem. This chapter is a continuation of the advice of Job's friend, Bildad. His words in this chapter are much stronger than when he previously spoke.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### God's holiness and man's sin #####
Bildad describes the holiness of Yahweh and the universal nature of man's sinfulness. While his points are accurate, they are not convincing for Job because he has been righteous. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/holy]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]])

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter ####

##### Rhetorical questions #####
Bildad uses many different rhetorical questions in this chapter in order to try to convince Job that he is wrong. These questions help to build Bildad's argument. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
