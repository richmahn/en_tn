See how you translated this man's name in [Job 2:11](../02/11.md).

# Dominion and fear are with him

Here "him" refers to God. The abstract nouns "dominion" and "fear" can be stated as verbs. AT: "God rules over all and people should fear only him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# he makes order in his high places of heaven

"he makes peace in the high heaven"

# Is there any end to the number of his armies?

Bildad uses this question to emphasize how great God is. The implicit answer is "no." This refers to the armies of God's angels. AT: "There is no end to the number of angels in his army." or "His armies are so big that no one can count them." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# Upon whom does his light not shine?

Bildad uses this question to emphasize that God gives light to every person. AT: "There is no one upon whom his light does not shine." or "God makes his light shine over everyone." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
