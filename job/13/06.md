Job uses these two questions to rebuke his friends for speaking unrighteously. AT: "You think that you are speaking for God, but you are speaking unrighteously. You are speaking deceitfully." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])

# talk deceitfully

"lie" or "tell lies"

# Will you show him partiality ... will you argue the case for God?

Showing kindness to God represents helping God or defending God against Job's complaints. Job uses these questions to rebuke his friends for thinking that they can defend God. AT: "You think that God need you to defend him? You think that you can argue for God like attorneys in court."
