# God, listen carefully

Job begins directing his speech directly to God.

# listen carefully to my speech; let my declaration come to your ears

These two lines mean basically the same thing and intensify Job's request for God to listen to him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# let my declaration come to your ears

The abstract noun "declaration" can be expressed with the verb "declare." The ears represent listening. AT: "listen to my declaration" or "listen to what I declare" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
