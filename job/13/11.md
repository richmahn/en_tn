## Would not his majesty ... dread fall upon you? ##

Job asks these two questions for emphasis and twice over for more emphasis. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## proverbs made of ashes, defenses made of clay ##

Job compares their useless proverbs to ashes and their resistance to the truth to clay. Both statements mean the same for emphasis. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
