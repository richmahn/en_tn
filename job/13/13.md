## translationNotes

* **let come what may on me.** - Job puts his life in Gods hands. AT: "whatever happens to me I will accept."
* **I will take my own flesh...my life in my hands.** - Job is willing to risk his life by arguing his case with God. "Flesh" and "life" refer to his body. "Teeth" and "hands" refer to his ability to take it under his own control. Both lines mean the same for emphasis.
