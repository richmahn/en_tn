## translationNotes

* **I wish to reason with God** - Job's friends are judging and not honest. Job would rather argue with God alone about his complaint.
* **whitewash the truth** - This means to paint over a wall to cover the dirt instead of cleaning it. AT: "cover up the truth with false judgments" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
* **physicians of no value** - Their effort to heal with counsel was false, deceitful, and wrong. Physicians represent the friends who try to make healing. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **hold your peace** - This expression means "be silent". (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
* **be your wisdom** - By being silent they would not say more foolish talk and would be wiser in their silence.
