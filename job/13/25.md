# Will you persecute ... pursue dry stubble?

Job uses these questions to tell God that since Job is so insignificant and weak, it is useless to persecute him. "Leaf" and "stubble" are metaphors describing Job's weakness, insignificance and frailty. Alternate translation: "You persecute me, but I am weak like a leaf blown by the wind and insignificant like dry stubble."
