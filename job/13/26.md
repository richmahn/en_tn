Job finishes presenting his case to God.

## inherit the iniquities of my youth ##

"Inherit" here means to live with the results of his foolish actions while he was young.

## in the stocks ##

"Stocks" are a form of restraint of prisoners by locking their feet in a fixed position so they can not move about.

## all my paths ##

"Path" represents the course of action of his life. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## like a rotten thing that wastes away ##

Job compares his life to something that is decaying. He is slowly dying. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

## like a garment that moths have eaten ##

Job compares himself to clothes that the worms of a moth will eat so these are no good because of holes in it. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
