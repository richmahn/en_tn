# If it is not so, who can prove me to be a liar; who can make my speech worth nothing?

Job uses this question to express the certainty of his argument. The implicit answer is: "no one." Alternate translation: "This is true, and no one can prove that I am a liar; no one can prove me wrong." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# make my speech worth nothing

"prove what I say is wrong"
