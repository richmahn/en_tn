# rebel against the light

Possible meanings of "light" are 1) visible light or 2) spiritual light, which refers to God or living righteously. AT: "hate the daylight" or "do not want to do things openly" or "rebel against God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# they know not its ways, nor do they stay in its paths

These two lines describe the same thing, and are used together to emphasize that they do not want to follow the ways of the light. AT: "they do not know how to live a moral life; they stay far away from living a righteous life" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
