# Connecting Statement:

Job continues speaking.

# like foam on the surface of the waters

Foam lasts only a short time. This emphasizes how quickly God will cause the wicked to disappear. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# their portion of the land is cursed

This can be stated in active form. AT: "God curses the part of the land that they own" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# As drought and heat melt away ... those who have sinned

Job says that sinners will disappear in Sheol in the same way as snow melts and disappears when it becomes warm. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# drought and heat

These two words describe essentially the same weather and are used together to describe it fully. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
