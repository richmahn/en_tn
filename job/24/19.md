# As drought and heat melt away ... those who have sinned

Job says that sinners will disappear in Sheol in the same way as snow melts and disappears when it becomes warm. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# drought and heat

These two words describe essentially the same weather and are used together to describe it fully. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
