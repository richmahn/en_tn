# Connecting Statement:

Job continues speaking.

# by his power

"by using his power" or "because he is powerful"

# he rises up and does not strengthen them in life

Here "does not strengthen them in life" means God does not keep them alive. Alternate translation: "God rises up and does not give wicked people the strength to live" or "God rises up and causes them to die" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
