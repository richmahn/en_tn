# orphans from their mothers' breast

Here "breast" refers to the mother. This implies that these orphans are still very young. This can be made explicit. Alternate translation: "young orphans out of their mothers' arms" or "fatherless infants from their mothers" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# orphans

This generally refers to children without parents. Here, however, it is used for children who have mothers but do not have fathers.

# take children as security from poor people

"take poor people's children to guarantee that the poor people will pay back money that they borrowed from the wicked people"

# as security

A lender would take something from a borrower to ensure that the borrower pays him back. See how you translated this in [Job 24:3](./03.md).
