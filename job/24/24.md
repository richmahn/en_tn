# Connecting Statement:

This concludes Job's speech.

# they will be brought low

This can be stated in active form. AT: "God will bring them low" or "God will destroy them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# they will be gathered up like all the others

Some translations are based on a different early text, which says "they wither and fade like weeds." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])

# they will be gathered up like all the others

This can be stated in active form. What "the others" refers to can be stated clearly. AT: "God will gather them up as he gathered up the other wicked people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# they will be cut off like the tops of ears of grain

These wicked people will be cut off in the same way heads of grain are cut off during harvest. This can be stated in active form. AT: "God will cut them off like a farmer cuts off the top of a stalk of grain" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# If it is not so, who can prove me to be a liar; who can make my speech worth nothing?

Job uses this question to express the certainty of his argument. The implicit answer is: "no one." AT: "This is true, and no one can prove that I am a liar; no one can prove me wrong." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# make my speech worth nothing

"prove what I say is wrong"
