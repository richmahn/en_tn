# they will be gathered up like all the others

This can be stated in active form. What "the others" refers to can be stated clearly. Alternate translation: "God will gather them up as he gathered up the other wicked people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
