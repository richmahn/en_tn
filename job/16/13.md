# His archers surround me all around

Job speaks of himself being the focus of God's attacks as if God has set him up as a target and God had archers surrounding him to attack him. AT: "It is as though his archers have me surrounded" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# God pierces my kidneys and does not spare me; he pours out my bile on the ground

Job speaks of the pain he is feeling by comparing it to God piercing his body with arrows. Here "God" represents the arrows that he shoots. AT: "It feels like God's arrows have pierced my kidneys and my liver, spilling my bile on the ground. He does not spare me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
