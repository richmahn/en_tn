# Earth, do not cover up my blood

Jobs speaks to the "earth" directly even though it cannot hear him, to add strength to his statement. The earth is personified as purposefully covering up his blood after he dies. Alternate translation: "I wish my blood would not soak into the ground but that it would remain on top of the ground as proof of how I died" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# Earth, do not cover up my blood

Job speaks of himself dying as if he would be murdered. Here his "blood" is a metonym referring to his death. Alternate translation: "Earth, when I die, do not hide how I died unfairly" or "Let it not be hidden how I died unfairly" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# let my cry have no resting place

Job speaks of wanting everyone to know what happened to him as if his "cry" were a person that never stopped testifying to what happened to him and never rested. Alternate translation: "let everyone hear about what has happened to me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
