# on my eyelids is the shadow of death

Here Job's eyes are represented by his "eyelids." Job speaks of his eyes' dark appearance as if his eyes looked like the eyes of a dead person. AT: "there are dark circles around my eyes" or "my eyes are dark, like the eyes of a dead person" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
