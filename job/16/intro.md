# Job 16 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

The ULB sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is a poem. This chapter is Job's response to Eliphaz.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Job's response #####
Job expresses shock and disgust at the advice Eliphaz gives to him. He even mocks Eliphaz. He describes the difficulties of his circumstances but never curses Yahweh. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/curse]])

##### Advocate #####
Job describes the need for someone to intercede for him in heaven. This person would be his advocate and provide a witness for him. Although this is probably not intended as a prophecy, it closely parallels the way Jesus intercedes for people in heaven. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/intercede]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/heaven]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/witness]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]])
