# grief

Job has experienced great loss of family and health that is unexplained and therefore causes him "great sorrow and emotional pain."

# how am I helped?

Job uses this rhetorical question to express that keeping quiet does not lessen his grief. This question can be written as a statement. Alternate translation: "it does not help me at all." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
