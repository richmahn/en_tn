## I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul ##

Job conveys a single idea using two different statements to emphasize the reason he will not remain silent. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## I will not restrain my mouth ##

"I will not stop talking"

## the anguish of my spirit ##

"the torment of my spirit" or "the agony of my suffering"

## the bitterness of my soul ##

"the resentment of my soul"

## Am I the sea or a sea monster, that you place a guard over me? ##

Job poses this question to express his anger at God.  In comparing himself to the sea or a sea monster, Job suggests that God regards him as a hideous creature. "I am not the sea or a sea monster that needs a guard to watch it."  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
