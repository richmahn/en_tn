# General Information:

The writer continues to use parallelism in each of these verses, conveying a single idea using two different statements to emphasize Job's sense of the shortness of life. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle

Job compares his lifetime to the quickness of a weaver's shuttle. AT: "My life goes by very quickly" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# weaver

a person who makes cloth by crossing threads or yarn

# a weaver's shuttle

a moving part that carries thread or yarn back and forth quickly in a loom when making cloth

# call to mind

"remember." The phrase "call to mind" does not mean God forgot. Job is asking God to consider or think about the shortness of Job's life.

# my life is only a breath

Job compares the shortness of his life to the shortness of a breath. AT: "my life is very short, like taking one breath" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# my eye will no more see good

Here "my eye" represents Job's whole person and his ability to see or experience things. AT: "I will never again experience good things" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
