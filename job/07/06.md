## translationNotes

* The writer continues to use parallelism in each of these verses, conveying a single idea using two different statements to emphasize Job's sense of the shortness of life. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
* **My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle** - "My life goes by very quickly"
* **weaver** - a person who makes cloth by crossing threads or yarn
* **a weaver's shuttle** - a moving part that goes back and forth very fast in a machine or apparatus for making cloth
* **they pass without hope** - "they come to an end with absolutely no hope"
* **God, call to mind** - The word "God" was added to this phrase because the people who heard "call to mind" would have understood that God was addressed.  (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]]).
* **my life is only a breath** - In this metaphor, Job compares the shortness of his life to the shortness of a breath.  "My life is very short like taking one breath" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]).
* **my eye will no more see good** - "I will never again experience happiness."
