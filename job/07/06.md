The writer continues to use parallelism in each of these verses, conveying a single idea using two different statements to emphasize Job's sense of the shortness of life. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle ##

"My life goes by very quickly"

## weaver ##

a person who makes cloth by crossing threads or yarn

## a weaver's shuttle ##

a moving part that goes back and forth very fast in a machine or apparatus for making cloth

## they pass without hope ##

"they come to an end with absolutely no hope"

## God, call to mind ##

The word "God" was added to this phrase because the people who heard "call to mind" would have understood that God was addressed.  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]]).

## my life is only a breath ##

In this metaphor, Job compares the shortness of his life to the shortness of a breath.  "My life is very short like taking one breath" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]]).

## my eye will no more see good ##

"I will never again experience happiness."
