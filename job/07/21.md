## translationNotes

* **Why do you not pardon my transgression and take away my iniquity?** - Here Job uses two different clauses within a rhetorical question to emphasize his desire that God pardon his sin. He poses this question to rebuke God for making him suffer. AT: "Forgive my transgression and remove my iniquity." See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **Why do you not pardon my transgression** - "Why not pardon my transgression?"
* **take away** - "remove"
* **I will lie down in the dust** - The phrase "lie down in the dust" is a mild or polite way of saying "die." "I will die" (see: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
