# call to mind

"remember." The phrase "call to mind" does not mean God forgot. Job is asking God to consider or think about the shortness of Job's life.

# my life is only a breath

Job compares the shortness of his life to the shortness of a breath. Alternate translation: "my life is very short, like taking one breath" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# my eye will no more see good

Here "my eye" represents Job's whole person and his ability to see or experience things. Alternate translation: "I will never again experience good things" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
