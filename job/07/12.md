# Am I the sea or a sea monster that you place a guard over me?

Job poses this question to express his anger at God. In comparing himself to the sea or a sea monster, Job suggests that God regards him as a hideous creature. This can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: "I am not the sea or a sea monster that needs a guard to watch it." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
