# General Information:

The writer continues to use parallelism in each of these verses, conveying a single idea using two different statements to emphasize Job's thought that, after death, neither God nor the people he knew will see him again. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# The eye of God, who sees me, will see me no more

Many versions of the Bible translate this as "The eye which sees me will see me no more." The words "of God" were added to this phrase because they are implied by the context. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# The eye of God, who sees me ... God's eyes will be on me

Here God is represented by his "eye" to emphasize what he looks at. AT: "God who watches me ... God will look for me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# As a cloud is consumed and vanishes away, so he who goes down to Sheol will come up no more

Job is describing death as being like the clouds that disappear. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# As a cloud is consumed

This can be expressed in active form. AT: "As a cloud fades" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# he who goes down to Sheol will come up no more

"he who dies will not return"

# his place

The words "his place" represent those who live in his place. AT: "the people who live in his place" or "his family" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
