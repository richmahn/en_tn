# General Information:

The writer continues to use parallelism in each of these verses, conveying a single idea using two different statements to emphasize Job's thought that, after death, neither God nor the people he knew will see him again. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# The eye of God, who sees me, will see me no more

Many versions of the Bible translate this as "The eye which sees me will see me no more." The words "of God" were added to this phrase because they are implied by the context. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# The eye of God, who sees me ... God's eyes will be on me

Here God is represented by his "eye" to emphasize what he looks at. AT: "God who watches me ... God will look for me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
