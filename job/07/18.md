# that you should observe ... every moment?

This is the end of the rhetorical question that Job begins asking with the words "What is man that" in verse 17. The question can be translated as a statement. "Tell me what man is that ... mind on him, that you should observe ... every moment." or "I do not understand what man is that ... mind on him, that you should observe ... every moment." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# observe him

"carefully examine him"
