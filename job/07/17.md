# What is man that ... every moment?

Job asks this question to emphasize that he wonders why God pays attention to people. It can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: "Tell me what man is that ... every moment." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# set your mind on him

Here the mind represents thoughts and attention. To "set your mind on" means to give attention to. Alternate translation: "direct your attention to him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
