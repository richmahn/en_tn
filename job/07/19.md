## How long will it be before you look away from me, before you let me alone long enough for me to swallow down my own saliva? ##

Here Job conveys a single idea using two different rhetorical questions to emphasize his wish that God would stop watching him. "Look away from me!  Leave me alone long enough for me to swallow my own saliva!"  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## Even if I have sinned, what would that do to you, you who watch men? ##

Job poses this question to rebuke God.  "Even if I have sinned, that would do nothing to you, who watches over people." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

##  Why have you made a target of me? ##

"Why have you made me a target for yourself"
