# How long will it be ... swallow down my own saliva?

Here Job conveys a single idea using two different rhetorical questions to emphasize his wish that God would stop watching him. Alternate translation: "Look away from me! Leave me alone long enough for me to swallow my own saliva!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# saliva

liquid produced in people's mouths that keeps the mouth moist and helps to swallow food
