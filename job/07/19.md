# How long will it be ... swallow down my own saliva?

Here Job conveys a single idea using two different rhetorical questions to emphasize his wish that God would stop watching him. AT: "Look away from me! Leave me alone long enough for me to swallow my own saliva!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# saliva

liquid produced in people's mouths that keeps the mouth moist and helps to swallow food

# Even if I have sinned ... burden for you?

Job poses these questions to argue against God treating him unfairly. AT: "Even if I have sinned, that would do nothing to you, as you watch over people. Tell me why you have made me your target, so that I am a burden for you." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
