# General Information:

The writer continues to use parallelism in the first two verses, conveying a single idea using two different statements to emphasize Job's intense suffering. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# My bed will comfort me, and my couch will ease my complaint

Here "bed" and "couch" are metonyms for "sleep." In lying down to sleep, Job would hope to be comforted. The metonyms also have human attributes; they have the ability to comfort and ease a person. AT: "My bed, my couch, will be like someone who can comfort me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# My bed ... my couch

These phrases refer to the same thing. AT: "My bed ... my bed"
