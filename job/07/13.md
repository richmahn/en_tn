## translationNotes

* The writer continues to use parallelism in the first two verses, conveying a single idea using two different statements to emphasize Job's intense suffering. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
* **My bed will comfort me and my couch will ease my complaint** - Here "bed" and "couch" are metonyms for "sleep." In lying down to sleep, Job would hope to be comforted.  The metonyms also have human attributes; they have the ability to comfort and ease a person. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
* **You scare me** - "You" refers to God to whom Job is making his complaint.
* **my soul would choose strangling** - "I would choose strangling"
* **strangling** - killing a person by squeezing his throat and stopping his breathing
* **these bones of mine** - Here Job uses the word "bones" to refer to his body. AT: "This body of mine" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]]).
