# Connecting Statement:

The writer continues to use parallelism in these verses, conveying a single idea using two different statements to emphasize the impact of Job's misery on his sense of self worth. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# I loathe my life

"I despise my life"

# to always be alive

"to live forever"

# my days are useless

"my days are pointless" or "the days of my life are empty"

# What is man that ... every moment?

Job asks this question to emphasize that he wonders why God pays attention to people. It can be translated as a statement. AT: "Tell me what man is that ... every moment." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# set your mind on him

Here the mind represents thoughts and attention. To "set your mind on" means to give attention to. AT: "direct your attention to him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# observe him

"carefully examine him"
