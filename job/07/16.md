# Connecting Statement:

The writer continues to use parallelism in these verses, conveying a single idea using two different statements to emphasize the impact of Job's misery on his sense of self worth. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# I loathe my life

"I despise my life"

# to always be alive

"to live forever"

# my days are useless

"my days are pointless" or "the days of my life are empty"
