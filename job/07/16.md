## I loathe my life ##

"I despise my life"

## to always be alive ##

## my days are useless ##

"my days are pointless" or "my days are of no value"

## that you should pay attention to him ##

"that you should magnify him"

## that you should set your mind on him ##

"that you should direct your attention to him"

## that you should observe him ##

"that you should carefully inspect him"
