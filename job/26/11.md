# The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his rebuke

People thought of heaven or the sky as resting on pillars. Job speaks as though the pillars are humans that shake in fear when God is angry. Alternate translation: "The pillars that hold up heaven shake in fear when God rebukes them" or "The pillars that hold up the sky shake like people who are afraid when God rebukes them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
