# Job 26 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

The ULB indents the lines of this chapter because it is a poem. This chapter is Job's response to Bildad.

This chapter begins a section continuing through chapter 31. 

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Yahweh's power #####
While Bildad describes Yahweh's power as being so much greater than Job's, Job understands the true extent of Yahweh's power. It is not just over Job's life, but over all of creation. 

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### Sarcasm #####
Job uses sarcasm in this chapter. This is the use of irony to insult Bildad. (See: [Job 1-4](./01.md) and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])
