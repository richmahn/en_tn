# See, these are but the fringes of his ways

Here "fringes" represents a small part that we can see of something that is much bigger. AT: "See, these things that God has done show only a small part of his great power" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# how small a whisper do we hear of him!

This is an exclamation that expresses Job's amazement of all the great things that God does that we do not even know about. Seeing what God does is spoken of as hearing God's voice. AT: "it is as if we heard only his quiet whisper!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Who can understand the thunder of his power?

The "thunder of his power" represents God's greatness. Job uses this question to emphasize that God's power is so great that no one can understand it. AT: "The thunder displays the greatness of his power which no one can understand!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
