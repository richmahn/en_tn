# How you have helped one ... the arm that has no strength

In these statements, Job is accusing Bildad. The word "one" refers to Job. And, the word "arm" represents the whole person. AT: "I am powerless and have no strength, but you act like you have helped me; but really, you have not helped me at all" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# How you have advised one who has no wisdom and announced to him sound knowledge

Job is saying that Bildad has not provided him with good advice and knowledge. AT: "You act like I have no wisdom and that you have advised me, that you have given me good advice" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])

# announced to him sound knowledge

"given him good advice"

# With whose help have you spoken these words? Whose spirit was it ... you?

In these questions Job continues to mock Bildad. They are both rhetorical questions and have basically the same meaning. They are used together to strengthen each other. AT: "You must have had help speaking these words. Perhaps some spirit helped you speak them!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
