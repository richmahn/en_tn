## How you have helped one ... the arm that has no strength! ##

In these statements, Job is accusing Bildad. The word "one" refers to himself. AT: "I am powerless and have no strength, but you act like you have helped me--but really, you have not helped me at all!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])

## the arm that has no strength ##

Job uses this phrase to describe himself. AT: "me, who is like an arm that has no strength" or "the one who is so weak" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## How you have advised on who has no wisdom and announced to him sound knowledge! ##

Job is saying that Bildad has not provided him with good advice and knowledge. AT: "You act like I have no wisdom and that you have advised me,  that you have given me good advice!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])

## announced to him sound knowledge ##

"given him good advice"

## Who helped you to say ...? Whose spirit was it ...? ##

In these questions Job continues to mock Bildad. They are both rhetorical questions and have basically the same meaning. They are used together to strengthen each other.  AT: "You must have had help speaking these words, perhaps some spirit helped you speak them!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
