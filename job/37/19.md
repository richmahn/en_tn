# Teach us what we should say to him

Here the words "us" and "we" refer to Elihu, Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar, but not to Job. Elihu uses this phrase sarcastically. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

# because of the darkness of our minds

Elihu speaks of the inability to understand as if it were having darkness in one's mind. AT: "because we do not understand" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
