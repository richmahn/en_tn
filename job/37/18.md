# Can you spread out the sky ... a mirror of cast metal?

Elihu asks this question to emphasize that Job cannot do this. Alternate translation: "You cannot spread out the sky ... a mirror of cast metal." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# as strong as a mirror of cast metal

In biblical days, mirrors were made of metal. Elihu speaks of the sky giving no rain as if it were as hard as solid metal. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# cast metal

This refers to metal that is melted, poured into a mold, and then hardens as it cools.
