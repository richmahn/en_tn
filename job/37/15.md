# Do you know how God establishes the clouds and makes the lightning bolts to flash in them?

Elihu asks this question to emphasize that Job cannot know this. Alternate translation: "You cannot understand how God establishes the clouds and makes the lightning bolts to flash in them." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# establishes the clouds

"controls the clouds" or "makes the clouds obey him"
