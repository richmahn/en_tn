# Do you understand how your garments become hot ... from the south?

Elihu asks this question to emphasize that Job does not know these things. Alternate translation: "You do not understand how your garments become hot ... from the south." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# how your garments become hot

"how you become hot in your clothes" or "how you sweat in your clothes"

# because the wind comes from the south

In Israel, hot winds blow in across the desert from the south and cause hot temperatures. Alternate translation: "because of the hot, dry wind blowing in from the south" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
