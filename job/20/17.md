Zophar continues speaking to Job.

# the streams, the torrents of honey and butter

"Streams" and "torrents" are metaphors that represent abundance. "Honey" and "butter" are metonyms that represent the good things that God gives people. Alternate translation: "the abundance of good things that God gives his people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
