# Connecting Statement:

Zophar finishes the rhetorical question he began in verse 4.

# the triumph ... for a moment?

Zophar uses a rhetorical question to cause Job to think deeply about what he will now say. This can be translated as a statement. "Surely you know ... man on earth; the triumph ... for a moment." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# the triumph of a wicked man is short

The abstract noun "triumph" can be expressed with the verbs "triumph" or "celebrate." Alternate translation: "the wicked man triumphs only a short time" or "the wicked person celebrates for only a little while" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# the joy of a godless man lasts only for a moment

The abstract noun "joy" can be expressed with the verb "rejoice" or the adjective "happy." The word "moment" is an exaggeration to emphasize that the time is very short. Alternate translation: "a godless man rejoices for only a moment" or "the godless man is happy for only a very short time" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
