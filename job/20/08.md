# General Information:

Zophar continues speaking to Job.

# He will

"The wicked person will"

# He will fly away like a dream ... he will be chased away like a vision of the night

Here "fly away" and "be chased away" represent disappearing. They may also imply being forgotten, since dreams and visions disappear when people forget them. Alternate translation: "He will disappear like a dream ... he will be forgotten like a vision of the night" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# will not be found

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "no one will find him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
