## Zophar the Naamathite ##

See how you translated this name in [Job 2:11](../02/11.md).

## My thoughts makes me answer quickly because of the worry that is in me ##

"I need to speak because you have made me worried"

## from you ##

Here "you" refers to Job. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

## but a spirit that is beyond my understanding answers me ##

AT: "but I must answer you with my knowledge" or "but I know how to answer you because I understand many things"
