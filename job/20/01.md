# General Information:

Zophar replies to Job.

# Zophar the Naamathite

See how you translated this man's name in [Job 2:11](../02/11.md). Since this is the second time that Zophar speaks, some translations omit "the Naamathite" here.

# My thoughts make me answer quickly

The idea of Zophar's thoughts making him do something represents his strong desire to do something. AT: "I want very much to answer you quickly" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# because of the worry that is in me

The abstract noun "worry" can be expressed with the adjective "worried." The reason for the worry can be stated clearly.

# I hear a rebuke that dishonors me

Here "spirit" probably refers to a thought or idea. AT: "a thought from my understanding answers me"

# a spirit from my understanding answers me

# a spirit from my understanding answers me
