Zophar continues speaking to Job.

## Though his height reaches up to the heavens, and his head reaches to the clouds ##

Both of these statements mean the same thing. Zophar speaks about someone who is tall enough to reach the sky to say that this person is very famous and many people in the world know about him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

## Though his height ##

AT: "Though his fame"

## like his own feces ##

Zophar compares the wicked person to feces to emphasize that he will become completely worthless and will disappear. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
