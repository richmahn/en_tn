# Though his height reaches up to the heavens

"Though the wicked person's height reaches up to the heavens." The abstract noun "height" can be expressed with the adjective "tall." AT: "Though he is as tall as the heavens" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# Though his height reaches up to the heavens

The wicked man's height represents either his reputation or his pride. Also, here "reaches up to the heavens" represents being very great. AT: "Though his reputation is great" or "Though his pride is great" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# his head reaches to the clouds

"and though his head is as high as the clouds." This also represents his reputation or pride being great. This means the same as the previous phrase. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
