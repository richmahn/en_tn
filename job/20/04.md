# General Information:

Zophar continues speaking with Job.

# Do you not know this fact from ancient times ... for a moment?

Zophar uses a rhetorical question to cause Job to think deeply about what he will now say. This can be translated as a statement. AT: "Surely you know what has been true since the ancient times ... for a moment." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# the triumph of a wicked man is short

The abstract noun "triumph" can be expressed with the verbs "triumph" or "celebrate." AT: "the wicked man triumphs only a short time" or "the wicked person celebrates for only a little while" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# the joy of a godless man lasts only for a moment

The abstract noun "joy" can be expressed with the verb "rejoice" or the adjective "happy." The word "moment" is an exaggeration to emphasize that the time is very short. AT: "a godless man rejoices for only a moment" or "the godless man is happy for only a very short time" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
