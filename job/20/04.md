Zophar continues speaking with Job.

## Do you not know this fact from ancient times ##

Zophar uses a question to cause Job to think deeply about what he will now say. AT: "Surely you know what has been true since the ancient times" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## the triumph of the wicked is short ##

"the wicked person only celebrates for a little while"

## the joy of the godless lasts only for a moment ##

This means the same as the first part of the verse. Zophar means their joy will not continue for a long time. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
