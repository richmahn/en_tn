# Although wickedness is sweet in his mouth

Here "wickedness is sweet" represents a person enjoying doing wicked things. AT: "Although doing wicked things is pleasurable like tasting sweet food in the mouth" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# although he hides ... does not let it go

This represents wanting to continue to enjoy the wickedness as one wants to continue enjoying tasty food by keeping it in the mouth. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the food in his intestines turns bitter

When food turns bitter in the stomach, it causes pain and a bitter taste. This is a metaphor for a person experiencing the painful consequences of doing wicked things. AT: "those wicked things become like food that has turned bitter in the stomach" or "the consequences of those wicked things are painful like food that becomes sour in the stomach" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# it becomes the poison of asps inside him

This image is even worse than sour food in the stomach. This is a metaphor for a person experiencing the terrible consequences of doing wicked things. AT: "the consequences of doing those wicked things are painful like the poison of asps inside him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# asps
