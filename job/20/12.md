Zophar continues speaking to Job.

## Although wickedness is sweet in his mouth...the poison of asps inside him ##

Zophar describes “wickedness” (or doing evil things) as if it is food that tastes very good, but when wickedness is swallowed and enters into us it becomes poison, like the poison of deadly snakes. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
