Zophar continues speaking to Job.

## He swallows down riches...cast them out of his belly ##

Zophar compares wealth to food. Just like a person who eats too much food will vomit it back up, God will take the wealth from a rich person who stores up things for himself. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## He will suck the poison of asps; the viperâ€™s tongue will kill him ##

Zophar says   that holding onto wealth is evil, and like poison evil can kill a person. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## vomit ##

## cast ##
