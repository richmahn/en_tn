# Job 20 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

The ULB sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is a poem. This chapter is  the advice of Job's friend, Zophar. His words in this chapter are much stronger than when he previously spoke, and he is even angry at Job. He claims that Job took advantage of the poor and is being punished for it.
