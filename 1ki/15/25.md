# Connecting Statement:

The rest of chapter 15 and 16 is about the kings of Israel. These events happened while King Asa of Judah was still alive.

# the second year of Asa king of Judah

This refers to the second year of Asa's reign. The meaning of this can be made clear. AT: "when Asa had been king of Judah for almost two years" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# he reigned over Israel two years

"Nadab reigned over Israel two years"
