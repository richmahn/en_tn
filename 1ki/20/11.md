# Tell Ben Hadad, 'No one who is just putting on his armor ... as if he were taking it off.'

This is an expression to give advice. "Putting on armor" is metonymy for getting prepared for battle. "Tell Ben Hadad, 'Do not boast as if you have already won a battle that you have not yet fought.'" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-proverbs]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
