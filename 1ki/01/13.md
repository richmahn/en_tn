# General Information:

The prophet Nathan continues to speak to Bathsheba.

# did you not swear to your servant ... throne?

The purpose of this question was to remind David of what he had promised Bathsheba. Alternate translation: "you swore to your servant ... throne." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# to your servant

Bathsheba speaks to David as if she were someone else to show that she respects David. Alternate translation: "to me, your servant" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pronouns]])

# he will sit on my throne

Sitting on the throne is a metonym for being king. Alternate translation: "he will be king just as I was" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# Why then is Adonijah reigning?

Bathsheba was to use a question so David would pay attention. Alternate translation: "So then, Adonijah should not be reigning." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
