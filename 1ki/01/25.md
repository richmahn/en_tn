# eating and drinking before him

Adonijah probably sat at a table where he could watch all those he had invited as they ate and drank. The main idea is that the people Nathan named were with Adonijah and they were celebrating together. Alternate translation: "eating and drinking with him" or "eating and drinking where he can see them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
