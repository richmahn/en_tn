# General Information:

Nathan the prophet continues to speak to King David.

# have you said, 'Adonijah will reign after me, and he will sit on my throne?'

This can be stated as an indirect quotation. AT: "have you said that Adonijah will reign after you, and he will sit on your throne?" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])

# he will sit on my throne

Sitting on the throne is a metonym for being king. See how you translated this in [1 Kings 1:13](./13.md). AT: "he will be king just as I was"
