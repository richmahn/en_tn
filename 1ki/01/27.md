# Has my master the king done this without telling us, your servants, who should sit on the throne after him?

Nathan refers to David in the third person. This is a way of showing respect to the king. It can be stated in second person. Alternate translation: "Have you, my master the king, done this without telling us, your servants, who should sit on the throne after you?" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# who should sit on the throne

Sitting on the throne is a metonym for being king. See how you translated similar words in [1 Kings 1:13](./13.md). Alternate translation: "who would be king after him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
