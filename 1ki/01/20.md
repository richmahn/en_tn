Bathsheba continues to speak to King David.

## the eyes of all Israel are on you ##

AT: "All the people of Israel are watching you." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]].)

## sleeps with his fathers ##

This is a polite way of referring to his death. AT: "dies" (See [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
