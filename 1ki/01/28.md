King David makes a promise to Bathsheba.

## came into the king's presence ##

AT: "came before the king" or "came back to the king"

## made an oath ##

"made a solemn promise"

## May my master King David live forever! ##

Bathsheba knew David would not live forever; this is a way of saying that he is a good king. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]].)
