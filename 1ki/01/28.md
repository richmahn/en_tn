# General Information:

King David makes a promise to Bathsheba.

# came into the king's presence

"came before the king" or "came back to the king"

# made an oath

"made a solemn promise"

# he will sit on my throne in my place

Sitting on the throne is a metonym for being king. See how you translated similar words in [1 Kings 1:13](./13.md). AT: "he will take my place and be king just as I was" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# May my master King David live forever

Bathsheba knew David would not live forever; this is a way of saying that he is a good king. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
