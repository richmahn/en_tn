# Adonijah ... took hold of the horns of the altar

The "horns of the altar" symbolized the strength and protection of Yahweh, but because Adonijah literally went into the area of the physical tent to take literal hold of the physical horns, you should translate this literally.

# Adonijah ... rose up, went

Another possible meaning is "Adonijah ... quickly went" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
