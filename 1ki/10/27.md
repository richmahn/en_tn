# The king had silver in Jerusalem, as much as the stones on the ground

The narrator uses exaggeration to emphasize the great amount of silver that was in Jerusalem. Alternate translation: "The king had so much silver in Jerusalem, it was like there was as much silver as there was stones on the ground" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
