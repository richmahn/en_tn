# King Solomon made

It might be best to translate so that the reader understands that other people helped Solomon do this. AT: "King Solomon's men made" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# two hundred large shields

"200 large shields" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])

# Six hundred shekels of gold

A shekel is a unit of weight equal to about 11 grams. AT: "About 6.6 kilograms of gold" or "Six and one half kilograms of gold" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bweight]])

# Six hundred shekels

Because the word "shekels" does not appear here in the Hebrew text, some modern versions assume instead the unit of bekah, which was equivalent to only a half shekel. Any version making this assumption would signal a metric equivalent of about three kilograms.
