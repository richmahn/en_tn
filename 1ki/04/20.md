# Judah and Israel were as numerous as the sand by the sea

The speaker uses exaggeration to say that there were so many people that it would be impossible to count them all. The words "Judah" and "Israel" are metonyms for the people who lived in Judah and Israel. Alternate translation: "There were as many people in Judah and Israel as there are grains of sand by the sea" or "there were more people in Judah and Israel than a person could count" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
