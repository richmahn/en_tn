# who came to King Solomon's table

"who ate with King Solomon" or "whom King Solomon invited to eat with him"

# every man in his month

Solomon had assigned each of the 12 officials in [1 Kings 4:7-19](./07.md) to bring him food in a different month.

# They let nothing be lacking

This can be expressed positively. Alternate translation: "They provided everything that Solomon needed" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
