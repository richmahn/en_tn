# Yahweh listened to the voice of Elijah

Here "voice" represents what Elijah prayed. Alternate translation: "Yahweh answered Elijah's prayer" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# the life of the child returned to him, and he revived

These two phrases mean basically the same thing. Alternate translation: "the child came back to life" or "the child lived again" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
