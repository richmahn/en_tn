# the word of Yahweh came to the prophet ... came from Judah, saying, "Yahweh

The idiom "the word of Yahweh came to" is used to introduce a special message from God. See how you translated a similar phrase in [1 Kings 6:11](../06/11.md). Alternate translation: "Yahweh gave a message to the prophet ... came from Judah. He said, 'Yahweh" or "Yahweh spoke this message to the prophet ... came from Judah: 'Yahweh" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# he cried to the man of God

"the prophet spoke loudly to the man of God"

# Because you have been disobedient to the word of Yahweh

"Because you have not obeyed the word of Yahweh"
