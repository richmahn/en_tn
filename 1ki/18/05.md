## translationNotes

* **save the horses and mules alive...not lose all the animals** - These two phrases mean basically the same thing and are combined for emphasis. AT: "prevent the horses and mules from dying" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
* **Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way** - The phrase "by himself" emphasizes that Ahab and Obadiah went in separate directions, not necessarily that no one was with Ahab. AT: "Ahab lead a team in one direction, and Obadiah lead a team in the other direction" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
