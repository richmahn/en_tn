# Perhaps he is thinking

"Maybe he is thinking" or "It could be that he is thinking"

# relieving himself

This euphemism is a more pleasant way to express a harsh statement. Elijah uses understatement to insult Baal with sarcasm. Alternate translation: "in the bathroom" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])

# must be awakened

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "you must awaken him" or "you must wake him up" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
