# Perhaps he is thinking

"Maybe he is thinking" or "It could be that he is thinking"

# relieving himself

This euphemism is a more pleasant way to express a harsh statement. Elijah uses understatement to insult Baal with sarcasm. AT: "in the bathroom" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])

# must be awakened

This can be stated in active form. AT: "you must awaken him" or "you must wake him up" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# they were still raving

"they continued their wild behavior." Prophets often acted in ways that seemed unusual or even crazy. In this case they were calling on Baal while dancing, shouting loudly, and cutting themselves with knives.

# of offering of the evening sacrifice

"to offer the evening sacrifice"

# but there was no voice or anyone to answer; there was no one who paid any attention to their pleadings

These phrases share similar meanings and emphasize that no one responded to the prayers of the false prophets. AT: "but Baal did not say or do anything or even pay attention" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# there was no voice or anyone to answer

See how you translated this in [1 Kings 18:26](./25.md).
