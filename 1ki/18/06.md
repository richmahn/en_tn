# Ahab went one way by himself and Obadiah went another way

The phrase "by himself" emphasizes that Ahab and Obadiah went in separate directions, not necessarily that no one was with Ahab. Alternate translation: "Ahab lead a team in one direction and Obadiah lead a team in the other direction" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
