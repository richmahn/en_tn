# They took the bull

"The prophets of Baal took the bull"

# the bull that was given to them

This can be stated in active form. AT: "the bull that someone gave them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# But there was no voice, nor anyone who answered

These two phrases share similar meanings and emphasize that there was no one to respond to the prayers of the false prophets. The word "voice" represents someone speaking. AT: "But Baal did not say or do anything" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
