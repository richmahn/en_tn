# they were still raving

"they continued their wild behavior." Prophets often acted in ways that seemed unusual or even crazy. In this case they were calling on Baal while dancing, shouting loudly, and cutting themselves with knives.

# of offering of the evening sacrifice

"to offer the evening sacrifice"

# but there was no voice or anyone to answer; there was no one who paid any attention to their pleadings

These phrases share similar meanings and emphasize that no one responded to the prayers of the false prophets. Alternate translation: "but Baal did not say or do anything or even pay attention" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# there was no voice or anyone to answer

See how you translated this in [1 Kings 18:26](../18/26.md).
