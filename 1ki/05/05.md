# So

This is to emphasize the words that follow. "Listen! This is what I am going to do:" or "Because of what Yahweh has done for me, this is what I am going to do:"

# for the name of Yahweh my God ... for my name

The word "name" is a metonym for the person. Alternate translation: "where Yahweh my God will live ... where I will live" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# set on your throne in your place

Here "throne" refers to ruling as king. Alternate translation: "make to be the king after you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
