# in order for my name to be

The word "name" is a metonym for the person, and "for ... name" refers to worshiping the person. See how you translated similar words in [1 Kings 3:2](../03/01.md). Alternate translation: "so that people would worship me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
