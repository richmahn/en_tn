# Suppose that your people go out ... suppose that they pray

When Solomon was speaking, these hypothetical situations had not happened, but Solomon knew that they might happen in the future. Use the form in your language for talking about events that have not happened but might happen in the future. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])

# for your name

The word "name" is a metonym for the person, and "for ... name" refers to worshiping the person. See how you translated similar words in [1 Kings 3:2](../03/01.md). Alternate translation: "in which people will worship you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
