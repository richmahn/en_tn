# their prayer and their request

The words "prayer" and "request" mean basically the same thing and emphasize that the people are sincere as they make their request. See how you translated similar words in [1 Kings 8:28](../08/28.md). Alternate translation: "their request" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
