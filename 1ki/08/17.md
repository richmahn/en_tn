# it was in the heart of David my father ... it was in your heart ... for it to be in your heart

What David desired is spoken of as if it were an item in a container and the heart as if it were a container. AT: "David my father desired ... you desired ... to desire to do that" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# for the name of Yahweh ... for my name

The word "name" is a metonym for the person, and "for ... name" refers to worshiping the person. See how you translated similar words in [1 Kings 3:2](../03/01.md). AT: "in which people would worship Yahweh ... in which people will worship me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# In that it was in your heart

"Because you desired"

# for it to be in your heart

"by wanting to do that"

# one who will be born from your loins

This can be stated in active form. AT: "one who will be your own offspring" or "one whom you yourself will father" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
