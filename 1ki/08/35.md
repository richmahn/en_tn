# the skies are shut up and there is no rain

The sky is spoken of as if it were a building in which God stores the rain. AT: "you do not allow rain to fall" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# confess your name

Possible meanings are 1) "confess that they have sinned against you" or 2) "praise you" or 3) "say that they will obey you from now on." See how you translated this in [1 Kings 8:33](./33.md).
