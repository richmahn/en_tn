## translationNotes

* **all Israel with him** - This may refer either 1) to the people whom Solomon called to Jerusalem and who are listed in [[en:bible:notes:1ki:08:01]], or 2) to those who traveled to Jerusalem for the feast, not necessarily to every person who lived in Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
