# all Israel with him

This generalization may refer either 1) to the people whom Solomon called to Jerusalem and who are listed in [1 Kings 8:1](../08/01.md), or 2) to those who traveled to Jerusalem for the feast, not necessarily to every person who lived in Israel. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
