## all Israel with him ##

See how you translated this phrase in [1 Kings 8:62](./62.md).

## seven days...seven days...fourteen days ##

AT: "7 days...7 days...14 days" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])

## joyful and glad ##

The two words mean basically the same thing and are combined for emphasis. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
