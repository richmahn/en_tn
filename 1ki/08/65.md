# all Israel with him

This generalization may refer either 1) to the people whom Solomon called to Jerusalem and who are listed in [1 Kings 8:1](./01.md), or 2) to those who traveled to Jerusalem for the feast, not necessarily to every person who lived in Israel. See how you translated similar words in [1 Kings 8:62](./62.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# seven days ... seven days ... fourteen days

"7 days ... 7 days ... 14 days" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])

# eighth day

The word "eighth" is the ordinal form of "8." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])

# joyful and glad

The two words mean basically the same thing and are combined for emphasis. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
