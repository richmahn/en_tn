# their prayer and their request

The two words "prayer" and "request" mean basically the same thing. Together they emphasize that the people were sincere as they made their request to Yahweh. See how you translated similar words in [1 Kings 8:28](./27.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
