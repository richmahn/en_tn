# The word of Yahweh came

This idiom means God spoke. See how you translated this in [1 Kings 6:11](../06/11.md). AT: "Yahweh spoke his message" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# Although I exalted you

This is God's message that Jehu was to give to Baasha. The word "you" refers to Baasha.

# I exalted you out of the dust

"I raised you out of the dust." Being in the dust on the ground represents not being important. Exalting someone represents making him important. AT: "I raised you from a very unimportant position" or "when you had no power or influence over people, I made you important" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# you have walked in the way of Jeroboam

Walking represents behaving. Jeroboam and Baasha both sinned. The full meaning of this statement can be made clear. AT: "you have done the same things that Jeroboam did" or "you have sinned as Jeroboam sinned" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
