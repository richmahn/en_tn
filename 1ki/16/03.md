# Connecting Statement:

Yahweh continues telling Baasha what he will do to him.

# See, I will completely sweep away Baasha and his family

Yahweh is speaking to Baasha, and the phrase "his family" refers to Baasha's family. This can be translated using the words "you" and "your." AT: "Listen, Baasha. I will completely sweep away you and your family" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# I will completely sweep away

Sweeping away represents destroying. AT: "I will completely destroy" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
