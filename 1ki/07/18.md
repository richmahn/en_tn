## two rows of pomegranates ##

A "pomegranate" is a fruit with a hard, red rind and many juicy seeds inside. Huram did not use real pomegranates to decorate the pillars. He made them out of bronze.

## The capitals...were decorated with lilies, four cubits high ##

Lilies are funnel-shaped flowers. AT: "Huram decorated the capitals with bronze lilies, four cubits high..." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

## the tops of the portico ##

See how you translated "portico" in [1 Kings 7:6](./06.md).
