## translationNotes

* **two rows of pomegranates** - A "pomegranate" is a fruit with a hard, red rind and many juicy seeds inside. Huram did not use real pomegranates to decorate the pillars. He made them out of bronze.

* **the tops of the portico** - See how you translated "portico" in [[en:bible:notes:1ki:07:06]].
