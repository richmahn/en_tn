# brought him from Tyre

Huram accepted Solomon's invitation to come to Jerusalem. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# the son of a widow ... his father was a man of Tyre

A widow is a woman whose husband has died, so we know that the father is dead. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# Huram was filled with wisdom and understanding and skill

This can be stated in active form. The words "wisdom and understanding" mean basically the same thing and are used together for emphasis. Yahweh giving such things as wisdom is spoken of as if they were liquids that Yahweh had poured into a container, and Huram is spoken of as if he were that container. AT: "Yahweh had given Huram wisdom, understanding, and skill" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
