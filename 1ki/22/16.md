## How many times must I require...in the name of Yahweh? ##

Ahab asks this question out of frustration to rebuke Micaiah. AT: "Many times I have required...in the name of Yahweh." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## in the name of Yahweh ##

Here the word "name" refers to authority. AT: "as the representative of Yahweh" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## I saw all Israel ##

Here "all Israel" refers to the army of Israel. AT: "I saw the entire army of Israel" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

## like sheep who have no shepherd ##

The people of the army are compared to sheep that have no one to lead them because their shepherd, the king, has died. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
