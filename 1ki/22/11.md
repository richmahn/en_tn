# made himself horns of iron

"made iron horns for himself"

# With these you will push the Arameans until they are consumed

The prophet's actions are a symbolic metaphor that illustrates the way that Ahab would defeat the Arameans. Ahab's army will win with great strength, as a bull attacks another animal. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# until they are consumed
