# I am like you, my people are like your people, and my horses are like your horses

Jehoshaphat tells Ahab that he, his people, and his horses belong to Ahab, meaning that Ahab can command them as he pleases. AT: "I, my soldiers, and my horses are yours to use in any way you want" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
