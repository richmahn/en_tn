# Do you know that Ramoth Gilead is ours, but that we are doing nothing to take it from the hand of the king of Aram?

Ahab asks this question to emphasize that they should have already recaptured Ramoth Gilead. Alternate translation: "Ramoth Gilead is ours, but we have done nothing yet to take it from the hand of the king of Aram." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# to take it from the hand of the king of Aram

Here the word "hand" refers to power. Alternate translation: "to take it from the control of the king of Aram" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
