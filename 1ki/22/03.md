# Do you know that Ramoth Gilead is ours, but that we are doing nothing to take it from the hand of the king of Aram?

Ahab asks this question to emphasize that they should have already recaptured Ramoth Gilead. AT: "Ramoth Gilead is ours, but we have done nothing yet to take it from the hand of the king of Aram." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# to take it from the hand of the king of Aram

Here the word "hand" refers to power. AT: "to take it from the control of the king of Aram" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# I am like you, my people are like your people, and my horses are like your horses

Jehoshaphat tells Ahab that he, his people, and his horses belong to Ahab, meaning that Ahab can command them as he pleases. AT: "I, my soldiers, and my horses are yours to use in any way you want" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
