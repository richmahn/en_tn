# Which way did the Spirit of Yahweh take to go from me to speak to you?

Zedekiah asks this sarcastic question to insult and rebuke Micaiah. AT: "Do not think that Yahweh's Spirit left me to speak to you!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Look

"Listen" or "Pay attention to what I am about to tell you"

# you will see

"you will know the answer to your question." If Zedekiah's rhetorical question is translated as a statement, this phrase may be translated to supply implicit information. AT: "you will know that the Spirit of Yahweh has spoken to me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
