# are they not written in the book of the events of the kings of Judah?

This can be expressed in active form and assumes that the answer is positive. The question is rhetorical and is used for emphasis. See how you translated this in [1 Kings 14:29](../14/29.md). AT: "they are written in the book of the events of the kings of Judah." or "you can read them in the book of the events of the kings of Judah."
