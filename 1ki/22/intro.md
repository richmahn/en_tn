# 1 Kings 22 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

This is the end of the story of Ahab and a continuation of the story of Elijah as he had predicted Ahab's death and the dogs licking his blood. 

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

When God has decided a person will die, then they cannot avoid death. Ahab persuaded Jehoshaphat, king of Judah to help him in a battle against the army of Aram. Ahab's false prophets all told him to go because he would be successful. But a randomly shot arrow hit him and he bled to death. They washed his chariot at the pool and the dogs licked up his blood, just as Elijah had said they would. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]])

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### "However, the shrines were still not taken away. The people were still sacrificing and burning incense at the shrines." ##### 
At the shrines, the people worshiped Yahweh. But later, during Hezekiah's reign it was decided that all sacrifices must be made only at the temple. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/temple]])
