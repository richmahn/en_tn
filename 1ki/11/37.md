Ahijah continues to tell Jeroboam what Yahweh has said.

## I will take you ##

Here the word "I" refers to Yahweh and the word "you" refers to Jeroboam.

## what is right in my eyes ##

See how you translated this phrase in [1 Kings 11:31](./31.md).

## build you a sure house ##

AT: "establish for you a lasting kingdom" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
