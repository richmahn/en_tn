# what is right in my eyes

The word "eyes" here is a metonym for someone's opinion or idea. This is a commonly used idiom. See how you translated this phrase in [1 Kings 11:33](./31.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# build you a sure house

The clause "build a house" is a metaphor for establishing descendants from that time on. Alternate translation: "establish for you a lasting kingdom" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
