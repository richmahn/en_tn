# completely consume and cut off from you every male child and slave and free man in Israel

Yahweh speaks of destroying Ahab's family and preventing him from having any decedents as if he were consuming these people like a fire would consume them, and cutting them off as one would cut a branch from a tree. AT: "destroy every one of your male children in Israel, whether slave or free" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# I will make your family like the family of Jeroboam ... and like the family of Baasha

Yahweh will destroy Ahab's family like he destroyed the families of Jeroboam and Baasha.
