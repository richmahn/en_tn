# seated Naboth above the people

Having Naboth sit in a place of honor is spoken of as if it were having him sit above the rest of the people who were present. See how you translated this idea in [1 Kings 21:9](./08.md). Alternate translation: "had Naboth sit in a place of honor among the people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
