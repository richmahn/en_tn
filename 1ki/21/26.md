# removed before the people of Israel

Here "Israel" refers to all twelve tribes of Israel and not just to the northern kingdom. Alternate translation: "removed from the presence of the people of Israel" or "drove out of the land before the people of Israel" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
