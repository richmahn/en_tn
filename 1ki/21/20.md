# Have you found me, my enemy?

Ahab uses this question to express anger toward Elijah. That Elijah "found" Ahab likely refers to Elijah discovering Ahab's actions, not to finding his physical location. Alternate translation: "You have found me, my enemy!" or "You have discovered what I have done, my enemy!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# you have sold yourself to do what is evil

A person being committed to doing what is evil is spoken of as if that person had sold himself to evil. Alternate translation: "you have dedicated yourself to doing what is evil" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# what is evil in the sight of Yahweh

The phrase, "in the sight of" refers to someone's opinion. See how you translated this in [1 Kings 11:6](../11/06.md). Alternate translation: "what Yahweh considers to be evil" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
