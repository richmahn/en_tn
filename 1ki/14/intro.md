#### Special concepts in this chapter

##### The death of Jeroboam's son
God knows the truth; it is useless to try to fool God's prophet. Jeroboam's son became sick; so the king sent his wife, disguised as a common woman, to the prophet. The prophet was blind, but when Jeroboam's wife arrived he told her, "Come in, wife of Jeroboam." He also told her that her son would die and that all of Jeroboam's family would be killed, because he had caused Israel to worship the golden calves. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/true]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])

##### Rehoboam's reign
When Solomon obeyed God, God made him very rich. When the people of Judah began to worship the fertility goddess, Ashtoreth, and to do many evil things, they had to give all of their wealth to the king of Egypt to persuade him not to attack Jerusalem. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/evil]])
