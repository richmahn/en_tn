# slept with his ancestors

Rehoboam dying is spoken of as if he had fallen asleep. See how you translated this in [1 Kings 2:10](../02/10.md). Alternate translation: "died" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])

# was buried with them

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "people buried him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# Naamah

This is the name of a woman. See how you translated this in [1 Kings 14:21](../14/21.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# Abijah his son

"Abijah the son of Rehoboam"

# became king in his place

The phrase "in his place" is a metaphor meaning "instead of him." Alternate translation: "became king instead of Rehoboam" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
