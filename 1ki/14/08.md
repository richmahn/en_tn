# I tore the kingdom away

God forcefully removed most of the kingdom like a person tears a piece of cloth. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# followed me

"obeyed me"

# with all his heart

Here the "heart" refers to a person's will and desire. Alternate translation: "with all his will" or "with complete commitment" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# what was right in my eyes

The eyes represent seeing, and seeing represents thoughts or judgment. Alternate translation: "what I judged to be right" or "what I considered to be right" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
