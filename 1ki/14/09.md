# thrust me behind your back

Jeroboam has disrespected Yahweh like a person throws away something that is not wanted. AT: "completely rejected me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# look

"pay attention." This word is added to indicate that what follows is important.

# I will cut off ... and will completely remove

These two phrases are very similar in meaning and are repeated for emphasis. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# cut off from you every male child in Israel

Yahweh speaks of destroying Jeroboam's family and preventing him from having any descendants as if he were cutting them off as one would cut a branch from a tree. AT: "destroy every one of your male children in Israel" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# will completely remove your family, like someone who burns up dung until it is gone

This simile compares the removal of every descendant of Jeroboam with the complete burning up of dung that was mixed with straw, dried, and burned for fuel. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
