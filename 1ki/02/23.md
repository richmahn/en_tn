# May God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah has not spoken this word against his own life

This is an idiom. Alternate translation: "God will have every right to execute me—and to do even worse things to me—if I do not execute Adonijah because he has made this request" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
