# you will not turn away from my face ... I will not turn away from your face

Turning from the face of someone is a metonym for refusing to look at someone, which in turn is a metonym for refusing to do what that person requests. See how you translated similar words in [1 Kings 2:16-17](./16.md). AT: "you will not refuse to do what I request ... I will not refuse to do what you request" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
