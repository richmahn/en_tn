Benaiah goes to execute Joab.

## take away from me and from my father's house the blood which Joab shed without cause ##

Here "house" stands for the descendants of David while "blood" represents guilt. AT: "remove the guilt for the murders Joab committed from me and my family" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
