# General Information:

Benaiah goes to execute Joab.

# bury him so that you may take away from me and from my father's house the blood that Joab shed without cause

Here "house" stands for the descendants of David while "blood" represents guilt. AT: "bury him and so remove from me and my family the guilt for the murders Joab committed without cause" or "bury him. Do that so Yahweh will not hold me and my father's house guilty because Joab murdered people for no reason" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
