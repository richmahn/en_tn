King David continues to tell Solomon how to lead Israel.

## shed the blood of war in peace ##

AT: "murdered two men during a time of peace" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## on the belt around his waist and in the shoes on his feet ##

Joab's belt (where his sword was attached) and his shoes (for marching) symbolize his military rank. These are stained with the blood of the men he murdered. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## do not let his gray head go down to the grave in peace ##

The language here implies that Joab should die a violent death and not be allowed to grow old (See UDB). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
