# General Information:

Adonijah shares his request with Bathsheba.

# do not turn away from my face

Turning from the face of someone is a metonym for refusing to look at someone, which in turn is a metonym for refusing to do what that person requests. Alternate translation: "do not refuse to do what I request" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
