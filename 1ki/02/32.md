King Solomon explains why Joab should die.

## May Yahweh return his blood on his own head ##

The word "his" refers to Joab. "Blood" refers to guilt. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## more righteous and better ##

Both words are used for emphasis. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

## the head of Joab and his descendants ##

This is using "head" to describe the whole person. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## and to his house and to his throne ##

Here "house" and "throne" represent David's "descendants" and David's "rule." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
