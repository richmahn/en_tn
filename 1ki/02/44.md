# will return your wickedness on your own head

Here the head represents the person, and wickedness is spoken of as if it were a solid or liquid that could be put on a person's head. Alternate translation: "will hold you responsible for all your wickedness" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
