# General Information:

King Solomon gives an answer to Adonijah's request.

# Why do you ask ... Adonijah? Why do you not ask the kingdom for him also ... Zeruiah?

King Solomon was angered by his mother's request. AT: "You are wrong to ask ... Adonijah! This is the same as asking the kingdom for him also ... Zeruiah!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# May God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah has not spoken this word against his own life

This is an idiom. AT: "God will have every right to execute me—and to do even worse things to me—if I do not execute Adonijah because he has made this request" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
