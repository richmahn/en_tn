Solomon responds to God's question.

## You have shown great covenant faithfulness ##

AT: "You have been very faithful to your agreement"

## because he walked before you in trustworthiness, in righteousness and in uprightness of heart ##

AT: “because he was trustworthy, righteous and honest”

## to sit on his throne ##

AT: "to rule in his place" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
