# 1 Kings 03 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

This chapter has two stories. Verses 1-15 is the story of Solomon's dream when God asked him what he wanted and he said he needed wisdom to be a good and fair ruler.  Verses 16-28 is the story of a court case showing Solomon's wisdom. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/wise]])

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Wisdom #####

God was very pleased with Solomon's request for wisdom. This is because wisdom was something that he could use to serve other people instead of himself. Because this was a noble request, God promised Solomon wisdom, wealth, and fame. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/promise]])

##### Putting the needs of others first #####
There are two additional examples of people putting the needs of others in front of their own needs. God is pleased with people wanting to do their job well more than wanting to be blessed. A mother will put the life of her child above every other concern. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/bless]])
