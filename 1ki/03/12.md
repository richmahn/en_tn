"I will do what you asked me to do when you spoke with me"

# I give you a wise and an understanding heart

The heart is a metonym for what a person thinks and desires. Alternate translation: "I make you able to be wise and to understand many things" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
