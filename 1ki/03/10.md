God gives Solomon wisdom and more.

## the life of your enemies ##

Solomon did not ask God to give him power over the life of his enemies. AT: "your enemies to be killed" or "the power to kill your enemies"; (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## you commanded me to do when you gave me your word ##

AT: "you asked me to do when you spoke to me"
