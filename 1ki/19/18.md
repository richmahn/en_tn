# I will leave for myself

Here the words "I" and "myself" refer to Yahweh. Alternate translation: "I will save from death" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns]])

# seven thousand people

"7,000 people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])

# whose knees have not bent down to Baal, and whose mouths have not kissed him

"Bending down" and "kissing" are metonymies for actions people did to worship idols. They are combined for emphasis. Alternate translation: "who have not bowed down and kissed Baal" or "who have not worshiped Baal" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
