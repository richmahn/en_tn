# the word of Yahweh came to him and said to him

The idiom "The word of Yahweh came to" is used to introduce a special message from God. AT: "Yahweh gave a message to him. He said," or "Yahweh spoke this message to him:" See how you translated this in [1 Kings 6:11](../06/11.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# What are you doing here, Elijah?

Yahweh asks this question to rebuke Elijah and to remind him of his duty. AT: "This is not where you should be, Elijah." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# I, only I, am left

Here the word "I" is repeated for emphasis.
