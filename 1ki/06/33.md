# Solomon also made ... He carved ... he evenly overlaid

Solomon would have commanded his workers to do this work. AT: "They also made ... They carved ... they evenly overlaid" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# In this way, Solomon also made for the temple entrance doorposts of olive wood having four indented sections and two doors of cypress wood

"Solomon also made doorposts of olive wood for the temple entrance, with four indented sections and two doors of cypress wood, in the same way"

# indented sections

tooth-like notches

# The two leaves of the one door

This means each door had two sections connected by hinges so they could fold together.
