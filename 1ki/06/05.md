Scripture continues to list the dimensions of the temple.

## the lowest story ... the middle ... the third ##

This refers to the rooms in each story of the building.

## he made offsets in the wall of the house ##

They made ledges all around the amin building to support the beams of the small rooms.

## beams ##

A beam is a long heavy piece of wood used to support a building.
