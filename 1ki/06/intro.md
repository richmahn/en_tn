##### Building the temple #####
Solomon built the temple in seven years. The outside walls were made of rock. Solomon shaped the rocks for the wall in the quarry and then assembled them at the temple site. The inside was covered with wood. Inside the temple was a room covered by gold, which was the Most Holy Place where the ark was housed under statues of angels. It represented the presence of God.
