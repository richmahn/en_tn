# the fourth year ... the eleventh year

The words "fourth" and "eleventh" are the ordinal forms of "four" and "eleven." You may need to make explicit the event from which the writer counts the years. AT: "the fourth year after Solomon became king ... the eleventh year after Solomon became king" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# house of Yahweh

"the temple"

# in the month of Ziv

"Ziv" is the name of the second month of the Hebrew calendar. It is during the last part of April and the first part of May on Western calendars. See how you translated this in [1 Kings 6:1](./01.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-hebrewmonths]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
