# Solomon made ... he made ... he made ... He overlaid ... he spread

Solomon would have commanded his workers to do this work. Alternate translation: "They made ... they made ... they made ... They overlaid ... they spread" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# overlaid

"covered." See how you translated this in [1 Kings 6:21](../06/21.md).
