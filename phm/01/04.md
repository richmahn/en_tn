This could also be translated as "that your trusting in Christ as we do will make you able to know" or "that because you joined us in trusting in Christ, you will be able to know"

## your participation in the faith ##

## that is in us in Christ ##

The most likely meaning is "that we have because of Christ."

## the hearts of the saints have been refreshed by you ##

Here the word "hearts" refers to the courage of the believers. Also, "have been refreshed" is a passive clause. This could be translated as an active clause: "you have encouraged the believers." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## brother ##

Paul called Philemon "brother" because they were both believers. He was also probably emphasizing their friendship. It can also be translated here as "dear brother" or "dear friend."
