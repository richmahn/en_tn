# General Information:

Three times Paul identifies himself as the author of this letter. Evidently Timothy was with him and probably wrote the words down as Paul said them. Paul greets others who meet for church at Philemon's house.
All instances of "I," "me," and "my" refer to Paul. Philemon is the main person to whom this letter is written. All instances of "you" and "your" refer to him and are singular unless otherwise noted. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and the brother Timothy to Philemon

Your language may have a particular way of introducing the authors of a letter. Alternate translation: "I, Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy, our brother, are writing this letter to Philemon" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

# a prisoner of Christ Jesus

"a prisoner for the sake of Christ Jesus." People who opposed Paul's preaching had punished him by putting him into prison.

# brother

Here this means a fellow Christian.

# our dear friend

The word "our" here refers to Paul and those with him but not to the reader. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

# and fellow worker

"who, like us, works to spread the gospel"
