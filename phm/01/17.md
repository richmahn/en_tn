## If then you regard me a partner ##

"If you think of me as a fellow worker for Christ"

## charge that to my own account ##

This can be translated as "charge it to me" or "say that I am the one who owes you."

## I, Paul, write with mine own hand ##

This could be translated as "I, Paul, write this myself." Paul wrote this so that Philemon would know that the words were true; Paul really would pay him.

## I will repay it ##

"I will pay you what he owes you"

## I do not mention to you ##

This can be translated as "I do not need to remind you" or "You know."

## you owe me your very life ##

"you owe me your own life."  The reason Philemon owed Paul his life can be made explicit: "you owe me much because I saved your life" or "you owe me your own life because what I told you saved your life."  Paul was implying that Philemon should not say that Onesimus or Paul owed him anything because Onesimus owed Paul even more. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

## refresh my heart ##

This can be translated as "make my heart glad" or "make me glad" or "comfort me." How Paul wanted Onesimus to do this can be made explicit: "refresh my heart by accepting Onesimus kindly."
