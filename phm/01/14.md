# But I did not want to do anything without your consent

Paul states a double negative to mean the opposite. AT: "But I wanted to keep him with me only if you approved" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])

# I did not want your good deed to be from necessity but from good will

"I did not want you to do this good deed because I commanded you to do it, but because you wanted to do it"

# but from good will

"but because you freely chose to do the right thing"

# Perhaps for this he was separated from you for a time, so that

This can be stated in active form. AT: "Perhaps the reason God took Onesimus away from you for a time was so that" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# for a time

"during this time"

# better than a slave

"more valuable than a slave"

# a beloved brother

"a dear brother" or "a precious brother in Christ"

# much more so to you

"he means even more to you"

# in both the flesh

"both as a man." Paul is referring to Onesimus' being a trustworthy servant. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# in the Lord

"as a brother in the Lord" or "because he belongs to the Lord"
