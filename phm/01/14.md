# But I did not want to do anything without your consent

Paul states a double negative to mean the opposite. Alternate translation: "But I wanted to keep him with me only if you approved" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])

# I did not want your good deed to be from necessity but from good will

"I did not want you to do this good deed because I commanded you to do it, but because you wanted to do it"

# but from good will

"but because you freely chose to do the right thing"
