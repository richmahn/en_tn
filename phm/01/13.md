# in my chains ... while I am in chains

Prisoners were often bound in chains. Paul was in prison when he taught Onesimus and was still in prison when he wrote this letter. AT: "while I was in prison ... while I am in prison" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# so he could serve me for you

"so that, since you cannot be here, he might help me" or "so that he could help me in your place"

# for the sake of the gospel

Paul was in prison because he preached the gospel publicly. This can be stated explicitly. AT: "because I preach the gospel" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
