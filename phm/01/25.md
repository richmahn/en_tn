# May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit

The word "your" here refers to Philemon and all who met in his house. The words "your spirit" are a synecdoche and represent the people themselves. Alternate translation: "May our Lord Jesus Christ be kind to you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
