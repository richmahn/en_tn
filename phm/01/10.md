# General Information:

Onesimus is the name of a man. He was apparently Philemon's slave and had stolen something and ran away.

# my child Onesimus

"my son Onesimus." Paul speaks of the way he is friends with Onesimus as if it were the way a father and his son love each other. Onesimus was not Paul's actual son, but he received spiritual life when Paul taught him about Jesus, and Paul loved him. AT: "my spiritual son Onesimus" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Onesimus

The name "Onesimus" means "profitable" or "useful." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# whom I have fathered in my chains

Here "fathered" is a metaphor that means Paul converted Onesimus to Christ. AT: "who became my spiritual son when I taught him about Christ and he received new life while I was in my chains" or "who became like a son to me while I was in my chains" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# in my chains ... while I am in chains

Prisoners were often bound in chains. Paul was in prison when he taught Onesimus and was still in prison when he wrote this letter. AT: "while I was in prison ... while I am in prison" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# I have sent him back to you

Paul was probably sending Onesimus with another believer who carried this letter.

# who is my very heart

"Heart" is a metonym for inner life, or "motivation for living". AT: "who is my very motivation for living" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]]).
# so he could serve me for you

"so that, since you cannot be here, he might help me" or "so that he could help me in your place"

# for the sake of the gospel

Paul was in prison because he preached the gospel publicly. This can be stated explicitly. AT: "because I preach the gospel" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
