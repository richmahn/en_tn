Closing (13:11–13)\n\n### Who wrote the Book of 2 Corinthians?\n\nPaul was the author. He was from the city of Tarsus. He had been known as Saul in his early life. Before becoming a Christian, Paul was a Pharisee. He persecuted Christians. After he became a Christian, he traveled several times throughout the Roman Empire telling people about Jesus.\n\nPaul started the church in Corinth. He was staying in the city of Ephesus when he wrote this letter.\n\n### What is the Book of 2 Corinthians about?\n\nIn 2 Corinthians, Paul continued to write about the conflicts among the Christians in the city of Corinth. It is clear in this letter that the Corinthians had obeyed his previous instructions to them. In 2 Corinthians, Paul encouraged them to live in a way that would please God.\n\nPaul also wrote to assure them that Jesus Christ sent him as an apostle to preach the Gospel. Paul wanted them to understand this, because a group of Jewish Christians opposed what he was doing. They claimed Paul was not sent by God and he was teaching a false message. This group of Jewish Christians wanted Gentile Christians to obey the law of Moses.\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nTranslators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “Second Corinthians.” Or they may choose a clearer title, such as “Paul’s Second Letter to the Church in Corinth.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### What was the city of Corinth like?\n\nCorinth was a major city located in ancient Greece. Because it was near the Mediterranean Sea, many travelers and traders came to buy and sell goods there. This resulted in the city having people from many different cultures. The city was famous for having people who lived in immoral ways. The people worshipped Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love. As part of the ceremonies honoring Aphrodite, her worshipers had sexual intercourse with temple prostitutes.\n\n### What did Paul mean by “false apostles” (11:13)?\n\nThese were Jewish Christians. They taught that Gentile Christians had to obey the law of Moses in order to follow Christ. Christian leaders had met in Jerusalem and decided on the matter (See: Acts 15). However, it is clear that there were still some groups that disagreed with what the leaders in Jerusalem decided.\n\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\n\n### Singular and plural “you”\n\nIn this book, the word “I” refers to Paul. Also, the word “you” is almost always plural and refers to the believers in Corinth. There are two exceptions to this: 6:2 and 12:9. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]] and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])\n\n### How are the ideas of “holy” and “sanctify” represented in 2 Corinthians in the ULT?\n\nThe scriptures use such words to indicate any one of various ideas. For this reason, it is often difficult for translators to represent them well in their versions. In translating into English, the ULT uses the following principles:\n* Sometimes the meaning in a passage implies moral holiness. Especially important for understanding the gospel is the fact that God considers Christians to be sinless because they are united to Jesus Christ. Another related fact is that God is perfect and faultless. A third fact is that Christians are to conduct themselves in a blameless, faultless manner in life. In these cases, the ULT uses “holy,” “holy God,” “holy ones,” or “holy people.”\n* The meaning in most passages in 2 Corinthians is a simple reference to Christians without implying any particular role filled by them. In these cases, the ULT uses “believer” or “believers.” (See: 1:1; 8:4; 9:1, 12; 13:13)\n* Sometimes the meaning in the passage implies the idea of someone or something set apart for God alone. In these cases, the ULT uses “set apart,” “dedicated to,” “reserved for,” or “sanctified.”\n\nThe UST will often be helpful as translators think about how to represent these ideas in their own versions.\n\n### What did Paul mean by expressions like “in Christ” and “in the Lord”?\n\nThis kind of expression occurs in 1:19, 20; 2:12, 17; 3:14; 5:17, 19, 21; 10:17; 12:2, 19; and 13:4. Paul meant to express the idea of a very close union with Christ and the believers. At the same time, he often intended other meanings as well. See, for example, “A door was opened for me in the Lord,” (2:12) where Paul specifically meant that a door was opened for Paul by the Lord.\n\nPlease see the introduction to the Book of Romans for more details about this kind of expression.\n\n### What does it mean to be a “new creation” in Christ (5:17)?\n\nPaul’s message was that God makes Christians part of a “new world” when a person believes in Christ. God gives a new world of holiness, peace, and joy. In this new world, believers have a new nature that has been given them by the Holy Spirit. Translators should try to express this idea.\n\n### What are the major issues in the text of the Book of 2 Corinthians?\n* “and in your love for us” (8:7). Many versions, including the ULT and UST, read this way. However, many other versions read, “and in our love for you.” There is strong evidence that each reading is original. Translators should probably follow the reading preferred by other versions in their region.\n\n(See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
1:intro	tsh3				0	# 2 Corinthians 1 General Notes\n\n## Outline of Chapter One\n\n1. Paul greets and blesses the Corinthian Christians (1:1-2)\n1. Paul praises God for his comfort in affliction (1:3-1:11)\n1. Paul explains his conduct and his change of plans (1:12-2:4)\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nThe first paragraph reflects a common way to begin a letter in the ancient Near East.\n\n## Special Concepts\n\n### Comfort\n\nComfort is a major theme of this chapter. Paul explains that believers experience affliction because they belong to Jesus. When this happens, the Holy Spirit comforts them. Then they are able to comfort others. Paul wants the Corinthian believers to know that he is not exempt from terrible persecution but that God always rescues and comforts him, as well. He also wants them to know that God will do the same for them.\n\n\n### Paul’s integrity\n\n\nApparently, people in Corinth had been criticizing Paul, saying that he was not sincere and did not truly care about the Corinthian believers. Therefore, Paul refutes them by explaining his motives for what he was doing.\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### Rhetorical question\n\nPaul uses two rhetorical questions in 1:17 to defend himself against a charge of not being sincere. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])\n\n### Metaphorical “Yes and No”\n\nIn 1:17-20 Paul uses the words “yes” and “no” together to represent the attitudes and speech of a person who is unstable and easily changes his mind about what he wants to do. It seems that some people had been accusing Paul of being such a person, but he makes it clear that he is not. Instead, he imitates God who is always faithful, and Jesus, who faithfully fulfills all of the promises of God.  \n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### Holy Spirit as guarantee\n\nIn 1:22 Paul says that the Holy Spirit is the “guarantee” of all of God's promises, including eternal life with him. The term comes from business deals in which a person gives some valuable item to another person as a “guarantee” that the first person will pay the full amount of money that he owes. Other words for this idea include “pledge” or “down-payment.” Paul uses this idea to explain that, because believers experience the blessings of the Holy Spirit now, they can be sure that they will experience all of God’s given promises after they die. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/eternity]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/save]])\n\n### God as witness\n\nIn 1:23 Paul calls God to be a witness to his character, that he is being honest and faithful to the Corinthian believers. It is probable that Paul means this as an oath, in which it is expected that God would bear witness to what Paul is saying by dramatically punishing him or striking him dead if he is lying. Alternatively, he may intend that God will bear witness by affirming Paul's honesty to the Corinthian believers through the Holy Spirit.
1:1	mel3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	Παῦλος & τῇ ἐκκλησίᾳ τοῦ Θεοῦ τῇ οὔσῃ ἐν Κορίνθῳ	1	Your language may have a particular way of introducing the author of a letter and its intended audience.

Interrupted travel plans (1:15–2:13)\n     * The interruption and the reason for it (1:15–2:4)\n     * The person who caused grief (2:5–11)\n     * Travel to Troas and Macedonia (2:12–13)\n4. Paul’s ministry (2:14–7:4)\n     * The fragrance of Christ (2:14–17)\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### The previous letter\n\nIn [2:3–4](../02/03.md), [9](../02/09.md), Paul refers to a letter that he had already written and sent to the Corinthians. While a few scholars think this letter is 1 Corinthians, most likely we do not have this previous letter. Paul acknowledges that this previous letter might have “grieved” them, but he wants them to know that he wrote the letter because of his love for them. In your translation, make sure that these verses refer to a letter that Paul previously wrote, not to 2 Corinthians. \n\n### “Grieving” others\n\nPaul refers to “sorrow,” “grief,” and “grieving” others multiple times in [2:1–8](../02/01.md). These words refer to how people who are close friends can “grieve” or hurt each other by what they say and do. These words do not refer to physically hurting someone. Rather, they refer to hurting someone inside. Paul acknowledges that his letter might have “grieved” them, and he also indicates that one of the Corinthians has “grieved” fellow believers. Consider a natural way to refer to one person hurting or injuring another person inside. \n\n### The person who caused grief\n\nIn [2:5–11](../02/05.md), Paul refers to a person who has caused grief. Almost certainly, he has one specific person in mind. Paul is not clear about what this person did to cause the grief. He or she may have committed a sexual sin or stolen money from the church or opposed Paul’s authority. Whatever the person did, Paul chooses not to be specific about the person or what he or she did. Perhaps this is because he wants the Corinthians to forgive and show love to this person now that he or she has properly been disciplined by the church. In your translation, use general words for both the person and what the person did. \n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Aroma and fragrance\n\nIn [2:14–16](../02/14.md), Paul identifies himself and those who serve with him as an “aroma” or “fragrance.” Paul could be thinking in general of smells and odors, or he could be referring to the smell from incense and sacrifices offered during a “triumphal procession” (see [2:14](../02/14.md)), or he could be referring to the smell from sacrifices offered at the temple. Whatever exact smells Paul has in mind, he is clear that he and those with him are a smell that comes from Christ, and people react to it very differently: some think it is the smell of death, while others think it is the smell of life. Paul speaks in this way because smells spread throughout a whole area, and people have to react to them. Just like that, he and those with him spread the gospel throughout the world, and people have to respond to it. Further, just as some people like a smell and others hate it, so some people believe the gospel and receive life from God, while others reject the gospel and perish. If possible, preserve the “aroma” and “fragrance” language. If necessary, you could use a simile to express the idea. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Paul’s use of pronouns\n\nIn [2:1–13](../02/01.md), Paul consistently uses the first person singular to refer to himself and the second person plural to refer to the Corinthians. The only exception is in [2:11](../02/11.md), where Paul uses “we” to refer to himself and the Corinthians. However, in [2:14–17](../02/14.md), Paul uses “we” to refer to himself and those preaching the gospel with him. In these verses, “we” does not include the Corinthians. It is unclear exactly whom Paul includes in “we”: it could be just he and Titus, or he and the group that works with him, or he and everyone else who preaches the gospel. Consider natural ways to represent these changes in reference throughout the chapter. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])\n\n### Paul’s travel\n\nIn [2:12–13](../02/12.md), Paul describes some of his travels. Troas is a city on the west coast of what is now Turkey. Since Troas was a port city, most likely Paul sailed from there to Macedonia, which is the northern part of what is now Greece. Since Corinth is in southern Greece, Paul was not too far away from the Corinthians. Paul continues the description of what happened in Macedonia in [7:5–7](../07/05.md). Consider what information your readers need to know to understand Paul’s travels, and include what is necessary in your translation or in a footnote. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/names/troas]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/names/macedonia]])
2:1	wh9c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1	# Connecting Statement:\n\nHere, the word **For** introduces an explanation of what Paul said in [1:23](../01/23.md) about the reason why he did not visit Corinth, which was to “spare” them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different word or phrase that introduces an explanation. Alternate translation: “Here is why I have not come to Corinth:” or “So” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
2:1	wpd4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἐμαυτῷ τοῦτο τὸ μὴ	1	Here, the word **this** refers ahead to what Paul is about to say: **not to come to you again in sorrow**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make what **this** refers to explicit, or you could rephrase the sentence so that you do not use **this**. Alternate translation: “for myself what follows: not” or “for myself not” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
2:1	yz5q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐμαυτῷ	1	Here the phrase **for myself** indicates that Paul made this choice because of reasons he thought about. In other words, he was not forced to make this choice. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that indicates that someone made their own choice or decision. Alternate translation: “on my own” or “in my own mind” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
2:1	yrbk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	τὸ μὴ & ἐλθεῖν	1	Here the word **come** refers to traveling from somewhere else to Corinth to visit the Corinthians. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that identifies this kind of movement. Alternate translation: “not to travel” or “not to go” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])
2:1	ma6n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πάλιν	1	Here, the word **again** implies that Paul has already visited the Corinthians **in sorrow**. He does not give many details about this visit. It cannot be the first time that he visited the Corinthians, so he must have visited them again **in sorrow** sometimes between when he first met them and when he wrote this letter. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the implication more explicit. Alternate translation: “a second time” or “yet again” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:1	hu8y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐν λύπῃ	1	Here the ones who experience the **sorrow** could be: (1) Paul and the Corinthians. Alternate translation: “in sorrow for all of us” (2) just the Corinthians. Alternate translation: “in sorrow for you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:1	ij73		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐν λύπῃ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **sorrow**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “sorrowful” or “sad.” Alternate translation: “in a sorrowful way” or “in a way that makes us sad” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:2	jb50		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	Here, the word **For** introduces a reason why Paul is avoiding the “sorrow” he mentioned in [2:1](../02/01.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a reason. Alternate translation: “I decided that because” or “Indeed,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
2:2	q4aq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical	εἰ & ἐγὼ λυπῶ ὑμᾶς	1	Here Paul refers to a situation that has not happened and which he intends to keep from happening. He refers to the situation using the conditional form to indicate what would result from the situation if it did happen. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that refers to something that may not happen but that the author wishes to speak about. Alternate translation: “supposing that I myself grieved you” or “were I myself to grieve you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical]])
2:2	le34		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns	ἐγὼ λυπῶ	1	Here, the word **myself** emphasizes **I**. Consider using a natural way to emphasize **I** in your language. Alternate translation: “it is I myself who grieve” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns]])
2:2	nb6x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	καὶ τίς ὁ εὐφραίνων με, εἰ μὴ ὁ λυπούμενος ἐξ ἐμοῦ?	1	Paul does not ask this question because he is looking for information. Rather, he asks it to involve the Corinthians in what he is arguing. The question implies that the answer is “there is no one else.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea by using a strong negation. Alternate translation: “then there is no one cheering me up, except the one being grieved by me.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
2:2	mbbo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	τίς ὁ εὐφραίνων με, εἰ μὴ ὁ λυπούμενος	1	Here the author uses the singular form **the one** to refer in general to people, particularly to the Corinthians. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that refers in general to people. Alternate translation: “who are those cheering me up, except those being grieved” or “who are those cheering me up, except you who are being grieved” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])
2:2	mbag		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-exceptions	τίς ὁ εὐφραίνων με, εἰ μὴ ὁ λυπούμενος ἐξ ἐμοῦ	1	If it would appear in your language that Paul was making a statement here and then contradicting it, you could reword this question to avoid using an exception clause. Alternate translation: “is it not the one being grieved by me who is the only one cheering me up” or “is there any one cheering me up besides the one being grieved by me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-exceptions]])
2:2	x2vr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ὁ λυπούμενος ἐξ ἐμοῦ	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “the one whom I have grieved” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2:3	kxu2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἔγραψα	1	Here Paul refers to a letter he had already written to the Corinthians. Most likely, he wrote this letter sometime between 1 Corinthians and 2 Corinthians, but we do not have the letter. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make it clearer that Paul is referring to a letter that he already sent to the Corinthians. Alternate translation: “I wrote in my last letter” or “I sent you the previous letter that said” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:3	e7c4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	τοῦτο αὐτὸ	1	Here, the phrase **this same thing** refers to what Paul wrote in the previous letter. He could referring to: (1) what he just wrote in [2:1–2](../02/01.md). Alternate translation: “the same thing I am now writing” (2) the contents of the previous letter in general. Alternate translation: “those things” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
2:3	abty		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous	ἐλθὼν	1	Here, the phrase **having come** refers to something that an event that is still in the future for Paul but that would happen at the same as **I might not have sorrow**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces something that happens at the same time as another event in the future. Alternate translation: “whenever I came” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous]])
2:3	l9t0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	ἐλθὼν	1	Here, the word **come** refers to Paul’s plan to visit the Corinthians at some point.

2:3	v87i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	μὴ & λύπην σχῶ ἀφ’	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **sorrow**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “sorrowful” or “sad.” Alternate translation: “I might not become sorrowful because of” or “I might not be sad because of” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:3	owzn			ἀφ’ ὧν ἔδει με χαίρειν	1	Here, this clause could indicate that **it is necessary** for: (1) Paul to **rejoice** in the Corinthians. Alternate translation: “from those in which it is necessary for me to rejoice” (2) the Corinthians to give “joy” to Paul. Alternate translation: “from those for whom it is necessary to give me joy”
2:3	p4q2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	πεποιθὼς	1	Here, the phrase **having confidence** introduces a reason why Paul **wrote** the previous letter. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a reason. Alternate translation: “because I had confidence” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
2:3	b6f9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	πεποιθὼς	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **confidence**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “confident.” Alternate translation: “being confident” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:3	i5r6			ἡ ἐμὴ χαρὰ πάντων ὑμῶν ἐστιν	1	Here Paul could be stating that his **joy**: (1) leads to the Corinthians’ joy. Alternate translation: “my joy leads to your joy” (2) has the same source as the Corinthians’ joy.

2:3	gmyo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἡ ἐμὴ χαρὰ πάντων ὑμῶν ἐστιν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **joy**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “rejoice” or an adjective such as “joyful.” Alternate translation: “I am joyful and so you are joyful” or “I rejoice and so you rejoice” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:4	p4n6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1	Here, the word **For** introduces a further explanation about the letter that Paul **wrote** to them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces an explanation, or you could leave **For** untranslated. Alternate translation: “Indeed,” or “As it is,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
2:4	tl4m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἔγραψα	1	Here, the phrase **I wrote** again refers to the previous letter. See how you translated “I wrote” in [2:3](../02/03.md). Alternate translation: “I wrote that letter” or “I sent that previous letter” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:4	uch7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐκ & ἔγραψα ὑμῖν	1	Here Paul refers to “writing” **out of** something else. In his culture, this form referred to what the person was experiencing while they **wrote**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that refers to what an author experiences while they are writing something. Alternate translation: “I wrote to you as I experienced” or “I wrote to you while I felt” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
2:4	oz8a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐκ & πολλῆς θλίψεως καὶ συνοχῆς καρδίας	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **tribulation** and **anguish**, you could express the ideas by using verbs such as “suffer” and “distress.” Alternate translation: “as I suffered much and was distressed in my heart” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:4	vs7m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	συνοχῆς καρδίας	1	In Paul’s culture, the **heart** is the place where humans think and feel. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate **heart** by referring to the place where humans think and feel in your culture or by expressing the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “anguish of mind” or “emotional anguish” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
2:4	d5vf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	διὰ πολλῶν δακρύων	1	Here, the phrase **through many tears** indicates what Paul was doing while he **wrote** the letter. The word **tears** refers to the act of crying or weeping. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that indicates that a person is crying or weeping while they are doing something. Alternate translation: “with much crying” or “as I shed many tears” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
2:4	y0t3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	οὐχ ἵνα λυπηθῆτε, ἀλλὰ τὴν ἀγάπην ἵνα γνῶτε, ἣν ἔχω περισσοτέρως εἰς ὑμᾶς	1	If your language would not naturally put the negative statement before the positive statement, you could reverse the two clauses here. Alternate translation: “so that you might know the love that I have more abundantly for you, not so that you would be grieved” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
2:4	uc77		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	λυπηθῆτε	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who would do the action, the Paul implies that “he himself” would do it. Alternate translation: “I would grieve you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2:4	g826		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τὴν ἀγάπην & ἣν ἔχω περισσοτέρως εἰς ὑμᾶς	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **love**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “love.” Alternate translation: “how abundantly I love you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:4	zw13			περισσοτέρως εἰς ὑμᾶς	1	Here, the phrase **more abundantly** could indicate that: (1) Paul has “abundant” love for the Corinthians. Alternate translation: “most abundantly for you” or “very abundantly for you” (2) Paul loves the Corinthians more than he loves other people. Alternate translation: “more abundantly for you than I have for others”
2:5	xomm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	δέ	1	Here, the word **But** introduces a contrast with how Paul did not want to “grieve” them. Here he addresses how someone has **caused grief**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a contrast. Alternate translation: “However,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
2:5	xlxc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἰ & τις λελύπηκεν, οὐκ & λελύπηκεν	1	Here Paul is speaking as if someone causing **grief** were a hypothetical possibility, but he means that it is actually true. If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, and if your readers might misunderstand and think that what Paul is saying is not certain, then you could express the idea by indicating that someone has indeed **caused grief**. Alternate translation: “the person who caused grief has not grieved only” or “if anyone has caused grief, and it has happened, he has not grieved only” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
2:5	ln83		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	λελύπηκεν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **grief**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “grieve.” Alternate translation: “has grieved people” or “has caused others to grieve” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:5	j6bn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	οὐκ & λελύπηκεν	1	Here, Paul may be referring specifically to a man, especially if the way that he has **grieved** others is by sinning sexually. However, it is not certain that Paul is referring to a man here. Consider using a form that does not specify the gender of this person. Alternate translation: “that individual has not grieved only” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
2:5	d7fx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οὐκ ἐμὲ λελύπηκεν	1	Here Paul could be indicating that the person has: (1) **grieved** Paul some, but mostly the person has **grieved** the Corinthians. Alternate translation: “he has not grieved me much” (2) not **grieved** Paul at all but only the Corinthians. Alternate translation: “he has not grieved me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:5	rvpt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἀπὸ μέρους	1	Here, the phrase **in part** indicates that only some of an action or group is involved. In this case, Paul could be using **in part** to refer to: (1) how many of the Corinthians have been **grieved**. Alternate translation: “some of you” or “part of your group” (2) how much the Corinthians have been **grieved**. Alternate translation: “he has partially grieved you” or “you also in part” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
2:5	iva7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	ἀπὸ μέρους, ἵνα μὴ ἐπιβαρῶ πάντας ὑμᾶς	1	There are several ways to understood how the pieces of the sentence go together. You could translate the sentence so that: (1) **in order that I might not burden all of you** indicates the reason why Paul uses the phrase **in part**, which would refer to the Corinthians. Alternate translation: “you in part, which I say so that I might not burden all of you” (2) **in part** and **all of you** go together, and **in order that I might not burden** is a parenthetical statement explaining why Paul says **in part**. Alternate translation: “in part—which I say so that I might not burden—all of you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
2:5	or46		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	μὴ ἐπιβαρῶ	1	Here, to **burden** someone refers to placing a heavy object on someone’s back. Paul could be using the phrase **I might not burden** to refer to: (1) how he is trying to avoid saying too much about the situation. In other words, Paul uses the phrase **in part** because he does not want to make his words too strong, which would make the words like a person carrying a heaven load. Alternate translation: “I might not say too much about” or “I might not exaggerate about” (2) how he wants to avoid troubling or distressing all of them, which would be like “burdening” them with a heavy object. Alternate translation: “I might not distress” or “I might not trouble” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:6	wr3k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τῷ τοιούτῳ ἡ ἐπιτιμία αὕτη	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **punishment**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “punish.” Alternate translation: “How such a person has been punished” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:6	iy4r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	ἡ ἐπιτιμία αὕτη	1	Here, the word **This** indicates that both Paul and the Corinthians knew what the **punishment** was. However, Paul never states exactly what the punishment was. You should use a word or phrase that is as general as what Paul used. Alternate translation: “That punishment” or “The punishment” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])
2:6	g3eo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	τῷ τοιούτῳ	1	Here Paul speaks in general terms about **such a {person}**. However, he is referring more specifically to the person that he mentioned in the previous verse, the one who “grieved” the Corinthians (see [2:5](../02/05.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this reference more explicit. Alternate translation: “on the person we are talking about” or “on that individual” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
2:6	z2dt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τῶν πλειόνων	1	Here, the word **majority** refers to more than half of a group. Often it means most of the group. If it would be helpful in your language, you could clarify that Paul is referring to “most” of the Corinthians. Alternate translation: “almost all of you” or “the majority of your group” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
2:6	d7b7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	τῶν πλειόνων	1	Here the phrase **the majority** implies a “minority.” These are some of the Corinthians who either did not agree with the **punishment** or who thought that the person had done nothing wrong. Paul does not give any information about this “minority,” however, so you should use a word or phrase that refers to most of the people in a group. Alternate translation: “all but a few of you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])
2:6	a7c4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἱκανὸν	1	Here, the word **sufficient** could indicate that the **punishment**: (1) has been severe enough. Alternate translation: “is severe enough” or “is sufficiently strong” (2) has lasted long enough. Alternate translation: “has lasted long enough” or “can end now” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:7	we1i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	τοὐναντίον μᾶλλον ὑμᾶς χαρίσασθαι	1	Here, the words **on the contrary** and **rather** indicate that Paul wishes the Corinthians to do now the opposite of what they were doing. Instead of “punishing” the person, Paul wants them now to **forgive and comfort** the person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use words that naturally indicate such a change in behavior. Alternate translation: “in contrast, you should instead forgive” or “instead of doing that, you should change your behavior and forgive” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
2:7	w4n6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	παρακαλέσαι & τῇ	1	Here, just as in [2:5](../02/05.md), Paul may be referring specifically to a man, especially if the way that he has “grieved” others is by sinning sexually. However, it is not certain that Paul is referring to a man here. Consider using a form that does not specify the gender of this person. Alternate translation: “comfort the individual … any” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
2:7	vpx1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	μή πως τῇ περισσοτέρᾳ λύπῃ, καταποθῇ ὁ τοιοῦτος	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “so that excessive sorrow might not overwhelm such a person” or “so that such a person might not experience overwhelming and excessive sorrow” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2:7	i3dm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	μή πως τῇ περισσοτέρᾳ λύπῃ καταποθῇ ὁ τοιοῦτος	1	Here Paul speaks as if a person could be **overwhelmed** or swallowed up by **sorrow**. He speaks in this way to indicate that a person can experience so much **sorrow** that it controls and destroys them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable figure of speech or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “so that such a person might not be overcome by excessive sorrow” or “so that such a person might not despair because of his excessive sorrow” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:7	me4y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ὁ τοιοῦτος	1	Here Paul speaks in general terms about **such a {person}**. However, he is referring more specifically to the person that he has already mentioned, the one who “grieved” the Corinthians (see [2:5](../02/05.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this reference more explicit. See how the translated this phrase in [2:6](../02/06.md). Alternate translation: “the person we are talking about” or “that individual” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
2:7	cgil		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τῇ περισσοτέρᾳ λύπῃ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **sorrow**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “sorrowful” or “sad.” Alternate translation: “as he is excessively sorrowful” or “because he is excessively sad” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:8	r916		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	διὸ	1	# Connecting Statement:\n\nHere, the word **So** introduces an exhortation that is based on what Paul said in the previous verse about “forgiving” and “comforting” the person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces an exhortation or inference. Alternate translation: “Because of that,” or “So then” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
2:8	ii0x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	κυρῶσαι εἰς αὐτὸν ἀγάπην	1	Here, the phrase **for him** could go with: (1) **love**. Alternate translation: “to reaffirm the love that you have for him” (2) **reaffirm**. Alternate translation: “to reaffirm to him your love” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
2:8	yi2z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	εἰς & ἀγάπην	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **love**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “love.” Alternate translation: “that you love” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:8	vlmy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	αὐτὸν	1	Here, just as in [2:5](../02/05.md), [7](../02/07.md), Paul may be referring specifically to a man, especially if the way that he has “grieved” others is by sinning sexually. However, it is not certain that Paul is referring to a man here. Consider using a form that does not specify the gender of this person. Alternate translation: “that individual” or “the person” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
2:9	oadd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1	Here, the word **Indeed** introduces more information about the letter that Paul wrote to them (see [2:3–4](../02/03.md)). It does not identify a close link with the previous verse. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different word or phrase that introduces further explanation, or you could leave **Indeed** untranslated. Alternate translation: “In fact” or “As a matter of fact” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
2:9	lc78		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καὶ ἔγραψα	1	Here, the phrase **I also wrote** again refers to the letter that Paul sent to them before he wrote 2 Corinthians.

2:9	pp4j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	εἰς τοῦτο & ἵνα	1	Here, the phrases **for this reason** and **so that** both introduce the purpose for which Paul **wrote** the previous letter. Paul uses this repetition to emphasize his purpose. If the repetition would be confusing in your language, and if it would not emphasize the purpose, you could combine the two phrases and provide emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “so that” or “in order that” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
2:9	eebj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τὴν δοκιμὴν ὑμῶν	1	Here, the word **proof** refers primarily to the results of a test or trial. In this case, Paul is saying that he wants to **know** how they passed the test, which were the commands he included in the previous letter. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to the results of a test. Alternate translation: “how you responded to my commands” or “your character” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
2:9	uzsx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τὴν δοκιμὴν ὑμῶν	1	Here Paul uses the possessive form to describe a **proof** that the Corinthians give or provide.

Alternate translation: “the prove you provide” or “the proof from you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
2:9	gs2t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τὴν δοκιμὴν ὑμῶν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **proof**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “prove.” Alternate translation: “what you would prove to me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:9	xw5t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὑπήκοοί	1	Here, Paul does not state to whom they are **obedient**. He could be implying that they are **obedient** to: (1) him as an apostle. Alternate translation: “obedient to me” (2) God and God’s commands. Alternate translation: “obedient to God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:10	r7ib		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	δέ	1	Here, the word **Now** introduces a development in Paul’s argument. In this case, Paul is concluding his discussion about the previous letter. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a development or a conclusion, or you could leave **Now** untranslated. Alternate translation: “Finally,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
2:10	o14x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ᾧ & τι χαρίζεσθε, κἀγώ	1	Here Paul could be making: (1) a specific statement about forgiving the person who “grieved” the Corinthians. Alternate translation: “to that person to whom you forgive anything, I also forgive” (2) a general concluding statement about forgiveness. Alternate translation: “to any person to whom you forgive anything, I also forgive” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:10	uzvm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	κἀγώ	1	This clause leaves out some words that many languages might need to be complete. If it would be helpful in your language, you could supply these words from the first half of the sentence. Alternate translation: “I also forgive it” or “I also forgive them for it” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
2:10	tzn1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	καὶ γὰρ	1	Here, the phrase **for indeed** indicates that Paul is adding more information (**indeed**) that supports what he said in the previous clause (**for**). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use words that introduce added information that supports a previous statement. Alternate translation: “further,” or “and in fact,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
2:10	d9ah		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	καὶ γὰρ ἐγὼ ὃ κεχάρισμαι, εἴ τι κεχάρισμαι, δι’ ὑμᾶς	1	Here Paul includes the comment **if I have forgiven anything** in the middle of his sentence. Consider what may be a natural place to include extra information like this. Alternate translation: “for indeed, if I have forgiven anything, what I have forgiven is for your sake” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
2:10	avqv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	εἴ τι κεχάρισμαι	1	This clarification fits with what Paul said in [2:5](../02/05.md) about how the person did not “grieve” him but rather the Corinthians. Much like there, Paul could be saying that: (1) he does not have very much to forgive, since the person only hurt him a little. Alternate translation: “what little I had to forgive” (2) he really has nothing to forgive, since the person hurt the Corinthians, not him. Alternate translation: “although there was nothing to forgive” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:10	cbm6			δι’ ὑμᾶς	1	Here, the phrase **for your sake** could mean that: (1) Paul forgives the person to benefit or help the Corinthians.

2:10	b6uy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐν προσώπῳ Χριστοῦ	1	Here, the phrase **in the presence of Christ** could indicate that: (1) Paul forgives because he knows that **Christ** sees or knows what he does. So, he acts in a way that pleases **Christ**. Alternate translation: “as Christ desires” or “with Christ watching” (2) Paul forgives with **Christ** as witness. Alternate translation: “with Christ as witness” or “with Christ guaranteeing it” (3) Paul forgives as someone who represents **Christ**. Alternate translation: “as one who represents Christ” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:10	nq4n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐν προσώπῳ Χριστοῦ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **presence**, you could express the idea by using a phrase that refers to being close to or in front of **Christ**. Alternate translation: “in front of Christ” or “before Christ” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:11	xaoc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	ἵνα	1	Here, the phrase **so that** introduces the purpose for which Paul and Corinthians should “forgive” others (see [2:10](../02/10.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a purpose. Alternate translation: “in order that” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
2:11	xoaw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	μὴ πλεονεκτηθῶμεν ὑπὸ τοῦ Σατανᾶ	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “Satan would not take advantage of us” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2:11	x3p2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	μὴ πλεονεκτηθῶμεν	1	Here, the phrase **taken advantage of** refers to when someone gains power or control over someone else, usually by using some area in which that person is weak. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to how someone gains power or control over someone else. Alternate translation: “we would not be exploited” or “we would not be dominated” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
2:11	z6no		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	Here, the word **For** introduces a further explanation of what Paul said in the first half of verse about **Satan**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different word or phrase that introduces further explanation. Alternate translation: “because” or “inasmuch as” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
2:11	m46t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes	οὐ & αὐτοῦ τὰ νοήματα ἀγνοοῦμεν	1	Here the author uses a figure of speech that expresses a strong positive meaning by using a negative word together with a word that is the opposite of the intended meaning.

Alternate translation: “we are fully aware of his schemes” or “we are very knowledgeable about his schemes” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
2:12	nh7u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1	Here, the word **Now** introduces a new section. Paul has finished speaking about the person that he and the Corinthians should forgive. He now returns to the topic of his travel plans and why he has not visited the Corinthians (see [1:8–23](../01/08.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a new topic or section, or you could leave **Now** untranslated. Alternate translation: “Moving on,” or “I wish to speak again about my journeys:” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
2:12	l6vd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	ἐλθὼν & εἰς	1	# Connecting Statement:\n\nHere, the phrase **having come to** refers to arriving in one place or city from another, in this case probably traveling on land. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to this kind of movement. Alternate translation: “having traveled to” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])
2:12	c14o		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	εἰς τὸ εὐαγγέλιον τοῦ Χριστοῦ, καὶ θύρας & ἀνεῳγμένης	1	This clause gives information that contrasts with what Paul will say in the previous verse about how he left **Troas**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could indicate this contrast with a natural form. Alternate translation: “and although a door for the gospel of Christ had been opened” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
2:12	a1ti		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	εἰς τὸ εὐαγγέλιον τοῦ Χριστοῦ, καὶ θύρας μοι ἀνεῳγμένης	1	Here Paul speaks of God providing opportunities for him to preach the **gospel** as if God were “opening” a **door** for the **Gospel**. The image is of God opening a door so that Paul can go in and preach the message about Christ. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “and an opportunity to preach the gospel of Christ having been given to me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:12	n9cr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	εἰς τὸ εὐαγγέλιον τοῦ Χριστοῦ, καὶ θύρας μοι ἀνεῳγμένης ἐν Κυρίῳ	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. In this case, Paul could be stating the the **Lord** did it, or he could be implying that “God” did it **in the Lord**. See the note about **in the Lord**. Alternate translation: “and the Lord having opened a door for the gospel of Christ for me” or “and God having opened a door for the Gospel of Christ for me in the Lord” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2:12	vtg5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τὸ εὐαγγέλιον τοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	Here Paul uses the possessive form to describe **the gospel** that could: (1) be about **Christ**. Alternate translation: “the gospel concerning Christ” (2) belong to **Christ**. Alternate translation: “Christ’s gospel” or “the gospel from Christ” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
2:12	fcf7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐν Κυρίῳ	1	Here Paul uses the spatial metaphor **in the Lord** to describe his union with Christ. In this case, being **in the Lord**, or united to the Lord, shows that the **door** was **opened** to Paul: (1) by the **Lord**. Alternate translation: “by the Lord” (2) so that he could continue to serve in his union with the **Lord**. Alternate translation: “in my union with the Lord” or “so that I can do what the Lord wants” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:12	m7x6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	Κυρίῳ	1	Here, the word **Lord** could refer to: (1) Jesus the Messiah. Alternate translation: “the Lord, the Messiah” (2) God generally. Alternate translation: “the Lord God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:13	rjy9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	οὐκ ἔσχηκα ἄνεσιν τῷ πνεύματί μου	1	Here, the clause **I had no relief in my spirit** indicates that Paul was anxious or concerned.

2:13	k7k9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οὐκ ἔσχηκα ἄνεσιν τῷ πνεύματί μου	1	Here Paul does not clarify what he was concerned or anxious about. He clarifies later in [7:5–16](../07/05.md) that he was anxious to know how Titus’ visit to the Corinthians went. The Corinthians would have made this inference, since Titus had already visited them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this information more explicit. Alternate translation: “I had no relief in my spirit about Titus’ visit to you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:13	trp2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	οὐκ ἔσχηκα ἄνεσιν τῷ πνεύματί μου	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **relief**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “restful” or “relieved.” Alternate translation: “my spirit was not restful” or “my spirit was not relieved” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:13	w79i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	μὴ εὑρεῖν με Τίτον τὸν ἀδελφόν μου	1	Here Paul is stating that **Titus** was not in Troas, not that he simply could not find him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that shows that **Titus** was not in the city of Troas when Paul visited there. Alternate translation: “as I found out that my brother Titus was not there” or “as my brother Titus was not in the city” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:13	xd5h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	Τίτον τὸν ἀδελφόν μου	1	Here Paul speaks of **Titus** as if he were his **brother** (probably a younger **brother**). He speaks in this way to indicate that **Titus** is a fellow believer and that he and Paul are as close as if they they were brothers. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a simile or plain language to express this idea. Alternate translation: “Titus, who is like my own brother,” or “my very dear friend and fellow believer Titus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:13	wq6j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀποταξάμενος αὐτοῖς	1	Here Paul refers to how he **said farewell** to the people from Troas, but he also means that he left their city. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “having said farewell to them and departed” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:13	j9je		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	αὐτοῖς	1	Here, the word **them** refers to the friends that Paul made in the city of “Troas” (see [2:12](../02/12.md)). Most likely, these people were fellow believers. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make to whom **them** refers more explicit. Alternate translation: “to the people from Troas” or “to my friends in Troas” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
2:13	gxp2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	ἐξῆλθον εἰς	1	Here, the phrase **went on to** refers to travel in which a person leaves one area and goes to another area. Use a word or phrase that refers to this kind of movement in your language. Alternate translation: “I departed from there to go to” or “I went from there to” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])
2:14	s6k3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1	Here, the word **But** introduces a new section. Paul will not speak again about Titus and his travel plans until [7:5](../07/05.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a new section or topic, or you could leave **But** untranslated. Alternate translation: “But now,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
2:14	g39s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	τῷ & Θεῷ χάρις	1	Here, the phrase **thanks {be} to God** is a way to indicate that one is praising God for something. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this phrase with a normal way in your language to thank or praise someone for what that person has done. Alternate translation: “we thank God” or “we give glory to God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
2:14	qgok		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἡμᾶς & ἡμῶν	1	Here, the word **us** does not include the Corinthians. It could refer to: (1) Paul and those who proclaim the gospel with him.

2:14	gpd2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τῷ πάντοτε θριαμβεύοντι ἡμᾶς	1	Here Paul speaks as if **God** were a leader who had won a victory and set up a parade or **triumphal procession** to celebrate. In this parade, Paul and those with him could be either or both of the following: (1) prisoners who have been conquered and who are put in the parade to illustrate the victory. This is the normal meaning of the word in other places. Alternate translation: “always parading us as his captives” or “always showing that he leads us” (2) soldiers who helped win the victory and who are celebrating. This is not the normal meaning of the word, but it is possible and fits the context well. Alternate translation: “always having us participate in his triumphal parade” or “always helping us to conquer” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:14	so2k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐν τῷ Χριστῷ	1	Paul uses the spatial metaphor **in Christ** to describe the union of believers with Christ. In this case, being **in Christ**, or united to Christ, explains why or how they are involved in the **triumphal procession**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a phrase that indicates that union with Christ is the reason or the means for participating in the **procession**. Alternate translation: “because of our union with Christ” or “by means of our union with Christ” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:14	l1nr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor	τὴν ὀσμὴν τῆς γνώσεως αὐτοῦ, φανεροῦντι δι’ ἡμῶν ἐν παντὶ τόπῳ	1	Here Paul speaks as if **the knowledge of him** were an **aroma**, a smell or odor. In this case, the context implies that this is a pleasing or good smell. He speaks in this way to indicate that everyone hears and reacts to the message about Christ, just like everyone smells and reacts to a strong odor. Also, just like a smell fills a whole room, so the good news fills **every place** on earth. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea by using a simile or plain language. Consider using a form that you can continue to use in the following two verse, in which Paul continues the **aroma** metaphor. Alternate translation: “making known through us and in every place the knowledge of him, which is like an good smell” or “powerfully revealing through us the knowledge of him, which is spreading into every place” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])
2:14	tlqe		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τὴν ὀσμὴν τῆς γνώσεως αὐτοῦ	1	Here Paul uses the possessive form to describe an **aroma** that is **knowledge**. In other words, the possessive indicates what the **aroma** stands for. Then, Paul indicates that this **knowledge** is about **him**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the ideas in a more natural way. Alternate translation: “the aroma, which is knowledge about him” or “the aroma, that is, knowing him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
2:14	ihbw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τῆς γνώσεως αὐτοῦ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **knowledge**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “know.” Alternate translation: “that is knowing him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

2:14	eq21		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	ἐν παντὶ τόπῳ	1	Here Paul speaks as if God used him and those with him to make God known **in every place**. The Corinthians would have understood him to mean that God uses them to make God known in many places, or in every place that they visit. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea clearer. Alternate translation: “in every place we go” or “throughout the world” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
2:15	cjjj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	ὅτι	1	Here, the word **For** introduces an explanation of what Paul said in the previous verse about “the aroma” ([2:14](../02/14.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces further explanation. Alternate translation: “Indeed,” or “Here is what I mean:” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
2:15	yfx6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἐσμὲν	1	Here, just as in [2:14](../02/14.md), the word **we** does not include the Corinthians. It could refer to: (1) Paul and those who proclaim the gospel with him. Alternate translation: “we who preach are” (2) just Paul. Alternate translation: “I am” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
2:15	x6nn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor	Χριστοῦ εὐωδία ἐσμὲν τῷ Θεῷ	1	Here Paul continues to speak about **fragrance** and good smells (see [2:14](../02/14.md)). Here, he identifies himself and those with him as a **fragrance** that comes from **Christ** and which goes toward **God**. By speaking in this way, he shows that **we** are those who represent or declare who Christ is in the presence of God. Just like everyone smells a good smell and knows where it comes from, so everyone notices Paul and those with him and realizes that they represent **Christ** before **God**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a simile or express the idea in plain language. Make sure that your translation fits with the previous and the following verses. Alternate translation: “we are like a good odor that spreads from Christ before God” or “we represent Christ before God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])
2:15	b1k1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	Χριστοῦ εὐωδία	1	Here Paul uses the possessive form to indicate that the **fragrance** could: (1) come or spread from **Christ**. Alternate translation: “a fragrance from Christ” (2) be presented or offered by **Christ**. Alternate translation: “a fragrance that Christ presents” or “a fragrance that Christ offers” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
2:15	itc8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τοῖς σῳζομένοις	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who does the action, Paul implies that “God” does it. Alternate translation: “the ones whom God is saving” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2:15	ze7n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	τοῖς ἀπολλυμένοις	1	Christians disagree over whether God causes people to “perish” or whether people cause themselves to “perish.” The word that Paul uses here intentionally does not include the person who causes the **perishing**. If possible, your translation also should avoid stating who causes the “perishing.” Alternate translation: “the ones on the path to destruction” or “the ones who are not being saved” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])
2:16	zrae		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	οἷς μὲν & οἷς δὲ	1	Here, the word **indeed** indicates that the author is introducing the first of two parts. The word **but** introduces the second part. The author uses this form to contrast “the ones perishing” and “the ones being saved” (see [2:15](../02/15.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that naturally contrasts two groups of people. Alternate translation: “on one hand, to the ones … but on the other hand, to the others” or “to the ones … but to the others” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
2:16	pv6o		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	οἷς μὲν ὀσμὴ ἐκ θανάτου εἰς θάνατον, οἷς δὲ ὀσμὴ ἐκ ζωῆς εἰς ζωήν	1	Here Paul refers to “the ones perishing” before he refers to “the ones being saved,” which is the opposite of the order he used in [2:15](../02/15.md). This was good style in his culture. If reversing the order from [2:15](../02/15.md) would be confusing for your readers, and if it would not be good style, you could reverse the order here to match that in [2:15](../02/15.md). Alternate translation: “to the ones indeed, an aroma from life to life, but to the others, an aroma from death to death” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
2:16	t3vw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	οἷς	-1	Here, the phrase **to the ones** refers to “the ones perishing,” and the phrase **to the {others}** refers to “the ones being saved” (see [2:15](../02/15.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could clarify to whom these phrases refer. Alternate translation: “to the latter … to the former” or “to the ones perishing … to the ones being saved” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
2:16	dwk6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor	ὀσμὴ	-1	Here Paul continues to speak about **fragrance** and good smells (see [2:14–15](../02/14.md)). He specifically explains what kind of **aroma** he and those with him are. Those who do not believe think that the **aroma** smells bad, while those who do believe think that the **aroma** smells good. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a simile or express the idea plainly. Make sure that your translation fits with how you translated the “smelling” language in [2:14–15](../02/14.md). Alternate translation: “we smell like an aroma … we smell like an aroma” or “our message is … our message is” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])
2:16	ud2u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐκ θανάτου εἰς θάνατον & ἐκ ζωῆς εἰς ζωήν	1	Here Paul uses the words **from** and **to** with the same word. He could be using this form because: (1) **from** indicates the source of the **aroma**, and **to** indicates the effects of the **aroma**. Alternate translation: “that smells like death and leads to death … that smells like life and leads to life” or “of death causing death … of life causing life” (2) **from** and **to** together emphasize that the **aroma** is characterized completely by either **death** or **life**. Alternate translation: “of death … of life” or “characterized completely by death … characterized completely by life” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
2:16	yau5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐκ θανάτου εἰς θάνατον & ἐκ ζωῆς εἰς ζωήν	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **death** and **life**, you could express the ideas by using verbs such as “die” and “live” or adjectives such as “dead” and “alive.” Make sure your translation fits with the option you chose in the previous note. Alternate translation: “that comes from something dying and that leads to people dying … that comes from something living and leads to people living” or “that smells like something dead … that smells like something alive” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:16	cdr3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	πρὸς ταῦτα	1	Here, the phrase **these things** refers back to what those who proclaim the good news must do, things that Paul has outlined in [2:14–16](../02/14.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could make explicit what **these things** refers to. Alternate translation: “to do what I have said” or “to preach the gospel like this” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
2:16	be6x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	πρὸς ταῦτα τίς ἱκανός?	1	Paul does not ask this question because he is looking for information. Rather, he asks it to involve the Corinthians in what he is arguing. The question could imply that the answer is that: (1) no one is **sufficient**. Alternate translation: “for these things, nobody is sufficient!” (2) Paul and those with him are **sufficient**. Alternate translation: “for these things, we are indeed sufficient” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
2:17	h7y1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γάρ	1	Here, the word **For** could introduce: (1) a basis or proof for why he and those with him are not “sufficient,” as the previous question implied (see [2:16](../02/16.md)). Alternate translation: “You can tell that we are not sufficient because” (2) an answer to the previous question that indicates that Paul and those with him are “sufficient.” Alternate translation: “But we are sufficient, because” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
2:17	pmpz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἐσμεν & λαλοῦμεν	1	Here, just as in [2:14–15](../02/14.md), the word **we** does not include the Corinthians. It could refer to: (1) Paul and those who proclaim the gospel with him. Alternate translation: “we who preach are … we speak” (2) just Paul. Alternate translation: “I am … I speak” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
2:17	a5sa		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τὸν λόγον	1	Here, the word **word** represents what someone says in words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “the words” or “the communication” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
2:17	u7ui		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	οἱ πολλοὶ	1	Paul is using the adjective **many** as a noun in order to refer **many** people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this one with a noun phrase. Alternate translation: “the many people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
2:17	yf8u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	καπηλεύοντες	1	Here, the word **peddling** refers to the practice of selling goods that one has. The word implies that the person who is **peddling** is trying to make as much profit as they can, both by honest and deceitful means. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to selling something for as much money as possible. Alternate translation: “trading in” or “selling off” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
2:17	ohh8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τὸν λόγον τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Here Paul uses the possessive form to describe **the word** that could be: (1) from **God**. Alternate translation: “the word from God” (2) about **God**. Alternate translation: “the word about God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
2:17	u4iy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	ἀλλ’ ὡς	-1	Here Paul uses **but as** to introduce a contrast with **the many** who “peddle” God’s word. Paul repeats **but as** to continue and emphasize this contrast, not to contrast **sincerity** and **from God**. If the repetition of **but as** would be confusing, you could use **but as** once and express the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “but instead as … and even more as” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
2:17	x86y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐξ εἰλικρινείας	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **sincerity**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “sincere.” Alternate translation: “those who are sincere” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:17	f9x4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὡς ἐκ Θεοῦ	1	Here, the phrase **as from God** indicates that God sent Paul and those with him to **speak** the gospel. The word **as** indicates how they **speak**. It does not mean that they are not really **from God**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “as those whom God has sent” or “as ones sent by God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:17	aizg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	λαλοῦμεν	1	Here, Paul implies that they are speaking **the word of God** that he already mentioned. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make what they **speak** more explicit. Alternate translation: “we speak the word of God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:17	vpdc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	κατέναντι Θεοῦ	1	Here, the phrase **in the presence of God** could indicate that: (1) they **speak** as they do because they know that **God** sees or knows what they do. So, they speak in a way that pleases **God**. Alternate translation: “as God desires” or “with God watching” (2) they **speak** with **God** as a witness guaranteeing what they say. Alternate translation: “with God as witness” or “with God guaranteeing it” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:17	q4dc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	κατέναντι Θεοῦ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **presence**, you could express the idea by using a phrase that refers to being close to or in front of **God**. Alternate translation: “in front of God” or “before God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:17	u2zb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐν Χριστῷ	1	Paul uses the spatial metaphor **in Christ** to describe the union of believers with **Christ**. In this case, being **in Christ**, or united to Christ, explains how they **speak**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a phrase that indicates that they **speak** as those who are united to **Christ**. Alternate translation: “as Christians” or “as those united to Christ” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:1	mdwx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἀρχόμεθα & ἑαυτοὺς & μὴ χρῄζομεν	1	Here, just as in [2:14–15](../02/14.md), [17](../02/17.md), the word **we** does not include the Corinthians. It could refer to: (1) Paul and those who proclaim the gospel with him. Alternate translation: “Are we who preach beginning … ourselves … we do not need … do we” (2) just Paul. Alternate translation: “Am I beginning … myself … I do not need … do I” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
3:intro	f7rh				0	# 2 Corinthians 3 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n4. Paul’s ministry (2:14–7:4)\n     * Qualification for ministry (3:1–6)\n     * Ministry of Moses and ministry of Paul (3:7–4:6)\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Letters of recommendation\n\nIn [3:1–3](../03/01.md), Paul refers to “letters of recommendation.” These were letters that a person carried with them when they traveled to a new place. Someone that the traveler knew would write down that the traveler could be trusted and should be welcomed, and the traveler would give this letter to people that he or she visited. If something like this is not a common practice in your culture, you may need to explain it for your readers in a footnote. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/letter]])\n\n### Letter and Spirit\n\nIn [3:6–8](../03/06.md), Paul contrasts “letter” and “Spirit.” In these verses, the word “letter” refers to the letters in the alphabet, and the word “Spirit” refers to the Holy Spirit. Paul’s point is that whatever is characterized by the “letter” is something that is only written down and does not have any power. Whatever is characterized by the “Spirit” has power and can change people. Although it also might be written down, the “Spirit” gives it power. Paul uses this contrast to describe one of the differences between the old covenant (“letter”) and the new covenant (“Spirit”). Consider a natural way to express this contrast in your language. \n\n### Glory\n\nThroughout this chapter, Paul speaks extensively of “glory.” He indicates that the old covenant and ministry had glory, but the new covenant and ministry have much more glory. The word “glory” refers to how great, powerful, and amazing someone or something is. Consider what term will express this idea throughout the chapter. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/glory]])\n\n### Veiling of the glory on Moses’ face\n\nIn [3:7](../03/07.md), [13](../03/13.md), Paul refers to a story about what happened when Moses received the Ten Commandments from God. Because he met God and spoke with him, Moses’ face became bright or shining. Because of that, Moses would cover his face with a veil or cloth after he spoke with God. You can read this story in [Exodus 34:29–35](../exo/34/29.md). Paul also notes that the brightness or “glory” on Moses’ face would fade away. This detail cannot be found directly in the story in Exodus. Paul either inferred it from the story, or it was tradition to say that the “glory” faded away. If your readers would not understand what Paul refers to in these verses, you could include a footnote or explanatory information. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/veil]])\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### The Corinthians as a letter of recommendation\n\nIn [3:2–3](../03/02.md), Paul describes the Corinthians as a letter of recommendation for him and those with him. He speaks in this way because anyone who knows the Corinthians will know that they believed because of Paul and those who worked with him. In this way, the Corinthians “recommend” Paul as a true apostle of Jesus. If possible preserve the metaphor of a letter of recommendation or express the idea with a simile. \n\n### The “veil”\n\nAfter he introduces how Moses put an actual “veil” over his face, Paul begins to use the word “veil” and related words in figurative ways (see [3:14–18](../03/14.md)). He claims that people who are not united to Christ cannot understand the Old Testament, and he describes this as a “veil” that covers their hearts. In other words, just as the Israelites could not see the glory on Moses’ face, so anyone who hears the Old Testament without believing in Jesus cannot fully understand it. However, Paul says that this “veil” is taken away when someone believes in Jesus. Because of that, those who believe have no “veil” and can reflect God’s glory even more than Moses’ did. This is a complex figure of speech that connects directly to the story about Moses and his veil. Because of that, it is important to preserve the “veil” language. If your readers would not understand that Paul is speaking figuratively, you could use a simile to express the idea. \n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### “The Lord is the Spirit”\n\nIn [3:17](../03/17.md), Paul states that “the Lord is the Spirit.” Scholars have understood this sentence in three primary ways. First, Paul could be defining who he meant when he referred to “the Lord” in the previous verse ([3:16](../03/16.md)). Second, Paul could be stating that the way that believers experience “the Lord” is as the Holy Spirit. Third, Paul could be stating that “the Lord” is a spirit or is spiritual. It is most likely true that Paul is defining who “the Lord” he has referred to is, so it is recommended that you follow the first option. See the notes on this verse for translation possibilities.
3:1	um8x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	ἀρχόμεθα πάλιν ἑαυτοὺς συνιστάνειν?	1	Paul does not ask this question because he is looking for information. Rather, he asks it to involve the Corinthians in what he is arguing. The question implies that the answer is “no, we are not.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea by using a strong negation. Alternate translation: “We are certainly not beginning to commend ourselves again!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
3:1	ogwa		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ἑαυτοὺς συνιστάνειν	1	Here, phrase **commend ourselves** refers to the practice of stating why one should be trusted and welcomed. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to giving reasons why people should welcome and trust a person. Alternate translation: “to speak favorably of ourselves” or “to vouch for ourselves” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
3:1	fuds		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πάλιν	1	Here, the word **again** implies that Paul and those with him had already “commended themselves” at some point in the past. Most likely, this happened when they first met the Corinthians. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that makes this more explicit. Alternate translation: “once more” or “again, like we did at first” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:1	noiz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	ἢ	1	The word **Or** introduces an alternate to what Paul asked in the first question. In that question, he implied that they were not “commending” themselves again. With **Or**, then, Paul asks a question that introduces the incorrect alternative: they might need **letters of recommendation**. He introduces this incorrect alternate to show that the implication of his first question is true: they are not “commending” themselves again. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express **Or** with a word that signifies a contrast or gives an alternative. Alternate translation: “Rather,” or “Quite the contrary:” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
3:1	y8yc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	ἢ μὴ χρῄζομεν, ὥς τινες, συστατικῶν ἐπιστολῶν πρὸς ὑμᾶς ἢ ἐξ ὑμῶν?	1	Paul does not ask this question because he is looking for information. Rather, he asks it to involve the Corinthians in what he is arguing. The question implies that the answer is “we do not need them.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea by using a strong negation. Alternate translation: “In fact, we certainly do not need, like some, letters of recommendation to you or from you.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
3:1	syny		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ὥς τινες	1	Here, the word **some** refers generally to other people besides Paul and those with him. Paul may more specifically have in mind the people who opposed him in Corinth, but he does not make this explicit. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to other people besides Paul and those who serve with him. Alternate translation: “like some others” or “like some people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
3:1	ad1u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	συστατικῶν ἐπιστολῶν	1	Here Paul uses the possessive form to refer to **letters** that gave a **recommendation** for the person who had the letter. Many people in Paul’s culture would ask friends to write these letters, and then they would show the letters to people they visited to prove that they were trustworthy and could be welcomed. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that naturally refers to this kind of letter. Alternate translation: “reference letters” or “letters of introduction” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
3:1	dygq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	συστατικῶν ἐπιστολῶν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **recommendation**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “recommend.” Alternate translation: “letters that recommend us” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
3:2	ty59		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἡ ἐπιστολὴ ἡμῶν ὑμεῖς ἐστε ἐνγεγραμμένη ἐν ταῖς καρδίαις ἡμῶν, γινωσκομένη καὶ ἀναγινωσκομένη ὑπὸ πάντων ἀνθρώπων	1	Here Paul continues to speak about “letters,” but now he tells the Corinthians that they are the **letter** of recommendation for Paul and those with him. This **letter** is not a physical document, but is **written** in their **hearts**, and **all men** can **read** it. Paul speaks in this way to indicate that the recommendation he relies on is the Corinthian believers. In other words, the fact that they believe and that they are close with Paul (**in our hearts**) shows that Paul is trustworthy and a true apostle. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea with a simile or in some other natural way. Alternate translation: “You yourselves are like our letter of recommendation, which you wrote on us and that is known and read by all men” or “We do not need a letter of recommendation because you yourselves are the recommendation that is in our hearts and that is known and understood by all men” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:2	f8s8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns	ὑμεῖς ἐστε	1	Here, the word translated **yourselves** emphasizes **You**. Consider using a natural way to emphasize **You** in your language. Alternate translation: “You indeed are” or “It is you who are” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns]])
3:2	a7xl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἡ ἐπιστολὴ ἡμῶν & ταῖς καρδίαις ἡμῶν	1	Here, just as in [3:1](../03/01.md), the word **our** does not include the Corinthians. It could refer to: (1) Paul and those who proclaim the gospel with him. Alternate translation: “the letter for us who preach the gospel … our hearts” (2) just Paul. Alternate translation: “my letter … my heart” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
3:2	ygx8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	ἡ ἐπιστολὴ ἡμῶν & ἐνγεγραμμένη	1	Here Paul uses the possessive form to describe a **letter** that could: (1) recommend “us.” Alternate translation: “the letter for us written” or “a letter that recommends us written” (2) be written by “us.” Alternate translation: “a letter written by us” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
3:2	v2e7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐνγεγραμμένη ἐν ταῖς καρδίαις ἡμῶν	1	In the Paul’s culture, **hearts** are the places where humans think and plan. What Paul means is that the recommendation from the Corinthians is not written down on paper but is rather part of their relationship with Paul. If it would be helpful in your language, you could refer to the place where humans think in your culture or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “written inside us” or “expressed by our relationship” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
3:2	ko7w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐνγεγραμμένη	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Paul states in the following verse that “Christ” did it (see [3:3](../03/03.md)). Alternate translation: “that Christ has written” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
3:2	bu1u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	γινωσκομένη καὶ ἀναγινωσκομένη ὑπὸ πάντων ἀνθρώπων	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the ideas in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “which all men know and read” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
3:2	pzpz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	γινωσκομένη καὶ ἀναγινωσκομένη	1	Here, the words **known** and **read** express very similar ideas. It is likely that **known** indicates that people are aware that there is a **letter**, while **read** indicates that they know what the **letter** says. If you do not have words that express these distinctions, and if the repetition would be confusing in your language, you could express the idea with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “read” or “noticed” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
3:2	dr5k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	πάντων ἀνθρώπων	1	Although the word **men** is masculine, Paul is using it to refer to all people, both men and women. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a non-gendered word or refer to both genders. Alternate translation: “every person” or “all men and women” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
3:3	s717		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	φανερούμενοι	1	Here, the phrase **making known** could: (1) indicate that something is well-known or obvious to people. Alternate translation: “being clear” or “so it is evident” (2) state that the Corinthians show or reveal something to others. Alternate translation: “you making it clear” or “you revealing” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:3	aylw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐστὲ ἐπιστολὴ Χριστοῦ, διακονηθεῖσα ὑφ’ ἡμῶν, ἐνγεγραμμένη οὐ μέλανι, ἀλλὰ Πνεύματι Θεοῦ ζῶντος, οὐκ ἐν πλαξὶν λιθίναις, ἀλλ’ ἐν πλαξὶν καρδίαις σαρκίναις	1	Here Paul continues to speak as if the Corinthians were a **letter**. Here, he states that this **letter** was written by **Christ** and **administered** by Paul and those with him. What he means by this is that **Christ** is the one who enabled the Corinthians to believe, and he worked through Paul and those with him to do that. Paul then contrasts a **letter** written with **ink** and on **tablets of stone** with a **letter** written by the power of the **Spirit** and on **hearts of flesh**. What he means by this is that the letter is the Corinthians, not some written document, and that the message is communicated by the **Spirit**, not by letters written with **ink**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea with a simile or in some other natural way. Alternate translation: “you are like a letter of Christ having been administered by us, not written with ink but as if with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but as if on tablets of hearts of flesh” or “you are a message from Christ having been administered by us, not communicated by ink but by the Spirit of the living God, not presented on tablets of stone but on tablets of hearts of flesh” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:3	hlap		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	ἐπιστολὴ Χριστοῦ	1	Here Paul uses the possessive form to indicate that the **letter** is from or written by **Christ**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in a more natural way. Alternate translation: “a letter from Christ” or “a letter written by Christ” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
3:3	wrk4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	διακονηθεῖσα ὑφ’ ἡμῶν	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

3:3	q96q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐνγεγραμμένη οὐ	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

3:3	t5ah		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	Θεοῦ ζῶντος	1	Here, the phrase **living God** identifies God as the one who “lives” and possibly as the one who gives “life.” The primary point is that **God** actually “lives,” unlike idols and other things that people call “god.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that emphasizes that God really “lives.” Alternate translation: “of the God who lives” or “of the true God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
3:3	ana2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ἐν πλαξὶν	-1	Here, the word **tablets** refers to thin, flat pieces of stone on which people would write words, especially important words.

Paul may be referring here to the **tablets** on which Moses wrote God’s commandments (see [Exodus 34:1–4](../exo/34/01.md)), so if possible use a word that could refer to those **tablets**. Alternate translation: “on flat pieces … on flat pieces” or “on plaques … on plaques” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
3:3	ih89		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	πλαξὶν λιθίναις	1	Here Paul uses the possessive form to describe **tablets** that are made out of **stone**.

3:3	no25		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	καρδίαις σαρκίναις	1	In the Paul’s culture, **hearts** are the places where humans think and plan.

3:4	z7qx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	πεποίθησιν & τοιαύτην ἔχομεν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **confidence**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “confident.” Alternate translation: “we are confident in this way” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
3:4	q0kr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	πεποίθησιν & τοιαύτην	1	Here, the word **such** indicates that the **confidence** is the kind that Paul showed in the previous verses, especially in [3:1–3](../03/01.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could make it clearer that **such** refers back to what Paul has said in the previous verses. Alternate translation: “that kind of confidence” or “confidence in those ways” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
3:4	y72k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πρὸς τὸν Θεόν	1	Here, the phrase **toward God** could indicate that the **confidence** is: (1) before or in the presence of **God**.

He wishes to clarify that the **confidence** is not based on themselves but on **God**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces this kind of contrast. Alternate translation: “But it is not” or “However, it is not” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
3:5	i7nt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἑαυτῶν & ἐσμεν & ἑαυτῶν & ἡμῶν	1	Here, just as in [3:1–4](../03/01.md), the words **we**, **ourselves**, and **our** do not include the Corinthians.

Alternate translation: “I am … myself … myself … my” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
3:5	qye9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀφ’ ἑαυτῶν ἱκανοί & ἡ ἱκανότης ἡμῶν	1	Here Paul does not state what they are not **sufficient** to do. He implies that it is serving God by preaching the gospel. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit.

3:5	e5e7			ἑαυτῶν & λογίσασθαί	1	Here, the phrase **to consider** introduces an explanation or elaboration of what **sufficient from ourselves** means.

3:5	wi1t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἡ ἱκανότης ἡμῶν ἐκ τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **sufficiency**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “sufficient.” Alternate translation: “God makes us sufficient” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

3:6	r5ea		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	διακόνους καινῆς διαθήκης	1	Here Paul uses the possessive form to identify himself and those with him as **servants** who “serve” for the benefit of **a new covenant**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in a more natural way. Alternate translation: “as those who serve a new covenant” or “as servants who administer a new covenant” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
3:6	j8rd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	οὐ γράμματος, ἀλλὰ Πνεύματος	1	If your language would not naturally put the negative statement before the positive statement, you could reverse the two clauses here. Alternate translation: “of the Spirit, not of the letter” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
3:6	poyq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οὐ γράμματος, ἀλλὰ Πνεύματος	1	When Paul contrasts **letter** and **Spirit**, he implies that **letter** describes the old covenant and **Spirit** describes the new covenant. What he means is that the old covenant was only written down and could not change people on the inside. On the other hand, the new covenant is empowered by the Holy **Spirit**, who can change people on the inside. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this contrast more explicit. Alternate translation: “not a covenant of the letter that is powerless, but a covenant of the powerful Spirit” or “not one that is only written down but one that the Spirit puts inside people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:6	dp6i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	γράμματος & τὸ & γράμμα	1	Here, the word **letter** refers generally to a message written in “letters.” More specifically, Paul uses the word **letter** to refer to the old covenant, which was written down only and could not change people like the **Spirit** can.

3:6	tc4u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	Πνεύματος & τὸ δὲ Πνεῦμα	1	Here, the word **Spirit** could refer to: (1) the Holy Spirit.

3:6	q4at		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	τὸ & γράμμα ἀποκτέννει	1	Here Paul speaks as if **the letter** were a person who **kills** others. He speaks in this way to indicate that **the letter** (which refers to the old covenant and its regulations) does not have the power to give life but instead can only condemn people to die. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable figure of speech or plain language. Alternate translation: “the letter is like someone who kills” or “the letter dooms people to die” or “the letter causes death” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
3:7	lyf7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1	# Connecting Statement:\n\nHere, the word **Now** introduces a development of the ideas from the previous verse. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a development, or you could leave **Now** untranslated. Alternate translation: “Indeed,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
3:7	yzhq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἰ	1	Paul is speaking as **if** the **glory** of the **ministry** of **death** were a possibility, but he means that it is actually true. If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, and if your readers might think that what Paul is saying is not certain, then you can introduce the clause with a word such as “since” or “given that.” Alternate translation: “since” or “given that” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
3:7	rife		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	ἡ διακονία τοῦ θανάτου	1	Here Paul uses the possessive form to describe a **ministry** that leads to **death**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in a more natural way. Alternate translation: “the ministry that leads to death” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
3:7	du65		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἡ διακονία τοῦ θανάτου	1	Here, the word **ministry** could refer primarily to: (1) the action of “ministering.” In this case, the word refers to how Moses “administered” the old covenant.

Alternate translation: “the system of this death” or “the laws that led to death” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:7	ut6r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἡ διακονία τοῦ θανάτου	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **ministry** and **death**, you could express the ideas by using verbs such as “administer” and “die.” Alternate translation: “the old covenant, which was administered in a way that causes people die” or “what was administered, which caused people to die” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
3:7	j1hp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐν γράμμασιν ἐντετυπωμένη λίθοις	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Paul implies that “God” did it (see also [Exodus 34:1](../exo/34/01.md)). Alternate translation: “which God engraved in letters on stones” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
3:7	rx13		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐν γράμμασιν ἐντετυπωμένη λίθοις	1	Here Paul refers to how God **engraved** or carved the regulations for the **ministry** on **stones** or tablets. Much like in the previous verse, **letters** refers to the alphabet, so the point is that God used writing. Paul is probably referring to the story about how Moses met God on a mountain, and God carved the regulations of the covenant on two pieces of stone. You can read this story in [Exodus 34:1–28](../exo/34/01.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “engraved in writing by God onto two stone slabs” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:7	r5p5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐγενήθη ἐν δόξῃ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **glory**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “glorious” or “great.” Alternate translation: “was very great” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
3:7	myms		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὥστε μὴ δύνασθαι ἀτενίσαι τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἰσραὴλ εἰς τὸ πρόσωπον Μωϋσέως, διὰ τὴν δόξαν τοῦ προσώπου αὐτοῦ, τὴν καταργουμένην	1	Here Paul refers to a story about what happened after God **engraved** the stone tablets. When Moses returned to talk to the Israelites, his face shone brightly because he had been talking to God. In other words, some of God’s **glory** became part of Moses’ **face**, and the Israelites could not **look intently** at his face because it was a little like looking at God. You can read this story in [Exodus 34:29–35](../exo/34/29.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the idea more explicit or include a footnote explaining the story. Alternate translation: “so that the sons of Israel were not able to look carefully at the face of Moses because of the fading glory on his face that came from talking with God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:7	s9zp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	τοὺς υἱοὺς	1	Although the word **sons** is masculine, Paul is using it to refer to any children or descendants, both men and women. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a non-gendered word or refer to both genders. Alternate translation: “the sons and daughters” or “the children” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
3:7	mh54		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship	τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἰσραὴλ	1	Here the author uses the word **sons** to refer in general to all the descendants of **Israel**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to descendants in general. Alternate translation: “the descendants of Israel” or “those descended from Israel” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship]])
3:7	enwt			διὰ τὴν δόξαν τοῦ προσώπου αὐτοῦ, τὴν καταργουμένην	1	Here, the reason why the Israelites **were not able to look intently** at Moses’ face could be that: (1) Moses’ face was very “glorious.” Alternate translation: “because of the glory of his face, even though it was fading” (2) the **glory of his face** was **fading**. Alternate translation: “because the glory of his face was fading”
3:7	pqbi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τὴν δόξαν τοῦ προσώπου αὐτοῦ, τὴν καταργουμένην	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **glory**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “glorious” or “shining.” Alternate translation: “how his face was shining, even though that was fading” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
3:7	ewkr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὴν δόξαν τοῦ προσώπου αὐτοῦ, τὴν καταργουμένην	1	Here, the word **fading** could describe: (1) the **glory** of Moses’ **face**.

Alternate translation: “the glory of his face, although that ministry was fading away” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:8	xxn6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	πῶς οὐχὶ μᾶλλον ἡ διακονία τοῦ Πνεύματος ἔσται ἐν δόξῃ?	1	Paul does not ask this question because he is looking for information. Rather, he asks it to involve the Corinthians in what he is arguing. The question implies that the answer is “yes, it has much more glory.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea by using a strong affirmation. Alternate translation: “then the ministry of the Spirit will certainly be with much more glory.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
3:8	wkvl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture	οὐχὶ & ἔσται	1	Here Paul could use the future tense because: (1) he is stating an inference from something in the past, so the inference is future. Paul does not mean that the **ministry** will only have **glory** in the future. Alternate translation: “then is … not” (2) he is stating that the **ministry** will have **glory** in the future. He could mean that it only has **glory** in the future, or he could mean that it has **glory** in the present and will also have **glory** in the future. Alternate translation: “will … in the future not be” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture]])
3:8	wq1v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	ἡ διακονία τοῦ Πνεύματος	1	Here Paul uses the possessive form to describe **the ministry** that could: (1) lead to people receiving the **Spirit**.

In this case, the word refers to the new covenant or its principles. Alternate translation: “the system of the Spirit” or “the principles that lead to the Spirit” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:8	o30n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἡ διακονία τοῦ Πνεύματος	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **ministry**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “administer.” See how you translated this word in [3:7](../03/07.md). Alternate translation: “the new covenant, which was administered in a way that brought the Spirit,” or “what was administered, which gave the Spirit,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
3:8	bmme		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τοῦ Πνεύματος	1	Here, the word **Spirit** could refer to: (1) the Holy Spirit.

If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different word or phrase that introduces further explanation. Alternate translation: “Further,” or “Even more,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
3:9	p7p5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἰ	1	Paul is speaking as **if** the **glory** of the **ministry of this condemnation** were a possibility, but he means that it is actually true. If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, and if your readers might think that what Paul is saying is not certain, then you can introduce the clause with a word such as “since” or “given that.” Alternate translation: “since” or “given that” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
3:9	ufq6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τῇ διακονίᾳ τῆς κατακρίσεως & ἡ διακονία τῆς δικαιοσύνης	1	Here, the word **ministry** could refer primarily to: (1) the action of “ministering.” In this case, the word refers to how people “administered” the the two covenants. Alternate translation: “the service of this condemnation … the service of this righteousness” or “the act of ministering that leads to this condemnation … the act of ministering that leads to this righteousness” (2) the system of **ministry**. In this case, the word refers to a covenant or its principles. Alternate translation: “the system of this condemnation … the system of this righteousness” or “the law that leads to condemnation … the principle that leads to righteousness” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:9	k779		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τῇ διακονίᾳ τῆς κατακρίσεως	1	Here Paul uses the possessive form to describe a **ministry** that leads to **condemnation**.

Alternate translation: “the ministry that caused this condemnation” or “the ministry that ended in this condemnation” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
3:9	tcxw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τῇ διακονίᾳ τῆς κατακρίσεως, δόξα	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **ministry**, **condemnation**, and **glory**, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: “the old covenant, which was administered in a way that caused people to be condemned, was great,” or “what was administered that led to people being condemned was glorious,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
3:9	if33		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	πολλῷ μᾶλλον περισσεύει ἡ διακονία τῆς δικαιοσύνης δόξῃ	1	Here, the phrase **much more** marks this clause as an exclamation, not a question. Paul uses this exclamation to emphatically contrast the two “ministries.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in a way that naturally contrasts the two “ministries.” Alternate translation: “then certainly much more the ministry of this righteousness abounds in glory.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations]])

3:9	e5zz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	πολλῷ μᾶλλον περισσεύει ἡ διακονία τῆς δικαιοσύνης δόξῃ.	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **ministry**, **righteousness**, and **glory**, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: “the new covenant, which is administered in a way that makes people righteous, is even more great,” or “what is administered that leads to people being righteous is even more glorious,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
3:10	q8bg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	καὶ γὰρ	1	Here, the phrase **for indeed** indicates that Paul is adding more information (**indeed**) that supports what he said about **glory** in [3:7–9](../03/07.md) (**for**). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use words that introduce added information that supports a previous statement. Alternate translation: “Further,” or “And in fact,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
3:10	n4pe		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὸ δεδοξασμένον & τῆς ὑπερβαλλούσης δόξης	1	Here, the phrase **{what} had been glorified** refers to the old covenant that God gave through Moses. The phrase **surpassing glory** refers to the new covenant that Paul and those with him serve. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make what these phrases refer to more explicit. Alternate translation: “the old covenant that was glorified … the surpassing glory of the new covenant” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:10	t2dq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	οὐ δεδόξασται, τὸ δεδοξασμένον	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If possible, avoid stating who does the “glorifying,” since Paul is focusing on the fact of “glory” rather than on the action of becoming “glorious.” Alternate translation: “what had glory does not have glory” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
3:10	hmcu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	οὐ δεδόξασται, τὸ δεδοξασμένον ἐν τούτῳ τῷ μέρει	1	Here, the phrase **in this part** could modify: (1) in what way the old covenant is **not glorified**. In other words, **in this part** introduces the way in which something that has **been glorified** can actually be **not glorified**. Alternate translation: “what had been glorified is not glorified, and here is why:” or “what had been glorified is not glorified in this way” (2) **{what} had been glorified**. In other words, the old covenant was **glorified** only “partially.” Alternate translation: “what had been glorified in part is not glorified” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
3:10	es4c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐν τούτῳ τῷ μέρει	1	Here, the phrase **in this part** indicates that a statement is only true in **part** or in some specific way. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces the qualification that some statement or action is partially true or accurate. Alternate translation: “in a sense” or “in this way” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
3:10	d7k5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	ἐν τούτῳ τῷ μέρει εἵνεκεν	1	Here, the phrase **in this part** and the word **because** both introduce how or why **{what} had been glorified** is **not glorified**. Paul uses both elements because he wants to make his point very clear. If the repetition would not make the point clearer, and if using both elements would be confusing in your language, you could use one word or phrase that introduces how what was **glorified** is **not glorified**. Alternate translation: “because of” or “in comparison to” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
3:10	pvbx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τῆς ὑπερβαλλούσης δόξης	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **glory**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “glorious” or “great.” Alternate translation: “what was much more glorious” or “what was even greater” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
3:10	f2mo			τῆς ὑπερβαλλούσης δόξης	1	Alternate translation: “the glory that surpasses it”
3:11	grwl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1	Here, the word **For** introduces a further explanation of the comparison between the two covenants and their **glory**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different word or phrase that introduces further explanation, or you could leave **For** untranslated. Alternate translation: “Further,” or “As it is,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
3:11	r7c9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἰ	1	Paul is speaking as if the **glory** of **{what} is fading away** were a possibility, but he means that it is actually true. If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, and if your readers might think that what Paul is saying is not certain, then you can introduce the clause with a word such as “since” or “given that.” Alternate translation: “since” or “given that” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
3:11	ym37			τὸ καταργούμενον	1	Here, the words translated **{what} is fading away** could indicate: (1) that something is disappearing or temporary without stating that anyone is making it disappear. Alternate translation: “what is passing away” (2) that God is causing something to disappear or pass away. Alternate translation: “what is being abolished” or “what God is abolishing”
3:11	zwb2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τὸ καταργούμενον	1	Here, the phrase **fading away** translates the same word that Paul used in [3:7](../03/07.md) to refer to how the glory was “fading” from Moses’ face. Paul means that, just like the glory on Moses’ face was temporary, so the old covenant that God made through Moses was temporary. See how you translated this idea in [3:7](../03/07.md) and use similar language if possible. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea using a simile. Alternate translation: “what is temporary” or “what is fading, like the glory on Moses’ face,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:11	hm9d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὸ καταργούμενον & τὸ μένον	1	Here, the phrase **{what} is fading away** refers to the old covenant, while the phrase **{what} remains** refers to the new covenant. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make explicit what these phrases refer to. Alternate translation: “the old covenant that is fading away … the new covenant that remains” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:11	wtht		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	διὰ δόξης & ἐν δόξῃ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **glory**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “glorious” or “great” or an adverb such as “gloriously.” Alternate translation: “was great … is great” or “came gloriously … will come gloriously” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
3:11	wrf4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	πολλῷ μᾶλλον τὸ μένον ἐν δόξῃ	1	Here, the phrase **much more** marks this clause as an exclamation, not a question. Paul uses this exclamation to emphatically contrast the two covenants. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in a way that naturally contrasts the two covenants. Alternate translation: “then certainly much more what remains will come with glory.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations]])
3:12	tnc1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	οὖν	1	Here, the word **Therefore** introduces an inference from what Paul has already said, especially what he has said about the ministry of “glory” in [3:4–11](../03/04.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces an inference from a previous section. Alternate translation: “Because of that” or “Because of this ministry of glory” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
3:12	ib35		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ἔχοντες	1	Here, the word **having** introduces a reason why Paul and those with him **act with much boldness**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the relationship more explicit. Alternate translation: “because we have” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
3:12	j76k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἔχοντες & τοιαύτην ἐλπίδα	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **hope**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “hope” or an adjective such as “hopeful.” Alternate translation: “being hopeful in such a way” or “hoping in that way” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
3:12	u5qa		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	τοιαύτην ἐλπίδα	1	Here, the word **such** refers to back to what Paul has said about the “glory” of the ministry in [3:7–11](../03/07.md). In other words, the **hope** is based on the glorious ministry and covenant. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make explicit what **such** refers to. Alternate translation: “that kind of hope” or “hope in such a covenant” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
3:12	rf9h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	χρώμεθα	1	Here, just as in [3:1–6](../03/01.md), the word **we** does not include the Corinthians. It could refer to: (1) Paul and those who proclaim the gospel with him. Alternate translation: “we who preach the gospel” (2) just Paul. Alternate translation: “I act” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
3:12	zbff		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	χρώμεθα	1	Here Paul does not exactly what it is that **we** do. He implies that it is the “ministry” that he has referred to in [3:7–11](../03/07.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could make what **we** do more explicit. Alternate translation: “we perform the ministry” or “we proclaim the good news” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:12	b5ql		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	πολλῇ παρρησίᾳ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **boldness**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “bold” or an adverb such as “boldly.” Alternate translation: “as very bold people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
3:13	fb59		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καὶ οὐ καθάπερ Μωϋσῆς	1	Here Paul contrasts the **boldness** that he and those with him show with how **Moses** could not show God’s glory openly. In other words, Paul and those with him can reveal God’s glory openly, in contrast to Moses, who could not. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this contrasts more explicit. Alternate translation: “and without hiding the glory, like Moses” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:13	p1y3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	Μωϋσῆς ἐτίθει κάλυμμα ἐπὶ τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ, πρὸς τὸ μὴ ἀτενίσαι τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἰσραὴλ, εἰς τὸ τέλος τοῦ καταργουμένου	1	Here Paul refers to a story in [Exodus 34:29–35](../exo/34/29.md) that describes how Moses’ face shone with God’s glory after Moses spoke with him. Moses would hide his face with a **veil** when **his face** shone like this. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make what Paul is writing about more explicit. See how you translated the similar phrases in [3:7](../03/07.md), where Paul has already referred to this story. Alternate translation: “Moses wearing a veil to hide his face so that the sons of Israel would not look directly at it when the glory on his face, which came from talking with God, disappeared” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:13	boui		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	τοὺς υἱοὺς	1	Although the word **sons** is masculine, Paul is using it to refer to any children or descendants, both men and women. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a non-gendered word or refer to both genders. Alternate translation: “the sons and daughters” or “the children” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
3:13	pdnk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship	τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἰσραὴλ	1	Here the author uses the word **sons** to refer in general to all the descendants of **Israel**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to descendants in general. Alternate translation: “the descendants of Israel” or “those descended from Israel” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship]])
3:13	vuyk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὸ τέλος	1	Here, the word **end** could refer to: (1) the result of the **fading**, which was that the “glory” completely stopped shining from Moses’ face. Alternate translation: “the cessation” or “the termination” (2) the purpose or implication of how the “glory” ceased shining from Moses’ face, which was that the old covenant too would cease. Alternate translation: “the result” or “the meaning” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:13	p5u2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τοῦ καταργουμένου	1	Here, the phrase **{what} was fading away** could refer to: (1) the “glory” that shone from the **face** of Moses. In this case, Paul could also be implying that the old covenant would also “fade.” Alternate translation: “of the glory that was fading from his face” (2) the old covenant, that would “fade away” when God instituted a new covenant. Alternate translation: “of the covenant that would fade away” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:13	mczg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τὸ τέλος τοῦ καταργουμένου	1	Here Paul uses the possessive form to describe how **{what} was fading away** completely ceased or “ended.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in a more natural way. Alternate translation: “how what was fading away ended” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
3:13	fe5r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τὸ τέλος τοῦ καταργουμένου	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **end**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “end” or “cease.” Alternate translation: “how what was fading away ended” or “what ceased after fading away” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
3:14	kb8y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	ἀλλὰ	1	Here, the word **But** could introduce a contrast between: (1) being able to “look intently” and having **hardened** minds. Alternate translation: “But instead of looking intently,” (2) what Moses did (veiling his face) and what the Israelites did (have **hardened** minds). Alternate translation: “In contrast to Moses,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
3:14	csl1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	τὰ νοήματα αὐτῶν	1	Here, the word **their** refers to “the sons of Israel” that Paul mentioned in [3:13](../03/13.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could make explicit to whom the pronoun **their** refers. Alternate translation: “the minds of the sons of Israel” or “the minds of the Israelites” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
3:14	khkq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐπωρώθη τὰ νοήματα αὐτῶν	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If it is possible, avoid stating who did the “hardening,” since Paul is emphasizing the fact that their minds were “hard,” not who did the “hardening.” If you must state who did the action, Paul could be implying that: (1) the Israelites did it to themselves. Alternate translation: “they hardened their minds” or “their minds became hard” (2) God did it to them. Alternate translation: “God hardened their minds” (3) Satan did it to them. Alternate translation: “Satan hardened their minds” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
3:14	zvf5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐπωρώθη τὰ νοήματα αὐτῶν	1	Here Paul speaks as if people’s **minds** were a soft substance that could be **hardened**. He speaks in this way to indicate that their **minds** could not know or understand what was happening, unlike a soft substance that changes when something hits it. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable figure of speech or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “they could not realize what was true” or “they could not think properly” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:14	tzbd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1	Here, the word **For** introduces a further explanation of what Paul has said about how **their minds were hardened**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different word or phrase that introduces further explanation. Alternate translation: “and this is how:” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
3:14	zm7j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἄχρι & τῆς σήμερον ἡμέρας	1	Here, the phrase **until the present day** refers to all the time before and including the **present day**, which is the time when Paul wrote this letter. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to a period of time that includes the past and the present. Alternate translation: “up to the present” or “in the past and in the present” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
3:14	w68p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τὸ αὐτὸ κάλυμμα ἐπὶ τῇ ἀναγνώσει τῆς παλαιᾶς διαθήκης μένει, μὴ ἀνακαλυπτόμενον	1	Here Paul speaks as if a **veil** kept people from understanding the **old covenant** when it is “read,” and this veil is not **lifted**. He speaks in this way to identify the inability of people to understand the **old covenant** with how Moses’ kept the Israelites from looking at his face with a **veil**. Just as the **veil** kept them from seeing the glory on his face, so a **veil** keeps people from understanding **the reading of the old covenant**. Since Paul uses this figure of speech to connect what he is saying with what he has said about Moses, you should preserve the metaphor or express the idea with a simile. Alternate translation: “their lack of understanding is a like a veil that remains at the reading of the old covenant, not being lifted” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:14	wcbv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	τὸ αὐτὸ κάλυμμα ἐπὶ τῇ ἀναγνώσει τῆς παλαιᾶς διαθήκης μένει, μὴ ἀνακαλυπτόμενον	1	Here, the phrase **not being lifted** could: (1) explain how the veil **remains**. Alternate translation: “the same veil remains at the reading of the old covenant, and it is not lifted” (2) go with **remains** and explain what **remains**. Alternate translation: “the same veil remains not having been lifted at the reading of the old covenant” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
3:14	wymg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὸ αὐτὸ κάλυμμα	1	Here, the phrase **same veil** could refer to: (1) the veil that Moses wore (see [3:13](../03/13.md)).

Alternate translation: “the veil that hardened their minds” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:14	gg2d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	ἐπὶ τῇ ἀναγνώσει τῆς παλαιᾶς διαθήκης	1	Here Paul uses the possessive form to refer to a person **reading** the **old covenant**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in a more natural way. Alternate translation: “when the old covenant is read” or “when they read the old covenant” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
3:14	orvo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τῆς παλαιᾶς διαθήκης	1	Here, the phrase **old covenant** refers to the words that contain or describe **the old covenant**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could refer directly to these words. Alternate translation: “of the message about the old covenant” or “of the words that describe the old covenant” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
3:14	gl8l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	μὴ ἀνακαλυπτόμενον	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who would do the action, Paul implies that “God” would do it. Alternate translation: “God not lifting it” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
3:14	vygf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ὅτι	1	Here, the word **because** could indicate why: (1) the **veil** is not “lifted.” Alternate translation: “and it is not lifted because” (2) the **veil remains**. Alternate translation: “and the veil remains because” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
3:14	m7lk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐν Χριστῷ	1	Here Paul uses the spatial metaphor **in Christ** to describe the union of believers with **Christ**. In this case, being **in Christ**, or united to Christ, explains why and how the **veil** is “lifted.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a phrase that indicates that being united to Christ leads to the “lifting” of the **veil**. Alternate translation: “only when a person is united to Christ” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:14	r1lt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καταργεῖται	1	Here, the phrase **fading away** is the same phrase that Paul used to describe how the “glory” was “fading” from Moses’ face (see [3:13](../03/13.md)). What Paul means is that the **veil** disappears or is removed **in Christ**. If possible, use a word or phrase that reminds your readers of how you translated “fading” in [3:13](../03/13.md). Alternate translation: “is it being abolished” or “is it disappearing” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:14	rhid		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	καταργεῖται	1	Here, the word **it** could refer to: (1) the **veil**. Alternate translation: “is this veil fading away” (2) the **old covenant**. Alternate translation: “is this covenant fading away” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
3:15	cv2j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	ἀλλ’	1	Here, the word **But** introduces a contrast with what Paul said in the previous verse about the veil “fading away” in Christ ([3:14](../03/14.md)). What Paul says in the rest of the verse repeats many of the ideas from the first parts of [3:14](../03/14.md). Consider whether a contrast word or a connecting word expresses the idea most clearly. Alternate translation: “However,” or “In fact,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
3:15	rjh5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἕως σήμερον	1	Here the phrase **until today** refers to all the time before and including the present day, which is the time when Paul wrote this letter. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to a period of time that includes the past and the present. See how you translated the similar phrase “until the present day” in [3:14](../03/14.md).

3:15	ip29		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἀναγινώσκηται Μωϋσῆς	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, you could use a vague or indefinite subject. Alternate translation: “someone reads Moses” or “they hear someone read Moses” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
3:15	bb5u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	κάλυμμα ἐπὶ τὴν καρδίαν αὐτῶν κεῖται	1	Here Paul continues to refer to a **veil** that keeps people from understanding the Scriptures. Express the metaphor as you did in [3:14](../03/14.md). Alternate translation: “their lack of understanding is like a veil that lies over their heart” or “they do not understand, as if a veil lies over their heart” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:15	gwp9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐπὶ τὴν καρδίαν αὐτῶν	1	In Paul’s culture, the **heart** is the place where humans think and feel. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate **heart** by referring to the place where humans think and feel in your culture or by expressing the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “over their mind” or “over their understanding” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
3:15	z5zh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	τὴν καρδίαν αὐτῶν	1	Here the author is speaking of “hearts” in general, not of one particular **heart**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that refers to “hearts” in general. Alternate translation: “their hearts” or “each of their hearts” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns]])
3:15	lmu6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	τὴν καρδίαν αὐτῶν	1	Here, the word **their** could refer to: (1) anyone who hears the reading of **Moses** without being “in Christ.” Alternate translation: “the hearts of those who listen” (2) the same people that “their” referred to in [3:14](../03/14.md): the Israelites. Alternate translation: “the Israelites’ heart” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
3:16	k2dr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐπιστρέψῃ πρὸς Κύριον	1	Here, the phrase **turn to the Lord** refers to a how people stop doing whatever they want and instead begin to trust and obey God. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable figure of speech or express the idea plainly.

3:16	mibm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	περιαιρεῖται τὸ κάλυμμα	1	Here Paul continues to refer to a **veil** that keeps people from understanding the Scriptures. Express the metaphor as you did in [3:14–15](../03/14.md). Alternate translation: “the lack of understanding that is like a veil is taken away” or “one understands, as if the veil was taken away” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:16	w1y2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	περιαιρεῖται τὸ κάλυμμα	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who does the action, Paul implies that “God” does it. Alternate translation: “the veil disappears” or “God takes away the veil” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
3:17	lrxy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1	Here, the word **Now** introduces a development of the ideas from the previous verse. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a development, or you could leave **Now** untranslated. Alternate translation: “Indeed,” or “In fact,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
3:17	ulmp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὁ & Κύριος & Κυρίου	1	Here, just as in [3:16](../03/16.md), the word **Lord** could refer to God generally or to Jesus specifically. Express the idea the same you did in [3:16](../03/16.md). Alternate translation: “God the Lord … of God the Lord is” or “the Lord Jesus … of the Lord Jesus is” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:17	erpi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὸ Πνεῦμά & τὸ Πνεῦμα Κυρίου	1	Here, the word **Spirit** could refer to: (1) the Holy Spirit. Alternate translation: “God’s Spirit … that Spirit of the Lord is” (2) what is “spiritual” as opposed to what is written or fleshly. Alternate translation: “the spirit … the spirit of the Lord is” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:17	f2o7			ὁ & Κύριος τὸ Πνεῦμά ἐστιν	1	Here Paul could mean that: (1) the “Lord” mentioned in [3:16](../03/16.md) is the Holy **Spirit**. Alternate translation: “the Lord of whom I speak is the Holy Spirit” (2) believers encounter God the **Lord** as the Holy **Spirit**. Alternate translation: “the Lord is experienced as the Holy Spirit” (3) the **Lord** is “spiritual.” Alternate translation: “the Lord is a spirit”
3:17	sp81		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	οὗ & τὸ Πνεῦμα Κυρίου, ἐλευθερία	1	Here Paul speaks of the **Spirit** being in a place, and so **freedom** also is in that place. Here speaks in this way to connect the **Spirit** and **freedom**. He means that whoever has the **Spirit** also has **freedom**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “whoever has the Spirit of the Lord also has freedom” or “the Spirit of the Lord gives freedom” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:17	b016		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τὸ Πνεῦμα Κυρίου	1	Here Paul uses the possessive form to describe **the Spirit** as belonging to or part of the **Lord**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in a more natural way. Alternate translation: “the Spirit who is the Lord is” or “the Spirit who belongs to the Lord is” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
3:17	uoss		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐλευθερία	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **freedom**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “free.” Alternate translation: “people are free” or “you are free” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
3:17	ao12		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐλευθερία	1	Here Paul does not give any details about what people experience **freedom** from or for. If possible, you also should not make these ideas explicit. However, if you must express more information about the **freedom**, it could be **freedom** (1) from the veil. Alternate translation: “there is freedom from the veil” (2) from the condemnation of the old covenant and its law. Alternate translation: “there is freedom from condemnation” (3) from the old covenant and its law. Alternate translation: “there is freedom from the old covenant” (4) to preach the gospel. Alternate translation: “there is freedom to proclaim the good news” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:18	r6rx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1	Here, the word **Now** introduces a development of the ideas from the previous section. In this case, Paul is concluding his discussion about Moses and the veil in [3:12–17](../03/12.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a final development, or you could leave **Now** untranslated. Alternate translation: “In the end,” or “Finally,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
3:18	l3xw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἀνακεκαλυμμένῳ προσώπῳ, τὴν δόξαν Κυρίου κατοπτριζόμενοι	1	Here the author speaks as if believers do not have a “veil” over their “faces” and can thus “reflect” God’s **glory**. Since the veiling language is an important part of what Paul is saying, you should preserve the figure of speech or express the idea by using a simile. Paul is indicating a contrast that could be: (1) with Moses, who had to veil the glory on his face. Unlike him, believers do not need to veil their faces. Alternate translation: “revealing the glory of the Lord like those who have unveiled faces” (2) the Israelites, who could not look directly at the glory of God. Unlike them, believers can see God’s glory directly without a “veil.” Alternate translation: “seeing the glory of the Lord, unlike those who could only see a veil” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:18	ui8y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	κατοπτριζόμενοι	1	Here, the word translated **reflecting** could refer to: (1) acting as a mirror that “reflects” an image. Alternate translation: “mirroring” (2) seeing something that is “reflected” in a mirror. Alternate translation: “seeing in a mirror” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
3:18	mdu9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τὴν δόξαν Κυρίου	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **glory**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “great” or “glorious.” Alternate translation: “how great the Lord is” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
3:18	brpu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	Κυρίου	1	Here, just as in [3:16–17](../03/16.md), the word **Lord** could refer to God generally or to Jesus specifically. Express the idea the same way you did in those verses. Alternate translation: “of God the Lord” or “of the Lord Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:18	rc9x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	μεταμορφούμεθα	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who does the action, Paul implies that “God” does it. Alternate translation: “are those whom God is transforming into” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
3:18	cq3i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὴν αὐτὴν εἰκόνα	1	Here, the phrase **the same image** refers to the **image** that belongs to the **Lord**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “into his image” or “the that image” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:18	g0ku		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τὴν αὐτὴν εἰκόνα & ἀπὸ δόξης εἰς δόξαν	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **image** and **glory**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “reflect” and an adjective such as “glorious” or “great.” Alternate translation: “people who reflect the Lord from what is glorious to what is glorious” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
3:18	bx5b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἀπὸ δόξης εἰς δόξαν	1	Here Paul uses the words **from** and **to** with the same word, much like he did in [2:16](../02/16.md). He could be using this form because: (1) **from** indicates the source of the transformation, and **to** indicates the effects of the transformation. Alternate translation: “by someone who has glory so that we also have glory” (2) **from** and **to** together emphasize that the transformation is characterized completely by **glory**. Alternate translation: “with great glory” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
3:18	mw3v			καθάπερ ἀπὸ	1	Here, the phrase **just as from** indicates the source of the transformation. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in a more natural way. Alternate translation: “and this is from” or “even as it is accomplished by”
3:18	wlp1			Κυρίου, Πνεύματος	1	Here, Paul could be using this phrase to: (1) identify the **Lord** as the **Spirit**, just as he did in [3:17](../03/17.md). Just as in that verse, he could mean that the **Lord** is the **Spirit**, or he could mean that the **Lord** is experienced as the **Spirit**. Alternate translation: “the Lord, that is, the Spirit” or “the Lord, whom we experience as the Spirit” (2) name the Holy Spirit as “the Spirit of the Lord,” as he did in [3:17](../03/17.md). Alternate translation: “the Spirit of the Lord” (3) refer to the **Lord** to whom the **Spirit** belongs or who sends the **Spirit**. Alternate translation: “the Lord of the Spirit”
3:18	mmdd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	Πνεύματος	1	Here, the word **Spirit** could refer to: (1) the Holy Spirit. Alternate translation: “God’s Spirit” (2) what is “spiritual” as opposed to what is written or fleshly. Alternate translation: “who is spiritual” or “who is a spirit” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:intro	rx1c				0	# 2 Corinthians 4 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n4. Paul’s ministry (2:14–7:4)\n     * Ministry of Moses and ministry of Paul (3:7–4:6)\n     * Suffering and ministry (4:7–18)\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Life and death\n\nIn [4:7–14](../04/07.md), Paul refers to life, death, and resurrection. When he refers to how he and those with him experience “death” or “dying,” he is referring to how they suffer and experience things related to death. When he refers to how he and those with him experience “life” or being “raised,” he is most likely referring to how God will resurrect them. He could also be referring to how God delivers them from “death” when they suffer or are persecuted. Consider what forms you could use to refer to experiences related to death and resurrection. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/life]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/death]])\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Light and darkness\n\nIn [4:3–6](../04/03.md), Paul describes a lack of understanding and belief in the gospel as “veiling,” “blinding,” and “darkness.” He describes understanding and belief in the gospel as “shining” and “light.” These figures of speech compare believing and understanding to seeing. If possible, preserve these figures of speech, but you could express the ideas in plain language if necessary. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/light]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/darkness]])\n\n### “Outer” and “inner” man\n\nIn [4:16](../04/16.md), Paul refers to two different parts of himself and those with him: their “inner man” and their “outer man.” The “inner” and the “outer” are probably not directly related to the spiritual and physical parts of people. Rather, the “inner” is connected to what is “not seen,” and the “outer” is connected to what is “seen” (see [4:18](../04/18.md)). Consider what form you can use to refer to the parts of a person that people can observe and the parts of a person that they cannot observe. Make sure that your translation does not simply distinguish between the skin and what is under the skin. It is more important to use words that suggest that what people observe is not always what is really true about a person. \n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Exclusive “we”\n\nThroughout this chapter, Paul uses the first person plural. When he uses these words, he does not include the Corinthians unless a note specifies otherwise. He could be referring to: (1) himself and those who preach the gospel with him. (2) just himself. It is recommended that you follow the first option, but both are possible. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])\n\n### The contrasts in [4:8–12](../04/08.md).\n\nIn these verses, Paul contrasts bad things that happen to him and those with him with good things that happen to them. Paul wrote these verses as one long sentence with short clauses because this was a powerful form in his culture. Consider using a form that is powerful in your culture. The UST expresses the idea with many short sentences because this is one kind of powerful form in English.
4:1	lyi4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	διὰ τοῦτο	1	# Connecting Statement:\n\nHere, the word **Therefore** introduces a conclusion based on what Paul has said, particularly what he said in [3:4–18](../03/04.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a conclusion based on what has been said. Alternate translation: “So then” or “Because of that” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
4:1	ln4n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ἔχοντες	1	Here, the word having introduces a reason why Paul and those with him **do not become discouraged**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the relationship more explicit. Alternate translation: “because we have” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
4:1	uoxl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἔχοντες τὴν διακονίαν ταύτην	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **ministry**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “minister.” Alternate translation: “being able to minister in this way” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
4:1	h1ud		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καθὼς ἠλεήθημεν	1	Here, this phrase could indicate: (1) the way that Paul and those with him received the **ministry**. Alternate translation: “which we received by God’s mercy” (2) what led to Paul and those with him receiving the ministry, which was their conversions. Alternate translation: “which we received after God had mercy on us” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:1	que0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἠλεήθημεν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **mercy**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “merciful” or an adverb such as “mercifully.” Alternate translation: “God acted mercifully toward us” or “God was merciful to us” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
4:1	ix7n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	οὐκ ἐνκακοῦμεν	1	Here, the word **discouraged** could refer to: (1) losing motivation and confidence.

4:2	yp4g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	ἀλλὰ	1	Here, the word **Instead** introduces a contrast with “becoming discouraged” in the previous verse ([4:1](../04/01.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces this kind of contrast. Alternate translation: “Instead of that” or “On the other hand” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
4:2	z4c2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὰ κρυπτὰ τῆς αἰσχύνης	1	Here, the phrase **shameful hidden things** could refer to: (1) things that people “hide” because they are **shameful**. Alternate translation: “the shameful things that people hide” (2) things that are both **hidden** and **shameful**. Alternate translation: “anything that is shameful and hidden” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:2	ey75		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	μὴ περιπατοῦντες	1	Paul speaks of behavior in life as if it were **walking in** something. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea with a comparable metaphor or with plain language. Alternate translation: “not acting” or “not behaving” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
4:2	vvzc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐν πανουργίᾳ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **craftiness**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “crafty” or an adverb such as “craftily.” Alternate translation: “craftily” or “in a crafty way” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
4:2	lzn0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	δολοῦντες	1	Here, the word **distorting** refers to changing something so that it is different than how it started. In this case, Paul is referring to changing **the word of God** so that it is not purely what God said. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to changing something or making it less pure. Alternate translation: “perverting” or “altering” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
4:2	gcqm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τὸν λόγον τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Here Paul uses the possessive form to describe a **word** that comes from **God**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in a more natural way. Alternate translation: “the word that comes from God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
4:2	gp3g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τὸν λόγον	1	Here, the word **word** represents what someone says in words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “the words” or “the communication” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
4:2	mrri		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τῇ φανερώσει τῆς ἀληθείας	1	Here Paul uses the possessive form to describe a **manifestation** that reveals **the truth**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in a more natural way. Alternate translation: “by revealing the truth” or “by making the truth known** (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
4:2	e7y7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τῇ φανερώσει τῆς ἀληθείας	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **manifestation** and **truth**, you could express the ideas by using a verb such as “reveal” and an adjective such as “true.” Alternate translation: “by revealing what is true” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
4:2	rqin		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	συνιστάνοντες ἑαυτοὺς	1	Here, phrase **commend ourselves** refers to the practice of stating why one should be trusted and welcomed. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to giving reasons why people should welcome and trust a person. See you how you translated the similar phrase in [3:1](../03/01.md). Alternate translation: “speaking favorably of ourselves” or “vouching for ourselves” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
4:2	aj24		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	ἀνθρώπων	1	Although the word **man’s** is masculine, Paul is using it to refer to any person, either man or woman. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a non-gendered word or refer to both genders. Alternate translation: “person’s” or “to man’s and woman’s” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
4:2	f6n1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐνώπιον τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Here, Paul refers to being **before God** to indicate a close connection to God. The phrase could indicate that: (1) God testifies or bears witness to Paul and those with him. Alternate translation: “with God testifying about us” (2) people can recognize that Paul preaches the gospel only when they are **before God** or in God’s presence. Alternate translation: “that is in God’s presence” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
4:3	lu2h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1	Here, the word **But** introduces a development from what Paul said in the previous verse ([4:2](../04/02.md)). In this verse, he explains that, although they reveal “the truth,” it may be **veiled** to some people. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces this kind of development. Alternate translation: “Now” or “However,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
4:3	m82q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἰ & καὶ	1	Here Paul could be using **even if** to introduce: (1) something that he thinks really is true. Alternate translation: “even though” (2) something that he thinks might be true. Alternate translation: “supposing that” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
4:3	mti5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἔστιν κεκαλυμμένον τὸ εὐαγγέλιον ἡμῶν, ἐν τοῖς ἀπολλυμένοις ἐστὶν κεκαλυμμένον	1	Here Paul again uses the language of “veiling,” just as he did in [3:12–18](../03/12.md). A **gospel** that **is veiled** is one that people do not understand or believe in. If possible, express the idea the same way you did in [3:12–18](../03/12.md). Alternate translation: “it is as if a veil hides our gospel, this happens to the ones perishing” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
4:3	hz2f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	εἰ & ἔστιν κεκαλυμμένον τὸ εὐαγγέλιον ἡμῶν, ἐν & ἐστὶν κεκαλυμμένον	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If possible, avoid stating who does the “veiling” and instead refer to how a “veil” hides the **gospel**. Alternate translation: “if a veil covers our gospel, this happens for” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
4:3	e5yu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	τοῖς ἀπολλυμένοις	1	Christians disagree over whether God causes people to “perish” or whether people cause themselves to “perish.” The word that Paul uses here intentionally does not include the person who causes the perishing. If possible, your translation also should avoid stating who causes the “perishing.” See how you translated the similar phrase in [2:15](../02/15.md). Alternate translation: “the ones on the path to destruction” or “the ones who are not being saved” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])
4:4	m71d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὁ θεὸς τοῦ αἰῶνος τούτου	1	Here, the phrase **the god of this age** refers to Satan, or the devil. Paul describes him in this way because God has allowed Satan to have some control or power in **this age**, which refers to the world as it is right now. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “the god of this age, Satan,” or “the devil, who rules over this age” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:4	ptb6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	ὁ θεὸς τοῦ αἰῶνος τούτου	1	Here Paul uses the possessive form to describe a **god** who rules over or controls **this age**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in a more natural way. Alternate translation: “the god who controls this age” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
4:4	r6pz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐτύφλωσεν τὰ νοήματα τῶν ἀπίστων, εἰς τὸ μὴ αὐγάσαι τὸν φωτισμὸν τοῦ εὐαγγελίου τῆς δόξης τοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	Here Paul speaks as if **minds** were eyes that could be **blinded** or that could see **light**. If **minds** are **blinded**, they cannot understand something. If **minds** can see **light**, they can understand something. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use simile or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “has made the minds of the unbelievers to be like blind eyes, so that they do not understand the gospel of the glory of Christ … just like blind eyes cannot see light” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
4:4	squ9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ἀπίστων, εἰς τὸ	1	Here, the phrase **so that** could introduce: (1) the result of **the god of this age** blinding people’s minds. Alternate translation: “of the unbelievers, with the result that” (2) the purpose of **the god of this age** blinding people’s minds. Alternate translation: “ of the unbelievers in order that” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
4:4	j1vz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τὸν φωτισμὸν τοῦ εὐαγγελίου τῆς δόξης τοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	Here the author uses the possessive form multiple times in a row. What he means is that the **light** either is or comes from the **gospel**, and the **gospel** is about the **glory of Christ**. In this last phrase, **glory** describes what **Christ** is like. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in a more natural form. Alternate translation: “the light, which is the gospel about the glorious Christ” or “the light that comes from the gospel concerning how glorious Christ is” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
4:4	hj21		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τῆς δόξης τοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **glory**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “glorious” or “great.” Alternate translation: “of the great Christ” or “Christ, the glorious one,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
4:4	fmaq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ὅς ἐστιν εἰκὼν τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **image**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “reflect” or “represent.” Alternate translation: “who reflects God” or “who represents God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
4:4	tx9h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	εἰκὼν τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Here Paul uses the possessive form to describe how **Christ** functions as the **image** that shows what **God** is like. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in a more natural way.

4:6	fy6h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	ὁ Θεὸς ὁ εἰπών	1	Here Paul introduces something that God **said**. The quotation is not directly from the Old Testament. Rather Paul is probably paraphrasing [Genesis 1:3](../gen/01/03.md), and he may also be referring to [Isaiah 9:2](../isa/09/02.md). Introduce the quotation as something that God said. If it would be helpful in your language, you could include a footnote that refers to the passages that Paul may be paraphrasing.

4:6	fkq3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	φωτισμὸν τῆς γνώσεως τῆς δόξης τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Here Paul uses the possessive form multiple times in a row. What he means is that the **illumination** either is or comes from the **knowledge**, and the **knowledge** is about the **glory of God**. In this last phrase, **glory** describes what **God** is like. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in a more natural form. See how you translated the similar construction in [4:4](../04/04.md). Alternate translation: “the illumination, which is the knowledge about the glorious God” or “the illumination that comes from the knowledge concerning how glorious God is” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])

He speaks of himself and those who proclaim the gospel as if they were **clay jars**, which are not valuable and can break easily. He speaks in this way to contrast how valuable and long-lasting the gospel is (**the treasure**) with how worthless and weak he and those who preach the gospel with him are in comparison (**clay jars**). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea plainly.

Alternate translation: “the surpassing greatness that characterizes the power” or “the surpassingly great power” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
4:7	u16o		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἡ ὑπερβολὴ τῆς δυνάμεως	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **greatness** and **power**, you could express the ideas by using adjectives such as “great” and “powerful.” Alternate translation: “how surpassingly great and powerful these things are” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

Alternate translation: “we might experience life from Jesus when we are delivered from suffering in our body” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

If your language does not use these words to describe coming back to life, you can use a comparable idiom or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “the one having restored Jesus to life will also restore us to life” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
4:14	zd0j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	σὺν Ἰησοῦ	1	Here, the phrase **with Jesus** could indicate that the Paul and those with him will: (1) be where **Jesus** is.

He speaks in this way to indicate how unimportant or insignificant the **affliction** is compared with how important or significant the **glory** is. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “small affliction … an eternal, great glory” or “insignificant affliction … an eternal, significant glory” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
4:17	jzhi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	κατεργάζεται ἡμῖν	1	Here Paul speaks as if the **affliction** were a process that was **producing** the **glory**. He means that the **affliction** leads to **glory** for **us**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “is leading us to” or “is enabling us to gain” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

4:18	fp4f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	μὴ σκοπούντων	1	Here, the word **watching** refers specifically to focusing on something or paying close attention to something.

Alternate translation: “are not focusing on” or “are not concentrating on” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:18	t2fp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τὰ βλεπόμενα, ἀλλὰ τὰ μὴ βλεπόμενα	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

5:intro	s14p				0	# 2 Corinthians 5 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n4. Paul’s ministry (2:14–7:4)\n     * Confidence in the resurrection (5:1–10)\n     * The gospel (5:11–6:2)\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Resurrection bodies\n\nIn [5:1–5](../05/01.md), Paul speaks about new bodies that believers will receive when Jesus comes back. Right now, he and those with him “groan” while they have their current bodies. That is because these bodies are weak and will eventually die. However, Paul and those with him do not want to just get rid of their bodies. Rather, they are looking forward expectantly to receiving new bodies that will not die. Paul expresses these ideas by using building and clothing language. See the sections below that address how this language functions. Make sure that your translation clearly contrasts old bodies with new bodies and does not suggest that Paul just wants to get rid of his body. \n\n### The intermediate state?\n\nIn [5:6–9](../05/06.md), Paul speaks about being “away from the body” and “with the Lord.” As the previous section has illustrated, Paul’s goal is to have a new body, not to be “away from the body.” So, what is he referring to here? There are three primary options. First, many Christians believe that Paul is talking about the time period between when a believer dies and when Jesus comes back. During this time period, the believer does not have a body but is with Jesus in heaven. Then, when Jesus comes back, the believer receives a new body. Second, some Christians believe that Paul is talking about how believers receive new bodies immediately after they die. In other words, the next thing that a believer experiences after he or she dies is Jesus’ return. In this case, there is no time period between death and resurrection. Third, some Christians believe that Paul is speaking about how believers receive a temporary body for the time they are in heaven with Jesus before he comes back. If possible, your translation should allow for all three of these interpretations. Make sure that you include at least option one, since this is the option that most Christians believe. \n\n### New creation\n\nIn [5:17](../05/17.md), Paul speaks about how being “in Christ” leads to “new creation,” with “old things” passing away and “new things” coming. Paul uses very general language, and the “new creation” could identify the person who is “in Christ” or everything that God is making “new.” If it is about people primarily, Paul’s point is that they are made “new” when they are in Christ. If it is about the world in general, Paul’s point is that God makes the world “new” in Christ, and people experience this “new creation” when they too are in Christ. Since Paul’s language is so general, it is best to express the idea in such a way that both of these interpretations are possible. If you must choose one, most interpreters think that Paul is focusing on people here. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/creation]])\n\n### Reconciliation\n\nIn [5:18–20](../05/18.md), Paul speaks about how God “reconciles” people to himself and gives the “ministry of reconciliation” to Paul and those with him. The word “reconcile” refers to how someone restores a relationship with someone else so that they can be together again. In other words, when someone does something that breaks or hurts a relationship, “reconciliation” heals the broken relationship. Consider how you might naturally express this idea in your language. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/reconcile]])\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Bodies as homes\n\nIn [5:1–9](../05/01.md), Paul speaks about bodies as if they were homes. He identifies current earthly bodies as “tents,” which indicates that they do not last. He identifies resurrection bodies as “buildings” that God makes. Paul uses the language of “home” to indicate that people belong in bodies and not without bodies. However, he does seem to think that people can be without bodies for a period of time, just as people can leave their homes for a period of time (see the above discussion of the “intermediate state”). Further, he contrasts “tent” homes with “building” homes to indicate that the “building” is the home (that is, body) that will last forever and which believers should long for. If possible, preserve the “home” language in your translation, either in metaphor or simile form. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/house]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/tent]])\n\n### Bodies as clothing\n\nIn [5:2–4](../05/02.md), Paul mixes “clothing” language in with his “home” language. The “clothes” are bodies, and Paul again uses this language to indicate that people belong in bodies (“clothed”), not without bodies (“naked” or “unclothed”). He does not use “clothing” language to show that bodies are an unimportant part of who people are. If possible, preserve the “clothing” language in your translation, either in metaphor or simile form. However, if how Paul mixes together “home” and “clothing” language would be confusing, you may need to use only the “home” language and express the “clothing” language plainly or as “home” language. See the notes on these verses for translation options. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/clothed]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Exclusive “we”\n\nThroughout this chapter, Paul uses the first person plural. When he uses this form, he is focusing on himself and those with him, or just on himself (although this is less likely). However, he does not necessarily mean that what he says is not true of the Corinthians or of believers in general. Consider how you can communicate the focus on Paul and those with him without totally excluding the Corinthians. In every case where Paul may be using the first person plural in a way different than this, a note will explain the options. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])\n\n### Singular nouns in general statements\n\nIn [5:1–10](../05/01.md), Paul consistently refers to “body,” “building,” “tent,” and “home” in singular form. He does this because the singular form was a natural way to refer to these things in general. Throughout this section, the UST models how to express the ideas in plural form, since this is more natural for general statements in English. Consider how your language might naturally express a general statement about “bodies.” \n\n### Translating [5:21](../05/21.md)\n\nPaul speaks in a very compressed way in this verse, and Christians disagree about what exactly he means. What is relatively clear is that Paul has in mind what some people call an “interchange” between Christ and believers. Christ, who is “righteous,” is somehow identified with “sin,” and believers, who are “sinners,” are somehow identified with “righteousness.” The “in him” at the end of the verse indicates that this “interchange” occurs in union with Christ. For details about what it could mean for Christ to be “made sin” and for believers to “become the righteousness of God,” see the notes on this verse. If possible, however, your translation should be as general as Paul’s sentence. This means that you should express the general idea of “interchange” and allow for many of the possible interpretations listed in the notes.

5:1	v03z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	οἴδαμεν & ἡμῶν & ἔχομεν	1	Here and throughout this chapter, Paul uses the first person plural. See the chapter introduction for more information on how to translate these words. Here, the words **we** and **our** could refer to: (1) just Paul and those with him. Paul is focusing on himself and those with him, but he does not mean to exclude the Corinthians entirely. Alternate translation: “we who preach the gospel … our … we have” (2) Paul and everyone who believes, including the Corinthians. Alternate translation: “all of us know … our … we have” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
5:1	la71		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact	ἐὰν	1	Here, the word **if** could introduce: (1) something that Paul thinks will definitely happen, but he is not sure when. Alternate translation: “whenever” (2) something that Paul thinks might happen. Alternate translation: “even if” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
5:1	z4vs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor	ἡ ἐπίγειος ἡμῶν οἰκία τοῦ σκήνους καταλυθῇ, οἰκοδομὴν ἐκ Θεοῦ ἔχομεν, οἰκίαν ἀχειροποίητον αἰώνιον ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς	1	Here Paul speaks as if a person’s body were a **house**, **tent**, or **building** that the person lives in. This was a common way to refer to a person’s body in Paul’s culture. He identifies the current body as a **tent** that is **torn down** because this body will die. He describes the body that a person will have when God resurrects them as a **building from God** and an **eternal house** that is **not made with hands**. This is an important metaphor in [5:1–9](../05/01.md), so preserve the **house**, **tent**, and **building** language if possible. If it would be helpful, you could use a simile or identify what the **house** is in another natural way. Alternate translation: “our earthly house of this tent, that is, our mortal body, is torn down, we have a building from God, that is, our resurrection body, an eternal house in the heavens, not made with hands” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])
5:1	zy2k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἡ ἐπίγειος ἡμῶν οἰκία τοῦ σκήνους καταλυθῇ	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who does the action, you could use a vague or indefinite subject. Alternate translation: “someone tears down our earthly house of this tent” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
5:1	bvz6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	ἡ ἐπίγειος ἡμῶν οἰκία τοῦ σκήνους	1	Here, Paul uses the possessive form identify the **earthly house** as a **tent**.

See the chapter introduction for more information. Consider what would be natural in your language and use that form throughout these verses. Alternate translation: “our earthly houses of these tents are torn down … buildings … eternal houses” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns]])
5:1	xifl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς	1	Many people in Paul’s culture believed that the space that they called “heaven” contained multiple layers or spheres of individual heavens. Here, Paul refers to how the **eternal house** can be found **in the heavens**. Since Paul does not include details about the heavens, translate **heavens** with a word or phrase that refers to all of heavenly space, including the idea of multiple heavens if possible. Alternate translation: “in the heavenly realm” or “in the heavenly spaces” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
5:1	bqi5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	ἀχειροποίητον	1	Here, the word **hands** refers to the main part of the body that we use to make things. So, the phrase refers to the whole person who makes things. If it would be helpful in your language, you could clarify that **hands** refers to “humans” in general, not just their hands. Alternate translation: “not made by humans” or “not made by people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
5:1	bbvr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἀχειροποίητον	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “which hands did not make” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
5:2	mt4s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	καὶ γὰρ	1	Here, the phrase **For indeed** indicates that Paul is adding more information (**indeed**) that supports what he said in the previous verse (**For**). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use words that introduce added information that supports a previous statement. Alternate translation: “Further” or “And in fact” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
5:2	tc2j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἐν τούτῳ	1	Here, the phrase **in this** could refer to: (1) the earthly house that is a tent, that is, the person’s current body. Alternate translation: “in this tent” or “in our bodies on earth” (2) the current time period. Alternate translation: “right now” or “in this time” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
5:2	yg6y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor	ἐν τούτῳ στενάζομεν, τὸ οἰκητήριον ἡμῶν τὸ ἐξ οὐρανοῦ ἐπενδύσασθαι ἐπιποθοῦντες	1	Here Paul continues to refer to mortal bodies and resurrection bodies as “houses” or “dwellings.” You should express the idea as you did in [5:1](../05/01.md). Paul also begins to refer to receiving new, resurrection bodies as if they were clothing that people could put on. This also is an important figure of speech for the following verses, so preserve the language if possible. If it is necessary, you could use a simile or express the idea in another natural way that fits with the “building” language. Alternate translation: “in this house, that is, our mortal body, we groan, longing to completely live in our dwelling that is from heaven, that is, our resurrection body” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])
5:2	ss6g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐπενδύσασθαι	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who will do the action, Paul implies that “God” will do it. Alternate translation: “for God to fully clothe us” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
5:3	bjau		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor	ἐνδυσάμενοι, οὐ γυμνοὶ εὑρεθησόμεθα	1	Here Paul continues to speak of bodies as if they were clothing. You should express the idea as you did in [5:2](../05/02.md). Alternate translation: “we have a house to live in, we will not be found homeless” or “having a new body that is like clothing, we will not be found naked, that is, without a body” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])
5:3	da0z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἴ γε & ἐνδυσάμενοι	1	Here Paul is speaking as if **having clothed ourselves** were a hypothetical possibility, but he means that it will actually be true. If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, and if your readers might misunderstand and think that what Paul is saying is not certain, then you could express the idea by using a word such as “when” or “whenever.” Alternate translation: “when indeed we have clothed ourselves” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
5:3	i4es			ἐνδυσάμενοι	1	Here Paul could mean that: (1) **we** clothe **ourselves**. Alternate translation: “we clothe ourselves” (2) God clothes “us.” Alternate translation: “God clothes us”
5:3	ap7v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	οὐ & εὑρεθησόμεθα	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Paul uses the passive form to focus on the state of being **naked** rather than on who “finds” them, so you should avoid stating a subject for **found**. Alternate translation: “we will not be” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
5:4	zvz8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	καὶ γὰρ	1	Here, the phrase **For indeed** indicates that Paul is adding more information (**indeed**) that supports what he said in the previous two verses (**For**).

Alternate translation: “Further” or “And in fact” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])

You should express the ideas as you did in [5:1–3](../05/01.md). Alternate translation: “the ones being in this tent, that is, our mortal body … we do not want to be homeless, but to have a home” or “the ones being in this tent, that is, this body … we do not want to have no body, which is like being unclothed, but to have a resurrection body, which is like being fully clothed” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])
5:4	e34b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	βαρούμενοι	1	Here Paul speaks as if he and those with were carrying a heavy “burden.” He means that something is making their lives difficult.

Alternate translation: “being troubled by many people and things” or “being oppressed” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
5:4	g9yu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	βαρούμενοι	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Paul implies that either the **tent** (their mortal bodies) or other people and things did it. Make sure your translation fits with how you chose to express the metaphor in the previous note. Alternate translation: “the tent burdening us” or “many people and things burdening us” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
5:4	f8rb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	οὐ θέλομεν ἐκδύσασθαι, ἀλλ’ ἐπενδύσασθαι	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Paul uses the passive form to focus on the state of being **unclothed** or **clothed** rather than on whoever clothes or unclothes them, so you should avoid stating a subject for **unclothed** and **clothed**. Alternate translation: “we do not want to be naked, but to have clothes on” or “we do not want to have no clothing, but to wear clothing” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
5:4	nezo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ἀλλ’ ἐπενδύσασθαι	1	This clause leaves out some words that many languages might need to be complete. If it would be helpful in your language, you could supply these words from earlier in the verse. Alternate translation: “but we want to be fully clothed” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
5:4	n78p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	τὸ θνητὸν	1	Paul is using the adjective **mortal** as a noun in order to refer to all bodies that are **mortal**.

5:4	e5zi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	καταποθῇ τὸ θνητὸν ὑπὸ τῆς ζωῆς	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “life may swallow up the mortal” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
5:4	de2b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	καταποθῇ	1	Here Paul refers to **the mortal** as if it were food that could be **swallowed up**. This illustrates that **the mortal** has been defeated as surely as if **life** devoured it as food. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this figure of speech with a comparable metaphor or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “may be destroyed” or “may be taken over” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
5:4	y0db		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τῆς ζωῆς	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **life**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “live” or an adjective such as “alive.” Alternate translation: “what is alive” or “what lives” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

5:5	m2id		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	κατεργασάμενος ἡμᾶς	1	Here, the phrase **having prepared** could refer to how God: (1) has acted in believers’ lives to get them ready for resurrection and new life. Alternate translation: “having gotten us ready” (2) created believers when they first began to live. Alternate translation: “having created” or “having made us” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
5:5	xr9o		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	αὐτὸ τοῦτο	1	Here, the phrase **this very thing** refers back to what Paul said in the previous verse about receiving a new body in place of the one that people have now (see [5:4](../05/04.md)).

5:5	n20x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish	ὁ δοὺς	1	Here Paul adding more information about **God**. He is not distinguishing between different gods.

Alternate translation: “and he has given” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish]])
5:5	g7yj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τὸν ἀρραβῶνα τοῦ Πνεύματος	1	Here, Paul is speaking of the **Spirit** as if he were a **down payment**, that is, a partial payment for a purchase with a promise to pay the rest of the amount on a future date. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. See how you translated the similar phrase in [1:22](../01/22.md). Alternate translation: “a guarantee, which is the Spirit, that he will also give us eternal life” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
5:5	kyyw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τὸν ἀρραβῶνα τοῦ Πνεύματος	1	Here Paul uses the possessive form to the **down payment** as the **Spirit**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in a more natural way. Alternate translation: “the Spirit as a down payment” or “the down payment that is the Spirit” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
5:6	clh5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	οὖν	1	# Connecting Statement:\n\nHere, the word **Therefore** introduces a conclusion or inference from what Paul has said in [5:1–6](../05/01.md).

Instead, he introduces a parenthetical statement in the following verse and then ends the sentence. At the beginning of [5:8](../05/08.md), he repeats the word that is translated **courageous** here, which indicates that he is going to resume speaking about what he started speaking about in this verse. If you can clearly indicate that Paul does not finish this sentence, you could use that form here, as the ULT does by using a dash. If your readers would find this structure confusing, you could make this verse a complete thought on its own. Alternate translation: “we are always courageous and know that being at home in the body, we are away from the Lord,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
5:6	xv3m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor	ἐνδημοῦντες ἐν τῷ σώματι, ἐκδημοῦμεν ἀπὸ τοῦ Κυρίου	1	Here Paul continues to refer to the **body** as if it were a building that a person could be **at home in**.

5:7	wok7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	διὰ πίστεως & οὐ διὰ εἴδους	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **faith** and **sight**, you could express the ideas by using verbs such as “believe” and “see.” Alternate translation: “by believing, not by seeing” or “by what we believe, not by what we see” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

Make sure that your translation matches fits with what you chose in the previous note about whether Paul implies “body” or “Lord” here. Alternate translation: “whether being in the body as if it were a home or out of the body” or “whether being present or being absent” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])
5:9	j1sl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	αὐτῷ	1	Here, the word **him** refers to the “Lord” whom Paul mentioned in the previous verse, that is, Jesus. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make explicit what the pronoun refers to. Alternate translation: “to the Lord” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
5:10	k0qb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	Here, the word **For** introduces a reason why Paul and those with him “aspire to be well-pleasing” to Jesus.

If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the idea more explicit or refer more directly to how **Christ** will “judge.” Alternate translation: “before the judgment seat that Christ will sit on when he returns” or “before Christ to be judged by him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
5:10	c499		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	κομίσηται & τὰ διὰ τοῦ σώματος	1	In this context, the phrase **receive back** refers to getting something in payment or in return for something else. Paul is speaking as if everyone **will receive back** as payment or recompense exactly what they did **through the body**.

Alternate translation: “we persuade men also to know the fear of the Lord” (2) to realize that he and those with him are people who know **the fear of the Lord** and are thus trustworthy.

Alternate translation: “we persuade men to believe the gospel” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
5:11	b7dd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	δὲ	1	Here, the word **But** introduces a contrast with how they **persuade men**. In contrast with that, they do not need to persuade God, since they are already **clearly known** by him.

Alternate translation: “God knows us clearly … that you know us clearly” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
5:11	qb7z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πεφανερώμεθα & ἐν ταῖς συνειδήσεσιν ὑμῶν πεφανερῶσθαι	1	Here Paul does not state what it is about them that is **clearly known**. Paul implies that **God** knows that they are faithful to him and preach the good news properly. Paul wants the Corinthians to recognize this also. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “we are clearly known to be faithful … to be clearly known in your consciences as faithful” or “we are clearly known to preach the truth … to be clearly known in your consciences as one preaching the truth” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
5:11	y5l1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐν ταῖς συνειδήσεσιν ὑμῶν	1	Here, the word **consciences** identifies the parts of people that can identify and recognize what is right and wrong. Paul refers to the **consciences** here because he wants the Corinthians to think about whether Paul and those with him are truly trustworthy or not. If it would be helpful in your language, you could refer to the part of the person that decides what is right and wrong, or you could use plain language. Alternate translation: “in your hearts” or “by you as consider us” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
5:12	r7sg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	οὐ πάλιν ἑαυτοὺς συνιστάνομεν ὑμῖν, ἀλλὰ ἀφορμὴν διδόντες ὑμῖν καυχήματος ὑπὲρ ἡμῶν, ἵνα ἔχητε πρὸς τοὺς ἐν προσώπῳ καυχωμένους, καὶ μὴ ἐν καρδίᾳ	1	If your language would not naturally put the negative statement before the positive statement, you could reverse the order of the elements here. Alternate translation: “We are giving you an opportunity of boasting on our behalf, so that you may have an answer for the ones boasting in appearance and not in heart. It is not that we are again commending ourselves to you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
5:12	yk4m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	οὐ πάλιν ἑαυτοὺς συνιστάνομεν	1	Here, phrase **commending ourselves** refers to the practice of stating why one should be trusted and welcomed. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to giving reasons why people should welcome and trust a person. See how you translated the similar phrase in [3:1](../03/01.md). Alternate translation: “We are not again speaking favorably of ourselves” or “We are not again vouching for ourselves” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
5:12	ufwe		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πάλιν	1	Here, the word **again** implies that Paul and those with him had already “commended themselves” at some point in the past. Most likely, this happened when they first met the Corinthians. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that makes this more explicit. See how you translated the similar form in [3:1](../03/01.md). Alternate translation: “once more” or “again, like we did at first,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
5:12	m6sy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἀφορμὴν διδόντες ὑμῖν καυχήματος	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **opportunity**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “enable” or “equip.” Alternate translation: “are equipping you for boasting” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
5:12	c134		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	ἀφορμὴν & καυχήματος	1	Here Paul uses the possessive form to describe an **opportunity** that is for **boasting**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in a more natural way. Alternate translation: “an opportunity for boasting” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
5:12	mza1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἔχητε πρὸς	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **answer**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “answer” or “respond.” Alternate translation: “you may be able to answer” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
5:12	e6k6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐν προσώπῳ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **appearance**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “appear” or “look.” Alternate translation: “what people look like” or “how things appear” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
5:12	ikd5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	μὴ ἐν	1	This phrase leaves out some words that many languages might need to be complete. If it would be helpful in your language, you could supply these words from earlier in the sentence. Alternate translation: “not boasting in” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
5:12	it2r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐν καρδίᾳ	1	In Paul’s culture, the **heart** is the place where humans think and feel. If it would be helpful in your language, you express the idea by referring to the place where humans think and feel in your culture or by using plain language. Alternate translation: “in mind” or “in who they really are” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
5:13	ys3l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1	Here, the word **For** introduces a further explanation of what Paul said “boasting” in the previous verse. In this verse, he indicates that he acts in certain ways **for** the Corinthians, even if he acts in other ways **for God**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces further explanation, or you could leave **For** untranslated. Alternate translation: “Further,” or “In fact,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
5:13	e4mp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἴτε	-1	Here, the word **if** in both places introduces situations that Paul thinks has happened. He is not using **if** to introduce things he thinks might happen. If your language does not use the conditional form for things that definitely happened, you could use another form that refers to alternate situations. Alternate translation: “whenever … whenever” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
5:13	cy57		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐξέστημεν & σωφρονοῦμεν	1	Here Paul uses two opposite phrases. These phrases could contrast: (1) fanatical or extreme behavior with moderate or sane behavior. Alternate translation: “we are fanatical … we are moderate” (2) ecstatic or visionary behavior with rational or normal behavior. Alternate translation: “we see visions … we have control of our minds” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
5:13	b4ri		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	Θεῷ & ὑμῖν	1	Here, the phrases **for God** and **for you** could indicate: (1) the people for whose benefit Paul is behaving in these ways. Alternate translation: “it is for God’s sake … it is for your sake” (2) the people to whom he directs his behavior. Alternate translation: “it is in our relationship with God … it is in our relationship with you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
5:14	a5w7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	Here, the word **For** introduces a reason why Paul acts in the ways that he does (see [5:13](../05/13.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different word or phrase that introduces a reason. Alternate translation: “We do those things because” or “We act in those ways because” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
5:14	azi9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	ἡ & ἀγάπη τοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	Here Paul uses the possessive form to describe **love** that could be: (1) **love** that **Christ** has for Paul and those with him. Alternate translation: “the love Christ has for us” (2) **love** that Paul and those with him have for **Christ**. Alternate translation: “the love we have for Christ” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
5:14	gjmd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἡ & ἀγάπη τοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **love**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “love.” Make sure that your translation fits with the option you chose in the previous note about whose **love** this is. Alternate translation: “how Christ loves us” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
5:14	y3hj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	συνέχει	1	Here, the word **controls** refers to how something forces or directs a person to act in a certain way. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different word or phrase that expresses this idea clearly. Alternate translation: “constrains” or “compels” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
5:14	l1y6			κρίναντας	1	Here, the phrase **having judged** could introduce: (1) what he and those with him think about how **the love of Christ controls** them. Alternate translation: “and we have judged” or “as we judge” (2) a reason why **the love of Christ controls** them. Alternate translation: “because we have judged”
5:14	ig7l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	τοῦτο, ὅτι	1	Here, the word **this** refers to what Paul is about to say, what he introduces with the word **that**. This form was powerful in his culture. If it would not be powerful in your culture, and if your readers might find both **this** and **that** confusing, you could express the idea in a more natural way. Alternate translation: “that” or “what follows:” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
5:14	nd9g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	εἷς	1	Paul is using the adjective **one** as a noun in order to refer to **Christ**, who is **one** person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this one with a noun phrase, and you could make explicit to whom **one** refers. Alternate translation: “one human” or “one human, Christ,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
5:14	crsa		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὑπὲρ	1	Here, the phrase **for the sake of** could indicate that Jesus **died**: (1) to benefit or help others.

Alternate translation: “all humans … all humans” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
5:14	ocra		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	πάντων & οἱ πάντες	1	Here, the word **all** could refer in general to all humans, or it could refer more specifically to all humans who believe in Jesus. Since Paul did not clarify which he meant, if possible you also should use a general word that could be interpreted in either way. Alternate translation: “everyone … everyone” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])
5:14	nezi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	οἱ πάντες ἀπέθανον	1	Here Paul speaks as if **all died** because or when Jesus **died**. Since the following verse states that some people are still “living,” he cannot mean that every person has physically **died**. He may mean that people have **died** to sin, or that they participated in how Christ **died**, or that who they used to be **died**. Since some or all of these interpretations are possible, preserve the metaphor or express the idea in a form that could allow for several of these interpretations, such as in simile form. Alternate translation: “in a way, all died” or “all died in a manner of speaking” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
5:15	h831		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὑπὲρ	-1	Here, much like in [5:14](../05/14.md), the word **for** could indicate that Jesus **died**: (1) to benefit or help others.

5:15	b5d1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	πάντων	1	Paul is using the adjective **all** as a noun in order to refer to **all** people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way.

5:15	rbbw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	πάντων	1	Here, just as in [5:14](../05/14.md), the word **all** could refer in general to all humans, or it could refer more specifically to all humans who believe in Jesus.

5:15	g9k4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ἀλλὰ τῷ	1	This clause leaves out some words that many languages might need to be complete. If it would be helpful in your language, you could supply these words from the first half of the verse. Alternate translation: “but they should live for the one” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
5:15	ri6f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	τῷ	1	Here, the word **one** refers to the same person that **he** refers to at the beginning of the verse: Jesus the Messiah. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make explicit to whom **one** refers. Alternate translation: “for the Messiah, the ones” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
5:15	h52q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐγερθέντι	1	Paul uses the word **raised** to refer to someone who had previously died coming back to life.

5:15	aovc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	αὐτῶν & καὶ ἐγερθέντι	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Paul implies that “God” did it. Alternate translation: “them, the one whom God raised” or “them, whom God raised” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
5:16	ic21		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ὥστε	1	Here, the word **Therefore** introduces an inference conclusion from what Paul has said, especially referring back to [5:14–15](../05/14.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces an inference from previous claims. Alternate translation: “So then” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
5:16	f2ww		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀπὸ τοῦ νῦν & νῦν	1	# Connecting Statement:\n\nHere, the word **now** could refer to: (1) the time when **we** believed. Alternate translation: “starting when we believed, … since then” (2) the time in which Paul was writing this letter. Alternate translation: “from the present moment on … right now” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
5:16	efn1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἀπὸ τοῦ νῦν	1	Here, the phrase **from now on** refers to a specific moment in time (**now**) and the all time that follows that moment (**on**).

5:16	t1cc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	κατὰ σάρκα	-1	Here Paul uses the phrase **according to the flesh** to refer to human ways of thinking. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea by using a phrase that refers to human values or perspectives. Alternate translation: “according to human definitions … according to human definitions” or “according to what humans value … according to what humans value” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
5:16	y8mk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἰ καὶ	-1	Paul is speaking as **if** it were a possibility that **we regarded Christ according to the flesh** in the past, but he means that it is actually true. If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, and if your readers might think that what Paul is saying is not certain, then you can introduce the clause with a word or phrase such as “although” or “despite the fact that.” Alternate translation: “Even though” or “Despite the fact that” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
5:17	yx28		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ὥστε	1	Here, the word **Therefore** could introduce an inference from: (1) [5:16](../05/16.md). In this case, Paul is saying that “regarding” Christ in a new ways indicates that a person is also a **new creation**. Alternate translation: “Regarding Christ in this new way shows that” (2) [5:14–15](../05/14.md). In this case, Paul is saying that how Christ died for people causes them to be a **new creation**. Alternate translation: “Because Christ died for people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
5:17	khzj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical	εἴ	1	Here Paul uses the conditional form to show that being **in Christ** leads to being **a new creation**. If the conditional form does not indicate a cause-and-effect relationship like this in your language, you could express the **if** statement in a way that does show the relationship. Alternate translation: “as long as” or “supposing that” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical]])
5:17	wark		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐν Χριστῷ	1	Paul uses the spatial metaphor **in Christ** to describe the union of believers with **Christ**.

Alternate translation: “is a Christian” or “is united to Christ” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
5:17	af1b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	καινὴ κτίσις	1	Although the word **he** is masculine, Paul is using it to refer to any person, either man or woman. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a non-gendered word or refer to both genders. Alternate translation: “that person is a new creation” or “he or she is a new creation” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
5:17	tl3h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	καινὴ κτίσις	1	Here Paul does not directly what state what is **a new creation**.

5:17	vpe3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	ἰδοὺ	1	Here, the word **behold** draws the attention of the audience and asks them to listen carefully.

5:17	izkz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	γέγονεν καινά	1	Some early manuscripts include the word “all” in this clause, so that it reads, “all things have become new.” Consider whether translations that your readers might be familiar with include “all.” Otherwise, it is recommended that you follow the ULT here, since the best manuscripts do not include “all.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
5:18	whyb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1	Here, the word **Now** introduces a development of the ideas from the previous verse.

5:18	lj2h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	δόντος ἡμῖν τὴν διακονίαν τῆς καταλλαγῆς	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **ministry** and **reconciliation**, you could express the ideas by using verbs such as “minister” and “reconcile.” Alternate translation: “having commissioned us to minister so that God reconciles people to himself” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

Alternate translation: “and he did that by not counting their trespasses against them and by placing in us the word of reconciliation” (2) **not counting** further defines **reconciling**, and **having placed** introduces an action parallel to **reconciling**. Alternate translation: “that is, not counting their trespasses against them, and he was placing in us the word or reconciliation” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])

He means that God has called or commissioned them to proclaim this **word of reconciliation**.

Alternate translation: “Let God reconcile you to himself” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
5:21	jp2a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	τὸν μὴ γνόντα ἁμαρτίαν & ἐποίησεν & ἐν αὐτῷ	1	Here, the words **one** and **him** refer to Jesus the Messiah.

Alternate translation: “Jesus, who did not know sin, God made … in Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
5:21	qim8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	τὸν μὴ γνόντα ἁμαρτίαν	1	Here, the phrase **having known sin** refers to committing or doing **sin**. It does not refer just to knowing about **sin**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to committing **sin**. Alternate translation: “The one not having done sin” or “The one not having sinned” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
5:21	oxvb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἁμαρτίαν ἐποίησεν	1	Here Paul speaks as if God **made** Jesus **sin**. He could mean that God: (1) treated Jesus like he was a sinner.

6:intro	f5qu				0	# 2 Corinthians 6 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n4. Paul’s ministry (2:14–7:4)\n     * The gospel (5:11–6:2)\n     * Proofs of ministry (6:3–10)\n     * Join with fellow believers, not unbelievers (6:11–7:4)\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the quotations from the Old Testament in [6:2](../06/02.md) and [6:16–18](../06/16.md).\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Commendation of ministry\n\nIn [6:3–4](../06/03.md), Paul tells the Corinthians that he avoids doing anything that would cause offense and lead to people blaming ministry. In fact, he and those with him “commend themselves” in many ways, and he provides a list of those ways in [6:4–10](../06/04.md). Paul commends their ministry in this way because other people in Corinth were claiming that Paul was not a good apostle or minister for Christ. They claimed that they were better ministers for Christ. Paul responds here by listing what he and those with him do and experience as true ministers of Christ. Make sure that you express the list so that it shows that Paul and those with him are true ministers of Christ. \n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### “Weapons of righteousness”\n\nIn [6:7](../06/07.md), Paul states that he and with him “weapons of righteousness” for both hands. He could mean that “righteousness”: (1) is the “weapons” (2) is defended by the “weapons” (3) characterizes the “weapons.” Also the idea that the “weapons” are for both hands could indicate that: (1) Paul and those with him have an offensive weapon in one hand and a defensive weapon in the other hand (2) Paul and those with him can defend against enemies coming from any direction. Paul does not state whom he is fighting against with these “weapons,” but it is probably sin, evil powers, and people who oppose his ministry. See the notes on this verse for translation options. \n\n### “Opening” the heart\n\nIn [6:11–13](../06/11.md), Paul speaks about “opening” the heart and, in contrast, being “restricted.” He is speaking about loving other people as if it were an “open” heart and failing to love other people as it were a “restriction” in one’s insides. If your culture can express the idea of love by referring to where in their bodies people feel love, you could do so in these verses. Otherwise, you could use a comparable metaphor or plain language. See the notes on these verses for translation options. \n\n### The temple of the living God\n\nIn [6:16](../06/16.md), Paul claims that believers are “the temple of the living God.” In the last part of the verse, he quotes from the Old Testament to prove that this is true. This quotation also shows that the identification of God’s people with the temple indicates that God is with his people and treats them as his people. Since the temple is a very important part of Paul’s culture, you should preserve the temple language. If your readers would not understand the metaphor, you could express it as a simile or explain it in a footnote. See the notes on this verse for translation options. \n\n### Rhetorical questions\n\nIn [6:14–16](../06/14.md), Paul asks five questions, and each question assumes that the answer is “none” or “nothing.” Paul asks these questions to include the Corinthians in what he is arguing, not because he is looking for information. If your language does not use questions in this way, you could include answers to the questions, or you could express them as negative statements. See the notes on these verses for translation options. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### The long list in [6:4–10](../06/04.md)\n\nThese verses contain one long list of the situations and ways in which Paul and those with him commend their ministry. This list is divided into three parts. Each part uses a repeated form for each item. The first part uses the word “in” ([6:4–7a](../06/04.md)), the second part uses the word “through” ([6:7b–8a](../06/07.md)), and the third part uses the words “as” and “yet” or “but” ([6:8b–10](../06/08.md)). If possible, represent these parts in your language by using repeated words or some other natural form. Consider whether a long list like this would be natural in your language. The UST models one possible way to divide the list up into shorter sentences. \n\n### Exclusive “we”\n\nThroughout this chapter, Paul uses the first person plural. When he uses this form, he is focusing on himself and those with him, or just on himself (although this is less likely). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
6:1	kf1d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1	# Connecting Statement:\n\nHere, the word **Now** introduces a development of the ideas from the previous verses, especially from [5:20–21](../05/20.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a development, or you could leave **Now** untranslated. Alternate translation: “Further,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
6:1	tbr6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	συνεργοῦντες	1	Here Paul does not directly state **with** whom he is **working**. He could be implying that he works **with**: (1) God, since God is the subject of the previous sentence. Alternate translation: “working together with God” (2) the Corinthians, since they are the ones ho is “urging.” Alternate translation: “working together with you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
6:1	x4hc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	καὶ, παρακαλοῦμεν	1	Here and throughout this chapter, **we** does not include the Corinthians. The first person plural could refer to: (1) Paul and those who work with him. Alternate translation: “we who preach the good news also urge” (2) just Paul. Alternate translation: “I also urge” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
6:1	s8db		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	καὶ, παρακαλοῦμεν μὴ εἰς κενὸν τὴν χάριν τοῦ Θεοῦ δέξασθαι ὑμᾶς	1	Here Paul uses two negative terms, **not** and **in vain**, to indicate a positive meaning. If your language does not use two negative words like this, you could instead use one positive term. Alternate translation: “we also urge you to receive the grace of God so that it has results” or “we also urge you to receive the grace of God so that it produces its goal” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
6:1	wdla		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τὴν χάριν τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **gracious**, you could express the idea by using a verbal phrase such as “act kindly” or an adverb such as “graciously.” Alternate translation: “how God acts kindly” or “how God acts graciously” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
6:1	pdgo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	εἰς κενὸν	1	Here, **in vain** identifies a cause that does not have its intended effect. In this case, receiving **the grace of God** will not lead to salvation if the Corinthians do not persevere in living as those who have received **the grace of God**. If it would be helpful in your language, you use a word or phrase that identifies a cause that does not have its intended effect. Alternate translation: “for nothing” or “to no purpose” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
6:2	ooms		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γάρ	1	Here, the word **For** introduces a reason why the Corinthians should “receive the grace of God” (see [6:1](../06/01.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different word or phrase that introduces reason for an exhortation. Alternate translation: “because” or “since” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
6:2	u9kc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	λέγει	1	Here, the phrase **he says** introduces words that God speaks in the Scriptures. Specifically, Paul is quoting from a Greek translation of [Isaiah 49:8](../isa/49/08.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you use a form that indicates that God speaks these words that come from Isaiah. Alternate translation: “according to Isaiah the prophet God says,” or “God speaks these words through Isaiah:” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
6:2	uqu5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	λέγει & καιρῷ δεκτῷ ἐπήκουσά σου, καὶ ἐν ἡμέρᾳ σωτηρίας ἐβοήθησά σοι.	1	If you do not use this form in your language, you could translate the sentence as an indirect quote instead of as a direct quote. Alternate translation: “he says that at an acceptable time he listened to you, and in a day of salvation he helped you.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
6:2	pp3i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	καιρῷ δεκτῷ ἐπήκουσά σου, καὶ ἐν ἡμέρᾳ σωτηρίας ἐβοήθησά σοι. ἰδοὺ, νῦν καιρὸς εὐπρόσδεκτος; ἰδοὺ, νῦν ἡμέρα σωτηρίας	1	The two clauses in the quotation mean basically the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if the repetition might be confusing, you could connect the phrases with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Make sure that you use the same form for Paul’s interpretation of the quotation, which is also in parallel form. Alternate translation: “At an acceptable time I listened to you; yes, in a day of salvation I helped you. Behold, now is a favorable time; yes, now is a day of salvation” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
6:2	kilf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	καιρῷ δεκτῷ	1	Here, the phrase **an acceptable time** refers to a point in time that someone considers to proper or appropriate for doing something. Paul could be implying that this **time** is **acceptable** to: (1) God. Alternate translation: “At a time that I considered right” or “At a time appropriate for me” (2) people. Alternate translation: “At a time that people considered right” or “At a time appropriate for people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
6:2	iz3h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐπήκουσά σου	1	Here, the word **listened** indicates that God both listened and responded. If it would be helpful in your language, you could clarify that God did not just “listen” but also acted in response. Alternate translation: “I answered you” or “I listened to you and responded” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
6:2	be7i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	σου & σοι	1	Because God is speaking to one person, his special servant, **you** in the quotation is singular. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
6:2	z6w6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐν ἡμέρᾳ σωτηρίας	1	Here, the phrase **day of salvation** refers to the time when God will bring **salvation** for his people. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a more natural form for this idea. Alternate translation: “in the time of salvation” or “at the time when I gave salvation” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
6:2	qrdt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	σωτηρίας	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **salvation**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “save.” Alternate translation: “when I saved” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
6:2	sa94		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	ἰδοὺ, νῦν	-1	Here, the words **Behold** and **Look** draw the attention of the audience and ask them to listen carefully. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea with words or phrases that ask the audience to listen, or you could use another form that draws the audience’s attention to the statements that follow. Alternate translation: “Pay attention! Now … Pay attention! Now” or “Listen, now … Now” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations]])
6:2	j4k4			καιρὸς εὐπρόσδεκτος & ἡμέρα σωτηρίας	1	Here, the phrases **a day of salvation** and **a favorable time** repeat the words from the quotation exactly, except Paul uses a word that emphasizes that the **time** is good (**favorable**) instead of just appropriate (**acceptable**). Use the form that you used in the quotation, although if possible use a word for “good” **time** instead of just **acceptable time**. Alternate translation: “is a time that God considers good … is a time of salvation” or “is a time appropriate for God … is a time when God gives salvation”
6:3	shtt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	διδόντες	1	Here, the word **giving** goes with the clause “we also urge you” in [6:1](../06/01.md). It introduces an explanation of how Paul and those with him serve God. In most languages, it is best to begin a new sentence with this verse. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that clearly links back to “we also urge” from [6:1](../06/01.md). If you use the following alternate translation, you will need to end the previous verse with a period. Alternate translation: “As we urge you to receive the grace God, we give” or “As we serve God, we give” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
6:3	v3wc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	μηδεμίαν & διδόντες προσκοπήν	1	Here, the phrase **giving no cause for offense** refers to how a person acts so that others are not offended. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a more natural form. Alternate translation: “avoiding provoking others” or “doing nothing that could cause offense” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
6:3	c9kr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	προσκοπήν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **offense**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “offend” or “upset.” Alternate translation: “cause to be offended” or “reason to be upset” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
6:3	sv9d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐν μηδενὶ	1	Here, the phrase **in anything** could refer to: (1) actions and behavior. Alternate translation: “in whatever we do” (2) people. Alternate translation: “among anybody” or “to any person” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
6:3	he3c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	μὴ μωμηθῇ ἡ διακονία	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who does the action, Paul could be implying that: (1) other people would do it. Alternate translation: “others might not blame our ministry” (2) God. Alternate translation: “God might not blame our ministry” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
6:3	fkf9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἡ διακονία	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **ministry**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “minister.” Alternate translation: “how we minister” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
6:3	winz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	μὴ μωμηθῇ	1	Here, the word **blamed** refers to how people criticize something or find fault with it. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that expresses the idea more clearly. Alternate translation: “might not be critiqued” or “might not be condemned” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
6:4	xd9l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	συνιστάντες ἑαυτοὺς	1	# General Information:\n\nHere, the phrase **commend ourselves** refers to the practice of stating why one should be trusted and welcomed. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to giving reasons why people should welcome and trust a person. Alternate translation: “we present ourselves favorably” or “we vouch for ourselves” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
6:4	p6pl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐν παντὶ συνιστάντες ἑαυτοὺς ὡς Θεοῦ διάκονοι	1	Here the word **as** could introduce: (1) who they are (**servants of God**) while they **commend** themselves. Alternate translation: “we who are servants of God commend ourselves in everything” (2) what it is that they must **commend** themselves to be. Alternate translation: “we commend ourselves in everything, proving that we are servants of God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
6:4	p9up		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	Θεοῦ διάκονοι	1	Here Paul uses the possessive form to refer **servants** who serve **God**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in a more natural way. Alternate translation: “servants for God” or “God’s servants” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
6:4	faw1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	Θεοῦ & ἐν ὑπομονῇ πολλῇ, ἐν	1	Here, the phrase **in much endurance** could go with: (1) the list that follows. In this case, the list gives the situation in which they have **much endurance**. Alternate translation: “of God; we have much endurance in” (2) **we commend ourselves**. In this case, the phrase gives an explanation for how they **commend** themselves, and the list gives the situations in which this occurs Alternate translation: “of God by having much endurance; we show this in” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])

Alternate translation: “And the temple of God has no agreement with idols!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
6:16	m658		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τίς & συνκατάθεσις ναῷ Θεοῦ μετὰ εἰδώλων	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **agreement**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “agree.” Alternate translation: “does the temple of God agree with idols” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
6:16	jc79		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1	Here, the word **For** introduces an explanation of what Paul said about **the temple of God**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different word or phrase that introduces an explanation. Alternate translation: “Now” or “As a matter of fact,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
6:16	s3l8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἡμεῖς	1	Here, the word **we** refers to everyone who believes in Jesus. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
6:16	aqql		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἡμεῖς & ναὸς Θεοῦ ἐσμεν ζῶντος	1	Here Paul speaks as if **we** were a **temple**. He explains this metaphor with the following quotation, which illustrates how God dwells with his people as their God. Since the **temple** is an important building in Paul’s culture, if possible you should preserve the language. If necessary, you could express the idea by using a simile form. Alternate translation: “we are like the temple of the living God” or “the living God dwells with us as if we were his temple” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
6:16	oc16		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	Θεοῦ & ζῶντος	2	Here, the phrase **the living God** identifies God as the one who “lives” and possibly as the one who gives “life.” The primary point is that God actually “lives,” unlike idols and other things that people call “god.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that emphasizes that God really “lives.” Alternate translation: “of the God who lives” or “of the true God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
6:16	es7t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	καθὼς εἶπεν ὁ Θεὸς	1	Here, the phrase **just as God said** introduces a quotation that supports what Paul has said about how **we are the temple of the living God**. The words Paul quotes could come from [Leviticus 26:12](../lev/26/12.md); [Jeremiah 31:33](../jer/31/33.md); and [Ezekiel 37:27](../ezk/37/27.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could clarify that the words that God speaks are from the Scriptures. Alternate translation: “just as God spoke through the prophets” or “as God spoke in the Old Testament” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
6:16	l298		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	εἶπεν & ὅτι ἐνοικήσω ἐν αὐτοῖς, καὶ ἐνπεριπατήσω, καὶ ἔσομαι αὐτῶν Θεός, καὶ αὐτοὶ ἔσονταί μου λαός	1	If you do not use this form in your language, you could translate the sentence as an indirect quote instead of as a direct quote. Alternate translation: “said that he would dwell among them, and walk among them; and he would be their God, and they themselves would be his people.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
6:16	u5g3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	ἐνοικήσω ἐν αὐτοῖς, καὶ ἐνπεριπατήσω	1	These two clauses mean basically the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if the repetition might be confusing, you could connect the phrases with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: “I will dwell among them; yes, I will walk among them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
6:16	g0nl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐνπεριπατήσω	1	Here the author of the quotation speaks as if God would **walk** among his people. He means that God will be as close to his people as if he was “walking” around with them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or plain language. Alternate translation: “spend time with them” or “be close to them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
6:16	vy1b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns	αὐτοὶ ἔσονταί	1	Here, the word translated **themselves** switches focus from **God** to **they**. Consider using a natural way to switch the focus to **they** in your language. Alternate translation: “it is they who will be” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns]])
6:17	fe1z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	διὸ & λέγει Κύριος	1	# General Information:\n\nHere Paul uses the words **Therefore** and **says the Lord** to introduce a quotation that provides a result or inference from what Paul said in the previous verse. Most of the quotation is from [Isaiah 52:11](../isa/52/11.md), but the phrase **and I will welcome you** is from a Greek translation of [Ezekiel 20:34](../ezk/20/34.md). The ULT indicates that the quote is from two different passages by using new quotation marks with the last line. However, it is recommended that you treat the whole verse as one quote in your translation. If it would be helpful in your language, you could introduce the quote in a natural way that shows it comes from the Old Testament. It may be more natural to move **says the Lord** to the beginning of the verse, as the UST does. Alternate translation: “Because of that … the Lord says {through the prophets}” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
6:17	vkex		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	διὸ ἐξέλθατε ἐκ μέσου αὐτῶν καὶ ἀφορίσθητε, λέγει Κύριος, καὶ ἀκαθάρτου μὴ ἅπτεσθε; κἀγὼ εἰσδέξομαι ὑμᾶς	1	If you do not use this form in your language, you could translate the sentence as an indirect quote instead of as a direct quote. Alternate translation: “Therefore the Lord says that you should come out from the midst of them, and be separate, and touch no unclean thing, and he will welcome you.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
6:17	peek		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	ἐξέλθατε ἐκ μέσου αὐτῶν καὶ ἀφορίσθητε	1	Here, these two clauses mean basically the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if the repetition might be confusing, you could connect the phrases with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: “Come out from the midst of them; yes, be separate” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
6:17	z5ld		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	αὐτῶν	1	Here, the word **them** refers to people who do not follow God and who do not trust the Messiah. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make explicit to whom the pronoun refers. Alternate translation: “of the unbelievers” or “of the people who do not follow God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
6:17	vfie		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἀκαθάρτου μὴ ἅπτεσθε	1	Here the author of the quotation uses the word **touch** to refer to interacting with someone in any way, not just by “touching” it. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “interact with no unclean thing” or “avoid every unclean thing” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
6:17	jg48		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	κἀγὼ	1	Here, the word **and** introduces what happens when people do what God commanded in the first part of the verse. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that more clearly introduces a result. Alternate translation: “and then I” or “and when you do those things, I” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
6:18	ft65		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	καὶ	1	Here uses the word **And** to introduce another quote from the Old Testament, specifically from [2 Samuel 7:8](../2sa/07/08.md) and [2 Samuel 7:14](../2sa/07/14.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that clarifies that Paul is quoting from the Old Testament. Alternate translation: “Again, as you can read in the Scriptures,” or “Even more, as it is written,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
6:18	o9h6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	καὶ ἔσομαι ὑμῖν εἰς πατέρα, καὶ ὑμεῖς ἔσεσθέ μοι εἰς υἱοὺς καὶ θυγατέρας, λέγει Κύριος Παντοκράτωρ.	1	If you do not use this form in your language, you could translate the sentence as an indirect quote instead of as a direct quote. If you do, you may need to introduce the quote more clearly and specify to whom **I** refers. Alternate translation: “And it is written that God will be to you as a Father, and you will be to him as sons and daughters, as the Lord Almighty says.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
6:18	dks6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	ἔσομαι ὑμῖν εἰς πατέρα, καὶ ὑμεῖς ἔσεσθέ μοι εἰς υἱοὺς καὶ θυγατέρας	1	These two clauses mean basically the same thing.

7:intro	hg36				0	# 2 Corinthians 7 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n4. Paul’s ministry (2:14–7:4)\n     * Join with fellow believers, not unbelievers (6:11–7:4)\n5. Paul rejoices about Titus’ visit to the Corinthians (7:5–16)\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Boasting\n\nIn [7:4](../07/04.md), [14](../07/14.md), Paul refers to how he boasts about the Corinthians. What he means is that he tells people about how wonderful and great he thinks they are. It is important to indicate that Paul is not describing the Corinthians as better than they actually are. Rather, Paul indicates in [7:14](../07/14.md) that what he says about them is actually true. Use a word or phrase that refers to saying good things that are true about someone else. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/boast]])\n\n### Encouragement and comfort\n\nThe words for “encouragement” and “comfort” are very closely related. Sometimes it is not clear whether Paul is focusing more on the encouragement (which implies urging someone to act) or more on the comfort (which implies making someone feel better). If you have a word or phrase that can indicate both comfort and encouragement, you could use it in this chapter. Otherwise, consider which emphasis the context implies. Generally, the ULT models one option, and the UST models the other option. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/comfort]])\n\n### The previous letter\n\nIn [7:8–12](../07/08.md), Paul refers to a letter that he had already written and sent to the Corinthians. He has already referred to this letter in chapter 2. While a few scholars think this letter is 1 Corinthians, most likely we do not have this previous letter. Paul acknowledges that this previous letter might have “grieved” them, but he wants them to know that he wrote the letter to help them do what was right. In your translation, make sure that these verses refer to a letter that Paul previously wrote, not to 2 Corinthians.\n\n### Grief and sorrow\n\nThe words for being “grieved” and for “sorrow” are very closely related. Paul uses these words to refer to being hurt or feeling upset about something. Paul distinguishes between two kinds of “sorrow”: one that is with respect to God or godly, the other that is with respect to the world or worldly. If possible use a word or words that are general enough to refer to both kinds of “sorrow.” \n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Exclusive “we”\n\nThroughout this chapter, Paul uses the words “we,” “us,” and “our” to refer to himself and those who work with him. He does not include the Corinthians except in [7:1](../07/01.md). You should assume that Paul only means himself and those with him unless a note specifies otherwise. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])\n\n### Switches between first person singular and first person plural\n\nThroughout this chapter, Paul switches between singular forms (“I”) and plural forms (“we”) of the first person. These switches are probably not just stylistic. Rather, they indicate when Paul is referring just to himself and when he is referring to himself and those who serve with him. If possible, preserve these switches in your translation. \n\n### What happened in Corinth\n\nIn this chapter, Paul continues to refer to something that happened in Corinth, something he already discussed in chapter 2. However, Paul gives even less details than he did in chapter 2 about what happened. What we know is that a person, probably a man, from the Corinthians’ group did something wrong and hurt some of the Corinthians and possibly also Paul. Paul in response wrote a severe letter, which “grieved” the Corinthians. Paul also sent Titus to Corinth to make sure that everything was resolved. In this chapter, Paul especially focuses on how happy he was to hear what Titus told him about how the Corinthians responded. Avoid providing more details in this chapter than Paul does, but make sure that your translation generally refers to events like these.
7:1	h5xv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	οὖν	1	Here, the word **Therefore** introduces an inference from what Paul has already said, especially what he said in [6:16–18](../06/16.md) about being God’s temple and family. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces an inference from a previous section. Alternate translation: “Because of that” or “On account of those things” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
7:1	k46r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ἔχοντες	1	Here, the word **having** introduces a reason why believers should **cleanse** themselves. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the relationship more explicit. Alternate translation: “since we have” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
7:1	tytd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ταύτας & ἔχοντες τὰς ἐπαγγελίας	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **promises**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “promise” or “pledge.” Alternate translation: “having been promised these things” or “God having pledged these things” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
7:1	pw5n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ταύτας & τὰς ἐπαγγελίας	1	Here Paul is referring to the **promises** from the Old Testament that he quoted in [6:16–18](../06/16.md), which indicate that believers are God’s people, that God will welcome them, and that they are God’s sons and daughters. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that clearly refers back to those **promises**. Alternate translation: “the promises that I have quoted” or “those promises” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:1	gwjt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	καθαρίσωμεν ἑαυτοὺς	1	By **us** and **ourselves**, Paul means himself, those with him, and the Corinthians, so use the inclusive form of those words in your translation if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
7:1	fv49		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	παντὸς μολυσμοῦ σαρκὸς	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **defilement**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “defile” or “corrupt.” Alternate translation: “anything that corrupts flesh” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
7:1	f00w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	σαρκὸς καὶ πνεύματος	1	Here Paul uses the word **flesh** to refer to the outward part of people, particularly the body. He uses the word **spirit** to refer to the inward part of people, the part that thinks, feels, and makes decisions. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use words that refer to similar parts of the person. Alternate translation: “of body and soul” or “of the physical and the spiritual” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:1	turq			ἐπιτελοῦντες	1	Here, the word **perfecting** could introduce: (1) another thing that believers should do while they are “cleansing” themselves. Alternate translation: “and let us perfect” or “as we perfect” (2) the result of the “cleansing.” Alternate translation: “so that we perfect” (3) how they “cleanse” themselves. Alternate translation: “by perfecting”
7:1	c2xf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐπιτελοῦντες ἁγιωσύνην	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **holiness**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “holy.” Alternate translation: “perfecting how holy we are” or “growing to be perfectly holy” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
7:1	pt41		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	φόβῳ Θεοῦ	1	Here Paul uses the possessive form to identify **fear** that is directed toward **God**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in a more natural way. See how you translated the similar phrase “fear of the Lord” in [5:11](../05/11.md). Alternate translation: “the fear that is directed to God” or “the fear that we experience for God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
7:1	xlet		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐν φόβῳ Θεοῦ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind fear, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “fear.” Alternate translation: “in how we fear God” or “through fearing God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
7:2	x55b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	χωρήσατε ἡμᾶς; οὐδένα ἠδικήσαμεν, οὐδένα ἐφθείραμεν, οὐδένα ἐπλεονεκτήσαμεν	1	Here and in the rest of the chapter, by **us** and **we**, Paul means himself and those with him but not the Corinthians, so use the exclusive form of that word in your translation if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
7:2	c2yz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	χωρήσατε ἡμᾶς	1	Here, just as in [6:11–13](../06/11.md), Paul speaks of loving others as if it was about having space in one’s insides. When people have space for other people inside them, they are loving and caring for them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or plain language. Alternate translation: “Show love for us” or “Make room in your hearts for us” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
7:2	v4nu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	οὐδένα ἠδικήσαμεν, οὐδένα ἐφθείραμεν, οὐδένα ἐπλεονεκτήσαμεν	1	# Connecting Statement:\n\nHere Paul uses three phrases with similar structure and meaning to strongly deny that he did anything to hurt any of the Corinthians. It is possible that the word **wronged** refers to doing something unjust, the word **ruined** refers to corrupting or perverting someone, and the phrase **took advantage of** refers to gaining money or things from somebody without doing anything in return. If the repetition would not communicate a strong denial in your language, or if you do not have three words for these ideas, you could express the idea with only one or two strong clauses. Alternate translation: “We wronged and took advantage of no one” or “We did not hurt any person” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
7:3	pgze		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οὐ λέγω	1	Here Paul refers to what he said in the previous verse about how he and those with him did not hurt anyone ([7:2](../07/02.md)). Here he wishes to clarify that he does not mean that it was the Corinthians who hurt people. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this relationship more explicit. Alternate translation: “I did not speak what I just spoke” or “I did not write that” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:3	bhb7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	πρὸς κατάκρισιν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **condemnation**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “to condemn you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
7:3	ckpm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	προείρηκα	1	Here Paul refers back to what he said in [6:11](../06/11.md): “our heart has been opened wide.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this relationship more explicit. Alternate translation: “I told you earlier in this letter” or “I wrote above in this letter” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:3	fay3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐν ταῖς καρδίαις ἡμῶν ἐστε	1	Here Paul speaks as if the Corinthians were in the **hearts** of him and those with him. He means that they love the Corinthians very much. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “you are in our affections” or “we love you very much” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
7:3	xzg3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	εἰς τὸ συναποθανεῖν καὶ συνζῆν	1	Here Paul refers to two extreme alternates, dying and living, to indicate that nothing that happens will keep him and those with him from loving the Corinthians. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “come what may” or “whatever may happen to us” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
7:4	uamr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	πολλή μοι παρρησία πρὸς ὑμᾶς, πολλή μοι καύχησις ὑπὲρ ὑμῶν	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **confidence** and **boasting**, you could express the ideas in a more natural way. Alternate translation: “I am very confident about you; I boast greatly on your behalf” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
7:4	yp45		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	μοι παρρησία πρὸς ὑμᾶς	1	Here Pal could be saying that he: (1) is confident that they follow Christ and do what is right. Alternate translation: “is my confidence that you follow Christ” or “is my confidence that you are doing well” (2) can speak boldly or confidently to them. Alternate translation: “is my boldness in speaking to you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:4	mh12		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	πεπλήρωμαι τῇ παρακλήσει	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Paul implies that the Corinthians did it. Alternate translation: “You have filled me with encouragement” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
7:4	k5t2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τῇ παρακλήσει	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **encouragement**, you could express the idea by using a verbal form such as “comfort” or “cheer up.” Alternate translation: “how you comfort me” or “by how you cheer me up” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
7:4	mx9b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ὑπερπερισσεύομαι τῇ χαρᾷ	1	Here Paul speaks as if he were “overflowing” with **joy**. He means that he has so much **joy** that he feels like it has completely filled him up. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable figure of speech or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “I am incredibly joyful” or “I have so much joy” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
7:4	mr75		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ὑπερπερισσεύομαι τῇ χαρᾷ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **joy**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “rejoice” or an adjective such as “joyful.” Alternate translation: “I overflow as I rejoice” or “I overflow with how joyful I am” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
7:5	rt1p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	καὶ γὰρ	1	Here, the phrase **For even** introduces further explanation of the “afflictions” that Paul mentioned in [7:4](../07/04.md). However, Paul is also speaking again about what he said in [2:13](../02/13.md) about traveling to Macedonia. Consider a natural way to reintroduce Paul’s travel plans, and if possible, use a word or phrase that introduces an explanation of the “afflictions.” Alternate translation: “Speaking of afflictions, I will tell you more about my journeys:” or “Now as for the travels I have spoken about,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
7:5	f3c5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	ἐλθόντων ἡμῶν εἰς	1	Here the phrase **having come to** refers to traveling from somewhere else to **Macedonia**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that identifies this kind of movement. Alternate translation: “having traveled to” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])
7:5	c8ju		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	ἡ σὰρξ ἡμῶν	1	Here, the phrase **our flesh** refers to the whole person. Paul uses it to emphasize the physical or bodily nature of their suffering. If it would be helpful in your language, you could refer to the whole person and not just their **flesh**. Alternate translation: “we ourselves” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
7:5	zwwy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οὐδεμίαν ἔσχηκεν ἄνεσιν	1	Here Paul continues what he was saying in [2:13](../02/13.md) about how he “had no relief” in his “spirit.” What he means is that traveling to **Macedonia** did not help with his concerns about Titus or his sufferings. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “had no relief from our sufferings and worries at all” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:5	byp3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	οὐδεμίαν ἔσχηκεν ἄνεσιν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **relief**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “relieve” or “rest.” Alternate translation: “was not relieved at all” or “could not rest at all” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
7:5	h3cv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	θλιβόμενοι	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

8:intro	kl7m				0	# 2 Corinthians 8 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n6. Giving for the gospel (8:1–9:15)\n     * Example of the Macedonians (8:1–6)\n     * Paul appeals to the Corinthians to give generously (8:7–9:5)\n\nSome translations set quotations from the Old Testament farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text. The ULT does this with the quotation from [Exodus 16:18](../exo/16/18.md) in [8:15](../08/15.md).\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### The collection for the church in Jerusalem\n\nThroughout this chapter, Paul encourages the Corinthians to finish collecting the money they were going to contribute to what Paul was gathering to send to the believers in Jerusalem. Paul sometimes calls participating in this collection a “grace.” He often refers to this collection indirectly, which was a polite way to talk about financial matters in his culture. If people in your culture speaks more directly about financial matters, you may need to make some of the ideas more explicit. In order to encourage the Corinthians to give to this collection, Paul tells them that the Macedonian believers have already given generously ([8:1–5](../08/01.md)), states reasons why the Corinthians should give ([8:6–15](../08/06.md)), and assures the Corinthians that the people who are managing the collection are trustworthy ([8:16–24](../08/16.md)). Make sure that your translation includes these elements that encourage the Corinthians to give to the collection.\n\n### The generosity of the Macedonians\n\nIn [8:1–5](../08/01.md), Paul tells the Corinthians about how the Macedonian believers contributed generously to the collection even though they were poor and suffering. He does this to encourage the Corinthians also to give generously. While Paul does not directly compare how much the Corinthians and Macedonians have given, he does use the Macedonians as an example. Your translation should clearly present the Macedonians as an example to imitate.\n\n### Equality\n\nIn [8:13–14](../08/13.md), Paul indicates that one of the reasons for the collection is “equality” among believers. He does not mean that every believer must have exactly the same amount of possessions and money. What he does mean is that believers who have much should share with believers who have little. He wants all believers to be doing “equally” well. So, while this does not mean that everyone has exactly the same amount of possessions and money, it does mean that some believers should not be rich when others are poor. Consider how you might express the idea of general, although not exact, “equality.”\n\n### Titus and two traveling companions\n\nIn [8:16–23](../08/16.md), Paul commends Titus and then introduces and commends the two men who travel with him. Most likely, these three men traveled together and carried Paul’s letter (2 Corinthians) with them. Paul does not name the two men, but he does indicate that they are trustworthy and should be respected. If you have normal ways of introducing and commending people, you could use them here. \n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Exclusive “we”\n\nThroughout this chapter, Paul uses the words “we,” “us,” and “our” to refer to himself and those who work with him. He does not include the Corinthians. You should assume that Paul only means himself and those with him unless a note specifies otherwise. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
8:1	mm8g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1	# Connecting Statement:\n\nHere, the word **Now** introduces a new topic.

8:1	a73v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	ἀδελφοί	1	# Connecting Statement:\n\nAlthough the term **brothers** is masculine, Paul is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If you retain the metaphor in your translation, and if it would be helpful in your language, you could say “brothers and sisters” to indicate this. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
8:1	nqwf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τὴν χάριν τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	# Connecting Statement:\n\nHere, Paul is using the possessive form to describe **grace** that comes from **God**.

8:1	phws		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τὴν χάριν τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	# Connecting Statement:\n\nIf your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **grace**, you could express the same idea in another way.

8:1	d1mj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τὴν δεδομένην	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

8:1	xnfz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τῆς Μακεδονίας	1	As Paul indicates in [7:5](../07/05.md), he is in **Macedonia** when he writes this letter.

Alternate translation: “a severe trial that afflicted them” or “affliction, which was a severe trial” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
8:2	b7k5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἡ περισσεία τῆς χαρᾶς αὐτῶν καὶ ἡ κατὰ βάθους πτωχεία αὐτῶν	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **abundance**, **joy**, and **poverty**, you could express the same ideas in another way.

8:2	a6td		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἡ κατὰ βάθους πτωχεία αὐτῶν	1	Here Paul is speaking of **poverty** as if it were a **deep** hole. He means that they were very poor.

8:2	pr8c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τὸ πλοῦτος τῆς ἁπλότητος αὐτῶν	1	Here Paul is speaking of **generosity** as if it were **riches**. He means that these people had very much **generosity**, just like a “rich” person has very much money. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the greatness of their generosity” or “how much generosity they had” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
8:2	z6mt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τὸ πλοῦτος τῆς ἁπλότητος αὐτῶν	1	Here Paul is using the possessive form to describe **riches** that could: (1) indicate how much **generosity** these people had.

8:2	hcgh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τὸ πλοῦτος τῆς ἁπλότητος αὐτῶν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **generosity**, you could express the same idea in another way.

Alternate translation: “Indeed,” or “As a matter of fact,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
8:3	tf8b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	κατὰ δύναμιν & παρὰ δύναμιν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **ability**, you could express the same idea in another way.

8:3	wxoh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	αὐθαίρετοι	1	Here, the phrase **of their own accord** indicates that no one forced or required the believers in Macedonia to act as they did. Rather, they chose to do so on their own. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable expression. Alternate translation: “of their own free will” or “because they wanted to” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
8:3	soq9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	αὐθαίρετοι	1	Here, the phrase **of their own accord** could modify: (1) the implied **gave** in this verse. Alternate translation: “which they did of their own accord” (2) “pleaded” in the following verse ([8:4](../08/04.md)).

8:4	tfsj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	δεόμενοι ἡμῶν, τὴν χάριν καὶ τὴν κοινωνίαν τῆς διακονίας τῆς	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **favor**, **fellowship**, and **ministry**, you could express the same ideas in another way.

8:4	jdqw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	τὴν χάριν καὶ τὴν κοινωνίαν	1	The two words **favor** and **fellowship** work together to express a single idea. The word **fellowship** describes what **the favor** is. If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this meaning in a different way. Alternate translation: “the favor of the fellowship” or “the gift of fellowship” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
8:4	nmw8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τῆς διακονίας τῆς εἰς τοὺς ἁγίους	1	Here Paul does not give very many details about the **ministry** because he had already told the Corinthians about it in [1 Corinthians 16:1–4](../1co/16/01.md). From that passage and other passages, we know that Paul was collecting money from various churches to send to Jerusalem to help the believers there. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make it more explicit that this is what Paul is talking about. Alternate translation: “of this ministry that is for the saints in Jerusalem” or “of this ministry of sending money to the Jerusalem saints” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
8:5	y9sj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οὐ καθὼς ἠλπίσαμεν, ἀλλ’	1	Here Paul is implying that the Macedonians did more than Paul and those with him had **hoped**, not that they did less.

Alternate translation: “they first devoted themselves” or “they chose first to be servants” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
8:5	w0el			πρῶτον & καὶ	1	Here, the words **first** and **then** could indicate what is: (1) more and less important. Alternate translation: “primarily … and secondarily” (2) first and second in sequence. Alternate translation: “first … and second”

8:7	x7cd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	ἀλλ’	1	Here, the word **But** introduces a new section. It is does not primarily contrast with what Paul has already said, although it does introduce a change in focus from the Macedonians and Titus to the Corinthians. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a new a section or a change in focus. Alternate translation: “Now” or “In your case,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
8:7	mv4w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	ἐν παντὶ	1	Paul says **everything** here as a generalization for emphasis.

8:7	hy1o		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	ἐξ ἡμῶν ἐν ὑμῖν	1	Many ancient manuscripts read **from us in you**. The ULT follows that reading. Other ancient manuscripts read “from you in us.” If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of the ULT. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])

If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces the standard by which something else is proved or tested. Alternate translation: “in comparison with the earnestness of others” or “against the earnestness of others” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
8:8	x7fs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	ἑτέρων	1	Paul is using the adjective **others** as a noun to mean other people, particularly other believers.

9:intro	lt8d				0	# 2 Corinthians 9 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n6. Giving for the gospel (8:1–9:15)\n     * Paul appeals to the Corinthians to give generously (8:7–9:5)\n     * Blessing and thanksgiving (9:6–15)\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with verse [9:9](../09/09.md), which is quoted from the Old Testament.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Plans for the collection\n\nIn [9:1–5](../09/01.md), Paul continues to speak about the collection for the Jerusalem believers, how the Corinthians should contribute to it, and why he is sending Titus and two other believers to the Corinthians. For more information, see the introduction to chapter 8. \n\n### God enables and blesses those who give\n\nIn [9:6–14](../09/06.md), Paul describes how God gives people enough money and possessions so that they can give to others, and he also describes how God blesses people who do this. Finally, he explains how giving and receiving gifts glorifies God. Your translation should not suggest that God makes people who give to others very rich. Instead of that, Paul is saying that God gives some people more than they need so that they can give what they have to fellow believers, which leads to thanksgiving and glory to God. \n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Farming metaphors\n\nIn [9:6](../09/06.md), [10](../09/10.md), Paul speaks of giving to fellow believers as if it were farming. In [9:6](../09/06.md), Paul refers to how farmers who sow much seed will harvest more produce. This applies to believers giving to each other: those who give more will produce more blessings for others and glory to God. In [9:10](../09/10.md), Paul refers to how God is the one who provides the seeds and the produce for farmers. This again applies to believers giving to each other: God is the one who gives some believers more than they need so that they can share it with others, and God also makes those gifts bless others and glorify him. If possible, preserve these metaphors or express the ideas in simile form. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n
9:1	wc5l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1	# Connecting Statement:\n\nHere, the word **For** introduces a further explanation concerning why Paul and those with him boast about the Corinthians (see [8:24](../08/24.md)).

9:2	jqee		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	ὅτι Ἀχαΐα παρεσκεύασται ἀπὸ πέρυσι, καὶ	1	# General Information:\n\nIt may be more natural in your language to have a direct quotation here.

9:2	zdgk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τὸ ὑμῶν ζῆλος	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **zeal**, you could express the same idea in another way.

9:2	ynu8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἠρέθισε τοὺς πλείονας	1	Here Paul speaks as if the **zeal** of the Corinthians could stir up or provoke the believers in Macedonia.

Alternate translation: “challenged most of them” or “motivated most of them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
9:3	x7t9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	δὲ	1	Here, the word **But** introduces a contrast a with what Paul has said in [9:1–2](../09/01.md) about how eager the Corinthians are.

There are two things that Paul thinks are possibilities. First, **Macedonians** might travel with him. Second, the Corinthians might be **unprepared**. Paul wishes to say that if both these things were to happen, both he and the Corinthians would be **ashamed**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that introduces something that might happen. Alternate translation: “suppose that Macedonians come with and find you unprepared; in that case” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical]])
9:4	j8ey		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀπαρασκευάστους	1	Here Paul implies that they would be **unprepared** to give money to the collection. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the idea more explicit.

9:4	dy3x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	καταισχυνθῶμεν ἡμεῖς, ἵνα μὴ λέγωμεν ὑμεῖς, ἐν τῇ ὑποστάσει ταύτῃ	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “this situation would shame us—not to mention you.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
9:4	wyzr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	καταισχυνθῶμεν ἡμεῖς, ἵνα μὴ λέγωμεν ὑμεῖς, ἐν	1	Here, the phrase **not to mention you** indicates that Paul thinks that the Corinthians would obviously be **ashamed**, even more than Paul and those with him.

9:4	vhme		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τῇ ὑποστάσει ταύτῃ	1	Here, the phrase **this situation** could refer to: (1) what would actually happen if the Corinthians were **unprepared** in contrast to what Paul had told the Macedonians would happen.

Alternate translation: “how confident we were” or “this confidence” (3) the project that Paul was undertaking, which was the collection of money for the Jerusalem believers.

9:4	rz1f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	τῇ ὑποστάσει ταύτῃ	1	Here most ancient manuscripts read **this situation**. The ULT follows that reading. Some ancient manuscripts read “this situation of boasting.” Most likely, the phrase “of boasting” was added by accident because it appears in the similar phrase in [11:17](../11/17.md). So, it is recommended that you use the reading of the ULT. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
9:5	v9y2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	οὖν	1	Here, the word **So** introduces an inference or conclusion from what Paul said in the previous verse (see [9:5](../09/05.md)).

9:5	cka7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς	1	Paul is using the term **brothers** to mean people who share the same faith. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the believers” or “the Christians” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
9:5	q1up		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	προέλθωσιν εἰς ὑμᾶς	1	In a context such as this, your language might say “come” instead of **go**. Alternate translation: “they should come to you beforehand” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])
9:5	p927		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τὴν προεπηγγελμένην εὐλογίαν ὑμῶν	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “blessing that you promised” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
9:5	wjw5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὴν προεπηγγελμένην εὐλογίαν ὑμῶν, ταύτην	1	Here Paul uses the word **blessing** to refer to the money that the Corinthians said that they would contribute to Paul’s collection.

Alternate translation: “this blessing of money that you promised” or “this promised gift of yours” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
9:5	zg4e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	οὕτως ὡς	1	Here Paul uses both the phrase **in this way** and the word **as** to introduce the two ways in which the Corinthians could give to the collection. Your language may only use one form to introduce this information. If so, you could use just one form here. Alternate translation: “as” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])
9:5	nm2n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	μὴ ὡς πλεονεξίαν	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “not as something that we forced you to give” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
9:6	lmv6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	δέ	1	Here, the word **Now** introduces a new section. In this section, Paul gives the Corinthians more reasons why they should give generously. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a new section, or you could leave **Now** untranslated. Alternate translation: “Next,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
9:6	gho8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	τοῦτο	1	Here, the word **this** refers to the words that Paul says in the rest of this verse. If it would be helpful in your language, you could clarify that Paul is referring to what he is about to say. Alternate translation: “here is what I say” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
9:6	mm9w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ὁ σπείρων φειδομένως, φειδομένως καὶ θερίσει; καὶ ὁ σπείρων ἐπ’ εὐλογίαις, ἐπ’ εὐλογίαις καὶ θερίσει	1	Here Paul speaks as if giving money to the collection were like **sowing** seeds and reaping the harvest from what these seeds produce. In the second clause, he uses the word **blessings** to show the Corinthians how to apply what he says about farmers to the collection. Just as farmers receive a harvest that fits with how the sowed, so people who give to help other believers will receive **blessings** that fit with what and how much they gave. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a simile or clearly express how the metaphor relates to the Corinthians. Alternate translation: “giving money to help other believers is like farming. The one sowing sparingly will also reap sparingly, and the one sowing in blessings will also reap in blessings” or “the one sowing sparingly will also reap sparingly, and the one sowing generously will also reap generously. Similarly, the one giving blessings to fellow believers will also receive blessings” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
9:6	kqvb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	ὁ σπείρων φειδομένως, φειδομένως καὶ θερίσει; καὶ ὁ σπείρων ἐπ’ εὐλογίαις, ἐπ’ εὐλογίαις καὶ θερίσει	1	These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could connect the phrases with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: “the one sowing sparingly will also reap sparingly; yes, the one sowing in blessings will also reap in blessings” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
9:7	qrhq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	προῄρηται τῇ καρδίᾳ	1	Although the words **he** and **his** are masculine, Paul is using the words in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a phrase that makes this clear. Alternate translation: “he or she has decided beforehand in his or her heart” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
9:7	tzt4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τῇ καρδίᾳ	1	In Paul’s culture, the **heart** is the place where humans think and feel. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea by referring to the place where humans think and feel in your culture or by using plain language. Alternate translation: “in his mind” or “on his own” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

10:intro	abcd				0	# 2 Corinthians 10 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nSome translations set quotations from the Old Testament farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text. The ULT does this with the quoted words of verse 17.\n\nIn this chapter, Paul returns to defending his authority. He also compares the way he speaks and the way he writes.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Boasting\n\n“Boasting” is often thought of as bragging, which is not good. But in this letter “boasting” means confidently exulting or rejoicing.\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### Metaphor\n\nIn verses 3-6, Paul uses many metaphors from war. He probably uses them as part of a larger metaphor about Christians being spiritually at war. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n\n### Exclusive “we”\n\n### Flesh\n\n“Flesh” is possibly a metaphor for a person’s sinful nature. Paul is not teaching that our physical bodies are sinful. Paul appears to be teaching that as long as Christians are alive (“in the flesh”), we will continue to sin. But our new nature will be fighting against our old nature. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/flesh]])

He does not mean that he thinks these words are actually true about him, but he brings them up to respond to what others are saying.

Alternate translation: “who appears to be meek when face to face among you, but being absent, appears to be bold toward you” or “who am ‘meek’ when face to face among you, but being absent, am ‘bold’ toward you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])

Alternate translation: “acting” or “living our lives” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
10:2	t6lv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	κατὰ σάρκα	1	Here Paul uses the phrase **according to the flesh** to refer to human ways of thinking and acting.

In this verse, he specifically speaks about their **weapons**, which God empowers. He also refers to **strongholds**, which are places that an army can easily defend. He defines the **strongholds** as **strategies** or arguments against him and the gospel. Paul means that God empowers him and those with him to defeat and destroy these arguments. Paul does not mean that they are actually killing people and destroying physical strongholds. If possible, preserve the metaphor or express the idea with a simile. Alternate translation: “what we use to defend ourselves are like weapons of warfare that are not fleshly but are powerful to God for overcoming strategies and arguments, which are like strongholds” or “we do not fight with fleshly weapons but with arguments that are powerful to God for the defeating of powerful enemies and strategies” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])
10:4	d1gj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τὰ & ὅπλα τῆς στρατείας ἡμῶν	1	Here, Paul is using the possessive form to describe **weapons** that are used to fight in **warfare**.

In this verse, he speaks about **every high thing**, which are fortifications or walls. He means that he and those with him defeat or discredit anything that claims to be as great or important as **the knowledge of God**. Paul also speaks about taking thoughts **captive**. Just as the victor in a war takes the conquered people **captive**, so Paul and those with him wish to take peoples’ thoughts **captive** so that these people are obedient to Christ. If possible, preserve the metaphor or express the idea with a simile. Alternate translation: “anything that is like a high fortress that raises itself against the knowledge of God, and we control every thought like we we were taking it captive into the obedience of Christ” or “and anything that proudly claims to be more important than the knowledge of God, and we take control of every thought into the obedience of Christ” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])

Here he says that they are **in readiness** like soldiers ready to attack. When they attack, they will **avenge every act of disobedience**.

If possible, preserve the metaphor or express the idea with a simile. Alternate translation: “and being like soldiers who are ready to avenge every act of disobedience, when your obedience would be complete” or “and being prepared to punish everyone who disobeys, when your obedience would be complete” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])

10:6	ipsn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πληρωθῇ ὑμῶν ἡ ὑπακοή	1	Here Paul is referring to how he wants the Corinthians to commit to obeying. When they always work towards **obedience**, then he and those with him will **avenge every act of disobedience**. He does not mean that the Corinthians need to be perfectly obedient or **complete** specific acts of obedience. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit.

11:intro	abce				0	# 2 Corinthians 11 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nIn this chapter, Paul continues defending his authority.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### False teaching\n\nThe Corinthians were quick to accept false teachers. They taught things about Jesus and the gospel that were different and not true. Unlike these false teachers, Paul sacrificially served the Corinthians. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/goodnews]])\n\n### Light\n\nLight is commonly used in the New Testament as a metaphor. Paul here uses light to indicate the revealing of God and his righteousness. Darkness describes sin. Sin seeks to remain hidden from God. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/light]], [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/darkness]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### Metaphor\n\nPaul begins this chapter with an extended metaphor. He compares himself to the father of a bride who is giving a pure, virgin bride to her bridegroom. Wedding practices change depending on the cultural background. But the idea of helping to present someone as a grown and holy child is explicitly pictured in this passage. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/holy]] and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])\n\n### Irony\n\nThis chapter is full of irony. Paul is hoping to shame the Corinthian believers with his irony.\n\n“You tolerate these things well enough!” Paul thinks that they should not tolerate the way the false apostles treated them. Paul does not think they are really apostles at all.\n\nThe statement, “For you gladly put up with fools. You are wise yourselves!” means that the Corinthian believers think they were very wise but Paul does not agree.\n\n“I will say to our shame that we were too weak to do that.” Paul is speaking about behavior he thinks is very wrong in order to avoid it. He is speaking as if he thinks he is wrong for not doing it. He uses a rhetorical question also as irony. “Did I sin by humbling myself so you might be exalted?” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/apostle]] and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])\n\n### Rhetorical questions\n\nIn refuting the false apostles claiming to be superior, Paul uses a series of rhetorical questions. Each question is coupled with an answer: “Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they descendants of Abraham? So am I. Are they servants of Christ? (I speak as though I were out of my mind.) I am more.”\n\nHe also uses a series of rhetorical questions to empathize with his converts: “Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who has caused another to fall into sin, and I do not burn within?”\n\n### “Are they servants of Christ?”\n\nThis is sarcasm, a special type of irony used to mock or insult. Paul does not believe these false teachers actually serve Christ, only that they pretend to do so.\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### Paradox\n\nA “paradox” is a true statement that appears to describe something impossible. This sentence in verse 30 is a paradox: “If I must boast, I will boast about what shows my weaknesses.” Paul does not explain why he would boast in his weakness until 2 Corinthians 12:9. ([2 Corinthians 11:30](../11/30.md))

11:29	hhb2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τίς ἀσθενεῖ, καὶ οὐκ ἀσθενῶ?	1	The word **weak** is probably a metaphor for a spiritual condition, but no one is sure what Paul is speaking of, so it is best to use the same word here.

12:intro	abcf				0	# 2 Corinthians 12 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nPaul continues defending his authority in this chapter.\n\nWhen Paul was with the Corinthians, he proved himself to be an apostle by his powerful deeds. He had not ever taken anything from them. Now that he is coming for the third time, he will still not take anything. He hopes that when he visits, he will not need to be harsh with them. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/apostle]])\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Paul’s vision\n\nPaul now defends his authority by telling about a wonderful vision of heaven. Although he speaks in the third person in verses 2-5, verse 7 indicates that he was the person who experienced the vision. It was so great, God gave him a physical handicap to keep him humble. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/heaven]])\n\n### Third heaven\n\nMany scholars believe the “third” heaven is the dwelling place of God. This is because Scripture also uses “heaven” to refer to the sky (the “first” heaven) and the universe (the “second” heaven).\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### Rhetorical questions\n\nPaul uses many rhetorical questions as he defends himself against his enemies who accused him: “For how were you less important than the rest of the churches, except that I was not a burden to you?” “Did Titus take advantage of you? Did we not walk in the same way? Did we not walk in the same steps?” and “Do you think all of this time we have been defending ourselves to you?” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])\n\n### Sarcasm\n\nPaul uses sarcasm, a special type of irony, when he reminds them how he had helped them at no cost. He says, “Forgive me for this wrong!” He also uses regular irony when he says: “But, since I am so crafty, I am the one who caught you by deceit.” He uses it to introduce his defense against this accusation by showing how impossible it was to be true. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### Paradox\n\nA “paradox” is a true statement that appears to describe something impossible. This sentence in verse 5 is a paradox: “I will not boast, except about my weaknesses.” Most people do not boast about being weak. This sentence in verse 10 is also a paradox: “For whenever I am weak, then I am strong.” In verse 9, Paul explains why both of these statements are true. ([2 Corinthians 12:5](../12/05.md))
12:1	iwn3			Connecting Statement:	0	# Connecting Statement:\n\nIn defending his apostleship from God, Paul continues to state specific things that have happened to him since he became a believer.

12:1	rb42		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	ὀπτασίας καὶ ἀποκαλύψεις Κυρίου	1	This could mean: (1) Paul uses the words **visions** and **revelations** to mean the same thing in hendiadys for emphasis.

12:2	cz7u			οἶδα ἄνθρωπον ἐν Χριστῷ	1	Paul is actually speaking of himself as if he were speaking of someone else, but this should be translated literally if possible.
12:2	fth2			εἴτε ἐν σώματι οὐκ οἶδα, εἴτε ἐκτὸς τοῦ σώματος οὐκ οἶδα	1	Paul continues to describe himself as if this happened to another person. “I do not know if this man was in his physical body or in his spiritual body”
12:2	k4aw			τρίτου οὐρανοῦ	1	Here, the **third heaven** refers to the dwelling place of God rather than the sky or outer space (the planets, stars, and the universe).
12:4	qv5h			ἡρπάγη εἰς τὸν Παράδεισον	1	Paul continues his account of what happened to “this man” (verse 3). If your language does not use this passive form, you can state this in active form. This could mean: (1) God took this man into **paradise**. (2) an angel took this man into **paradise**. If possible, it would be best not to name the one who took the man: “someone took him up to paradise” or “they took him up to paradise.”
12:4	wm7y			ἡρπάγη	1	Here, **caught up** refers to being suddenly and forcefully held and taken.
12:4	ic45			τὸν Παράδεισον	1	Here, **paradise** could refer to: (1) heaven. (2) the third heaven. (3) a special place in heaven.
12:5	hpq6			τοῦ τοιούτου	1	Alternate translation: “of that person”
12:5	i12f			οὐ καυχήσομαι, εἰ μὴ ἐν ταῖς ἀσθενείαις	1	You can state this in positive form. Alternate translation: “I will boast only of my weaknesses”

12:7	xxi2			τῇ ὑπερβολῇ τῶν ἀποκαλύψεων	1	Alternate translation: “because those revelations were so much greater than anything anyone else had ever seen”
12:7	hu8g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐδόθη μοι σκόλοψ τῇ σαρκί	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

12:7	q5e7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	σκόλοψ τῇ σαρκί	1	Here Paul’s physical problems are compared to a **thorn** piercing his **flesh**. Alternate translation: “an affliction” or “a physical problem” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
12:7	q7lz			ἄγγελος Σατανᾶ	1	Alternate translation: “a servant of Satan”
12:7	ehp9			μὴ ὑπεραίρωμαι	2	Alternate translation: “I would not become too proud”
12:8	n76p			τρὶς	1	Paul put the words **three times** at the beginning of the sentence to emphasize that he had prayed many times about his “thorn” ([2 Corinthians 12:7](../12/07.md)).
12:8	wc7r			ὑπὲρ τούτου	1	Alternate translation: “about this thorn in the flesh,” or “about this affliction”
12:9	nr2j			ἀρκεῖ σοι ἡ χάρις μου	1	Alternate translation: “I will be kind to you, and that is all you need”
12:9	cs63			ἡ γὰρ δύναμις ἐν ἀσθενείᾳ τελεῖται	1	Alternate translation: “for my power works best when you are weak”
12:9	g8mi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐπισκηνώσῃ ἐπ’ ἐμὲ ἡ δύναμις τοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	Paul speaks of the **power of Christ** as if it were a tent built over him. This could mean: (1) people might see that Paul has the power of Christ. (2) Paul truly has the power of Christ. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
12:10	pxf1			εὐδοκῶ ἐν ἀσθενείαις, ἐν ὕβρεσιν, ἐν ἀνάγκαις, ἐν διωγμοῖς, καὶ στενοχωρίαις, ὑπὲρ Χριστοῦ	1	This could mean: (1) Paul is **content** in **weaknesses**, **insults**, **troubles**, **persecutions**, and **distressing situations** if these things come because I belong to Christ. (2) Paul is content in weakness if these things cause more people to know Christ.
12:10	s5sx			ἐν ἀσθενείαις	1	Alternate translation: “when I am weak”
12:10	xl8q			ἐν ὕβρεσιν	1	Alternate translation: “when people try to make me angry by saying that I am a bad person”

12:10	c4t2			στενοχωρίαις	1	Alternate translation: “when there is trouble”
12:10	t7qg			ὅταν γὰρ ἀσθενῶ, τότε δυνατός εἰμι	1	Paul is saying that when he is no longer **strong** enough to do what needs to be done, Christ, who is more powerful than Paul could ever be, will work through Paul to do what needs to be done. However, it would be best to translate these words literally, if your language allows.
12:11	a1ym			γέγονα ἄφρων	1	Alternate translation: “I am acting like a fool”
12:11	pzw1			ὑμεῖς με ἠναγκάσατε	1	Alternate translation: “You forced me to talk this way”
12:11	v2lr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐγὼ & ὤφειλον ὑφ’ ὑμῶν συνίστασθαι	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “you should have praised me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
12:11	f644			συνίστασθαι	1	See how you translated similar phrases in ([3:1](../03/01.md)) and ([4:2](../04/02.md)). Alternate translation: “been praised” or “been recommended”
12:11	h4d5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes	οὐδὲν γὰρ ὑστέρησα	1	By using the negative form, Paul is saying strongly that those Corinthians who think that he is **inferior** are wrong. Alternate translation: “For I am just as good as” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
12:11	s82x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony	τῶν ὑπέρλίαν ἀποστόλων	1	Paul uses irony here to show that those teachers are less important then people say they are.

12:12	kp5l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τὰ μὲν σημεῖα τοῦ ἀποστόλου κατειργάσθη	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form with emphasis on the **signs**, or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “it is the true signs of an apostle that I performed” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
12:12	d4um			σημείοις τε, καὶ τέρασιν, καὶ δυνάμεσιν	1	These are the “signs of an apostle” that Paul performed “with all perseverance.”
12:13	z35e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τί γάρ ἐστιν ὃ ἡσσώθητε ὑπὲρ τὰς λοιπὰς ἐκκλησίας, εἰ μὴ ὅτι αὐτὸς ἐγὼ οὐ κατενάρκησα ὑμῶν?	1	Paul is emphasizing that the Corinthians are wrong to accuse him of wanting to do them harm. If your readers would misunderstand this question, you could express it as a statement. Alternate translation: “I treated you the same way I treated all the other churches, except that I myself did not burden you.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
12:13	d426			αὐτὸς ἐγὼ οὐ κατενάρκησα ὑμῶν	1	Alternate translation: “I did not ask you for money or other things I needed”
12:13	sy7v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony	χαρίσασθέ μοι τὴν ἀδικίαν ταύτην!	1	Paul is being ironic to shame the Corinthians. Both he and they know that he has done them no wrong, but they have been treating him as though he has wronged them. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])
12:13	u1w9			τὴν ἀδικίαν ταύτην	1	Here, **this wrong** refers to not asking them for money and other things he needed.
12:14	ugk1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀλλὰ ὑμᾶς	1	The full meaning of this statement can be made explicit. Alternate translation: “but what I want is that you love and accept me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

12:15	nk8v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ὑπὲρ τῶν ψυχῶν ὑμῶν	1	The word **souls** is a metonym for the people themselves. Alternate translation: “for you” or “so you will live well” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

This could mean: (1) some of you will be arguing with us, jealous of us, suddenly becoming very angry with us, trying to take our places as leaders, speaking falsely about us, telling about our private lives, being proud, and opposing us as we try to lead you. (2) some of you will be arguing with each other, jealous of each other, suddenly becoming very angry with each other, quarreling with each other over who will be the leader, speaking falsely about each other, telling about each other’s private lives, being proud, and opposing those whom God has chosen to lead you.

(See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/disciple]])\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### Power and weakness\n\nPaul repeatedly uses the contrasting words “power” and “weakness” in this chapter. The translator should use words that are understood to be opposites of each other.\n\n### “Examine yourselves to see if you are in the faith. Test yourselves.”\n\nScholars are divided over what these sentences mean. Some scholars say that Christians are to test themselves to see whether their actions align with their Christian faith.

13:1	xfhc			ἐπὶ στόματος δύο μαρτύρων καὶ τριῶν σταθήσεται πᾶν ῥῆμα	1	Paul is quoting here from Deuteronomy 19:15. He has been accusing the Corinthian believers of doing wrong, and so he compares the number of his visits, during which he has observed and will observe this wrong behavior, with the number of witnesses that the Old Testament required for convicting someone of doing wrong. You may want to include some of this information in a footnote.
13:1	gs3j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐπὶ στόματος	1	Paul is using the term **mouth** to mean the words that people say by using their mouths. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a more natural expression from your language or you could state the meaning plainly.

13:2	da34		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	οὐ φείσομαι	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a positive expression to translate this double negative that consists of the negative particle **not** and the negative verb **spare**. Alternate translation: “I will certainly punish everyone” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
13:3	svtr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	δοκιμὴν ζητεῖτε τοῦ ἐν ἐμοὶ λαλοῦντος Χριστοῦ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **proof**, you could express the same idea in another way.

13:3	ffwe		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ὃς	1	The pronoun **who** refers to **Christ**. If this is not clear for your readers, you could say this here.

13:4	ezsm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἀσθενοῦμεν ἐν αὐτῷ	-1	Here, Paul is speaking of his relationship to Christ as if he were inside of Christ.

If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “You know that it is Jesus Christ himself who lives within you—unless you are not in the faith.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
13:5	sbx4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐν ὑμῖν	1	Here, **in you** could mean: (1) Jesus is intimately connected to each believing individual, as if Jesus were living inside each person.

13:6	xk7u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact	ἐλπίζω	1	Paul speaks as if he were uncertain about whether or not the Corinthian believers would understand that he is a true follower or apostle of Christ.

13:6	f8o8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns	ἡμεῖς	1	Here the word **ourselves** emphasizes that Paul is talking about his apostolic team, who introduced the Corinthian believers to Jesus Christ.

See how you translated a similar phrase in [2 Corinthians 10:8](../10/08.md). Alternate translation: “to help you become better followers of Christ and not to discourage you so you stop following him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
