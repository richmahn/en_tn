"We must never say that God is unrighteous"

# For then how would God judge the world?

Paul uses this question to show that the arguments against the gospel are not valid, since the Jews believe that God will judge all people. AT: "We all know that God will in fact judge the world!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# the world

The "world" is a metonym for the people who live in the world. AT: "anyone in the world" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
