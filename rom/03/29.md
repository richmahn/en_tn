# Or is God the God of Jews only?

Paul asks this question for emphasis. Alternate translation: "You who are Jews certainly should not think that you are the only ones whom God will accept!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Is he not also the God of Gentiles? Yes, of Gentiles also

Paul asks this question to emphasize his point. Alternate translation: "He will also accept non-Jews, that is, Gentiles" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
