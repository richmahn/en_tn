# Or is God the God of Jews only?

Paul asks this question for emphasis. AT: "You who are Jews certainly should not think that you are the only ones whom God will accept!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Is he not also the God of Gentiles? Yes, of Gentiles also

Paul asks this question to emphasize his point. AT: "He will also accept non-Jews, that is, Gentiles" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# he will justify the circumcision by faith, and the uncircumcision through faith

Here "circumcision" is a metonym that refers to Jews and "uncircumcision" is a metonym that refers to non-Jews. AT: "God will make both Jews and non-Jews right with himself through their faith in Christ" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
