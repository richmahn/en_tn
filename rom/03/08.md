# Why not say ... come"?

Here Paul raises a question of his own, to show how ridiculous the argument of his imaginary adversary is. Alternate translation: "I might as well be saying ... come!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# as we are falsely reported to say

"some lie to tell others that this is what we are saying"

# The judgment on them is just

It will be only fair when God condemns these enemies of Paul, for telling lies about what Paul has been teaching.
