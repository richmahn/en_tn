## translationNotes

* Paul continues his imaginary argument with a Jewish person, answering the questions such a person might have.
* **But if the truth of God through my lie abounded to his praise, why am I still judged as a sinner?** - Here Paul imagines someone continuing to reject the Christian gospel; that adversary argues that God should not declare that he is a sinner on judgment day if, for example, he tells lies. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]], [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
* **And why not sayâ€¦?** - Here Paul raises a question of his own, to show how ridiculous is the argument of his imaginary adversary. Alternate translation: "I might as well be saying that we should do evil things in order that good things may happen as a result!" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
* **as we are falsely reported to say** - Alternate translation: "Some liars tell others that this is what we are saying."
* **The judgment on them is just** - It will be only fair when God condemns these enemies of Paul, for telling lies about what Paul has been teaching.
