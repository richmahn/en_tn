# But if the truth of God through my lie provides abundant praise for him, why am I still being judged as a sinner?

Here Paul imagines someone continuing to reject the Christian gospel. That adversary argues, because his sin shows the righteousness of God, then God should not declare that he is a sinner on judgment day if, for example, he tells lies. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Why not say ... come"?

Here Paul raises a question of his own, to show how ridiculous the argument of his imaginary adversary is. AT: "I might as well be saying ... come!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# as we are falsely reported to say

"some lie to tell others that this is what we are saying"

# The judgment on them is just

It will be only fair when God condemns these enemies of Paul, for telling lies about what Paul has been teaching.
