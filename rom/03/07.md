Paul continues his imaginary argument with a Jewish person, answering the questions such a person might have.

## But if the truth of God through my lie abounded to his praise, why am I still judged as a sinner? ##

Here Paul imagines someone continuing to reject the Christian gospel; that adversary argues that God should not declare that he is a sinner on judgment day if, for example, he tells lies. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]], [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

## And why not sayâ€¦? ##

Here Paul raises a question of his own, to show how ridiculous is the argument of his imaginary adversary. Alternate translation: "I might as well be saying that we should do evil things in order that good things may happen as a result!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

## as we are falsely reported to say ##

Alternate translation: "Some liars tell others that this is what we are saying."

## The judgment on them is just ##

It will be only fair when God condemns these enemies of Paul, for telling lies about what Paul has been teaching.
