## translationNotes

* Paul continues his imaginary argument with a Jewish person, answering the questions such a person might have.
* **But if our unrighteousness shows the righteousness of God, what can we say?** - Paul is putting these words in the mouth of the imaginary Jewish person he is talking to. Alternate translation: "Because our unrighteousness shows that God is righteous, I have a question:"
* **God is not unrighteous, he who inflicts wrath, is he?** - If you use this alternate translation, be sure that the reader knows that the answer is no: "Is God, who inflicts wrath on people, unrighteous?" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **I speak according to human logic** - "I am saying this as an unrighteous person might say it."
* **how would God judge the world?** - Paul uses this rhetorical question to show that the arguments against the Christian gospel are ridiculous, since all Jews believe that God can and will judge all people. "And we all know that God will in fact judge the world!" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
