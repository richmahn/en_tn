# But if our unrighteousness shows the righteousness of God, what can we say? Can we say that God is unrighteous to bring his wrath upon us?

Paul uses these questions to present what some people were arguing and to get his readers to think about whether or not this argument is true. Alternate translation: "Some people say that since our unrighteousness shows God's righteousness, then God is unrighteous when he punishes us" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# to bring his wrath upon us

Here "wrath" is a metonym for punishment. Alternate translation: "to bring his punishment upon us" or "to punish us" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# I am using a human argument

"I am saying here what some people say" or "This is what some people say"
