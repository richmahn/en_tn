# But if our unrighteousness shows the righteousness of God, what can we say? Can we say that God is unrighteous to bring his wrath upon us?

Paul uses these questions to present what some people were arguing and to get his readers to think about whether or not this argument is true. AT: "Some people say that since our unrighteousness shows God's righteousness, then God is unrighteous when he punishes us" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# to bring his wrath upon us

Here "wrath" is a metonym for punishment. AT: "to bring his punishment upon us" or "to punish us" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# I am using a human argument

"I am saying here what some people say" or "This is what some people say"

# May it never be

"We must never say that God is unrighteous"

# For then how would God judge the world?

Paul uses this question to show that the arguments against the gospel are not valid, since the Jews believe that God will judge all people. AT: "We all know that God will in fact judge the world!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# the world

The "world" is a metonym for the people who live in the world. AT: "anyone in the world" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
