# Romans 03 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with verses 4 and 10-18 of this chapter, which are words from the Old Testament.

Chapter 3 answers the question, "What advantage does being a Jew have over being a Gentile?" (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/save]])

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Universal Condemnation #####

This chapter explains that the whole world is without excuse and has enough knowledge to seek after and believe in the true God, Yahweh. Sin is a problem for all of mankind and enslaves the unbeliever in their sin. This goea against the popular idea that "all people are basically good." (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/believe]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])

##### "For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God" #####
Because God is holy, anyone with him in heaven must be perfect. Any sin at all will condemn a person. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/heaven]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/condemn]])

##### The purpose of the law of Moses #####
Obeying the law cannot make a person right with God. Obeying God's law is a way a person shows they believe in God. People have always been justified only by faith. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/justify]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]])

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter ####

##### Rhetorical Questions #####
Paul frequently uses rhetorical questions in this chapter. It appears the intent of these rhetorical questions is to make the reader see their sin so they will trust in Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/guilt]])
