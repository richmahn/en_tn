# Connecting Statement:

Paul sums up that all are guilty of sin, none are righteous, and no one seeks God.

# What then? Are we excusing ourselves?

Paul asks these questions to emphasize his point. AT: "We Jews should not try to imagine we are going to escape God's judgment, just because we are Jewish!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Not at all

These words are stronger than a simple "no," but not as strong as "absolutely not!"

# This is as it is written

You can translate this in an active form. AT: "This is as the prophets have written in the Scriptures" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
