## translationNotes

* **But** - Paul has completed his introduction and is now beginning to make his main point.
* **now** - The word "now" refers to the time since Jesus came to the earth.
* **without the Law a righteousness of God has been made known** - This can be translated with an active verb: "God has made known a way to be righteous without obeying the Law." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
* **without the Law** - This refers to "righteousness," not to "has been made known."
* **witnessed by the Law and the Prophets** - The words "the Law and the Prophets" refer to the parts of scripture that Moses and the prophets wrote and stand for the Jewish scriptures, which are described here as people who testify in court. Alternate translation with active verbs: "and what Moses and the prophets wrote confirms this." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
* **that is, the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ** - This could be translated as a new sentence: "I am referring to a righteousness that God gives us when we believe in Jesus Christ."
* **For there is no distinction** - "For God views Jews the same way he views Gentiles" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
