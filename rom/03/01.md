# Connecting Statement:

Paul proclaims the advantage that Jews have because God gave them his law.

# Then what advantage does the Jew have? And what is the benefit of circumcision?

Paul presents ideas that people might have after they hear what he wrote in chapter 2. He does this in order to respond to them in verse 2. AT: "Some people might say, 'Then what advantage does the Jew have? And what is the benefit of circumcision?'" or "Some people might say, 'If that is true, then the Jews do not have any advantage, and there is no benefit in being circumcised.'" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# It is great in every way

Paul now responds to the concerns brought up in verse 1. Here "It" refers to being a member of the Jewish people. AT: "But there is great advantage to being a Jew!"  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# First of all

Possible meanings are 1) "First in order of time" or 2) "Most certainly" or 3) "Most importantly."

# the Jews were entrusted with revelation from God

Here "revelation" refers to God's words and promises. You can translate this in an active form. AT: "God gave his words that contain his promises to the Jews" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
