Paul again takes up his imaginary argument with a Jewish person, answering the questions such a person might have.

## Then what advantage has the Jew? And what is the benefit of circumcision? ##

Alternate translation: "Then Jewish people have no benefit from God's covenant, even though God promised they would!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## It is great ##

"There is much advantage."

## First ##

Alternate translations: "First in order of time", or "Most certainly" (see UDB) or "Most importantly."
