## translationNotes

* Paul continues his imaginary argument with a Jewish person, answering the questions such a person might have.
* **For what if some Jews were without faith? Will their unbelief make the faithfulness of God invalid?** - Paul uses these rhetorical questions to make people think. Some Jews were unfaithful to God, so some would conclude that God would not fulfill his promise. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **By no means** - "That is not possible!‚Äù or "Certainly not!" This expression strongly denies that this could happen. You may want have a similar expression in your language that you could use here.
* **Instead** - "We should say this instead:"
* **As it has been written** - "The Jewish Scriptures themselves agree with what I am saying"
