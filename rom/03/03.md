Paul continues his imaginary argument with a Jewish person, answering the questions such a person might have.

## For what if some Jews were without faith? Will their unbelief make the faithfulness of God invalid? ##

Paul uses these rhetorical questions to make people think. Some Jews were unfaithful to God, so some would conclude that God would not fulfill his promise. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## By no means ##

This expression strongly denies that this could happen. You may have a similar expression in your language that you could use here. AT: "That is not possible‚Äù or "Certainly not"

## Instead ##

AT "We should say this instead:"

## As it has been written ##

AT: "The Jewish Scriptures themselves agree with what I am saying"
