# The God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet

The phrase "crush under your feet" refers to complete victory over an enemy. Here Paul speaks of the victory over Satan as if the Roman believers were trampling an enemy under their feet. Alternate translation: "Soon God will give you peace and complete victory over Satan" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
