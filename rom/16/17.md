Paul gives one last warning to the believers about unity and living for God.

# brothers

Here this means fellow Christians, including both men and women.

# to think about

"to watch out for"

# who are causing the divisions and stumbling

This refers to those who argue and cause others to stop trusting in Jesus. AT: "who are causing believers to argue with one another and to stop having faith in God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# They are going beyond the teaching that you have learned

"They teach things that do not agree with the truth you have already learned"

# Turn away from them

"Turn away" here is an metaphor for "refuse to listen." AT: "Do not listen to them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
