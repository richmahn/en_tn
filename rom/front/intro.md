#### What is the Book of Romans about? ####

Paul wrote this letter to the Christians in Rome. Paul wanted to get them ready to receive him when he visits them. He stated his purpose was to "bring about the obedience of faith" (16:26).

In this letter Paul wrote the fullest description of his understanding of the gospel of Jesus Christ. He explained that God loves people and accepts them through Jesus Christ. He explained that all people have sinned, the Jew and the non-Jew, and God will forgive them and declare them righteous only if they believe in Jesus.
 
#### How should the title of this book be translated? ####

Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, "Romans." Or they may choose a clearer title, such as "Paul's Letter to the Church in Rome," or "A Letter to the Christians in Rome." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

#### Who wrote the Book of Romans? ####

Paul from the city of Tarsus was the author. He had been known as Saul in his early life. Before becoming a Christian, Paul was a Pharisee. He persecuted Christians. After he began to trust in Jesus Christ, he traveled several times throughout the Roman Empire telling people about Jesus.

He probably wrote this letter while he was staying in the city of Corinth in Greece during his third trip through the Roman Empire.

## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts ##

#### What are the titles used to refer to Jesus? ####

In Romans, Paul described Jesus Christ by many titles and descriptions: Jesus Christ (1:1), the Seed of David (1:3), the Son of God (1:4), the Lord Jesus Christ (1:7), Christ Jesus (3:24), Propitiation (3:25), Jesus (3:26), Jesus our Lord (4:24), Lord of Hosts (9:29), a Stumbling Stone and Rock of Offence (9:33), the End of the Law (10:4), the Deliverer (11:26), Lord of the Dead and the Living (14:9), and the Root of Jesse (15:12).

#### How should theological terms in Romans be translated? ####

Romans contains many theological terms that do not occur very much in the four gospels. As early Christians thought more about the meaning of Jesus Christ and his message, they realized that they needed words and expressions for new ideas. Some examples of these words are "justification" (5:1), "works of the law" (3:20) and "gospel" (2:16). Other such terms are "righteousness" (1:17), "grace" (1:7), "reconcile" (5:10), "salvation" (1:16), "propitiation" (3:25), "sanctification" (6:19), "glorify" (8:17) and "the old man" (6:6).

The "key terms" dictionary can help translators understand many of these terms. Also, many of the terms are abstract concepts. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

Terms such as those given above are complicated to explain. It is often hard or impossible for translators to find equivalent terms in their own languages. It can help to know that word equivalents of these terms are not necessary. Instead, translators can develop any short expressions in order to communicate these ideas. For example, the term "gospel" can be translated as "the good news about Jesus Christ." "Grace" can be translated as "God's kind gifts" or "God's acceptance of people." 

Translators should also remember that some of these terms have more than one meaning. The meaning will depend on how the author is using the word in that particular passage. For example, "righteousness" sometimes means that a person can perfectly obey God's law. At other times, "righteousness" means that Jesus Christ has obeyed God's law for us, and that God allows us to share in Christ's obedience.

#### What does Paul mean by "a remnant" of Israel (11:5)? ####

The idea of a "remnant" is important both in the Old Testament and for Paul. Most of the Israelites were either killed or scattered among other people when the Assyrians and then the Babylonians conquered their land. Only a relatively few Jews survived. They were known as "the remnant."

In 11:1-9, Paul speaks of another remnant. These are the Jews who trusted in Jesus Christ. Because of that, God saved them. (See: rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/remnant)

## Part 3: Important Translation Issues ##

#### What does Paul mean by being "in Christ"? ####

The phrase "in Christ" and similar phrase occur in 3:24; 6:11, 23; 8:1,2,39; 9:1; 12:5,17; 15:17; and 16:3,7,9,10. Paul used these kinds of phrases as a metaphor to express the reality of Christian believers belonging to Jesus Christ. Belonging to Christ means the believer is saved and is made into a friend with God. The believer is also promised to live with God forever. However, this idea can be difficult to represent in many languages, so translators must become creative.

These kinds of phrases also have specific meanings that depend on how Paul used them in a particular passage. For example, in 3:24 ("the redemption that is in Christ Jesus"), Paul referred to the redemption that we have "because" of Jesus Christ. In 8:9 ("you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit"), Paul spoke of the believers' submission "to" the Holy Spirit. In 9:1 ("I tell the truth in Christ"), Paul meant that he is telling the truth that "is in agreement with" Jesus Christ. 

Nevertheless, the basic idea of our union with Jesus Christ (and with the Holy Spirit) is evident in these passages as well. Therefore, the translator has a choice in many passages that use "in." He will often decide to represent only the more immediate sense of "in," such as, "by means of," "in the manner of," "in regard to," etc. But if the project language allows the background sense of "in union with" to appear at the same time, the translator may well decide to translate in such that makes both meanings understood. (See: rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/inchrist)

#### How are the ideas of "holy," "saints" or "holy ones," and "sanctify" represented in Romans ULB? ####

The scriptures use such words to indicate any one of various ideas. For this reason, it is often difficult for translators to represent them well in their versions. In translating into English, Romans ULB uses the following principles:
* Sometimes its meaning in a passage implies moral holiness. Especially important for understanding the gospel is the fact that God considers Christians to be sinless because they are united to Jesus Christ. Another related fact is that God is perfect and faultless. A third fact is that Christians are to conduct themselves in a blameless and faultless manner in life. In these cases, the ULB uses "holy," "holy God," "holy ones" or "holy people." (See: 1:7)
* Sometimes its meaning in a passage indicates a simple reference to Christians without implying any particular role filled by them. In cases where some other English versions have "saints" or "holy ones," the ULB uses "believers." (See: 8:27; 12:13; 15:25, 26, 31; 16:2, 15)
* Sometimes its meaning in a passage indicates the idea of someone or something set apart for God alone. In these cases, the ULB uses "set apart," "dedicated to" or "reserved for." (See: 15:16)

As translators think about how to represent these ideas in their own versions, they will often be helped by the choices made in the ULB.

#### What are the major issues in the text of the Book of Romans? ####

The following are the most significant textual issues in the Book of Romans:

* "he [God] works all things together for good" (8:28). Some older versions read, "All things work together for good."
* "But if it is by grace, it is no longer by works. Otherwise grace would no longer be grace" (11:6). The best ancient copies have this reading. However, some versions read: "But if it is by works, then is it no more grace: otherwise work is no more work."
* "May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen" (16:24). The best ancient copies do not have this verse.

Translators are advised not to translate this last passage. However, if in the translators' region there are older Bible versions that have the passage, the translators can include it. If it is translated, it should be put inside square brackets ([]) to indicate that it is probably not original to the Book of Romans. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
