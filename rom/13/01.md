# Connecting Statement:

Paul tells believers how to live under their rulers.

# Let every soul be obedient to

Here "soul" is a synecdoche for the whole person. "Every Christian should obey" or "Everyone should obey" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# higher authorities

"government officials"

# for

because

# there is no authority unless it comes from God

"all authority comes from God"

# The authorities that exist have been appointed by God

You can translate this in an active form. Alternate translation: "And the people who are in authority are there because God put them there" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
