Paul tells believers how to live under their rulers.

# higher authorities

"government officials"

# for

because

# there is no authority unless it comes from God

"all authority comes from God"

# The authorities that exist have been appointed by God

You can translate this in an active form. AT: "And the people who are in authority are there because God put them there" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# that authority

"that government authority" or "the authority that God placed in power"

# those who oppose it will receive judgment on themselves

You can translate this in an active form. AT: "God will judge those who oppose government authority" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
