# For

Paul uses this word to begin his explanation of [Romans 13:2](./02.md) and to tell about what will result if the government condemns a person.

# rulers are not a terror

Rulers do not make good people afraid.

# to good deeds ... to evil deeds

People are identified with their "good deeds" or "evil deeds."

# Do you desire to be unafraid of the one in authority?

Paul uses this question to get people to think about what they need to do in order not to be afraid of rulers. Alternate translation: "Let me tell you how you can be unafraid of the ruler." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# you will receive his approval

The government will say good things about people who do what is good.
