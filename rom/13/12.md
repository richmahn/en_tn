# the day has come near

Paul speaks of the time when people do what is right as the day. Alternate translation: "the time of righteousness will begin soon" or "it is as though it will soon be day" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Let us therefore put aside the works of darkness

Paul speaks of of "works of darkness" as if they are clothing that a person puts aside. Here to "put aside" means to stop doing something. Here "darkness" is a metaphor for evil.
