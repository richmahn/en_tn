# Pay to everyone

Paul is addressing the believers here, so this is plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# Tax to whom tax is due, toll to whom toll is due; fear to whom fear is due, honor to whom honor is due.

The word "Pay" is understood from the previous sentence. Alternate translation: "Pay tax to whom tax is due and toll to whom toll is due. Pay fear to whom fear is due and honor to him to whom honor is due" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# fear to whom fear is due, honor to whom honor is due

Here paying fear and honor is a metaphor for fearing and honoring those who deserve to be feared and honored. Alternate translation: "Fear those who deserve to be feared, and honor those who deserved to be honored" or "Respect those whom you ought to respect, and honor those whom you ought to honor" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# toll

This is a kind of tax.
