# put on the Lord Jesus Christ

Paul speaks of accepting the moral nature of Christ as if he were our outer clothing that people can see. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# put on

If your language has a plural form for commands, use it here.

# make no provision for the flesh

Here the "flesh" refers to the self-directed nature of people who oppose God. This is the sinful nature of human beings. AT: "do not allow your old evil heart any opportunity at all for doing wicked things" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
