* **owe** - This verb is plural and applies to all the Roman Christians. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
* **except** - New sentence: “Loving other Christians is the one debt that you may continue to owe” (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
* **love** - Here and through verse 10 it means the kind of love that comes from God that is focused on the good of others, even when it doesn't benefit oneself.
* **For, "You will not…"** - Paul will now show how love fulfills the Law of God.
* **You will** - All occurrences of "you" in 13:9 are singular, but the speaker was addressing a group of people as if they were one person, so you may need to use plural forms here. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
* **covet** - "Covet" means to desire to have or possess something which a person does not have and is kept from having or possessing.
* **Love does not harm** - This phrase portrays love as a person who is being kind to other people. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]]) AT: "People who love their neighbors do not harm them" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
* **Therefore** - AT: "Because love does not harm one's neighbor"
