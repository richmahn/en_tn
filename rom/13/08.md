Paul tells believers how to act toward neighbors.

# Owe no one anything, except to love one another

# Owe

This verb is plural and applies to all the Roman Christians. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# except to love one another

This is the one debt that can remain as shown in the note above.

# love

This refers to the kind of love that comes from God and focuses on the good of others, even when it does not benefit oneself.
