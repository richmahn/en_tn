# We who died to sin, how can we still live in it?

Here "died to sin" means that those who follow Jesus are now like dead people who cannot be affected by sin. Paul uses this rhetorical question to add emphasis. Alternate translation: "We are now like dead people on whom sin has no effect! So we certainly should not keep on sinning!"
