## For the death that he died to sin, he died once for all ##

The phrase "once for all" means to finish something completely. The full meaning of this can be made explicit: "For when he died he broke the power of sin completely" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

## Thus also you: consider ##

"In the same way, consider" or "For this reason consider"

## consider yourselves ##

"think of yourselves as" or "see yourselves as"

## dead to sin ##

Here "sin" refers to the power that lives within us and makes us want to sin. This could be translated as "dead to the power of sin." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## dead to sin on the one hand, but on the other hand, alive to God ##

The phrases “on the one hand” and “on the other hand” introduce two different ways of thinking about something. Alternate translation: "dead to sin but also alive to God."

## alive to God in Christ Jesus ##

Alternate translation: "living to obey God by the power Christ Jesus gives you"
