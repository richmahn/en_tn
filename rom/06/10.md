# For in regard to the death that he died to sin, he died once for all

The phrase "once for all" means to finish something completely. You can make this full meaning explicit in your translation. AT: "For when he died he broke the power of sin completely" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# In the same way, you also must consider

"For this reason consider"

# consider yourselves

"think of yourselves as" or "see yourselves as"

# dead to sin

Just as one cannot force a corpse to do anything, sin has no power to force believers to dishonor God. AT: "as if you were dead to the power of sin" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# dead to sin, but alive to God

"dead to the power of sin, but living to honor God"

# alive to God in Christ Jesus

"living to honor God through the power Christ Jesus gives you"
