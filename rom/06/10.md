## translationNotes

* **For the death that he died to sin, he died once for all** - The phrase "once for all" means to finish something completely. The full meaning of this can be made explicit: "For when he died he broke the power of sin completely" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]] and [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
* **Thus also you: consider** - "In the same way, consider" or "For this reason consider"
* **consider yourselves** - "think of yourselves as" or "see yourselves as"
* **dead to sin** - Here "sin" refers to the power that lives within us and makes us want to sin. This could be translated as "dead to the power of sin." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
* **dead to sin on the one hand, but on the other hand, alive to God** - The phrases “on the one hand” and “on the other hand” introduce two different ways of thinking about something. Alternate translation: "dead to sin but also alive to God."
* **alive to God in Christ Jesus** - Alternate translation: "living to obey God by the power Christ Jesus gives you"
