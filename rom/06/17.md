Paul continues to use slavery as a metaphor for obedience and disobedience to God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## But thanks be to God! ##

AT: "But I thank God!"

## For you were servants of sin ##

Here "sin" is described as a master that a slave would serve. Also, "sin" refers to the power that lives in us that makes us choose to do what is sinful. AT:  "For you were slaves to the power of sin" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## but you obeyed from the heart ##

Here the word "heart" refers to having sincere or honest motives for doing something. AT: "but you truly obeyed" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## the form of teaching that you were given ##

Here "form" refers to the pattern or way of living that leads to righteousness. The believers change their old way of living to match this new way of living that Christian leaders teach to them. AT:  "the teaching that Christian leaders gave you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]]).

## You have been made free from sin ##

AT: "Christ has freed you from the power of sin" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## enslaved to righteousness ##

AT: "you are now a slave to doing what is right"
