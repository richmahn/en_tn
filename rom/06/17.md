# But thanks be to God!

"But I thank God!"

# For you were slaves of sin

Slavery of sin is a metaphor meaning having such a strong desire to sin that one is unable to stop himself from sinning. It is as if sin controls the person. Alternate translation: "you were like slaves of sin" or "you were controlled by sin" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# but you have obeyed from the heart

Here the word "heart" refers to having sincere or honest motives for doing something. Alternate translation: "but you truly obeyed" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# the pattern of teaching that you were given

Here "pattern" refers to the way of living that leads to righteousness. The believers change their old way of living to match this new way of living that Christian leaders teach to them. You can translate this in an active form. Alternate translation: "the teaching that Christian leaders gave you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
