# I speak like a man

"Here I am using examples from everyday life"

# because of the weakness of your flesh

Often Paul uses the word "flesh" as the opposite of "spirit." AT: "because you do not fully understand spiritual things" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# presented the parts of your body as slaves to uncleanness and to evil

Here, "body parts" refers to the whole person. AT: "offered yourselves as slaves to everything that is evil and not pleasing to God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# present the parts of your body as slaves to righteousness for sanctification

Here "body parts" refers to the whole person. AT: "offer yourselves as slaves to what is right before God so that he might set you apart and give you the power to serve him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# At that time, what fruit then did you have of the things of which you are now ashamed?

Paul is using a question to emphasize that sinning results in nothing good. AT: "You gained nothing by doing those things that now cause you shame" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
