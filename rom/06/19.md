Paul continues to use slavery as a metaphor for obedience and disobedience to God.

## I speak like a man ##

Paul is describing "sin" and "obedience" as "slavery." AT: "I am speaking about slavery to describe sin and obedience"

## because of the weakness of your flesh ##

Often Paul uses the word "flesh" as the opposite of "spirit." AT:  "because you do not fully understand spiritual things"

## presented your body parts as slaves to uncleanness and to evil ##

Here, "body parts" refers to the whole person. AT:  "offered yourselves as slaves to everything that is evil and not pleasing to God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

## present your body parts as slaves to righteousness for sanctification ##

AT: "offer yourselves as slaves to what right before God so that he might set you apart and give you the power to serve him" â€‹

## What fruit then did you have at that time of the things of which you are now ashamed? ##

Paul is using a question to emphasize that sinning results in nothing good. AT:  "You gained nothing by doing those things that now cause you shame." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
