# I speak like a man

"Here I am using examples from everyday life"

# because of the weakness of your flesh

Often Paul uses the word "flesh" as the opposite of "spirit." AT: "because you do not fully understand spiritual things" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# presented the parts of your body as slaves to uncleanness and to evil

Here, "body parts" refers to the whole person. AT: "offered yourselves as slaves to everything that is evil and not pleasing to God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# present the parts of your body as slaves to righteousness for sanctification

Here "body parts" refers to the whole person. AT: "offer yourselves as slaves to what is right before God so that he might set you apart and give you the power to serve him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# you were free from righteousness.

"Free from righteousness" involves an idiom meaning they had the ability to do whatever they wanted (They were "free") because they had no thoughts about living a righteous life. AT: "you were able to live without thinking about righteousness.  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]]).

# Yes, and what is more

This introduces another reason why they believed Jesus would not free Israel. AT: "Now that does not seem possible because"


# At that time, what fruit then did you have of the things of which you are now ashamed?

"Fruit" here is a metaphor for "result" or "outcome." Paul is using a question to emphasize that sinning results in nothing good. AT: "Nothing good came from those things that now cause you shame" or "You gained nothing by doing those things that now cause you shame" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
