## translationNotes

* Paul continues to use slavery as a metaphor for obedience and disobedience to God.
* **I speak like a man** - Paul is describing "sin" and "obedience" as "slavery." AT: "I am speaking about slavery to describe sin and obedience"
* **because of the weakness of your flesh** - Often Paul uses the word "flesh" as the opposite of "spirit." AT:  "because you do not fully understand spiritual things"
* **presented your body parts as slaves to uncleanness and to evil** - Here, "body parts" refers to the whole person. AT:  "offered yourselves as slaves to everything that is evil and not pleasing to God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
* **present your body parts as slaves to righteousness for sanctification** - AT: "offer yourselves as slaves to what right before God so that he might set you apart and give you the power to serve him" â€‹
* **What fruit then did you have at that time of the things of which you are now ashamed?** - Paul is using a question to emphasize that sinning results in nothing good. AT:  "You gained nothing by doing those things that now cause you shame." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
