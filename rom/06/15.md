# What then? Shall we sin because we are not under law, but under grace? May it never be

Paul is using a question to emphasize that living under grace is not a reason to sin. AT: "However, just because we are bound to grace instead of the law of Moses certainly does not mean we are allowed to sin" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# May it never be

"We would never want that to happen!" or "May God help me not to do that!" This expression shows an extremely strong desire that this does not take place. You may have a similar expression in your language that you could use here. See how you translated it in [Romans 3:31](../03/31.md).
