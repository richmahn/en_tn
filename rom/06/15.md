# What then? Shall we sin because we are not under law, but under grace? May it never be

Paul is using a question to emphasize that living under grace is not a reason to sin. AT: "However, just because we are bound to grace instead of the law of Moses certainly does not mean we are allowed to sin" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# May it never be

"We would never want that to happen!" or "May God help me not to do that!" This expression shows an extremely strong desire that this does not take place. You may have a similar expression in your language that you could use here. See how you translated it in [Romans 3:31](../03/31.md).

# Do you not know that the one to whom you present yourselves as servants is the one to which you are obedient, the one you must obey?

Paul uses a question to scold anyone who may think God's grace is a reason to keep sinning. You can translate this as a strong statement. AT: "You should know that you are slaves to the master you choose to obey!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# This is true whether you are servants to sin which leads to death, or servants to obedience which leads to righteousness

Here, Paul describes "sin" and "obedience" as masters that a slave would serve. AT: "You are either a slave to sin, which results in spiritual death, or you are a slave to obedience, which results in doing the things that God wants you to do (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
