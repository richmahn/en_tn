## translationNotes

* Paul uses slavery as a metaphor for obedience and disobedience to God. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **What then? Shall we sin because we are not under law, but under grace? May it never be.** - Paul is using a question to emphasize that living under grace is not a reason to sin. Alternate translation: "However, just because we are bound to grace instead of the Law of Moses certainly does not mean we are allowed to sin."(See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **May it never be** - "We would never want that to happen!" or "May God help me not to do that!" This expression shows an extremely strong desire that this not take place. You may want have a similar expression in your language that you could use here. See how you translated it in [[:en:bible:notes:rom:03:31]].
* **Do you not know that the one to whom you present yourselves as servants for obedience, you are the servants of the one whom you obey** - Paul uses a question to scold anyone who may think God's grace is a reason to keep sinning. Alternate translation: "You should know that you are slaves to the master you choose to obey."
* **whether of sin for death, or of obedience for righteousness** - Here, "sin" and "obedience" are described as masters that a slave would serve. This could be translated as a new sentence: "You are either a slave to sin, which results in spiritual death, or you are a slave to obedience, which results in God declaring you righteous." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
