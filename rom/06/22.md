# you have your fruit for sanctification.

"Fruit" is a metaphor for "result" or "outcome". AT: "you have the result of your obedience which leads to living a life set apart for God's purposes." (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor).

# The result is eternal life

# For the wages of sin are death

The word "wages" refers to a payment given to someone for their work. "For if you serve sin, you will receive spiritual death as payment" or "For if you continue sinning, God will punish you with spiritual death"
