## buried with him through baptism into death ##

This is comparing a believer's baptism into water with Jesus' death and burial in a tomb. This emphasizes that a believer in Christ shares the benefits of his death, which means sin no longer has power over the believer. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so also we might walk in newness of life ##

This compares a believer coming to life spiritually to Jesus coming back to life physically. The believer's new spiritual life enables that person to obey God. Alternative translation, with an active verb: "just as the Father brought Jesus back to life after he died, we might have new spiritual life and obey God."

## become united with him in the likeness of his death...be united with his resurrection ##

"joined with him in his death...join with him in life after death" or "died with him...come back to life with him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
