# Romans 06 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Paul begins this chapter by answering how someone might hypothetically object to what he taught in Chapter 5. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]]) 

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Against the Law #####
In this chapter, Paul refutes the teaching that Christians can live however they want after they are saved. Scholars call this "antinomianism" or being "against the law." To motivate godly living, Paul recalls the great price Jesus paid for a Christian to be saved. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/save]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/godly]])

##### Servants of sin #####
Before believing in Jesus, sin enslaves people. God frees Christians from serving sin. They are are able to choose to serve Christ in their lives. Paul explains that when Christians choose to sin, they willingly choose to sin. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])

##### Fruit #####
This chapter uses the imagery of fruit. The image of fruit usually refers to a person's faith producing good works in their life. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/fruit]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]])

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter ####

##### Rhetorical Questions #####
Paul uses rhetorical questions in this chapter. It appears the intent of these rhetorical questions is to make the reader see their sin so they will trust in Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/guilt]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### Death #####
"Death" is used many different ways in this chapter: physical death, spiritual death, sin reigning in the heart of man, and to end something. Sin and death contrast with the new life provided by Christ and the new way Christians are supposed to live after they are saved. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/death]])
