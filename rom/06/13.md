# Do not present the parts of your body to sin, to be tools used for unrighteousness

The picture is of the sinner offering the "parts of his body" to his master or king. One's "body parts" are a synecdoche for the whole person. Alternate translation: "Do not offer yourselves to sin so that you do what is not right" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# But present yourselves to God, as those who have been brought from death to life

Here "now living" refers to the believer's new spiritual life. Alternate translation: "But offer yourselves to God, because he has given you new spiritual life" or "But offer yourselves to God, as those who had died and are now alive" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# present the parts of your body to God as tools to be used for righteousness

Here "parts of your body" is a synecdoche that refers to the whole person. Alternate translation: "let God use you for what is pleasing to him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
