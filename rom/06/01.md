## translationNotes

* **What then will we say? Should we continue in sin so that grace may abound?** - Paul is anticipating a question someone might ask about what he has written about grace in [[en:bible:notes:rom:05:20]]. For a good way to restructure this as a statement, see UDB.
* **we...us** - The pronouns "we" and "us" refer to Paul, his readers, and other people. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive]])
* **abound** - This may be translated as "increase greatly".
