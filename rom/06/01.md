## What then will we say? Should we continue in sin so that grace may abound? ##

Paul is anticipating a question someone might ask about what he has written about grace in [Romans 5:20](../05/20.md). For a good way to restructure this as a statement, see UDB.

## we...us ##

The pronouns "we" and "us" refer to Paul, his readers, and other people. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-inclusive]])

## abound ##

AT: "increase greatly"
