# that which is known about God is visible to them

You can translate this in an active form. Alternate translation: "they can know about God because of what they can plainly see" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# For God has enlightened them

Here "enlightened them" means God has shown them the truth about him. Alternate translation: "Because God has shown everyone what he is like" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
