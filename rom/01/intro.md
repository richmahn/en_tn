#### Structure and formatting ####

The first verse is a type of introduction. People in the ancient Mediterranean region often started their letters this way. Sometimes this is called a "salutation." 

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### The gospel #####
This chapter refers to the contents of the Book of Romans as "the gospel" ([Romans 1:2](../01/02.md)). Romans is not a gospel like Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. Instead, chapters 1-8 present the biblical gospel: All have sinned. Jesus died for our sins. He was raised again that we might have new life in him. 

##### Fruit #####
This chapter uses the imagery of fruit. The image of fruit usually refers to a person's faith producing good works in their life. In this chapter, it refers to the results of Paul's work among the Roman Christians. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/fruit]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]])

##### Universal Condemnation and the Wrath of God #####
This chapter explains that everyone is without excuse. We all know about the true God, Yahweh, from his creation all around us. Because of our sin and our sinful nature, every person justly deserves the wrath of God. This wrath was satisfied by Jesus dying on a cross for those who believe in him. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/believe]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter ####

##### "God gave them over" #####
Many scholars view the phrases "God gave them over" and "God gave them up" as theologically significant. For this reason, it is important to translate these phrases with God playing a passive role in the action. God simply allows men to pursue their own desires, he does not force them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### Difficult phrases and concepts #####

This chapter has many difficult ideas in it. How Paul writes makes many of the phrases in this chapter difficult to translate. The translator may need to use the UDB to understand the meaning of the phrases. And it may be necessary to more freely translate these phrases. Some of the difficult phrases include: "obedience of faith," "whom I serve in my spirit," "from faith to faith" and "exchanged the glory of the imperishable God for the likenesses of an image of perishable man."
