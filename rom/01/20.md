# For his invisible qualities ... have been clearly seen

Paul speaks of people understanding God's invisible qualities as if people have seen those qualities. This can be translated in active form. AT: "For people have clearly understood God's invisible qualities, namely his eternal power and divine nature" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# divine nature

"all the qualities and characteristics of God" or "the things about God that make him God"

# world

This refers to the heavens and the earth, as well as everything in them.

# in the things that have been made

This can be translated in active form. AT: "because of the things that God has made" or "because people have seen the things that God has made" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# they are without excuse

"these people can never say that they did not know"
