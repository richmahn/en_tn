# Paul

Your language may have a particular way of introducing the author of a letter. You may also need to tell in this same verse who the people are to whom Paul wrote the letter ([Romans 1:7](./07.md)). AT: "I, Paul, wrote this letter" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# called to be an apostle and set apart for the gospel of God

You can translate this in an active form. AT: "God called me to be an apostle and chose me to tell people about the gospel" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# called

This means that God has appointed or chosen people to be his children, to be his servants and proclaimers of his message of salvation through Jesus.
