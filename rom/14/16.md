# So do not allow what you consider to be good to be spoken of as evil

"If someone thinks that something is evil, do not do it, even if you consider it to be good"

# For the kingdom of God is not about food and drink, but about righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit

Paul argues that God set up his kingdom so he could give us a right relationship with himself, and to provide peace and joy. AT: "For God did not set up his kingdom so that he could rule over what we eat and drink. He set up his kingdom so we could have a right relationship with him, and so he could give us peace and joy" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
