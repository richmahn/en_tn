## translationNotes

* **These particular beliefs that you have** - This refers back to the beliefs about food and drink from the previous verse.
* **you...you...yourself** - singular. Because Paul is addressing the believers, you may have to translate this using plural. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
* **Blessed is the one who does not condemn himself in respect to what he approves of** - AT: "Blessed are those who do not feel guilty for what they decide to do"
* **He who doubts is condemned if he eats** - This can be translated with an active verb. AT: "God will say that the person does wrong if he is not sure if it is right to eat a certain food, but he eats it anyway" (see UDB) or "The person who is not sure if it is right to eat a certain food, but then eats it anyway will have a troubled conscience" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
* **because it is not from faith** - This can be translated as a new sentence. AT: "God will say that he is wrong because he is eating something he believes God does not want him to eat"
* **and whatever is not from faith is sin** - AT: "You are sinning if you do something that you do not believe God wants you to do"
