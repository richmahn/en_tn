# The faith you have

This refers back to the beliefs about food and drink.

# you ... yourself

singular. Because Paul is addressing the believers, you may have to translate this using plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# Blessed is the one who does not condemn himself by what he approves

"Blessed are those who do not feel guilty for what they decide to do"

# He who doubts is condemned if he eats

You can translate this in an active form. AT: "God will say that the person does wrong if he is not sure if it is right to eat a certain food, but he eats it anyway" or "The person who is not sure if it is right to eat a certain food, but then eats it anyway will have a troubled conscience" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# because it is not from faith

Anything that is "not from faith" is something that God does not want you to do. You can make explicit the full meaning here. AT: "God will say that he is wrong because he is eating something he believes God does not want him to eat" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# whatever is not from faith is sin

Anything that is "not from faith" is something that God does not want you to do. You can make explicit the full meaning here. AT: "you are sinning if you do something that you do not believe God wants you to do" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
