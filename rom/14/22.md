## These particular beliefs that you have ##

This refers back to the beliefs about food and drink from the previous verse.

## you...you...yourself ##

singular. Because Paul is addressing the believers, you may have to translate this using plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

## Blessed is the one who does not condemn himself in respect to what he approves of ##

AT: "Blessed are those who do not feel guilty for what they decide to do"

## He who doubts is condemned if he eats ##

This can be translated with an active verb. AT: "God will say that the person does wrong if he is not sure if it is right to eat a certain food, but he eats it anyway" (see UDB) or "The person who is not sure if it is right to eat a certain food, but then eats it anyway will have a troubled conscience" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## because it is not from faith ##

This can be translated as a new sentence. AT: "God will say that he is wrong because he is eating something he believes God does not want him to eat"

## and whatever is not from faith is sin ##

AT: "You are sinning if you do something that you do not believe God wants you to do"
