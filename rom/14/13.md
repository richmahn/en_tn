# but instead decide this, that no one will place a stumbling block or a snare for his brother

Here "stumbling block" and "snare" mean basically the same thing. AT: "but instead make it your goal not to do or say anything that might cause a fellow believer to sin" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# brother

Here this means a fellow Christian, male or female.
