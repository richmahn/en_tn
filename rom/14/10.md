(See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]]) Alternate translations: "it is wrong for you to judge...it is wrong for you to despise" (see UDB) or "stop judging...stop despising." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **For we will all stand before the judgment seat of God** - The "judgment seat" refers to God's authority to judge. Alternate translation: "For God will judge us all." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
* **As I live** - This phrase is used to start an oath or solemn promise. Alternate translation: "You can be certain that this is true."
* **to me every knee will bend, and every tongue will give praise to God** - Paul uses the words "knee" and "tongue" to refer to the whole person.
