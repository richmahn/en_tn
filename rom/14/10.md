Paul continues instructing the believers on right living.

## But you, why do you judge...? And you, why do you despise...? ##

Paul is demonstrating how he might have to scold individuals among his readers. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]]) Alternate translations: "it is wrong for you to judge...it is wrong for you to despise" (see UDB) or "stop judging...stop despising." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## For we will all stand before the judgment seat of God ##

The "judgment seat" refers to God's authority to judge. Alternate translation: "For God will judge us all." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## As I live ##

This phrase is used to start an oath or solemn promise. Alternate translation: "You can be certain that this is true."

## to me every knee will bend, and every tongue will give praise to God ##

Paul uses the words "knee" and "tongue" to refer to the whole person. Also, the Lord uses the word "God" to refer to himself. Alternate translation: "Every person will bow and give praise to me." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
