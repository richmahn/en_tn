# let us pursue the things of peace and the things that build up one another

Here "build up one another" refers to helping each other grow in faith. Alternate translation: "let us seek to live peacefully together and help one another grow stronger in faith" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
