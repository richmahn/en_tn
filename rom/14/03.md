Paul continues instructing the believers on right living.

## Who are you, you who judge a servant belonging to another? ##

Paul is using a question to scold those who are judging others. AT: "You are not God, and you are not allowed to judge one of his servants"  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## you, you ##

singular (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

## Before his own master he stands or falls ##

AT: "Only the master can decide if he will accept the servant or not"

## But he will be made to stand; for the Lord is able to make him stand ##

This can be translated with an active verb. AT: "But the Lord will accept him because he is able to make the servant acceptable" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
