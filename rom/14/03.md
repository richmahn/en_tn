# Who are you, you who judge a servant belonging to someone else?

Paul is using a question to scold those who are judging others. You can translate this as a statement. AT: "You are not God, and you are not allowed to judge one of his servants!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# you, you

The form of "you" here is singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# It is before his own master that he stands or falls

Paul speaks of God as if he were a master who owned servants. AT: "Only the master can decide if he will accept the servant or not" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# But he will be made to stand, for the Lord is able to make him stand

Paul speaks of the servant who is acceptable to God as if he were being "made to stand" instead of falling. You can translate this in an active form. AT: "But the Lord will accept him because he is able to make the servant acceptable" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
