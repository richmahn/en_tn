# I know and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus

Here the words "know" and "am persuaded" mean basically the same thing; Paul uses them to emphasize his certainty. AT: "I am certain because of my relationship with the Lord Jesus" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# nothing is unclean by itself

You can translate this in a positive form. AT: "everything by itself is clean" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])

# by itself

"by its nature" or "because of what it is"

# Only for him who considers anything to be unclean, for him it is unclean

Paul implies here that a person should stay away from anything that he thinks is unclean. You can make this explicit in your translation. AT: "But if a person thinks something is unclean, then for that person it is unclean and he should stay away from it" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# If because of food your brother is hurt

"If you hurt your fellow believer's faith over the matter of food." Here the word "your" refers to those who are strong in faith and "brother" refers to those who are weak in faith.

# brother

Here this means a fellow Christian, male or female.

# you are no longer walking in love

Paul speaks of the behavior of believers as if it were a walk. AT: "then you are no longer showing love" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
