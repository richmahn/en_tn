## translationNotes

* <b>On the one hand, one person values one day above another, but on the other hand, another values every day
* The phrases “on the one hand” and “on the other hand” introduce two different ways of thinking about something. Alternate translation: "One person thinks one day is more important than all the others, but another person thinks that all days are the same." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
* **Let each person be convinced in his own mind** - The full meaning can be made explicit: "Let each person be sure what they are doing is to honor the Lord." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
* **He who observes the day, observes it for the Lord** - "The person who worships on a certain day does it to honor the Lord"
* **and he who eats, eats for the Lord** - "The person who eats every kind of food does it to honor the Lord"
* **He who does not eat, refrains from eating for the Lord** - "The person who does not eat certain kinds of food does it to honor the Lord"
