# Romans 14 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with verse 11 of this chapter, which Paul quotes from the Old Testament.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Weak in faith #####

Paul teaches that Christians can have real faith and at the same time be "weak in faith" in a given situation. This describes Christians whose faith is immature, not strong, or misunderstood. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]])

##### Dietary restrictions #####

Many religions in the ancient Near East restricted what was eaten. Christians have freedom to eat what they want. But they need to use this freedom wisely, in a way that honors the Lord and does not cause others to sin. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]]) 

##### The judgment seat of God #####

The judgment seat of God or Christ represents a time when all people, including Christians, will be held accountable for the way they lived their lives.
