# Romans 14 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations indent each line of poetry to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetry in 14:11, which is quoted from the OT.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Weak in faith #####

Faith is used in Scripture to as something one can definitively possess and at the same time be "weak in" or "lack" in a given situation. In this passage, being weak in faith references Christians who were immature, lacking strength or understanding in their faith. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]])

##### Dietary restrictions #####

Dietary restrictions were important in many religions in the ancient Near East. Christians had freedom to eat what they wanted to, but they had to exercise this freedom wisely, and in a way that brought honor to the Lord and did not cause others to sin. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]]) 

##### The Judgment Seat of God #####

The Judgment Seat of God or Christ (also known as the "Bema Seat") represents a time when Christians will be held accountable for the way they lived their lives as Christians.
