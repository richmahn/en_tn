## will give an account of himself to God ##

AT: "will have to explain our actions to God"

## but instead decide this, that no one will place a stumbling block or a snare for his brother ##

Here "stumbling block" and "snare" mean basically the same thing. AT: "but instead make it your goal not to do or say anything that might cause a fellow believer to sin" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

## brother ##

Here this means fellow Christians, including both men and women.
