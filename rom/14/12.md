## will give an account of himself to God ##

"will have to explain our actions to God"

## but instead decide this, that no one will place a stumbling block or a snare ##

Here "stumbling block" and "snare" mean basically the same thing. Alternate translation: "but instead make it your goal to not do or say anything that may result in a fellow believer starting to sin." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
