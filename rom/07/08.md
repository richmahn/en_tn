# But sin took the opportunity ... brought about every lust

Paul continues comparing sin to a person who can act. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# lust

This word includes both the desire to have what belongs to other people and wrong sexual desire.

# without the law, sin is dead

"if there were no law, there would be no breaking of the law, so there would be no sin"
