# But thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord

This is the answer to the question in 7:24.

# So then, I myself serve the law of God with my mind. However, with the flesh I serve the principle of sin

The mind and flesh are used here to show how they compare to serve either God's law or the principle of sin. With the mind or intellect one can choose to please and obey God and with the flesh or physical nature to serve sin. Alternate translation: "My mind chooses to please God, but my flesh chooses to obey sin" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
