# But I see a different principle in my body parts. It fights against that new principle in my mind. It takes me captive

"I am able only to do what my old nature tells me to do, not to live the new way the Spirit shows me"

# new principle

This is the new spiritually alive nature.

# a different principle in my body parts

This is the old nature, the way people are when they are born.

# the principle of sin that is in my body parts

"my sinful nature"
