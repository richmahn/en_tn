Paul gives an example of the principle he stated in [Romans 7:1](./01.md).

## she will be called an adulteress ##

The one who "called" is not clear, so be as general as possible. AT: "people will call her an adulteress" or "God will consider her an adulteress" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
