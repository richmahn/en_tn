## translationNotes

* Paul gives an example of the principle he stated in [[:en:bible:notes:rom:07:01]].
* **she will be called an adulteress** - The one who does the calling is not clear, so be as general as possible: "they will call her an adulteress." Alternate translations: "people will call her an adulteress" or "God will consider her an adulteress." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
