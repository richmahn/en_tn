Paul gives an example of the principle he stated in [Romans 7:1](./01.md).

## she will be called an adulteress ##

The one who does the calling is not clear, so be as general as possible: "they will call her an adulteress." Alternate translations: "people will call her an adulteress" or "God will consider her an adulteress." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
