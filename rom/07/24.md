##  Who will deliver me from this body of death? ##

"I want someone to set me free from the control of what my body desires" (UDB). If your language has a way to show that both the exclamation and the question are highly emotional, use it here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## thanks to God through Jesus Christ our Lord ##

This is the answer to the question in 7:24. (see UDB)

## So then I myself on the one hand with the mind serve the Law of God, but on the other hand serve the principle of sin with the flesh ##

The mind and flesh are used here to show how they compare to serve either God's Laws or the principle of sin. With the mind or intellect one can choose to please and obey God and with the flesh or physical nature to serve sin. AT: "My mind chooses to please God, but my flesh chooses to obey sin" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
