## translationNotes

* **sin, taking the opportunity through the commandment, deceived me, and through the commandment it killed me.** - As in [[:en:bible:notes:rom:07:07]], Paul is describing sin as a person who can do 3 things: take the opportunity, deceive, and kill. "because I wanted to sin, I deceived myself into thinking that I could sin and obey the commandment at the same time, but God punished me for disobeying the commandment by separating me from him." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
* **sin** - "my desire to sin" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
* **taking the opportunity through the commandment** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:rom:07:07]].
* **it killed me** - "it separated me from God" (See UDB, [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]))
* **Therefore** - Because the law allows sin to be recognized as a deceiver and killer
