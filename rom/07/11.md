# For sin took the opportunity through the commandment and deceived me. Through the commandment it killed me

As in [Romans 7:7-8](./07.md), Paul is describing sin as a person who can do 3 things: take the opportunity, deceive, and kill. AT: "Because I wanted to sin, I deceived myself into thinking that I could sin and obey the commandment at the same time, but God punished me for disobeying the commandment by separating me from him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# sin

"my desire to sin"

# took the opportunity through the commandment

Paul is comparing sin to a person who can act. See how you translated this in [Romans 7:8](./07.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# it killed me

Paul speaks of God's condemnation on sinners as if it resulted primarily in physical death. AT: "it separated me from God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
