## sin, taking the opportunity through the commandment, deceived me, and through the commandment it killed me. ##

As in [Romans 7:7](./07.md), Paul is describing sin as a person who can do 3 things: take the opportunity, deceive, and kill. "because I wanted to sin, I deceived myself into thinking that I could sin and obey the commandment at the same time, but God punished me for disobeying the commandment by separating me from him." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

## sin ##

"my desire to sin" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## taking the opportunity through the commandment ##

See how you translated this in [Romans 7:7](./07.md).

## it killed me ##

"it separated me from God" (See UDB, [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]]))

## Therefore ##

Because the law allows sin to be recognized as a deceiver and killer
