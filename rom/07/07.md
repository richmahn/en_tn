"Of course that is not true!" This expression gives the strongest possible negative answer to the preceding rhetorical question. You may have a similar expression in your language that you could use here. See how you translated this in [Romans 9:14](../09/14.md).

# I would never have known sin, if it were not through the law ... But sin took the opportunity ... brought about every lust

Paul is comparing sin to a person who can act. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# sin

"my desire to sin"

# lust

This word includes both the desire to have what belongs to other people and wrong sexual desire.

# without the law, sin is dead

"if there were no law, there would be no breaking of the law, so there would be no sin"
