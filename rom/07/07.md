## translationNotes

* **What will we say then?** - Paul is introducing a new topic. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **May it never be** - "Of course that is not true!" This expression give the strongest possible negative answer to the preceding rhetorical question. You may want have a similar expression in your language that you could use here. See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:rom:09:14]].
* **I would not have known sin…. …sin, taking the opportunity…brought about every lust** - Paul is comparing sin to a person who can act. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
* **sin, taking the opportunity through the commandment, brought about every lust in me** - When God's law tell us not to do something, it is because we have been told not to do it that we want to do it more. "sin reminded me of the commandment not to desire wrong things, and so I desired those wrong things even more than before" or "because I wanted to sin, when I heard the commandment not to desire wrong things, I desired...."
* **sin** - "my desire to sin"
* **lust** - This word includes both the desire to have what belongs to other people (see UDB) and wrong sexual desire.
* **without the Law, sin is dead** - "if there were no Law, there would be no breaking of the Law, so there would be no sin"
