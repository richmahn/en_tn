## What will we say then? ##

Paul is introducing a new topic. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## May it never be ##

"Of course that is not true!" This expression give the strongest possible negative answer to the preceding rhetorical question. You may want have a similar expression in your language that you could use here. See how you translated this in [Romans 9:14](../09/14.md).

## I would not have known sin…. …sin, taking the opportunity…brought about every lust ##

Paul is comparing sin to a person who can act. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

## sin, taking the opportunity through the commandment, brought about every lust in me ##

When God's law tells us not to do something, it is because we have been told not to do it that we want to do it more. AT: "sin reminded me of the commandment not to desire wrong things, and so I desired those wrong things even more than before" or "because I wanted to sin, when I heard the commandment not to desire wrong things, I desired...."

## sin ##

AT: "my desire to sin"

## lust ##

This word includes both the desire to have what belongs to other people (see UDB) and wrong sexual desire.

## without the Law, sin is dead ##

AT: "if there were no Law, there would be no breaking of the Law, so there would be no sin"
