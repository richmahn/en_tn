# Connecting Statement:

Paul talks about the struggle inside his inner man between his flesh and the law of Godâ€”between sin and good.

# For what I do, I do not really understand

"I am not sure why I do some of the things that I do"

# For

"because"

# what I want to do, I do not do

The words "I do not do" are an exaggeration to emphasize that Paul does not do what he wants to do as often as he would like or that he does what he does not want to do too often. AT: "I do not always do what I want to do" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# what I hate, I do

The words "I do," which implies that he always does what he hates to do, are an exaggeration to emphasize that Paul does what he does not want to do too often. AT: "the things that I know are not good are the things that I sometimes do" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# But

"However"

# I agree with the law

"I know God's law is good"
