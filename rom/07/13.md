# Connecting Statement:

Paul talks about the struggle inside his inner man between sin in his inner man and his mind with the law of Godâ€”between sin and good.

# So

Paul is introducing a new topic.

# did what is good become death to me?

Paul uses this question to add emphasis. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# what is good

This refers to God's law.

# become death to me

"cause me to die"

# May it never be

This expression gives the strongest possible negative answer to the preceding rhetorical question. You may have a similar expression in your language that you could use here. AT: "Of course that is not true!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# sin ... brought about death in me

Paul is viewing sin as though it were a person who could act. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# brought about death in me

"separated me from God"

# through the commandment

"because I disobeyed the commandment"
