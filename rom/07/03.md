# Connecting Statement:

This verse ends a description of what Paul means by "the law controls a person for as long as he lives" ([Romans 7:1](./01.md)).

# she will be called an adulteress

You can translate this in an active form. Alternate translation: "God will consider her an adulteress" or "people will call her an adulteress" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# she is free from the law

Here being free from the law means not having to obey the law. In this case, the woman does not have to obey the law that says that a married woman cannot marry another man. Alternate translation: "she does not have to obey that law"
