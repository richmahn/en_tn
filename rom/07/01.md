# Connecting Statement:

Paul explains how the law controls those who want to live under the law.

# do you not know, brothers ... that the law controls a person for as long as he lives?

Paul asks this question to add emphasis. AT: "So you certainly know that people have to obey laws only while they are alive" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# brothers

Here this means fellow Christians, including both men and women.

# the law controls a person for as long as he lives

Paul gives an example of this in [Romans 7:2-3](./02.md).
