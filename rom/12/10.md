# Concerning love of the brothers, be affectionate

Here Paul begins a list of nine items, each of the form "Concerning ... be" to tell the believers what kind of people they should be. You may need to translate some of the items as "Concerning ... do." The list continues to [Romans 12:13](../12/13.md).

# Concerning love of the brothers

"As for how you love your fellow believers"

# be affectionate

You can translate this in an active form. Alternate translation: "show affection" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# Concerning honor, respect one another

"Honor and respect one another" or "Honor your fellow believers by respecting them"
