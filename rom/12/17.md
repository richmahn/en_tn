Paul tells the believers how to deal with those who do evil to them in 12:17-[Romans 12:19](./19.md).

## Repay no one evil for evil ##

"Do not do evil things to someone who has done evil things to you."

## Do good things in the sight of all people ##

"Do things that everyone considers to be good."

## as much as it lies with you, be at peace with all people ##

"do whatever you can to live in peace with everyone."

## as much as it lies with you ##

"as for what you can control and are responsible for"
