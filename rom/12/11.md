Paul continues to tell the believers what kind of people they should be. This list began in [Romans 12:9](./09.md).

## Concerning diligence, do not be hesitant; concerning the spirit, be eager; concerning the Lord, serve him. ##

"Do not be lazy in your duty, but be eager to follow the Spirit and to serve the Lord"

## Concerning confidence, rejoice ##

"Be happy because our confidence is in God."

## concerning troubles, be patient ##

This can be translated as a new sentence: "Be patient when difficult times come."

## concerning prayer, be constant ##

This can be translated as a new sentence: "And remember to constantly pray."

## Share in the needs of the saints ##

This is the last item in the list that began in [Romans 12:9](./09.md). "Concerning the needs of the saints, share with them" or "As forâ€¦" or "When fellow Christians are in trouble, help them with what they need."

## give yourselves to hospitality ##

"always welcome them into your home when they need somewhere to stay"
