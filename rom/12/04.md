# For

Paul uses this word to show that he will now explain why some Christians should not think they are better than others.

# we have many members in one body

Paul refers to all the believers in Christ as if they were different parts of the human body. He does this to illustrate that although believers may serve Christ in different ways, each person belongs to Christ and serves in an important way. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# members

These are such things as eyes, stomachs, and hands.

# are individually members of each other

Paul speaks of the believers as if God had physically joined them together like the parts of the human body. You can translate this in an active form. AT: "God has joined each believer together with all other believers" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
