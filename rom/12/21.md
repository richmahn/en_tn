All forms of "you" and "your" are addressed as to one person. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good

Paul describes "evil" as though it were a person. You can translate this in an active form. AT: "Do not let those who are evil defeat you, but defeat those who are evil by doing what is good" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
