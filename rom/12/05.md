Paul speaks of the believers as if God had physically joined them together like the parts of the human body. You can translate this in an active form. AT: "God has joined each believer together with all other believers" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
