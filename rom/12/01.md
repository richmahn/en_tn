# Connecting Statement:

Paul tells what the life of a believer should be and how believers should serve.

# I urge you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God

Here "brothers" refers to fellow believers, both male and female. AT: "Fellow believers, because of the great mercy that God has given you I very much want you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# to present your bodies a living sacrifice

Here Paul uses the word "bodies" to refer to the whole person. Paul is comparing a believer in Christ who completely obeys God to the animals that the Jews killed and then offered to God. AT: "to offer yourselves completely to God while you are alive as if you were a dead sacrifice on a temple altar" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# holy, acceptable to God

Possible meanings are 1) "a sacrifice that you give to God alone and that pleases him" or 2) "acceptable to God because it is morally pure" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# This is your reasonable service

"This is the right way to worship God"

# Do not be conformed to this world

Possible meanings are 1) "Do not behave as the world behaves" or 2) "Do not think the way the world does." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Do not be conformed

Possible meanings are 1) "Do not let the world tell you what to do and think" or 2) "Do not allow yourself to act and do what the world does." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# this world

This refers to unbelievers who live in the world. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# but be transformed by the renewal of your mind

You can translate this in an active form. AT: "but let God change the way you think and behave" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
