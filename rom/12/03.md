## because of the grace that was given to me ##

Here "grace" refers to God choosing Paul to be an apostle and leader of the church. AT: "because God freely chose me to be an apostle"

## that everyone who is among you should not think more highly of oneself than he ought to think ##

AT: "that no one should think they are better than other people"

## but to think so as to think wisely ##

This could be translated as a new sentence: "But you should be wise in how you think about yourselves"

## just as God has given out to each one a measure of faith ##

AT: "since God has given you the amount of faith you need to think correctly"
