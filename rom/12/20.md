# your enemy ... feed him ... give him a drink ... if you do this, you will heap ... Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil

All forms of "you" and "your" are addressed as to one person. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# But if your enemy is hungry ... his head

In 12:20 Paul quotes another part of Scripture. AT: "But the Scripture also says, 'If your enemy is hungry ... his head'"

# feed him

"give him some food"

# heap coals of fire on his head

Paul speaks of the blessings that the enemies will receive as if someone were pouring hot coals on their heads. Possible meanings are 1) "make the person who harmed you feel badly about how he has mistreated you" or 2) "give God a reason to judge your enemy more harshly."
