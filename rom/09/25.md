## As he says also in Hosea: ##

"As God says also in the book Hosea wrote"

## Hosea ##

Hosea was a prophet. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

## "I will call my people who were not my people ##

"I will choose people who were not my people to be my people"

## and her beloved who was not beloved. ##

"and I will choose her whom I did not love to be one whom I love"

## sons of the living God ##

The word "living" may refer to the fact that God is the only "true" God, and not like the false idols. It could be translated as "children of the true God" (UDB).
