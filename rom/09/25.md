# Connecting Statement:

In this section Paul explains how Israel's unbelief as a nation was told ahead of time by the prophet Hosea.

# As he says also in Hosea

Here "he" refers to God. AT: "As God says also in the book that Hosea wrote" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# Hosea

Hosea was a prophet. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# I will call my people who were not my people

"I will choose for my people those who were not my people"

# her beloved who was not beloved

Here "her" refers to Hosea's wife, Gomer, who represents the nation of Israel. You can translate this in an active form. AT: "I will choose her whom I did not love to be one whom I love" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
