# our father Isaac ... It is just

In your culture you may need to place 9:11 after 9:12 to make them easier to understand. Alternate translation: "our father Isaac, it was said to her, 'The older will serve the younger.' Now the children were not yet born ... because of him who calls. It is just"

# Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated

The word "hated" is an exaggeration. God loved Jacob much more than he loved Esau. He did not literally hate Esau. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
