# it is not because of him who wills, nor because of him who runs

"it is not because of what people want or because they try hard"

# nor because of him who runs

Paul speaks of a person who does good things in order to gain God's favor as if that person were running a race. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
