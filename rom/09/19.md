* **You** - Paul is talking to the critics of his teaching as though his is talking to one person. You may need to use the plural here. (See: [[en:ta:translate:formsofyou]])
* **he...his** - These refer to God.
* **Will what has been molded say...daily use?** - Paul uses the potter's right to make any kind of container he wants from the clay as a metaphor for the creator's right to do whatever he wants with his creation. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
