# You will say then to me

Paul is talking to the critics of his teaching as though he were only talking to one person. You may need to use the plural here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# Why does he still find fault? For who has ever withstood his will?

These rhetorical questions are complaints against God. You can translate them as strong statements. Alternate translation: "He should not find fault with us. No one has ever been able to withstand his will." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# he ... his

The words "he" and "his" here refer to God.

# has ... withstood his will

"has ... stopped him from doing what he wanted to do"
