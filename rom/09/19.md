# You will say then to me

Paul is talking to the critics of his teaching as though he were only talking to one person. You may need to use the plural here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# Why does he still find fault? For who has ever withstood his will?

These are rhetorical questions that Paul uses to add emphasis. You can translate all of these questions as strong statements. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# he ... his

The words "he" and "his" here refer to God.
