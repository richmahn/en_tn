# For I could wish that I myself would be cursed and set apart from Christ for the sake of my brothers, those of my own race according to the flesh

You can translate this in an active form. Alternate translation: "I personally would be willing to let God curse me and, keep me apart from Christ forever if that would help my fellow Israelites, my own people group, to believe in Christ" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# brothers

Here this means fellow Christians, including both men and women.
