## For I could wish that I myself be cursed and apart from Christ for the sake of my brothers, those of my own race according to the flesh. ##

Alternate translation: "I personally would be willing to let God curse me and, keep me apart from Christ forever if that would help my fellow Israelites, my own people group, to believe in Christ."

## They are Israelites ##

"They, like me, are Israelites. God chose them to be Jacob's descendants." (UDB)

## Theirs are the ancestors from whom has come Christ with respect to the flesh ##

"Christ has come physically as a descendant from their ancestors."

## Christ, who is over all, God blessed forever ##

This can be translated as a separate sentence: "Christ is over all and God has blessed him forever."
