# They are Israelites

"They, like me, are Israelites. God chose them to be Jacob's descendants"

# They have adoption

Here Paul uses the metaphor of "adoption" to indicate that the Israelites are like God's children. Alternate translation: "They have God as their father" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
