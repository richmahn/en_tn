# Connecting Statement:

Paul tells of his personal desire that the people of the nation of Israel will be saved. Then he emphasizes the different ways in which God has prepared them to believe.

# I tell the truth in Christ. I do not lie

These two expressions mean basically the same thing. Paul uses them to emphasize that he is telling the truth. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# my conscience bears witness with me in the Holy Spirit

"the Holy Spirit controls my conscience and confirms what I say"
