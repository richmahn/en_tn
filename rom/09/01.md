## my conscience bearing witness with me in the Holy Spirit, ##

This phrase can be made into a separate sentence: "The Holy Spirit controls my conscience and confirms what I say"

## that for me there is great sorrow and unceasing pain in my heart. ##

This can be a separate sentence. AT: "I tell you that I grieve very greatly and deeply." If the person for whom Paul grieves needs to be stated, follow UDB.

## great sorrow and unceasing pain ##

These two expressions mean basically the same thing. Paul uses them together to emphasize how great his emotions are. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
