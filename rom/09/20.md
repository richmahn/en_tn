# Will what has been molded say ... daily use?

Paul uses the potter's right to make any kind of container he wants from the clay as a metaphor for the creator's right to do whatever he wants with his creation. Paul asks these questions to emphasize his point. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Why did you make me this way?

The word "you" here refers to God. Paul uses this question to add emphasis. You can translate it as a strong statement. Alternate translation: "God, you should not have made me this way!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
