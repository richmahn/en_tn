# Will what has been molded say to the one who molds it

Paul uses the potter's right to make any kind of container he wants from the clay as a metaphor for the creator's right to do whatever he wants with his creation. Paul asks this question to emphasize his point. Alternate translation: "Nothing that anyone has molded will say to the one who molds it" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# Why did you make me this way?
This rhetorical question is a rebuke. Alternative translation: "You should not have made me this way" or "It is wrong for you to have made me this way" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
