# Connecting Statement:

Paul emphasizes that those who are born in the family of Israel can really only be a true part of Israel through faith.

# But it is not as though the promises of God have failed

"But God has not failed to keep his promises" or "God has kept his promises"

# For it is not everyone in Israel who truly belongs to Israel

God did not make his promises to all the physical descendants of Israel (or Jacob), but to his spiritual descendants, that is, those who trust in Jesus.

# Neither are all Abraham's descendants truly his children

"Nor are they all children of God just because they are Abraham's descendants"
