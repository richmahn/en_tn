## But it is not as though the promises of God had failed ##

AT: "But God has not failed to keep his promises"

## For it is not everyone in Israel who truly belongs to Israel. ##

God did not make his promises to all the physical descendants of Israel (or Jacob), but to his spiritual descendants, that is, those who have faith in Jesus.

## Neither are all Abraham's descendants truly his children ##

AT: "Nor are they all children of God just because they are Abraham's descendants"
