# Connecting Statement:

Paul has affirmed all men are sinners and continues to remind them that all people are wicked.

# Therefore you are without excuse

The word "therefore" marks a new section of the letter. It also makes a concluding statement based on what Paul said in [Romans 1:1-32](../01/32.md). Alternate translation: "Since God will punish those who continually sin, he will certainly not excuse your sins" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# you are

Paul is writing here as if he were addressing a Jewish person who is arguing with him. Paul is doing this to teach his audience that God will punish everyone who continually sins, whether Jew or Gentile. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe]])

# you

Here the pronoun "you" is singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# you person, you who judge

Paul uses the word "person" here to scold anyone who might think he can act like God and judge others. Alternate translation: "You are just a human being, yet you judge others and say they deserve God's punishment" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# for what you judge in another you condemn in yourself

"But you are only judging yourself because you do the same wicked deeds as they do"
