Paul begins an argument with an imaginary Jewish person.

## Therefore you are without excuse ##

The word "therefore" marks a new section of the letter. It also makes a concluding statement based on what was said in [Romans 1:32](../01/32.md). AT: "Since God will punish those who continually sin, he will certainly not excuse your sins"

## you are ##

Paul is not talking to a real person. He is acting like a Jewish person who is arguing with him. Paul is doing this to teach his audience that God will punish everyone who continually sins, whether Jew or Gentile. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe]])

## you ##

Here the word "you" is singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])

## you person, you who judge ##

Here the word "person" is used to scold or mock someone who thinks he can act like God and judge others. This could be translated as a new sentence. AT: "You are just a human being, yet you judge others and say they deserve God's punishment"

## for what you judge in another you condemn in yourself ##

This could be translated as a new sentence. AT: "But you are only judging yourself because you do the same wicked deeds as they do"

## But we know ##

This may include Christian believers and also Jews who are not Christians. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-inclusive]])

## God's judgment is according to truth when it falls on those ##

AT: "God will judge those people truly and fairly" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

## those who practice such things ##

AT: "the people who do those wicked deeds"
