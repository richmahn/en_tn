# Connecting Statement:

Though this section is speaking to the non-religious wicked person, Paul sums it up by stating both non-Jews and Jews are wicked before God.

# self-seeking

"selfish" or "only concerned with what makes themselves happy"

# disobey the truth but obey unrighteousness

These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The second intensifies the first. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# wrath and fierce anger will come

The words "wrath" and "fierce anger" mean basically the same thing and emphasize God's anger. AT: "God will show his terrible anger" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# wrath

Here the word "wrath" is a metonym that refers to God's severe punishment of wicked people. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# tribulation and distress on

The words "tribulation" and "distress" mean basically the same thing here and emphasize how bad God's punishment will be. AT: "awful punishments will happen to" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# on every human soul

Here, Paul uses the word "soul" as a synecdoche that refers to the whole person. AT: "upon every person" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# has practiced evil

"has continually done evil things"

# to the Jew first, and also to the Greek

"God will judge the Jewish people first, and then those who are not Jewish people"

# first

Possible meanings are 1) "first in order of time" or 2) "most certainly"
