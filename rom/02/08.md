## translationNotes

* Paul continues his imaginary argument with a Jewish person.
* **self-seeking** - "selfish" or "only concerned with what makes themselves happy"
* **wrath and fierce anger will come ** - This says the same thing in two different ways to emphasize God's anger. Alternate translation "God will show his terrible anger." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
* **and tribulation and distress** - This says the same thing in two different ways to emphasize how bad God's punishment will be. This can be translated as a new sentence: "And awful punishments will fall."
* **on every human soul** - Here, Paul uses the word "soul" to refer to the whole person. Alternate translation: "upon every person." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
* **has practiced evil** - "has continually done evil things"
* **to the Jew first, and also to the Greek** - Alternate translation as a new sentence: "God will judge the Jewish people first, and then those who are not Jewish people."
* **first** - The good news was preached to Jews before the Greeks, so the primary meaning here is probably 1) first in order of time, but it could also mean 2) "most certainly" (see UDB) or "most importantly."
