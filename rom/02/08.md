# Connecting Statement:

Though this section is speaking to the non-religious wicked person, Paul sums it up by stating both non-Jews and Jews are wicked before God.

# self-seeking

"selfish" or "only concerned with what makes themselves happy"

# disobey the truth but obey unrighteousness

These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The second intensifies the first. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# wrath and fierce anger will come

The words "wrath" and "fierce anger" mean basically the same thing and emphasize God's anger. Alternate translation: "God will show his terrible anger" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# wrath

Here the word "wrath" is a metonym that refers to God's severe punishment of wicked people. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
