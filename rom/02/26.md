# the uncircumcised person

"the person who is not circumcised"

# keeps the requirements of the law

"obeys what God commands in the law"

# will not his uncircumcision be considered as circumcision? And will not the one who is naturally uncircumcised condemn you ... the law?

Paul asks two questions here to emphasize that circumcision is not what makes one right before God. You can translate these questions as statements in an active form. Alternate translation: "God will consider him as circumcised. The one who is not physically circumcised will condemn you ... the law."
