# And will not the one who is naturally uncircumcised condemn you ... the law?

This is the second of two questions that Paul asks here (the first is in Romans 2:26 (./26.md)) to emphasize that circumcision is not what makes one right before God. You can translate this questions as a statement in an active form. Alternate translation: "The one who is not physically circumcised will condemn you ... the law."
