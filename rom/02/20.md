# a corrector of the foolish

"you correct those who do wrong"

# a teacher of little children

Here Paul compares those who do not know anything about the law to very small children. AT: "and you teach those who do not know the law" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# and that you have in the law the form of knowledge and of the truth

The knowledge of the truth that is in the law comes from God. AT: "because you are sure you understand the truth that God has given in the law" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
