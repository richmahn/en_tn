# Connecting Statement:

Here begins Paul's discussion that the law the Jews possess actually condemns them because they do not obey it.

# if you call yourself a Jew

"since you call yourself a Jew"

# rest upon the law

The phrase "rest upon the law" represents believing that they can become righteous by obeying the law. AT: "rely on the law of Moses" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
