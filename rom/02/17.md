# Connecting Statement:

Here begins Paul's discussion that the law the Jews possess actually condemns them because they do not obey it.

# if you call yourself a Jew

"since you call yourself a Jew"

# rest upon the law

The phrase "rest upon the law" represents believing that they can become righteous by obeying the law. AT: "rely on the law of Moses" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# know his will

"and know God's will"

# because you have been instructed from the law

This can be stated in active form. AT: "because people have taught you what is right from the law" or "because you have learned from the law" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# that you yourself are a guide to the blind, a light to those who are in darkness

Here "the blind" and "those who walk in darkness" represent people who do not understand the law. AT: "that because you teach the law, you yourself are like a guide to blind people, and you are like a light to people who are lost in the dark" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# a corrector of the foolish

"you correct those who do wrong"

# a teacher of little children

Here Paul compares those who do not know anything about the law to very small children. AT: "and you teach those who do not know the law" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# and that you have in the law the form of knowledge and of the truth

The knowledge of the truth that is in the law comes from God. AT: "because you are sure you understand the truth that God has given in the law" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
