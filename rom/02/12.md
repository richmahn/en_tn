# For as many as have sinned

"For those who have sinned"

# without the law will also perish without the law

Paul repeats "without the law" to emphasize that it does not matter if people do not know the law of Moses. If they sin, God will judge them. Alternate translation: "without knowing the law of Moses will certainly still die spiritually" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# as many as have sinned

"all those who have sinned"

# with respect to the law will be judged by the law

God will judge sinful people according to his law. You can translate this in an active form. Alternate translation: "and who do know the law of Moses, God will judge them according to that law" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
