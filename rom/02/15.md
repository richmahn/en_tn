## translationNotes

* Paul continues his imaginary argument with a Jewish person.
* **By this they show** - "By naturally obeying the Law they show"
* **the actions required by the Law are written in their hearts** - Alternate translations: "God has written on their hearts what the Law requires them to do" or "They know exactly what the Law commands them to do." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
* **required by the Law** - This can be translated with an active verb: "the Law requires" or "that God demands through the Law."
* **bears witness with them, and their thoughts either accuse or defend themselves** - "tells them if they are disobeying or obeying God's law"
* **on the day when God will judge** - This finishes Paul's thought from [[:en:bible:notes:rom:02:13]]. This could be translated as a new sentence: "This will happen when God judges."
