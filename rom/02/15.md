Paul continues his imaginary argument with a Jewish person.

## By this they show ##

AT: "By naturally obeying the Law they show"

## the actions required by the Law are written in their hearts ##

AT: "God has written on their hearts what the Law requires them to do" or "They know exactly what the Law commands them to do" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

## required by the Law ##

This can be translated with an active verb. AT: "the Law requires" or "that God demands through the Law"

## bears witness with them, and their thoughts either accuse or defend themselves ##

AT: "tells them if they are disobeying or obeying God's law" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

## on the day when God will judge ##

This finishes Paul's thought from [Romans 2:13](./13.md). This could be translated as a new sentence. AT: "This will happen when God judges"
