## translationNotes

* Paul continues his imaginary argument with a Jewish person.
* **For** - "Because." If your language has a way to mark that verses 14 and [[:en:bible:notes:rom:02:15]] interrupt Paul's main argument to give the reader extra information, use it here. You may need to place 2:14-15 either before 2:13 or after 2:16.
* **it is not the hearers of the Law** - AT: "it is not those who only hear the Law of Moses"
* **who are righteous before God** - AT: "that are pleasing to God"
* **but it is the doers of the Law** - AT: "but it is those who obey the Law of Moses"
* **who will be justified** - This can be translated with an active verb. AT: "that God will accept" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
* **are a law to themselves** - AT: "have God's laws already inside them"
