Paul continues his imaginary argument with a Jewish person.

## But praise, honor, and peace will come ##

"But God will give praise, honor, and peace"

## practices good ##

"continually does what is good"

## to the Jew first, and also to the Greek ##

This could be a new sentence: "God will reward the Jewish people first, and then those who are not Jewish people."

## first ##

You should translate this the same way you did in [Romans 2:8](./08.md).

## For there is no partiality with God ##

"For God does not favor one group of people over another." Alternate translation: "For God treats all people the same." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])

## for as many as have sinned ##

This could be translated as a new sentence: "For those who have sinned"

## without the Law will also perish without the Law ##

Paul repeats "without the Law" to emphasize it does not matter if they do not know the Law of Moses. If they sin, God will judge them. Alternate translation: "without knowing the Law of Moses will certainly still die spiritually."

## and as many as have sinned ##

This could be translated as a new sentence: "And all those who have sinned"

## in respect to the Law will be judged by the Law ##

"and know the Law of Moses, God will judge them according to the Law of Moses."
