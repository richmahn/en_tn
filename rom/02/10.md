## translationNotes

* Paul continues his imaginary argument with a Jewish person.
* **But praise, honor, and peace will come** - AT: "But God will give praise, honor, and peace"
* **practices good** - AT: "continually does what is good"
* **to the Jew first, and also to the Greek** - This could be a new sentence. AT: "God will reward the Jewish people first, and then those who are not Jewish people"
* **first** - You should translate this the same way you did in [[en:bible:notes:rom:02:08]].
* **For there is no partiality with God** - AT: "For God does not favor one group of people over another" or "For God treats all people the same" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
* **for as many as have sinned** - This could be translated as a new sentence. AT: "For those who have sinned"
* **without the Law will also perish without the Law** - Paul repeats "without the Law" to emphasize it does not matter if they do not know the Law of Moses. If they sin, God will judge them. AT: "without knowing the Law of Moses will certainly still die spiritually"
* **and as many as have sinned** - This could be translated as a new sentence. AT: "And all those who have sinned"
* **in respect to the Law will be judged by the Law** - AT: "and know the Law of Moses, God will judge them according to the Law of Moses"
