Paul continues his imaginary argument with a Jewish person, whom he scolds with rhetorical questions.

## But ##

"So" (UDB)

## consider this ##

"think about what I am going to tell you"

## person ##

Use the general word for a human being. Alternate translation: "whoever you are."

## you who judge those who practice such things although you do the same things ##

"who say someone deserves God's punishment while you do the same wicked deeds"

## Will you escape from the judgment of God? ##

Alternate translation: "You will certainly not escape God's judgment!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## Or do you think so little of the riches of his goodness, his delayed punishment, and his patience ##

Alternate translation: "You act like it does not matter that God is good and he patiently waits a long time before he punishes people."

## think so little of the riches...patience ##

"consider the riches...patience unimportant" or "consider...not good"

## not knowing that his goodness is meant to lead you to repentance ##

This can be translated as a new sentence: "You must know that God shows you he is good so that you might repent."
