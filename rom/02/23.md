# You who boast in the law, do you dishonor God by breaking the law?

Paul uses a question to scold his listener. You can translate this as a strong statement. Alternate translation: "It is wicked that you claim to be proud of the law, while at the same time you disobey it and bring shame to God!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
