Paul continues his imaginary argument with a Jewish person, whom he scolds with rhetorical questions.

## You who rejoice proudly in the Law, do you through your transgression of the Law dishonor God? ##

Paul uses a question to scold his listener. AT: "It is wicked that you claim to be proud of the Law, while at the same time you disobey it and bring shame to God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## the name of God is dishonored among the Gentiles ##

This can be translated with an active verb. AT: "Your wicked actions bring shame to God in the minds of the Gentiles" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## name of God ##

The word "name" refers to the entirety of God, not just his name. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
