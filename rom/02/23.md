# You who boast in the law, do you dishonor God by breaking the law?

Paul uses a question to scold his listener. You can translate this as a strong statement. AT: "It is wicked that you claim to be proud of the law, while at the same time you disobey it and bring shame to God!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# the name of God is dishonored among the Gentiles

You can translate this in an active form. AT: "Your wicked actions bring shame to God in the minds of the Gentiles" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# name of God

The word "name" is a metonym that refers to the entirety of God, not just his name. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
