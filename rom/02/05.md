Paul continues his imaginary argument with a Jewish person.

## But it is to the extent of your hardness and unrepentant heart ##

Paul compares a person who refuses to listen and obey God to something hard, like a stone. The heart represents the whole person. AT: "It is because you refuse to listen and repent" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## hardness and unrepentant heart ##

The phrase "unrepentant heart" explains the word "hardness" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

## you are storing up for yourself wrath ##

The phrase "storing up" usually refers to a person gathering his treasures and putting it in a safe place. Paul says instead of treasures the person is gathering God's punishment. The longer they go without repenting, the more severe the punishment. AT: "you are making your punishment worse" (See:[[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## in the day of wrath, the day of the revelation of God's righteous judgment ##

These refer to the same day. AT: "when God shows everyone that he is angry and that he judges all people fairly" (see UDB).

## pay back ##

AT: "give a fair reward or punishment"

## to every person the same measure of his actions ##

AT: "according to what each person has done"

## to those who according to consistent, good actions have sought praise, honor, and incorruptibilityâ€”eternal life ##

AT: "He will give eternal life to those who have shown by consistently doing good things that they were seeking praise, honor, and incorruptibility"

## have sought ##

This means that they act in a way that will lead to a positive decision from God on judgment day.

## praise, honor, and incorruptibility ##

They want God to praise and honor them, and they want to never die.

## incorruptibility ##

This refers to physical, not moral, decay.
