# Connecting Statement:

Paul continues to show that God, by his law, condemns even the Jews who have God's law.

# For circumcision indeed benefits you

"I say all of this because being circumcised does benefit you"

# if you break the law

"if you do not obey the commandments found in the law"

# your circumcision becomes uncircumcision

"it is as though you were no longer circumcised"

# the uncircumcised person

"the person who is not circumcised"

# keeps the requirements of the law

"obeys what God commands in the law"

# will not his uncircumcision be considered as circumcision? And will not the one who is naturally uncircumcised condemn you ... the law?

Paul asks two questions here to emphasize that circumcision is not what makes one right before God. You can translate these questions as statements in an active form. AT: "God will consider him as circumcised. The one who is not physically circumcised will condemn you ... the law."
