## translationNotes

* Paul continues his imaginary argument with a Jewish person, whom he scolds with rhetorical questions.
* **For circumcision indeed benefits you** - AT: “I say all of this because being circumcised does benefit you”
* **if you are a violator of the Law ** - AT: "if you do not obey the commandments found in the Law"
* **your circumcision becomes uncircumcision** - This compares a Jewish person who does not obey the Law to a man who was physically circumcised but reverses the operation: he may be Jewish, but he looks like a Gentile. AT: "it is like you are no longer circumcised" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **the uncircumcised person** - AT: "the person who is not circumcised"
* **keeps the requirements of the Law** - AT: "obeys what is commanded in the Law"
* **will not his uncircumcision be considered as circumcision? Will not the one who is by nature uncircumcised...judge you** - Paul is asking a question to emphasize that circumcision is not what makes one right before God. This can be translated with an active verb: "God will consider him as circumcised. The one who is not physically circumcised...will judge you" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]], [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
* **who by the written scriptures and circumcision are a violator of the Law** - AT: "who have the written scriptures and are circumcised but do not obey the Law"
