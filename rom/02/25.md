Paul continues his imaginary argument with a Jewish person, whom he scolds with rhetorical questions.

## For circumcision indeed benefits you ##

“I say all of this because being circumcised does benefit you”

## if you are a violator of the Law  ##

<b>if you are a violator of the Law <b>- "if you do not obey the commandments found in the Law"

## your circumcision becomes uncircumcision ##

This compares a Jewish person who does not obey the Law to a man who was physically circumcised but reverses the operation: he may be Jewish, but he looks like a Gentile. Alternate translation: "it is like you are no longer circumcised." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## the uncircumcised person ##

"the person who is not circumcised"

## keeps the requirements of the Law ##

"obeys what is commanded in the Law"

## will not his uncircumcision be considered as circumcision? Will not the one who is by nature uncircumcised...judge you ##

Paul is asking a question to emphasize that circumcision is not what makes one right before God. This can be translated with an active verb: "God will consider him as circumcised. The one who is not physically circumcised...will judge you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]], [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## who by the written scriptures and circumcision are a violator of the Law ##

"who have the written scriptures and are circumcised but do not obey the Law"
