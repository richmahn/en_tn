# Connecting Statement:

Paul continues to show that God, by his law, condemns even the Jews who have God's law.

# For circumcision indeed benefits you

"I say all of this because being circumcised does benefit you"

# if you break the law

"if you do not obey the commandments found in the law"

# your circumcision becomes uncircumcision

"it is as though you were no longer circumcised"
