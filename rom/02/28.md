## translationNotes

* **outwardly** - This refers to Jewish rituals which people can see.
* **outward** - This is the physical evidence on his genitals that a man has received circumcision.
* **he is a Jew who is one inwardly, and circumcision is that of the heart** - This is a doublet in which "he is a Jew who is one inwardly" explains the metaphor "circumcision is that of the heart."
* **inwardly** - This refers to the values and motivations of the person whom God has transformed.
* **in the spirit** - This probably refers to the internal, spiritual part of a person, in contrast to the outward "letter" of the Law. However, it is also possible that it refers to the Holy Spirit (see UDB).
* **not in the letter** - A “letter” is the smallest part of written language. Here it refers to written Scripture. Alternative translation: “through the work of the Holy Spirit, not because you know the scriptures.” (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
