## translationNotes

* **outwardly** - This refers to Jewish rituals which people can see.
* **merely outward in the flesh** - This refers to the physical change to a man's body.
* **he is a Jew who is one inwardly, and circumcision is that of the heart** - These two phrases share similar meanings. The phrase, "he is a Jew who is one inwardly" explains the metaphor "circumcision is that of the heart." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
* **inwardly** - This refers to the values and motivations of the person whom God has transformed.
* **in the spirit** - This probably refers to the internal, spiritual part of a person, in contrast to the outward "letter" of the Law. However, it is also possible that it refers to the Holy Spirit (see UDB).
* **not in the letter** - A “letter” is the smallest part of written language. Here it refers to written Scripture. AT: “through the work of the Holy Spirit, not because you know the scriptures” (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
