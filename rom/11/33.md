# Oh, the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God!

Here "wisdom" and "knowledge" mean basically the same thing. AT: "How amazing are the many benefits of both God's wisdom and knowledge!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# How unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways beyond discovering

"We are completely unable to understand the things that he has decided and find out the ways in which he acts toward us"
