# Oh, the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God!

Here "wisdom" and "knowledge" mean basically the same thing. AT: "How amazing are the many benefits of both God's wisdom and knowledge!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# How unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways beyond discovering

"We are completely unable to understand the things that he has decided and find out the ways in which he acts toward us"

# For who has known the mind of the Lord or who has become his advisor?

Paul uses this question to emphasize that no one is as wise as the Lord. You can translate this as a statement. AT: "No one has ever known the mind of the Lord, and no one has become his advisor." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# the mind of the Lord

Here "mind" is a metonym for knowing things or thinking about things. AT: "all that the Lord knows" or "what the Lord thinks about" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
