## Oh, the depth of the riches  both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God ##

"How amazing are the many benefits of both God's wisdom and knowledge"

## How unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways beyond discovering ##

"We are completely unable to understand the things that he has decided and find out the ways in which he acts toward us"
