Paul is speaking to the Gentile believers as though they are one person.

## the kind actions and the severity of God ##

Paul is reminding the Gentile believers that although God may act very kindly toward them, he will not hesitate to judge and punish them.

## Otherwise you also will be cut off ##

"Otherwise God will cut you off" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
