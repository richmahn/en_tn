# the kind actions and the severity of God

Paul is reminding the Gentile believers that although God may act very kindly toward them, he will not hesitate to judge and punish them.

# severity came on the Jews who fell ... God's kindness comes on you

This can be restated to remove the abstract nouns "severity" and "kindness." AT: "God dealt harshly with the Jews who fell ... but God acts kindly toward you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# the Jews who fell

Doing what is wrong is spoken of as if it is falling down. AT: "the Jews who have done wrong" or "the Jews who have refused to trust in Christ" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# if you continue in his kindness

This can be restated to remove the abstract noun "kindness." AT: "if you continue doing what is right so that he continues being kind to you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# Otherwise you also will be cut off

Paul again uses the metaphor of a branch, which God can "cut off" if he needs to. You can translate this in an active form. AT: "Otherwise God will cut you off" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
