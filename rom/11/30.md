# you were formerly disobedient

"you did not obey in the past"

# you have received mercy because of their disobedience

Here mercy means God's undeserved blessings. Alternate translation: "because the Jews have rejected Jesus, you have received blessings that you did not deserve" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# you

This refers to Gentile believers, and is plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
