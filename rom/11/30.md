## you were formerly disobedient ##

AT: "you did not obey in the past"

## you ##

This refers to Gentile believers, and is plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])

## God has shut up all into disobedience ##

This can also mean that God has made everyone unable to stop disobeying him, like prisoners unable to escape prison. AT: "God has made everyone prisoners of their disobedience" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
