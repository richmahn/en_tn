## you were formerly disobedient ##

"you did not obey in the past." The pronoun "you," referring to Gentile believers, is plural.

## God has shut up all into disobedience ##

This can also mean that God has made everyone unable to stop disobeying him, like prisoners unable to escape prison: "God has made everyone prisoners of their disobedience." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
