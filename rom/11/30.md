## translationNotes

* **you were formerly disobedient** - "you did not obey in the past." The pronoun "you," referring to Gentile believers, is plural.
* **God has shut up all into disobedience** - This can also mean that God has made everyone unable to stop disobeying him, like prisoners unable to escape prison: "God has made everyone prisoners of their disobedience." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
