# On the one hand ... On the other hand

This is a pair of phrases used to compare two different facts about a subject. Paul uses these phrases to explain that God has rejected the Jews, but he also still loves them.

# concerning the gospel

You can make explicit that God treated the Jews as enemies because they rejected Jesus. AT: "because the Jews rejected the good news about Christ" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# they are enemies on your behalf

God's love for the Gentiles was so great that his love for the Jews seemed like hatred in comparison. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# they are beloved because of the ancestors

You can translate this in an active form. AT: "God still loves them because of what he promised to do for their ancestors" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# For the gifts and the call of God are unchangeable

Paul speaks of the spiritual and material blessings that God promised to give his people as if they were gifts. The call of God refers to the fact that God called the Jews to be his people. AT: "For God never changed his mind about what he has promised to give them, and about how he has called them to be his people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
