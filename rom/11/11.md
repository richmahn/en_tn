# Connecting Statement:

With Israel as a nation rejecting God, Paul warns the Gentiles to be careful they do not make the same mistake.

# Did they stumble so as to fall?

Paul uses this question to add emphasis. AT: "Has God rejected them forever because they sinned?" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# May it never be

"That is not possible!" or "Certainly not!" This expression strongly denies that this could happen. You may have a similar expression in your language that you could use here. See how you translated this in [Romans 9:14](../09/14.md).

# provoke ... to jealousy

See how you translated this phrase in [Romans 10:19](../10/19.md).

# if their failure is the riches of the world, and if their loss is the riches of the Gentiles

Both of these phrases mean basically the same thing. If you need to, you can combine them in your translation. AT: "when the Jews failed spiritually, the result was that God abundantly blessed the non-Jews" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# the riches of the world

Because the Jews rejected Christ, God richly blessed the Gentiles by giving them the opportunity to receive Christ.

# the world

Here the "world" is a metonym that refers to the people who live in the world, especially the Gentiles.
