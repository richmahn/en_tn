# Connecting Statement:

With Israel as a nation rejecting God, Paul warns the Gentiles to be careful they do not make the same mistake.

# Did they stumble so as to fall?

Paul uses this question to add emphasis. Alternate translation: "Has God rejected them forever because they sinned?" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# May it never be

"That is not possible!" or "Certainly not!" This expression strongly denies that this could happen. You may have a similar expression in your language that you could use here. See how you translated this in [Romans 9:14](../09/14.md).

# provoke ... to jealousy

See how you translated this phrase in [Romans 10:19](../10/19.md).
