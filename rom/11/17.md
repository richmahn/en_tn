## translationNotes

* Paul is speaking to the Gentile believers as though they are one person.
* **and you, a wild olive branch** - The pronoun "you," and the phrase "a wild olive branch," refer to the Gentile people who have accepted salvation through Jesus. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]], [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
* **were grafted in among them** - "were attached to the tree among the remaining branches"
* **the rich root of the olive tree** - the promises of God (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **do not boast over the branches** - "do not say you are better than the Jewish people God has rejected"
* **it is not you who supports the root, but the root that supports you** - "you are blessed because of God; God is not blessed because of you" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
