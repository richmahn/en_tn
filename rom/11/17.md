# if you, a wild olive branch

The pronoun "you," and the phrase "a wild olive branch," refer to the Gentile people who have accepted salvation through Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# But if some of the branches were broken off

Here Paul refers to the Jews who rejected Jesus as "broken branches." You can translate this in an active form. AT: "But if someone broke off some of the branches" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# were grafted in among them

Here Paul speaks of the Gentile Christians as if they were "grafted branches." You can translate this in an active form. AT: "God attached you to the tree among the remaining branches" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# the rich root of the olive tree

Here "the rich root" is a metaphor that refers to the promises of God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# do not boast over the branches

Here "the branches" is a metaphor that stands for the Jewish people. AT: "do not say you are better than the Jewish people God has rejected" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# it is not you who supports the root, but the root that supports you

Again Paul implies that the Gentile believers are branches. God saves them only because of the covenant promises that he made to the Jews. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
