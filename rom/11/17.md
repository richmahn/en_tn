Paul is speaking to the Gentile believers as though they are one person.

## and you, a wild olive branch ##

The pronoun "you," and the phrase "a wild olive branch," refer to the Gentile people who have accepted salvation through Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]], [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

## were grafted in among them ##

AT: "were attached to the tree among the remaining branches" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## the rich root of the olive tree ##

This refers to the promises of God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## do not boast over the branches ##

AT: "do not say you are better than the Jewish people God has rejected" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## it is not you who supports the root, but the root that supports you ##

AT: "you are blessed because of God; God is not blessed because of you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
