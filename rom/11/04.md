# But what does God's answer say to him?

Paul is using this question to bring the reader to his next point. AT: "How does God answer him?" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# him

The pronoun "him" refers to Elijah.

# seven thousand men

"7,000 men" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])

# remnant

Here this means a small part of people whom God chose to receive his grace.
