# For the gifts and the call of God are unchangeable

Paul speaks of the spiritual and material blessings that God promised to give his people as if they were gifts. The call of God refers to the fact that God called the Jews to be his people. AT: "For God never changed his mind about what he has promised to give them, and about how he has called them to be his people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
