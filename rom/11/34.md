# For who has known the mind of the Lord or who has become his advisor?

Paul uses this question to emphasize that no one is as wise as the Lord. You can translate this as a statement. Alternate translation: "No one has ever known the mind of the Lord, and no one has become his advisor." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# the mind of the Lord

Here "mind" is a metonym for knowing things or thinking about things. Alternate translation: "all that the Lord knows" or "what the Lord thinks about" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
