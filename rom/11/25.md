# I do not want you to be uninformed

Here Paul uses a double negative. You can translate this in a positive form. AT: "I very much want you to be aware" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])

# brothers

Here "brothers" means fellow Christians, including both men and women.

# I

The pronoun "I" refers to Paul.

# you ... you ... your

The pronouns "you" and "your" refer to the Gentile believers.

# in order that you will not be wise in your own thinking

Paul does not want the Gentile believers to think they are wiser than the Jewish unbelievers. AT: "so that you will not think you are wiser than you are" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# a partial hardening has occurred in Israel

Paul speaks of "hardening" or stubbornness as if it were a hardening of physical organs in the body. Some Jews have refused to accept salvation through Jesus. AT: "many people of Israel continue to be stubborn" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# until the completion of the Gentiles come in

The word "until" here implies that some Jews will believe after God has finished bringing the Gentiles into the church.
