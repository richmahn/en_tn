# Or who has first given anything to God, that God must repay him?"

Paul uses this question to emphasize his point. AT: "No one has ever given anything to God that he did not first receive from God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])  * **For from him ... through him ... to him** - Here, all occurrences of "him" refers to God.
