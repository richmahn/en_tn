Paul is speaking to the Gentile believers as though they are one person.

## if they do not continue in their unbelief ##

AT: "If the Jews start believing in Christ"

## they will be grafted back in ##

AT: "God will graft them back" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## graft ##

This is a common process where the end of a live branch of one tree is inserted into another tree so that it will continue to grow in that new tree.

## For if you were cut out of what is by nature a wild olive tree, and contrary to nature were grafted into a good olive tree, how much more will these Jews, who are the natural branches, be grafted back into their own olive tree? ##

AT: "For if God had cut you out of what is by nature a wild olive tree, and contrary to nature had grafted you into a good olive tree, how much more will he graft these Jews, who are the natural branches, into their own olive tree?" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## branches ##

Paul is comparing members of the people of God to branches on a tree. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## theyâ€¦them ##

All occurrences of they or them refer to the Jews.
