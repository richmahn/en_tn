# In this way, my desire has been to proclaim the gospel, but not where Christ is known by name

Paul only wants to preach to people who have never heard of Christ. Alternate translation: "Because of this, I want to preach the good news in places where people have never heard of Christ" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# in order that I might not build upon another man's foundation

Paul speaks of his ministry work as if he were building a house on a foundation. Alternate translation: "in order that I might not be simply continuing the work that someone else already started. I do not want to be like a man who builds a house on someone else's foundation" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
