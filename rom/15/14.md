# Connecting Statement:

Paul reminds the believers in Rome that God chose him to reach the Gentiles.

# I myself am also convinced about you, my brothers

Paul is quite sure that the believers in Rome are honoring each other in their behavior. AT: "I myself am completely sure that you yourselves have acted toward others in a completely good way" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# brothers

Here this means fellow Christians, including both men and women.

# filled with all knowledge

Paul exaggerates here to emphasize his point. AT: "filled with sufficient knowledge to follow God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# also able to exhort one another

Here "exhort" means to teach. AT: "also able to teach each other" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
