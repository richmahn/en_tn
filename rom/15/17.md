# So my delight is in Christ Jesus and in the things of God

Here "the things of God" could refer to the task that God has chosen Paul to do. AT: "Therefore I have reason to rejoice in Christ Jesus and in the work God has given me to do" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# For I will not dare to speak of anything ... These are things done by word and action, by the power of signs and wonders, and by the power of the Holy Spirit

You can translate this double negative in a positive form. Here "these are things" refers to what Christ has accomplished through Paul. AT: "For the sake of the obedience of the Gentiles, I will only speak of what Christ has accomplished through me in my words and actions and by the power of signs and wonders through the power of the Holy Spirit" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# signs and wonders

These two words mean basically the same thing and refer to various kinds of miracles. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
