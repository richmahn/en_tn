# the grace given me by God

Paul speaks of grace as if it were a physical gift that God had given him. God had appointed Paul and apostle even though he had persecuted believers before he decided to follow Jesus. You can translate this in an active form. Alternate translation: "the grace that God gave me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
