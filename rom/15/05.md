# Connecting Statement:

Paul encourages the believers to remember that both Gentile believers and Jews that believe are made one in Christ.

# may ... God ... grant

"I pray that ... God ... will grant"

# to be of the same mind with each other

Here to be of the "same mind" is a metonym that means to be in agreement with each other. Alternate translation: "to be in agreement with each other" or "to be united" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
