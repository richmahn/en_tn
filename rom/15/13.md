# the God of confidence

Here "confidence" refers to one's ability to trust in God to do what he has promised to do. AT: "God, whom you trust to fulfill his promises" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# fill you with all joy and peace

Paul exaggerates here to emphasize his point. AT: "fill you with great joy and peace" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# you may abound in confidence

"you may be completely confident"
