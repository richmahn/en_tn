# Now

If your language has a way to show that Paul has stopped talking about the good things he is confident of ([Romans 15:29](./28.md)) and is now starting to talk about the dangers he faces, use it here.

# I urge you

"I encourage you"

# brothers

Here this means fellow Christians, including both men and women.

# strive

"work hard" or "struggle"

# rescued

"saved" or "protected"

# that my service for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the believers

Here Paul expresses his desire that the believers in Jerusalem will gladly accept the money from the believers in Macedonia and Achaia. AT: "pray that the believers in Jerusalem will be glad to receive the money that I am bringing them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
