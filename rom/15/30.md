# Now

If your language has a way to show that Paul has stopped talking about the good things he is confident of ([Romans 15:29](../15/29.md)) and is now starting to talk about the dangers he faces, use it here.

# I urge you

"I encourage you"

# brothers

Here this means fellow Christians, including both men and women.

# you strive

"you work hard" or "you struggle"
