# Romans 15 General Notes #

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations of the Old Testament. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 15:9-12, 20, which are quotations from the Old Testament. Many of these quotations are used to prove that God has always had a plan for the salvation of the Gentile peoples. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/save]])
