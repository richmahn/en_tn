## translationNotes

* **But what does it say?** - The word "it" refers to "righteousness" in 10:6. Here Paul describes "righteousness" as a person that can speak. Paul uses a question to emphasize the answer he is about to give. Alternate translation: "But this is what Moses says" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]] and [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **The word is near you** - "The message is right here"
* **in your mouth** - The word "mouth" refers to what a person speaks. This can be translated as a new sentence: "It is in what you say." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
* **and in your heart** - The word "heart" refers to a person's mind or what he thinks. Alternate translation: "and it is in what you think."
* **if you acknowledge with your mouth Jesus as Lord** - "if you confess that Jesus is Lord"
* **believe in your heart** - "accept as true"
* **you will be saved** - This can be translated with an active verb: "God will save you." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
* **For with the heart man believes for righteousness, and with the mouth he acknowledges for salvation** - "For it is with the mind that a person trusts and is right before God, and it is with the mouth that a person confesses and God saves him"
