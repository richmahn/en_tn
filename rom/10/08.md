Paul uses a question to emphasize the answer he is about to give. AT: "But this is what Moses says" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]] and [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **The word is near you** - AT: "The message is right here" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
* **in your mouth** - The word "mouth" refers to what a person speaks. This can be translated as a new sentence. AT: "it is in what you say" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
* **and in your heart** - The word "heart" refers to a person's mind or what he thinks. AT: "and it is in what you think" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
* **if you acknowledge with your mouth Jesus as Lord** - AT: "if you confess that Jesus is Lord"
* **believe in your heart** - AT: "accept as true"
* **raised from the dead** - Here this means to cause a dead person to become alive again.
* **you will be saved** - This can be translated with an active verb. AT: "God will save you" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
* **For with the heart man believes for righteousness, and with the mouth he acknowledges for salvation** - AT: "For it is with the mind that a person trusts and is right before God, and it is with the mouth that a person confesses and God saves him"
