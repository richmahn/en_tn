## But they did not all listen ##

AT: "But not all Jews listened"

## Lord, who has believed our message? ##

Paul is using this question to emphasize that Isaiah prophesied in the Scriptures that many Jews would not believe in Jesus. Here, "our" refers to God and Isaiah. AT: "Lord, so many of them do not believe our message" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## believe ##

Here this means to accept or trust that it is true.
