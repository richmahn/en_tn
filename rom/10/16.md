# Lord, who has believed our message?

Paul is using this question to emphasize that Isaiah prophesied in the Scriptures that many Jews would not believe in Jesus. You can translate this as a statement. AT: "Lord, so many of them do not believe our message" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
