## translationNotes

* **But they did not all listen** - "But not all Jews listened"
* **Lord, who has believed our message?** - Paul is using this question to emphasize that Isaiah prophesied in the Scriptures that many Jews would not believe in Jesus. Here, "our" refers to God and Isaiah. Alternate translation: "Lord, so many of them do not believe our message." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
