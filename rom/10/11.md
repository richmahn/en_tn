# For scripture says

Paul speaks of the Scripture as if it were alive and had a voice. You can make explicit who wrote the Scripture that Paul uses here. Alternate translation: "For Isaiah wrote in the Scriptures" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# Everyone who believes on him will not be put to shame

This is equivalent to: "Everyone who does not believe will be shamed." The negative is used here for emphasis. You can translate this in an active form. Alternate translation: "God will honor everyone who believes in him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
