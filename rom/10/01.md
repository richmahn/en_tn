# Connecting Statement:

Paul continues stating his desire for Israel to believe but emphasizes that both those who are Jews as well as everyone else can only be saved by faith in Jesus.

# Brothers

Here this means fellow Christians, including both men and women.

# my heart's desire

Here "heart" is a metonym for a person's emotions or inner being. Alternate translation: "my greatest desire" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# is for them, for their salvation

"is that God will save the Jews"
