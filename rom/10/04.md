# For Christ is the fulfillment of the law

"For Christ completely fulfilled the law"

# for righteousness for everyone who believes

Here "believes" means "trusts." Alternate translation: "in order that he may make everyone who trusts in him right before God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
