# Moreover, I say, "Did Israel not know?"

Paul uses a question for emphasis. The word "Israel" is a metonym for the people who lived in the nation of Israel. AT: "Again I tell you the people of Israel did know the message" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# First Moses says, "I will provoke you ... I will stir you up

This means that Moses wrote down what God said. "I" refers to God, and "you" refers to the Israelites. AT: "First Moses says that God will provoke you ... God will stir you up" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])

# by what is not a nation

"by those you do not consider to be a real nation" or "by people who do not belong to any nation"

# By means of a nation without understanding

Here "without understanding" means that the people do not know God. AT: "By a nation with people who do not know me or my commands" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# I will stir you up to anger

"I will make you angry" or "I will cause you to become angry"

# you

This refers to the nation of Israel. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
