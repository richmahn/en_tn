# Romans 10 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations indent quotations from the Old Testament. The ULB does this with the quoted material in 10:8.

Some translations set each line of poetry further to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetry that is quoted from the Old Testament in 10:18-20.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### God's righteousness #####

Paul teaches here that while many Jews were earnest in their beliefs, they did not gain righteousness. God's righteousness cannot be earned, it must be given by Christ through faith. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]])

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter ####

##### Rhetorical questions #####
Paul uses many rhetorical questions to convince his reader that, because salvation is not restricted to the Hebrew people, Christians must be ready to go and share the gospel with the whole world. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/save]])

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### "I will provoke you to jealousy by what is not a nation" #####

This prophecy explains that one function of the church is to provoke the Hebrew people to jealousy so they would return to worshiping God. This will happen in the future. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/jealous]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
