# Romans 10 General Notes

#### Structure and formatting

Some translations set prose quotations from the Old Testament farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text. The ULT does this with the quoted words in verse 8.

Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with verses 18-20 of this chapter, which are words from the Old Testament.

#### Special concepts in this chapter

##### God's righteousness

Paul teaches here that while many Jews earnestly tried to be righteous, they did not succeed. We cannot earn God's righteousness. God gives us Jesus' righteousness when we believe in him. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]])

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter

##### Rhetorical questions
Paul uses many rhetorical questions in this chapter. He does this to convince his readers that God does not save only the Hebrew people, so Christians must be ready to go and share the gospel with the whole world. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/save]])

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter

##### "I will provoke you to jealousy by what is not a nation"

Paul uses this prophecy to explain that God will use the church to make the Hebrew people jealous. This is so they will seek God and believe the gospel. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/jealous]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
