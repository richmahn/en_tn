## And Isaiah is very bold and says ##

This means Isaiah wrote what God had said.

## I was found by those who did not seek me ##

The words "I" and "me" refer to God. This can be translated with an active verb: "Even though the Gentile people were not looking for me they found me." Also, prophets often speak of things in the future as if they have already happened. This emphasizes that the prophecy will certainly come true. Alternate translation: "Even though the Gentile people may not look for me, they will find me." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## I appeared ##

"I made myself known." Alternate translation: "I will make myself known."

## he says ##

God, speaking through Isaiah, says

## All the day long ##

This phrase is used to emphasize God's continual effort. Alternate translation: "Continually"

## I reached out my hands to a disobedient and resistant people ##

Alternate translation: "I tried to welcome you and to help you, but you refused my help and continued to disobey." The words "I" and "my" refer to God.
