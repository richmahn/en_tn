# the righteousness that comes from the law

Paul speaks of "righteousness" as if it were alive and able to move. Alternate translation: "how the law makes a person right before God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# The man who does the righteousness of the law will live by this righteousness

In order to be made right with God through the law, a person would have to keep the law perfectly, which is not possible. Alternate translation: "The person who perfectly obeys the law will live because the law will make him right before God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# will live

The words "will live" can refer to 1) eternal life or 2) mortal life in fellowship with God.
