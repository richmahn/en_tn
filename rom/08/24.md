# For in this certain hope we were saved

You can translate this in an active form. Alternate translation: "For God saved us because we hoped in him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# Now hope that is seen is not hope. For who hopes for what he can see?

Paul uses a question to help his audience understand what "hope" is. Alternate translation: "But if we are confidently waiting, that means we do not yet have what we want. No one can confidently wait if he already has what he wants" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
