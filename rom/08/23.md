##  who have the first fruits of the Spirit ##

Paul compares believers receiving the Holy Spirit to the first fruits and vegetables of the season to grow. This emphasizes that the Holy Spirit is only the beginning of what God will give to believers. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## waiting for our adoption, the redemption of our body ##

It can be made explicit what God will redeem us from: "waiting for when we are fully members of God's family and he saves our bodies from decay and death." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

## For in confidence we were saved ##

This can be translated with an active verb: "For we are confident that God saved us." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## But confidence that is seen is not confidence, for who is confident of what he now sees? ##

Paul uses a question to help his audience understand what "confidence" is. Alternate translation: "But if we are confidently waiting that means we do not yet have what we want. No one can confidently wait if he already has what he wants." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]]).
