## translationNotes

* ** who have the first fruits of the Spirit** - Paul compares believers receiving the Holy Spirit to the first fruits and vegetables of the season to grow. This emphasizes that the Holy Spirit is only the beginning of what God will give to believers. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **waiting for our adoption, the redemption of our body** - AT: "waiting for when we are fully members of God's family and he saves our bodies from decay and death" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]]) (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **For by this confidence we were saved** - AT: "For God saved us because we were confident in him" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
* **But what we are confident will happen has not yet been seen, for who is confident of what he already sees?** - Paul uses a question to help his audience understand what "confidence" is. AT: "But if we are confidently waiting that means we do not yet have what we want. No one can confidently wait if he already has what he wants." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]]).
