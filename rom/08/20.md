## translationNotes

* **For the creation was subjected to futility** - Alternate translation with an active verb: "For God caused what he had created to be unable to achieve the purpose for which he had made it." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
* **not of its own will, but of him who subjected it** - Here "creation" is described as a person who can desire. Alternate translation: "not because this is what the created things wanted, but because it is what God wanted." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
* **in the confidence that the creation itself will be delivered** - Alternate translation with a new sentence and with an active verb: "Yet the things created are fully certain that God will save them" (see UDB).
* **from slavery to decay** - Paul compares all things in creation to slaves and "decay" to their owner. Alternate translation: "from rotting and dying." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **into the liberty of the glory of the children of God** - "and he will free them when he gives honor to his children"
* **For we know that the whole creation groans and labors in pain together even now** - The creation is compared to a woman groaning while giving birth to a baby. "For we know that everything that God created wants to be free and groans for it like a woman giving birth."
