## we are killed all day long ##

Here "we" refers to the one who wrote this part of Scripture and includes all those who remain loyal to God. The phrase "all day long" is an exaggeration to emphasize how much danger they are in. Paul uses this part of Scripture to show that all who belong to God should expect difficult times. This can be translated with an active verb: "our enemies continually seek to kill us." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-inclusive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## We were considered as sheep for the slaughter ##

This compares those whom people kill because they are loyal to God to livestock. Alternate translation with an active verb: "Our lives had no more value to them than the sheep they kill." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
