# Who will separate us from the love of Christ?

Paul uses this question to teach that nothing can separate us from the love of Christ. AT: "No one will ever separate us from the love of Christ!" or "Nothing will ever separate us from the love of Christ!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or hunger, or nakedness, or danger, or sword?

The words "shall separate us from the love of Christ" are understood from the previous question.  AT: "Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or hunger, or nakedness, or danger, or sword separate us from the love of Christ?"(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# Tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or hunger, or nakedness, or danger, or sword?

Paul uses this question to emphasize that even these things cannot separate us from the love of Christ. AT: "Even tribulation, distress, persecution, hunger, nakedness, danger, and sword cannot separate us from the love of Christ." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or hunger, or nakedness, or danger, or sword?

The abstract nouns can be expressed with verb phrases. Here "sword" is a metonym that represents being killed violently. AT: "Even if people cause us trouble, hurt us, take away our clothes and food, or kill us, they cannot separate us from the love of Christ." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# Tribulation, or distress

These words both mean the same thing. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
