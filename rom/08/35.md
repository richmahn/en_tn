## translationNotes

* **Tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or hunger, or nakedness, or danger, or sword?** - AT: "It is not possible even if someone causes us trouble, hurts us, takes away our clothes and food, or even kills us." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
* **Tribulation, or distress** - These words both mean the same thing. (See [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
* **For your benefit** - Here "your" is singular and refers to God. AT: "For you" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
* **we are killed all day long** - Here "we" refers to the one who wrote this part of Scripture and includes all those who remain loyal to God. The phrase "all day long" is an exaggeration to emphasize how much danger they are in. Paul uses this part of Scripture to show that all who belong to God should expect difficult times. AT: "our enemies continually seek to kill us" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive]] and [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]] and [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
* **We were considered as sheep for the slaughter** - This compares those whom people kill because they are loyal to God to livestock. AT: "Our lives had no more value to them than the sheep they kill" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]] and [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
