# For your benefit

Here "your" is singular and refers to God. AT: "For you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# we are killed all day long

Here "we" refers to the one who wrote this part of Scripture, but not his audience, who was God. The phrase "all day long" is an exaggeration to emphasize how much danger they are in. Paul uses this part of Scripture to show that all who belong to God should expect difficult times. This can be translated in an active form. AT: "our enemies continually seek to kill us" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-inclusive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# We were considered as sheep for the slaughter

Here Paul compares to livestock those whom people kill because they are loyal to God. You can translate this in an active form. AT: "Our lives have no more value to them than the sheep they kill" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
