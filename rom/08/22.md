# For we know that the whole creation groans and labors in pain together even now

The creation is compared to a woman groaning while giving birth to a baby. Alternate translation: "For we know that everything that God created wants to be free and groans for it like a woman giving birth" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
