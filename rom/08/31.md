# What then shall we say about these things? If God is for us, who is against us?

Paul uses questions to emphasize the main point of what he said previously. AT: "This is what we should know from all of this: since God is helping us, no one can defeat us" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# He who did not spare his own Son

God the Father sent the Son of God, Jesus Christ, to the cross as the holy, infinite sacrifice necessary to satisfy God's infinite, holy nature against the sin of humanity. Here "Son" is an important title for Jesus, the Son of God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])

# but delivered him up

"but handed him over to his enemies"

# how will he not also with him freely give us all things?

Paul is using a question for emphasis. AT: "he will certainly and freely give us all things!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
