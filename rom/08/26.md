# Connecting Statement:

Though Paul has been emphasizing that there is a struggle in believers between the flesh and the Spirit, he affirms that the Spirit is aiding us.

# inexpressible groans

"groanings that we cannot express in words"

# He who searches the hearts

This refers to God. Here "searches the hearts" means "examines our thoughts and feelings." AT: "God, who knows all our thoughts and feelings" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
