# For if you live according to the flesh

"Because if you live only to please your sinful desires"

# you are about to die

"you will certainly be separated from God"

# but if by the Spirit you put to death the body's actions

Paul speaks of the "old man," crucified with Christ, as the person who is responsible for his sinful desires. AT: "but if by the power of the Holy Spirit you stop obeying your sinful desires" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
