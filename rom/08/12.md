# So then

"Because what I have just told you is true"

# brothers

Here this means fellow Christians, including both men and women.

# we are debtors

Paul is speaking of obedience as if it were paying back a debt. AT: "we need to obey" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# but not to the flesh to live according to the flesh

Again Paul speaks of obedience as if it were paying back a debt. You can include the implied word "debtors." AT: "but we are not debtors to the flesh, and we do not have to obey our sinful desires" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# For if you live according to the flesh

"Because if you live only to please your sinful desires"

# you are about to die

"you will certainly be separated from God"

# but if by the Spirit you put to death the body's actions

Paul speaks of the "old man," crucified with Christ, as the person who is responsible for his sinful desires. AT: "but if by the power of the Holy Spirit you stop obeying your sinful desires" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
