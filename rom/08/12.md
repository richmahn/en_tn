## So then ##

AT: "Because what I have just told you is true"

## brothers ##

AT: "fellow believers"

## we are debtors ##

Paul is comparing obedience to paying back a debt. AT: "we need to obey" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## but not to the flesh to live according to the flesh ##

AT: AT: "but we do not need to obey our sinful desires"

## For if you live according to the flesh ##

AT: "Because if you live only to please your sinful desires"

## you are about to die ##

AT: "you will certainly be separated from God"

## but if by the Spirit you put to death the body's actions ##

AT, as a new sentence: "But if by the power of the Holy Spirit you stop obeying your sinful desires"
