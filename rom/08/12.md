"Because what I have just told you is true"

Paul is comparing obedience to paying back a debt. Alternate translation: "we need to obey." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## but not to the flesh to live according to the flesh ##

"but we do not need to obey our sinful desires"

## For if you live according to the flesh ##

"Because if you live only to please your sinful desires"

## you are about to die ##

"you will certainly be separated from God"

## but if by the Spirit you put to death the body's actions ##

Alternate translation, as a new sentence: "But if by the power of the Holy Spirit you stop obeying your sinful desires."
