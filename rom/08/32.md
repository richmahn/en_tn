# He who did not spare his own Son

God the Father sent the Son of God, Jesus Christ, to the cross as the holy, infinite sacrifice necessary to satisfy God's infinite, holy nature against the sin of humanity. Here "Son" is an important title for Jesus, the Son of God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])

# but delivered him up

"but put him under the control of his enemies"

# how will he not also with him freely give us all things?

Paul is using a question for emphasis. Alternate translation: "he will certainly and freely give us all things!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# freely give us all things

"kindly give us all things"
