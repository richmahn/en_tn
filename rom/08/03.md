# For what the law was unable to do because it was weak through the flesh, God did

Here the law is described as a person who could not break the power of sin. AT: "For the law did not have the power to stop us from sinning, because the power of sin within us was too strong. But God did stop us from sinning" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# through the flesh

"because of people's sinful nature"

# He ... sent his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh ... an offering for sin ... he condemned sin

The Son of God forever satisfied God's holy anger against our sin by giving his own body and human life as the eternal sacrifice for sin.

# Son

This is an important title for Jesus, the Son of God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])

# in the likeness of sinful flesh

"who looked like any other sinful human being"

# to be an offering for sin

"so that he could die as a sacrifice for our sins"

# he condemned sin in the flesh

"God broke the power of sin through the body of his Son"

# the requirements of the law might be fulfilled in us

You can translate this in an active form. AT: "we might fulfill what the law requires" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# we who walk not according to the flesh

"we who do not obey our sinful desires"

# but according to the Spirit

"but who obey the Holy Spirit"
