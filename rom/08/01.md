# Connecting Statement:

Paul gives the answer to the struggle he has with sin and good.

# There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus

Here "condemnation" refers to punishing people. Alternate translation: "God will not condemn and punish those who are joined to Christ Jesus" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# therefore

"for that reason" or "because what I have just told you is true"
