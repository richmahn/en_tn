# the eager expectation of the creation waits for

Paul describes everything that God created as a person who eagerly waits for something. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# for the revealing of the sons of God

You can translate this in an active form. Alternate translation: "for the time when God will reveal his children" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# sons of God

Here this means all believers in Jesus. You can also translate this as "children of God."
