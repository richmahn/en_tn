## translationNotes

* **David also pronounces blessing upon the man to whom God counts righteousness without works** - AT: "Similarly, David wrote about how God blesses the man whom God makes righteous without works"
* **whose iniquities are forgiven...whose sins are covered...to whom the Lord will not count sin** - The same concept is stated in three different ways. AT: "whose iniquities the Lord has forgiven...whose sins the Lord has covered...whose sins the Lord will not count" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
