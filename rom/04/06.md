## David also pronounces blessing upon the man to whom God counts righteousness without works ##

AT: "Similarly, David wrote about how God blesses the man whom God makes righteous without works"

## whose iniquities are forgiven...whose sins are covered...to whom the Lord will not count sin ##

The same concept is stated in three different ways. AT: "whose iniquities the Lord has forgiven...whose sins the Lord has covered...whose sins the Lord will not count" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
