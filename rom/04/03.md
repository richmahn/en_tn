# For what does the scripture say

Paul uses this question to add emphasis. He speaks of the Scriptures as if they were alive and could talk. AT: "For we can read in the scripture" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# it was counted to him as righteousness

You can translate this in an active form. AT: "God considered Abraham as a righteous person" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
