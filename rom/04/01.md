## translationNotes

* **What then will we say that Abraham, our forefather, found according to the flesh?** - "This is what Abraham our physical ancestor found." Paul uses the question to catch the attention of the reader and to start talking about something new. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **For what do the scriptures say** - "For we can read in the scriptures" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
