Paul continues to answer rhetorical questions to emphasize that each point he is making is certainly true. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## What then will we say that Abraham, our forefather, found according to the flesh? ##

"This is what Abraham our physical ancestor found." Paul uses the question to catch the attention of the reader and to start talking about something new. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## For what do the scriptures say ##

"For we can read in the scriptures" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

## and it was counted to him as righteousness  ##

"and God considered Abraham as a righteous person" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
