# Connecting Statement:

Paul confirms that even in the past believers were made right with God by faith and not by the law.

# What then will we say that Abraham, our forefather according to the flesh, found?

Paul uses the question to catch the attention of the reader and to start talking about something new. AT: "This is what Abraham our physical ancestor found" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# For what does the scripture say

Paul uses this question to add emphasis. He speaks of the Scriptures as if they were alive and could talk. AT: "For we can read in the scripture" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# it was counted to him as righteousness

You can translate this in an active form. AT: "God considered Abraham as a righteous person" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
