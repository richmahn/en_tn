# as it is written

Where it is written can be made explicit. You can also translate this in an active form. Alternate translation: "as someone has written in the Scriptures" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# I have made you

Here the word "you" is singular and refers to Abraham. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# Abraham was in the presence of him whom he trusted, that is, God, who gives life to the dead

Here "of him whom he trusted" refers to God. Alternate translation: "Abraham was in the presence of God whom he trusted, who gives life to those who have died" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# calls the things that do not exist into existence

"created everything from nothing"
