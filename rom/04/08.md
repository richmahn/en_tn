# whose sins are covered 


The same concept that is stated as "whose lawless deeds are forgiven ... whose sins are covered" in Romans 4:7 (./07.md) is stated in yet another way here. You can translate this in an active form. Alternate translation: "whose sins the Lord has covered" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
