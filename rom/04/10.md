# So how was it counted? When Abraham was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision?

Paul asks these questions to add emphasis to his remarks. AT: "When did God consider Abraham to be righteous? Was it before his circumcision, or after it?" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# It was not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision

"It happened before he was circumcised, not after he was circumcised"
