## translationNotes

* **Now** - This word is used here to mark a new part of the letter. Paul changes from talking about Abraham to talking about believers in Christ.
* **for his benefit only** - "for Abraham only"
* **that it was counted to him** - This can be translated with an active verb: "that God counted righteousness to him" or "God considered him righteous." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
* **for us** - The word "us" refers to Paul and includes all believers in Christ. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive]])
* **but also for us, to whom it will be counted, we who believe** - This could be translated as a new sentence and with an active verb: "It was also for our benefit, because God will consider us righteous also if we believe."
* **him who raised** - "God, who raised"
* **Jesus, who was delivered up for our trespasses** - This can be translated with an active verb: "Jesus, whom God handed over to those who killed him."
* **and was raised for our justification** - This can be translated with an active verb: "and whom God brought back to life so we would be made right with God."
