## Nevertheless ##

AT: "Yet" or "There was no written law from the time of Adam to the time of Moses, but" (see [Romans 5:12](./12.md))

## death ruled from Adam until Moses ##

Paul is comparing death to a king. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]]). AT: "people continued to die from the time of Adam until the time of Moses as a consequence of their sin"

## even over those who did not sin like Adam’s disobedience ##

AT: "even people whose sins were different from Adam’s continue to die"

## who is a figure of him who was to come ##

Adam was a pattern of Christ, who appeared much later. He had much in common with him.

## For if...the many died...much more did the grace of God and the gift...abound ##

It is important that "the many died," but it is more important that "the grace of God and the gift" abounded.

## much more did the grace...and the gift...abound ##

"the grace...and the gift" were greater and stronger than the "trespass."
