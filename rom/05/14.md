## translationNotes

* **Nevertheless** - "Yet" or "There was no written law from the time of Adam to the time of Moses, but" (see [[:en:bible:notes:rom:05:12]])
* **death ruled from Adam until Moses** - Paul is comparing death to a king. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]). Translation Alternate: "people continued to die from the time of Adam until the time of Moses as a consequence of their sin."
* **even over those who did not sin like Adam’s disobedience** - "even people whose sins were different from Adam’s continue to die"
* **who is a figure of him who was to come** - Adam was a pattern of Christ, who appeared much later. He had much in common with him.
* **For if...the many died...much more did the grace of God and the gift...abound** - It is important that "the many died," but it is more important that "the grace of God and the gift" abounded.
* **much more did the grace...and the gift...abound** - "the grace...and the gift" were greater and stronger than the "trespass."
