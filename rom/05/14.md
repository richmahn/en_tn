# Nevertheless, death

"Even though what I have just said is true, death" or "There was no written law from the time of Adam to the time of Moses, but death." (See: [Romans 5:13](./13.md))

# death ruled from Adam until Moses

Paul is speaking of death as if it were a king who ruled. AT: "people continued to die from the time of Adam until the time of Moses as a consequence of their sin" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# even over those who did not sin like Adam's disobedience

"even people whose sins were different from Adam's continue to die"

# who is a pattern of him who was to come

Adam was a pattern of Christ, who appeared much later. He had much in common with him.
