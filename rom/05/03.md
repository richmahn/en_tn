# Not only this

The word "this" refers to the ideas described in [Romans 5:1-2](./01.md).

# we ... our ... us

All occurrences of "we," "our," and "us" refer to all believers and should be inclusive. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-inclusive]])

# approval

The word "approval" refers to God's acceptance of us.

# confidence for the future

This is the certainty that God will fulfill all his promises for those who trust in Christ.

# This confidence does not disappoint

Paul uses personification here as he speaks of "confidence" as if it were alive. AT: "We are very confident that we will receive the things that we wait for" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
