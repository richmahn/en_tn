# Not only this

The word "this" refers to the ideas described in [Romans 5:1-2](./01.md).

# we ... our ... us

All occurrences of "we," "our," and "us" refer to all believers and should be inclusive. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-inclusive]])

# certain hope

This is the certainty that God will fulfill all his promises for those who trust in Christ.

# that hope does not disappoint

Paul uses personification here as he speaks of "confidence" as if it were alive. AT: "we are very confident that we will receive the things that we wait for" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# because the love of God has been poured into our hearts

Here "hearts" represents a person's thoughts, feelings, or inner person. The phrase "the love of God has been poured into our hearts" is a metaphor for God showing love to his people. This can be stated in active form. AT: "because he has loved us greatly" or "because God has shown us how much he loves us" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
