# For the gift is not like the outcome of that one man's sin

Here "the gift" refers to God's freely erasing the record of our sins. AT: "The gift is not like the result of Adam's sin" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# The judgment followed one trespass and brought condemnation, but the gift ... justification

Here Paul gives two reasons why "the gift is not like the result of Adam's sin." The "judgment of condemnation" implies that we all deserve God's punishment for our sins. AT: "Because on the one hand, God declared that all people deserve to be punished because of the sin of one man, but on the other hand" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# the gift followed many trespasses and brought justification

This refers to how God makes us right with him even when we do not deserve it. AT: "God's kind gift to put us right with himself" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# followed many trespasses

"after the sins of many"

# trespass of the one

This refers to the sin of Adam.

# death ruled

Here Paul speaks of "death" as a king who ruled. The "rule" of death causes everyone to die. AT: "everyone died" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
