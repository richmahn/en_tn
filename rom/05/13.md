# For until the law, sin was in the world

This means that the people sinned before God gave the law. AT: "People in the world sinned before God gave his law to Moses" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# but there is no accounting for sin when there is no law

This means that God did not charge the people with sinning before he gave the law. AT: "but God recorded no sin against the law before he gave the law" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
