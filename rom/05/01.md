# Connecting Statement:

Paul begins to tell many different things that happen when God makes believers right with him.

# Since we are justified

"Because we are justified"

# we ... our

All occurrences of "we" and "our" refer to all believers and should be inclusive. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-inclusive]])

# through our Lord Jesus Christ

"because of our Lord Jesus Christ"

# Lord

Here "Lord" means that Jesus is God.
