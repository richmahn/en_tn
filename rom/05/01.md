# Connecting Statement:

Paul begins to tell many different things that happen when God makes believers right with him.

# Since

"Because"

# we ... our

All occurrences of "we" and "our" refer to all believers and should be inclusive. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-inclusive]])

# through our Lord Jesus Christ

"because of our Lord Jesus Christ"

# Lord

Here "Lord" means that Jesus is God.

# Through him we also have our access by faith into this grace in which we stand

Here "by faith" refers to our trust in Jesus, which allows us to stand before God. AT: "Because we trust in Jesus, God allows us to come into his presence"
