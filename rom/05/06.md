# we

The word "we" here refers to all believers and so should be inclusive. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-inclusive]])

# For one will hardly die for a righteous man

"It is hard to find someone who is willing to die, even for a righteous man"

# That is, perhaps someone would dare to die for a good person

"But you might find someone who is willing to die for such a good person"
