# Connecting Statement:

Paul explains why death happened even before God gave the law to Moses.

# through one man sin entered ... death entered through sin

Paul describes sin as a dangerous thing that came into the world through the actions of "one man," Adam. This sin then became an opening through which death, pictured here as another dangerous thing, also came into the world. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# For until the law, sin was in the world

This means that the people sinned before God gave the law. AT: "People in the world sinned before God gave his law to Moses" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# but there is no accounting for sin when there is no law

This means that God did not charge the people with sinning before he gave the law. AT: "but God recorded no sin against the law before he gave the law" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
