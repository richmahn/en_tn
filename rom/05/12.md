## translationNotes

* **Therefore** - The words that follow will be based on Paul's previous argument that all believers have been declared righteous by faith. (see UDB)
* **through one man sin enteredâ€¦death entered through sin** - Paul describes "sin" as a dangerous thing that was able to come into the world through the opening that was caused by the actions of "one man," Adam. This "sin" then became an opening through which "death," another dangerous thing, also came into the world. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]], [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
