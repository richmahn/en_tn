# Connecting Statement:

Paul explains why death happened even before God gave the law to Moses.

# through one man sin entered ... death entered through sin

Paul describes sin as a dangerous thing that came into the world through the actions of "one man," Adam. This sin then became an opening through which death, pictured here as another dangerous thing, also came into the world. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
