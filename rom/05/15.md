# For if by the trespass of one the many died

Here "one" refers to Adam. Alternate translation: "For if by one man's sin, many died" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# how much more did the grace of God and the gift by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, abound for the many

Here "grace" refers to God's free gift that he made available to everyone through Jesus Christ. Alternate translation: "even more through the man Jesus Christ, who died for us all, did God kindly offer us this gift of everlasting life, although we do not deserve it" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
