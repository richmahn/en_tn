# Connecting Statement:

John warns them of deceivers, reminds them to remain in Christ's teaching, and warns them to stay away from those who do not remain in Christ's teaching.

# For many deceivers have gone out into the world

"For many false teachers have left the congregation" or "For many deceivers are in the world"

# many deceivers

"many false teachers" or "many imposters"

# Jesus Christ came in the flesh

Coming in the flesh is a metonym for being a real person. Alternate translation: "Jesus Christ came as a real human" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# This is the deceiver and the antichrist

"They are the ones who deceive others and oppose Christ himself"
