John continues to speak to the church as "the lady." The believers are her "children." (See: [2 John 1:1](./01.md))

## some of your children ##

The word "your" is singular.

## just as we have received this commandment from the Father ##

"just as God the Father commanded us"

## not as though I wrote to you a new commandment ##

"not as though I am commanding you to do something new"

## but that which we have had from the beginning ##

"but I am writing to you what Christ commanded us to do when we first believed. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

## that we should love one another ##

This could be translated as a new sentence: "And he commanded that we should love one another."

## This is the commandment, even as you heard from the beginning, that you should walk in it ##

The word "it" refers to love. Alternate translation: "And he has commanded you since you first believed to love one another."

## that you should walk ##

The word "you" is plural.
