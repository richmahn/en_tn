Yahweh loves Israel and rejects Esau (Edom) (1:2–5)\n1. A message against the priests (1:6–2:9)\n1. A message against Judah: they have broken faith by divorcing and intermarrying (2:10–16)\n1. A message about the day of refining (2:17–3:6)\n1. A message about tithing (3:7–12)\n1. A message about those who others treated shamefully, but who were faithful to Yahweh (3:13–18)\n1. Yahweh will punish the wicked and send Elijah before the “great and terrible day of Yahweh” (4:5–6)\n\n### What is the Book of Malachi about?\n\nThe Book of Malachi is about the prophecies that Malachi spoke to the Jews who had returned from Babylon to Judah. At that time, the Jews were discouraged even though they had finished building a new temple. The wonderful things that previous prophets had promised for Judah had not yet happened. And the Persian Empire still ruled over them. As a result, they no longer were concerned about the law or worshiping Yahweh. Malachi rebuked them for not trusting in Yahweh. But he also promised them that Yahweh would do everything that he promised to do.\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nThis book traditionally has been titled “Malachi” or “The Book of Malachi.” Translators may decide to call it “The Book about Malachi” or “The Sayings of Malachi.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])\n\n### Who wrote the Book of Malachi?\n\nThe prophet Malachi wrote these messages from Yahweh to the Jews. However, since “Malachi” means “my messenger,” it is possible that this was a title for this prophet. If so, we do not know his real name.\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### What was meant by the day of Yahweh?\n\nMalachi spoke about “the day” several times. This is the same as “the day of Yahweh.” In the Book of Malachi, this is the time when Yahweh would judge his people. He would remove those who wickedly sin and bless those who trust in him. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/dayofthelord]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])
1:intro	b7vm				0	# Malachi 1 General Notes\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Yahweh of hosts\n\nThis is an important title used in this chapter. It reminds the reader of the great power Yahweh has to punish the nations. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/yahwehofhosts]])\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Rhetorical questions\n\nThere are many rhetorical questions in this chapter. They all have a rather dramatic effect. They increase the emotional connotations of what is being said. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
1:1	m3x2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	the burden of the word of Yahweh	1	The editor of the book is speaking as if the *word of Yahweh** were literally a **burden** that Malachi was carrying. This is likely a reference to the serious nature of what Yahweh told Malachi to say. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the serious word from Yahweh”
1:1	k9f4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	the word of Yahweh	1	The editor is using the word **word** by association to mean what Yahweh said by using words. Alternate translation: “the message from Yahweh”
1:1	p2r7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	to Israel	1	Since Malachi is referring to a group of people, it might be more natural in your language to use the plural form of **Israel**. Alternate translation: “to the Israelites”
1:1	w5h8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	by the hand of	1	The author is using one part of Malachi, his **hand**, to mean all of him in the act of bringing Yahweh’s message to the Israelites. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “through”
1:1	t6j9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Malachi	1	This could be translated either as: (1) **Malachi**, the name of a man. The ULT and these notes will follow that interpretation. (2) “my messenger,” as in [3:1](../03/01.md). If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to follow the interpretation that it does. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to follow the same interpretation as the ULT.
1:2	l1n3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	I have loved you	1	The word **you** is plural here because Yahweh is addressing the Israelites as a group, so use the plural form in your translation if your language marks that distinction. The words “you,” “your,” and “yourselves” are usually plural in this book when they refer to the Israelites. These notes will indicate any exceptions. The word “you” is always singular when it refers to Yahweh.
1:2	q7m5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	But you say	1	Malachi is probably not quoting an actual response from the Judeans. Rather, he is anticipating an objection, stating it, and then answering it. This was a common practice of Jewish public speakers in this time period (and also in New Testament times). The phrase **But you say** occurs throughout the book as Malachi anticipates and answers objections. It would be helpful to translate it consistently so that your readers can appreciate the method he is using to challenge the Judeans. Alternate translation: “Now you may object”
1:2	x4d6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	{Was} not Esau a brother to Jacob?	1	Yahweh is using the question form for emphasis. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “Now Esau was Jacob’s brother”
1:2	b2k8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	{Was} not Esau a brother to Jacob?	1	Yahweh is using the names **Esau** and **Jacob** by association to mean their descendants. Alternate translation: “Are the Edomites not a related people group to you Israelites?” or “Now the Edomites are a related people group to you Israelites”
1:2	h9f1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	the declaration of Yahweh	1	This phrase indicates that this is a direct quotation from Yahweh. You may wish to indicate that in your translation, using a natural way of introducing direct quotations in your language. Alternate translation: “this is what Yahweh declares”
1:2	v3r5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	Yet I loved Jacob	1	Yahweh is referring to the Israelites as a group by the name of their ancestor, **Jacob**. Alternate translation: “Yet I have favored you Israelites”
1:3	c7m2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	but Esau I hated	1	The word translated as **hated** does not always indicate a strong antipathy or loathing. In a comparison such as this one, it can mean “loved less” or “favored less.” Alternate translation: “but I have not favored the Edomites.”
1:3	g6n9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	a desolation	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **desolation**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “desolate”
1:3	z8k4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	jackals	1	A **jackal** is a wild dog that lives in the desert. If your readers would not be familiar with what a jackal is, in your translation you could use the name of a similar animal that your readers would recognize, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “wild dogs” or “desert scavengers”
1:4	y2p7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs- activepassive	We are beaten down	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “Our enemies have beaten us down”
1:4	f5s1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	And they will call them ‘the territory of wickedness’ and ‘the people whom Yahweh abhors forever	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “And people will say that they are a territory where wicked people live and that they are a people whom Yahweh abhors forever”
1:4	d9h3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	And they will call them	1	Here, **they** is an indefinite pronoun that does not have a specific referent in the immediate context. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this with a different expression that does not use an indefinite pronoun. Alternate translation: “And they will be called”
1:4	j1w6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	the territory of wickedness	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **wickedness**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “the wicked territory” or “the territory where wicked people live”
1:5	a8b3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	And your eyes will see, and you yourselves will say, “Great is Yahweh beyond the border of Israel!”	1	Some versions include this verse in the quotation from Yahweh that begins in [1:2](../01/02.md). If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to mark the quotation boundaries in the same way that it does. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to mark the quotation boundaries as the ULT does. If you treat this as a quotation from Yahweh, it may be more natural in your language not to have a quotation within a quotation and to have Yahweh speak of himself in the first person rather than in the third person. Alternate translation: “And your eyes will see, and you yourselves will say that I am great beyond the border of Israel!”
1:5	n4t8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	And your eyes will see	1	Malachi is using one part of the Judeans, their **eyes**, to mean all of them in the act of seeing. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “And you will see for yourselves”
1:6	r2k9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	So if I am a father, where is my honor? And if I am a master, where is my fear?	1	Yahweh is using the question form for emphasis. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “Since I am a father, you should honor me. And since I am a master, you should fear me.”
1:6	u6v1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	my name & your name	1	Yahweh is using the word **name** by association to mean his reputation and authority. Alternate translation: “my reputation … your reputation” or “my authority … your authority”
1:7	o3d8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	defiled food	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “food that people have made unfit for sacrifice”
1:7	q1j6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	But you say, ‘In what have we defiled you?’ In your saying, ‘The table of Yahweh, it is despised.’	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “But you ask how you have defiled me. You defile me by saying that you can despise the table of Yahweh.”
1:7	a3h2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	The table of Yahweh, it is despised	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “One may despise the table of Yahweh”
1:7	b7c4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	The table of Yahweh	1	Yahweh is speaking as if the altar on which the priests offered sacrifices to him were literally a **table** at which he ate food. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “The altar of Yahweh”
1:8	r8n4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	And when you present the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil? And when you present the lame and the sick, is it not evil?	1	Yahweh is using the question form for emphasis. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “When you present blind animals for sacrifice, that is evil! And when you present lame and sick animals, that is also evil!”
1:8	g2m7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	the blind & the lame and the sick	1	Yahweh is not referring to specific blind, lame, or sick animals. He means animals with these conditions in general. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using a plural form. Alternate translation: “blind animals … lame and sick animals”
1:8	p9k1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	Present it	1	The pronoun **it** refers to the blind, lame, and sick animals. It may be more natural in your language to use a plural expression. Alternate translation: “Present these animals”
1:8	y6s3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	to your governor & will he accept you & your face	1	The words **you** and **your** are singular here because Yahweh is addressing the priests as a collective group. This suits the context, since that is how they were ruled by their **governor**. It may be natural for you to use the singular form in your translation if your language marks that distinction.
1:8	r4f8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	Will he accept you or lift up your face?	1	Yahweh is using the question form for emphasis. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “He certainly will not accept you or lift up your face!”
1:8	d7h5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	Will he accept you or lift up your face?	1	The terms **accept you** and **lift up your face** mean similar things. Yahweh is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “He certainly will not show you any favor at all!”
1:8	i3l9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	or lift up your face	1	This is an expression that people of this culture would commonly use to mean “show favor.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “or show you favor”
1:9	a9n2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	And now	1	The phrase translated as **And now** is an expression that was used in messages of this time to introduce important points. If your language has a comparable expression that it uses for this same purpose, you can use it in your translation.
1:9	t5m1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	the face of God, that he may be gracious to us	1	Malachi attributes this quotation to Yahweh, but it is something that Yahweh told him to say to the priests. So you could translate it with Malachi as the speaker. However, if you translate it with Yahweh as the speaker, he speaking about himself in the third person. If it would be more natural in your language, you could translate it in the first person. Alternate translation: “my face, that I may be gracious to you”
1:9	s2k7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	the face of God	1	Yahweh is using one part of himself, his **face**, to mean all of him in the act of looking with favor on someone who was praying to him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “God”
1:9	e1f6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	the face of God	1	Malachi is probably using the term **God** here to contrast with the mention of “the governor” in the previous verse. The implication is that if people would not offer inferior gifts to a human being, they should certainly not offer them to God. So it would be appropriate to use here your language’s term for the true God who created the world, rather than the name Yahweh.
1:9	e8x4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	that he may be gracious to us	1	Malachi is using the pronoun **us** to refer to himself and his listeners, so use the inclusive form of that word if your language marks that distinction. (If you are treating this as a direct quotation from Yahweh, you may use the plural form of “you.”)
1:9	p1j6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	This has been	1	The pronoun **This** refers to the unacceptable sacrifices. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “These unacceptable sacrifices have been”
1:9	s7f2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	from your hand	1	Malachi is using one part of the priests, their **hand**, to mean all of them in the act of offering sacrifices. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “from you”
1:9	f2g9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	from your hand	1	Since Malachi is referring to a group of people, it might be more natural in your language to use the plural form of **hand**. Alternate translation: “from your hands”
1:9	i5h9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	Will he lift up your faces?	1	See how you translated the similar expression in [1:8](../01/08.md).
1:9	r3n8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	Will he lift up your faces?	1	Yahweh is using the question form for emphasis. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “He certainly will not lift your faces!” or “He will certainly not show you favor!”
1:10	u9w2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	Who even among you will shut the doors, that you might not kindle {fire} on my altar in vain?	1	Yahweh is using the question form for emphasis. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “I wish one of you would shut the temple doors so that you would not kindle useless fires on my altar!”
1:10	e3m7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	the doors	1	Yahweh assumes that his listeners will know that by **the doors** he means the doors of the temple. You could say that explicitly if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “the temple doors”
1:10	c8n2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	an offering from your hand	1	Since Yahweh is referring to a group of people, it might be more natural in your language to use the plural form of **hand**. Alternate translation: “offerings from your hands”
1:10	s6p4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	from your hand	1	Yahweh is using one part of the priests, their **hand**, to mean all of them in the act of offering sacrifices. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “from you”
1:11	m2t7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	from the rising of the sun and unto its setting	1	Yahweh is using the **rising** and **setting** of the **sun** by association to mean the east and the west. Alternate translation: “from the east to the west”
1:11	m9r3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	from the rising of the sun and unto its setting	1	Yahweh is speaking of two extremes in order to include them and everything in between. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “everywhere in the world”
1:11	n4f8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	my name {will be} great	1	Yahweh is using the word **name** by association to mean his reputation. See how you translated the same expression in [1:6](../01/06.md). Alternate translation: “my reputation will be great”
1:11	s7h1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	to my name	1	Yahweh is using one part of himself, his **name**, to mean all of him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “to me”
1:12	p2k6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	But you are profaning it	1	The pronoun **it** refers to Yahweh’s name or reputation. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “But you are profaning my name” or “But you are making my reputation no more than ordinary”
1:12	o7j9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	The table of the Lord	1	See how you translated the same expression in [1:7](../01/07.md). Alternate translation: “The altar of the Lord”
1:12	h3k5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	the Lord	1	In the same phrase in [1:7](../01/07.md), the name “Yahweh” is used. Here a title, **the Lord**, is used instead. It may be that in the earlier instance Yahweh is speaking of himself in the third person, while in this instance Yahweh is quoting what the priests would say. (In order not to misuse his name, Jews would use this title instead.) Some versions of the Bible use their representation of the divine name here, since that is what the priests meant. Other versions use the title **Lord** to reflect this Jewish practice and the original text of the book. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of the ULT.
1:12	a4d7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	it {is} defiled	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “it is not holy” or “it is nothing special”
1:12	l5t2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	its fruit	1	Yahweh is speaking as if the altar were a tree that produced **fruit**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “what we get from it”
1:12	e7n5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	its food	1	Yahweh assumes that his listeners will know that by **its food** he means the food allowance the priests receive from the altar. You could say that explicitly if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “our food allowance”
1:12	p9f3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	is despised	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “is contemptible”
1:13	m3h8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	Behold	1	The priests are speaking as if they literally wanted their listeners to **Behold** or look at something. They are using this term to focus their listeners’ attention on what they are about to say. Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation.
1:13	x6r2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	what a weariness	1	The priests are using a phrase that expresses a strong feeling of tiredness or boredom. There may be an equivalent word or phrase in your language that you can use in your translation to convey this same feeling. You could also state what the priests were feeling. Alternate translation: “what drudgery” or “we are tired of doing this”
1:13	s2k9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	And you puff at it	1	In this culture, to **puff** at something, blowing a small breath at it, was a symbolic action that showed contempt. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express this in terms of an action that has the same significance in your culture. You could also state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “And you sniff at it” or “And you show contempt for it”
1:13	g7n4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	the torn and the lame and the sick	1	Yahweh is not referring to specific **torn**, **lame**, or **sick** animals. He means animals with these conditions in general. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using plural forms. Alternate translation: “torn animals, lame animals, and sick animals”
1:13	r9t5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	Should I accept this from your hand?	1	Yahweh is using the question form for emphasis. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “I will certainly not accept this from you!”
1:14	e2f7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-events	But cursed {be} the deceiver if a male is in his flock and he vows {it}, but he sacrifices the blemished to the Lord	1	Yahweh is describing one event before describing another event that would precede it. In your translation, you may wish to relate these events in the order in which they would happen. Alternate translation: “But if someone has a male in his flock and he vows it, but he sacrifices the blemished to the Lord, then that deceiver will be cursed”
1:14	p8m3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	But cursed be	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “But I will curse”
1:14	e5k1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	if a male is in his flock	1	Yahweh assumes that his listeners will know that by **a male**, he means a healthy, unblemished male animal. You could say that explicitly if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “if a healthy, unblemished male is in his flock”
1:14	g3n9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	the blemished	1	Yahweh is not referring to a specific **blemished** animal. He means blemished animals in general. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using a plural form. Alternate translation: “blemished animals”
1:14	t7r2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	to the Lord	1	Yahweh is speaking about himself in the third person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this in the first person. Alternate translation: “to me”
1:14	s4h6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	and my name is feared among the nations	1	Yahweh is using one part of himself, his **name**, to mean all of him in the act of being feared. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and I am feared among the nations because of my reputation”
2:intro	jc2b				0	# Malachi 2 General Notes\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Levites\n\nThe priests are given a strong warning in this chapter. They have not followed the law of Moses and have led the people in the wrong direction. Yahweh has not accepted their sacrifices. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/priest]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]])\n\n### Marital unfaithfulness\n\nBecause the Jews lived under a covenantal arrangement with Yahweh, their relationship is described using the imagery of a marriage. Marital unfaithfulness indicates a person’s unfaithfulness to Yahweh. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/covenant]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/faithful]] and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:1	j8l1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	And now	1	See how you translated the same expression in [1:9](../01/09.md).
2:2	k2n6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	you will not listen	1	In contexts such as this, the word translated as **listen** has the specific sense of complying with what someone has said. Alternate translation: “you will not obey”
2:2	o1q7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	you will not set {it} upon the heart & you are not setting {this} upon the heart	1	This is an expression that people of this culture would commonly use to mean to take something seriously or to pay attention to it. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “you will not take it seriously … you are not taking this seriously” or “you will not pay attention to it … you are not paying attention to this”
2:2	u4w8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	to my name	1	Yahweh is using one part of himself, his **name**, to mean all of him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “to me”
2:2	v7x3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	then I will send a curse upon you	1	Yahweh is speaking as if a **curse** were literally an object that he could **send**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I will curse you”
2:2	y9z5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	your blessings	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **blessings**, you could express the same idea in another way. This term could mean: (1) the blessings that the priests spoke to the Israelites. Alternate translation: “I will make ineffective what you say to bless the Israelites” (2) with the sense of “gift,” the portion of the people’s tithes, atonement money, and sacrifices that the priests received.

2:5	n7q1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	was with him & to him & and he feared me & he was dismayed	1	Since Yahweh is referring to a group of people, it might be more natural in your language to use the plural form.

2:6	a9d2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	and iniquity was not found on his lips	1	The people of this culture commonly said that something **was … found** to mean that it existed.

If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “he influenced many to stop committing iniquity”
2:6	m1j7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	from iniquity	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **iniquity**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “from doing what is wrong”
2:7	a5n9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	the lips of a priest should guard knowledge	1	Yahweh is using one part of a priest, his **lips**, to mean all of him in the act of speaking.

2:7	a8k4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	they should seek	1	The pronoun **they** refers to people in general. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “people should seek”

2:7	o5q2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	{is} the messenger of Yahweh of Armies	1	Yahweh is speaking about himself in the third person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this in the first person. Alternate translation: “is the messenger of me, Yahweh of Armies”
2:8	r7s4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	But you yourselves have turned from the way	1	See how you translated the similar image in [2:6](../02/06.md). Alternate translation: “But you yourselves have stopped living as I want people to live”
2:8	m9t2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	You have caused many to stumble	1	Yahweh is speaking as if the priests had literally caused people to **stumble** or trip and fall.

2:9	m7t3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	and you are lifting faces	1	See how you translated the similar expression in [1:8](../01/08.md). Alternate translation: “and you are showing favoritism”
2:9	i9k2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	regarding the instruction	1	Yahweh assumes that the priests will know that in this instance, the expression **the instruction** implicitly means the law of Moses and how the priests have been applying it in individual cases. (Elsewhere in the chapter, the term has a more general meaning.) You could say that explicitly if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “regarding how you apply the law of Moses”
2:10	e5n8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	{Is} not one father to all of us? Did not one God create us?	1	Malachi is using the question form for emphasis. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate these questions as statements or as exclamations.

2:10	t1u6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	{Is} not one father to all of us? Did not one God create us?	1	These two phrases mean basically the same thing. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine them. However, since the first uses an image and the second explains the image, you might keep both phrases in your translation and show how the second explains the first. Alternate translation: “The same God created all of us. And so it is as if we all have the same father.”
2:10	w3y7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	Why do we deal treacherously, a man against his brother, to profane the covenant of our fathers?	1	Malachi is using the question form for emphasis. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation.

2:10	z1b4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	a man against his brother	1	This is an expression that people of this culture would commonly use to mean that people were acting against others of their own community.

2:10	d1f3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	our fathers	1	Malachi is speaking of the ancestors of the Israelites as if they were the **fathers** of the current generation. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “our ancestors”

2:11	l3n6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	Judah has dealt treacherously & Judah has profaned	1	Since Malachi is referring to a group of people, it might be more natural in your language to use the plural form. Alternate translation: “The people of Judah have dealt treacherously … The people of Judah have profaned”
2:11	q5s9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	and an abomination has been done in Israel and in Jerusalem	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “and the people have done something detestable in Israel and in Jerusalem”
2:11	u1w4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	and has married the daughter of a foreign god	1	Malachi is speaking as if foreign gods had **daughters** that the people of Judah could **marry**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. This could mean: (1) that the Judeans have allied themselves closely with foreign gods as their worshipers, as if they had made a marriage alliance the way kingdoms did. Alternate translation: “and has worshiped foreign gods” (2) that Judean men have married foreign women, and this has led them to worship foreign gods. Alternate translation: “and Judean men have married foreign women and begun to worship their gods”
2:12	x3z7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	cut off from the tents of Jacob	1	Malachi is describing the people of Israel by association with their ancestor, **Jacob**, who was also known as Israel. Alternate translation: “cut off from the tents of the people of Israel”
2:12	b5d8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	cut off from the tents of Jacob	1	This is an expression that people of this culture would commonly use to mean to remove someone from the community. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “remove from the community of Israel”
2:12	f9h3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	from the tents of Jacob	1	Malachi is using the word **tents** by association to mean the community of **Israel**. Alternate translation: “from the community of Israel”
2:12	j3l6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	the man	1	Here the masculine term **man** has a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use language in your translation that is clearly inclusive of both men and women. Alternate translation: “anyone”
2:12	n1q4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	the one being awake and the one answering	1	Malachi is speaking of two extremes in order to include them and everything in between. He is alluding to a watchman guarding a city at night (**the one being awake**) and someone approaching the city who is responding to the challenge, “Who is there?” (**the one answering**). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “no matter who he is”
2:13	r3t7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	covering the altar of Yahweh {with} tears	1	Malachi is making an overstatement for emphasis. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the emphasis in a different way. Alternate translation: “weeping profusely at the altar of Yahweh”
2:13	v5x8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	turning to the offering or taking {it} with favor {from} your hand	1	These two phrases mean basically the same thing. Malachi uses them together to emphasize how Yahweh is rejecting the offerings. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine these phrases. Alternate translation: “accepting your offerings favorably”
2:13	y7z1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	turning to the offering	1	This is an expression that people of this culture would commonly use to mean to pay attention to or accept something. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “accepting the offering”
2:13	c3d6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	{from} your hand	1	Malachi is using one part of the people, their **hand**, to mean all of them in the act of offering sacrifices. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “from you”
2:14	g1i4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	Yahweh is a witness between you and between the wife of your youth	1	Malachi assumes that the Judeans will know that when he refers to Yahweh as a **witness** to the covenant promises that they made when they married their wives, he means that Yahweh is holding them to those promises, which was a role of witnesses in this culture, by showing his disfavor by not accepting their offerings. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “Because Yahweh is enforcing the covenant promises you made to the wife of your youth”
2:14	k5m8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	you & your & you yourself	1	The words **you**, **your**, and **yourself** are singular in this verse because even though Malachi is speaking to the Judeans as a group, he is addressing an individual situation. So use singular forms in your translation if your language marks that distinction.
2:14	o3q6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	the wife of your youth	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **youth**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “the wife you married when you were young”
2:15	s1u4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	And did he not make one, and a remnant of spirit {was} to him?	1	Malachi is using the question form for emphasis. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. See the General Notes to this chapter for a discussion of what this sentence may mean and how you might translate it.
2:15	w5y8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	And why one? {He was} seeking seed of God	1	Malachi is not asking the question **And why one?** to get information. Rather, he is asking and then answering his own question. This was a common practice of Jewish public speakers in this time period (and also in New Testament times). Alternate translation: “And I will tell you why he made one: he was seeking seed of God”
2:15	z3b6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	seed of God	1	Malachi is using this possessive form to mean offspring that would be faithful to God. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “offspring that would be faithful to God”
2:15	d5f8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	So guard yourselves in your spirit	1	Malachi is speaking as if a person’s **spirit** were a physical place where they could be **guarded**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “So be careful about your attitudes”
2:16	h3j6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	and one {who} covers over his garment with violence	1	Malachi is speaking as if **violence** were literally a substance with which could cover a **garment**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. The idea of complete covering conveys emphasis. Alternate translation: “and one who acts very violently”
2:17	l7n1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	with your words	1	Yahweh is using the term **words** by association to mean what the people are saying. Alternate translation: “by what you are saying”
2:17	q9s2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	the doers of evil	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **evil**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “people who do evil things”
2:17	u3w6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	in the eyes of Yahweh	1	Malachi is using the word **eyes** by association to mean sight. Sight, in turn, represents judgment and perspective. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “in Yahweh’s perspective”
2:17	x7z1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	Where {is} the God of justice?	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **justice**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “Where is the God who judges fairly?”
2:17	b9d2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	Where {is} the God of justice?	1	The people are using the question form for emphasis. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “God is not punishing people who are not acting justly”
3:intro	wb48				0	# Malachi 3 General Notes\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Messiah\n\nThere are several prophecies in this chapter concerning the Messiah and the one who comes before the Messiah. At times, this chapter switches between prophesying about the first coming of the Messiah and the second coming of the Messiah without formal divisions between them. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/christ]])\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Rhetorical questions\n\nSeveral rhetorical questions are used in this chapter to convince the reader of the truth of what he is saying and of their sin. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])
3:1	f5h8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	Behold me, sending	1	This is an expression that people of this culture would commonly use to mean that they were about to do something. See how you translated the similar expression in [2:3](../02/03.md). Alternate translation: “Now I am about to send”
3:1	j7l1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	and he will prepare the way to my face	1	Yahweh is using the word **face** to mean his presence, by association with the way people can see the face of someone who is present. Alternate translation: “and he will prepare the way for me to be present among you”
3:1	n3q6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	and he will prepare the way to my face	1	Yahweh is speaking of his coming as if it were a journey for which a **way** needed to be prepared. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and he will get things ready for my coming”
3:1	r5t8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	behold	1	Yahweh uses this word to get the people’s attention. See how you translated a similar use of this word in [1:13](../01/13.md). Alternate translation: “pay attention”
3:2	v7x1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	But who {will be} enduring the day of his coming? And who {will be} the one standing in his appearing? For he {will be} like the fire of a refiner and like the soap of launderers.	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “He will be like the fire of a refiner and like the soap of launderers. So who will be able to endure the day of his coming? And who will be able to stand when he appears?”
3:2	y1z4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	But who {will be} enduring the day of his coming? And who {will be} the one standing in his appearing?	1	Yahweh is using the question form for emphasis. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “No one will be able to endure the day of his coming! No one will be able to stand when he appears!”
3:2	c5d8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	But who {will be} enduring the day of his coming? And who {will be} the one standing in his appearing?	1	These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. It may be clearer in your language to connect the phrases with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: “No one will be able to endure the day of his coming! Indeed, no one will be able to stand when he appears!”
3:2	g3i6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	{will be} the one standing	1	Yahweh is using the image of **standing** to speak of a person being declared innocent. The idea is that if he were declared guilty, that would be like a weight too heavy for the person to carry, and the person would sink down under it. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “will be declared innocent”
3:2	k7m1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	he {will be} like the fire of a refiner and like the soap of launderers	1	The point of this comparison is that just as fire refines metal and soap cleans clothes, so the messenger will purify the people, that is, he will help them forsake the sins they have been committing. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “just as fire refines metal and soap cleans clothes, he will purify people by helping them stop sinning”
3:3	o5q8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	And he will sit refining and purifying silver	1	Yahweh is speaking as if the messenger were literally going to be a metalworker who was **refining** and **purifying** precious metals. Since he expresses this same image as a comparison in the next clause, you may wish to present it as a comparison here as well. Alternate translation: “Yes, in that way he will be like someone who sits refining and purifying silver”
3:3	s3u6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	the sons of Levi	1	Yahweh is speaking as if these priests were literally something the **sons** of their ancestor **Levi**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the descendants of Levi who are priests”
3:3	w7y1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	and refine them like gold and like silver	1	The point of this comparison is that just as gold and silver are refined to remove impurities, so the messenger will purify the people. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “and he will purify the people from sin just as gold and silver are refined to remove impurities from them”
3:4	z5b8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	Then the offering of Judah and Jerusalem	1	Since Yahweh is referring to a group of people, it might be more natural in your language to use the plural form. Alternate translation: “Then the offerings of the people of Judah and Jerusalem”
3:4	d7f1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	as {in} the days of old and as {in} former years	1	These two phrases mean basically the same thing. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine these phrases. Alternate translation: “as in ancient times”
3:5	h5j8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against the ones swearing to a lie, and against the ones oppressing the wage of the hired worker, the widow, and the orphan, and the ones turning aside the foreigner, and they do not fear me	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “against those who, because they do not fear me, are sorcerers or adulterers or swear to a lie or oppress the wage of the hired worker, the widow, and the orphan or turn aside the foreigner”
