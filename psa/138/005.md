# Yahweh is high, yet he cares for the lowly

Yahweh is above all creation in power, position, and authority. Yet his interest is in those who are humble in spirit, servants to all. This is a simple contrast.

# the proud he knows from far off

This expression probably means that God is not faithful to those who are proud. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
