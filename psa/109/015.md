# May their guilt always be before Yahweh

Here David speaks about Yahweh thinking about their guilt as if their guilt is something physically present before him. Alternate translation: "May Yahweh continually think about their sins" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# may Yahweh cut off their memory from the earth

David uses the word "earth" to refer to all the people that live on the earth. Also, the phrase "their memory" refers to people remembering them after they have died. Alternate translation: "may Yahweh make it so that no one on earth remembers them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
