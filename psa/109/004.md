# In return for my love

"Although I loved them"

# my love

"my love for them"

# they accuse me

The word "they" refers to the people who are wicked and deceitful. You may need to make explicit that those who accuse the psalmist do so falsely. AT: "they accuse me falsely" or "they slander me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
