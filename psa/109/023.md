# I am fading away like the shadow ... like a locust

David feels like he is going to die soon and describes this feeling by comparing himself to a fading shadow and to how the wind blows away locust. Alternate translation: "I feel like I am about to die, like an evening shadow that will soon disappear, like a locust is easily blown away by the wind" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
