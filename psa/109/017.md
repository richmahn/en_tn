## translationNotes

* **may it come back upon him** - "may his curses come upon him"
* **He clothed himself...into his bones** - David uses these images to emphasize that curses filled every part of the man, even the innermost part of him. AT: "Curses became part of who he was and all he could do was curse other people." (See:5. Clothing is Moral Quality and 6. A Liquid is a Moral Quality in [[en:ta:workbench:translate:biblicalimagery]] )
* ** as his garment** - "as if they were his clothing."
* **came into his inner being** - "entered into his body"
* **like oil into his bones** - AT: "curses went into his bones like oil goes into bones." The bones are the innermost part of a person. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
