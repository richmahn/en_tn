# to rule by day

The sun is spoken of as if it were a king. Alternate translation: "to mark the time of day" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# for his covenant faithfulness endures forever

The abstract noun "faithfulness" can be translated with an adjective. See how you translated this in [Psalms 136:1](./001.md). Alternate translation: "because he remains faithful to his covenant forever" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
