# called us to mind

"thought about us"

# helped us in our humiliation

The condition of feeling shame is spoken of as if it were a place that the Israelites had been in. This is a reference to the many times when the Israelites' enemies had defeated them in battle and shamed them. Alternate translation: "cared when we were shamed" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
