# those who seek him, those who seek the face of the God of Jacob

Both statements mean the same thing. They both refer to those who go to the temple to worship God. Alternate translation: "the ones who approach God, they are the ones who may worship God, the one we Israelites worship" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# those who seek him

Going to the temple to worship Yahweh is spoken of as if the person is literally seeking to find him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the face of the God of Jacob

Here "face" stands for the whole person. Alternate translation: "the God of Jacob" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
