# your angry judgment against humanity will bring you praise

Possible meanings are 1) "people will praise you because you are angry at the wicked and judge them" or 2) "people who are angry with you will do things that cause people to praise you."

# you gird yourself with what is left of your anger

Yahweh's anger is spoken of as something that he can tie around himself like a belt. Alternate translation: "you tie your remaining anger around you like a belt" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
