# General Information:

Asaph speaks of God as if God was a soldier returning from a mountain after winning a great battle.

# You shine brightly and reveal your glory

The second phrase strengthens the first phrase in that Yahweh's glory relates to Yahweh shining brightly. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# You shine brightly

The words "shine brightly" are a metaphor for being great. AT: "You show how extremely great you are" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
