## A song of ascents ##

See how you translated this in [Psalms 120:1](../120/001.md)

## I lift up my eyes ##

Here the author refers to his eyes because that is the part of the body used for seeing. AT: "I look to you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

## enthroned ##

sitting on a throne and ruling as king

## as the eyes of servants … as the eyes of a maid … so our eyes look … ##

These three phrases have similar meanings. The third phrase, about the Israelites, is being compared to how the servants and maids look to their masters and mistresses for help. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## maids ##

"servant girls"

## mistress ##

the woman who has authority over the servant girls
