# What can anyone do to me?

Here a question is used to show that the psalmist is not afraid of people, because they cannot seriously harm him. This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement. AT: "People can do nothing to me!" or "People cannot harm me badly!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
