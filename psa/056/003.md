# you

The word "you" refers to God.

# what can mere man do to me?

Here a question is used to show that the psalmist is not afraid of people, because they cannot seriously harm him. This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement. AT: "mere man can do nothing to me!" or "mere man cannot harm me badly!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# mere man

"just humans" or "people." This implies that people are not powerful, but God is powerful.
