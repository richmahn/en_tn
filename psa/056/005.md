# All the day long

"All the time"

# they twist my words

Repeating what someone says but changing it a little so that it means something different is spoken of as twisting their words. AT: "they say that I said things than I did not say" or "they claim that I said things, butÂ they lie" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# all their thoughts are against me for evil

"they always have evil thoughts against me" or "they always think of evil things to do to me"
