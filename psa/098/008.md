# Let the rivers clap their hands, and let the mountains shout for joy

The psalmist speaks as if the rivers and mountains were people who could clap and shout. Alternate translation: "Let it be as though the rivers are clapping their hands and mountains were shouting for joy" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
