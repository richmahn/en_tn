# his right hand and his holy arm have

The words "right hand" and "holy arm" refer to Yahweh's strength. Together they emphasize how great his strength is. AT: "his very great power has" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# right hand

the more powerful and skilled hand

# holy arm

Here "arm" is a metonym for power. AT: "the power that is his alone" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# have given him victory

This can be restated to remove the abstract noun "victory." AT: "have enabled him to be victorious over his enemies" or "has enabled him to defeat his enemies" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# made known his salvation

The abstract noun "salvation" can be translated using the verb "save." AT: "showed people that he saves his people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# showed his justice to all the nations

The abstract noun "justice" can be translated using the adjective "just." The word "nations" is a metonym for "the people who live in all the nations." AT: "showed the people who live in all the nations that he is just" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
