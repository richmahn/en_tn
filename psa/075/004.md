# I said to the arrogant ... and to the wicked

The words "the arrogant" and "the wicked" are nominal adjectives that can be translated with nouns. The verb for the second phrase may be supplied from the first. Alternate translation: "I said to the arrogant people ... and I said to the wicked people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# I said

Possible meanings are 1) God is speaking or 2) Asaph is speaking.

# Do not be arrogant ... Do not lift

The speaker is speaking to many wicked people, so these forms are plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pronouns]])

# Do not lift up the horn

Asaph speaks of wicked people as if they were animals with horns on their heads, stretching their necks and holding their heads high to frighten other animals. Alternate translation: "Do not be confident" or "Do not boast about how strong you are" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
