# It is not from the east ... that lifting up comes

Asaph speaks of the one who lifts up as if he were the action of lifting up. He also speaks of God giving strength and honor to a person as if God were physically lifting that person up. Alternate translation: "The one who will lift you up will not be someone who comes from the east" or "The one who will make you strong and have people honor you will not be someone who comes from the east" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
