Asaph speaks about God.

# he brings down and he lifts up

The objects of the verbs can be stated clearly: "he brings some people down and he lifts other people up." The words "brings down" and "raises up" are metaphors for God making people powerful and taking away their power. AT: "he makes one man king in place of another man" or "he takes away one man's power and gives power to another man" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
