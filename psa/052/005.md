# take you up ... pluck you ... root you

All three of these phrases are different ways of saying "remove you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# root you out of the land of the living

Being alive on earth is spoken of as if people are plants with roots in the ground. God killing someone is spoken of as digging up the plant's roots and taking it out of the ground. AT: "he will take you out the land of the living" or "He will kill you so that you will no longer be on earth with living people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Selah

This may be a musical term that tells people how to sing or play their instruments here. Some translations write the Hebrew word, and some translations do not include it. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate]])
