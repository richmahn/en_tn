# seen sin

"loved sin" or "held iniquity"

# would not have listened to me

Here "would not have listened" implies that God would not have answered his prayer. This can be made clear in the translation. AT: "would not have heard me call out to him" or "he would not have answered my prayer" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
