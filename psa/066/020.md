# who has not turned away my prayer

Here "turned away' represents ignoring his prayer. Alternate translation: "who has not ignored my prayer"

# or his covenant faithfulness from me

The phrase "has not turned away" is understood from the previous phrase and can be repeated here. The idea of "his covenant faithfulness" can be translated with the phrase "being faithful to his covenant." Alternate translation: "and has not turned away his covenant faithfulness from me" or "and has not stopped being faithful to his covenant with me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
