# General Information:

Parallelism is common in Hebrew poetry. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
In much of this psalm, David writes as if he were a sheep and the Lord were his shepherd. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])

# Yahweh is my shepherd

The writer speaks about Yahweh as if he were a shepherd. This emphasizes how God cares for people as a shepherd cares for his sheep. AT: "Yahweh is like a shepherd to me" or "Yahweh cares for me as a shepherd cares for his sheep" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# I will lack nothing

This can be stated in positive form. AT: "I have everything that I need" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
