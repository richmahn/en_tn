This psalm continues to tell about how God cares for us as a shepherd cares for his sheep.

## though I walk through a valley of darkest shadow ##

A dark valley is a very dangerous place. "Though my life is like walking through a dark and dangerous valley" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## I will not fear harm ##

"I will not be afraid of being hurt"

## your rod and your staff comfort me ##

The rod and staff represent protection because shepherds use them to protect their sheep from danger. AT: "I am not afraid because you protect me like a shepherd who protects his sheep with his rod and staff" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]]
