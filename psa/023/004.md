# General Information:

This psalm continues to tell about how God cares for us as a shepherd cares for his sheep. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])

# Even though I walk through a valley of darkest shadow

The writer describes a person experiencing terrible trouble as if he were a sheep walking through a dark and dangerous valley. There a sheep could get lost or attacked by a wild animal. AT: "Though my life is like walking through a dark and dangerous valley" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# I will not fear harm

The abstract noun "harm" can be stated as a verb. AT: "I will not be afraid of something harming me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# you are with me

Here "you" refers to Yahweh. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# your rod and your staff comfort me

The rod and staff represent protection because shepherds use them to protect their sheep from danger. AT: "I am not afraid because you protect me like a shepherd who protects his sheep with his rod and staff" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
