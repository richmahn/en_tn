# General Information:

This psalm continues to tell about how God cares for us as a shepherd cares for his sheep. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])

# He brings back my life

This means God makes a person who is weak and tired to be strong and rested again.

# he guides me along right paths

Showing a person how to live in a way that pleases God is spoken of as if it were a shepherd showing a sheep the right path to take. AT: "He shows me how to live right" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# for his name's sake

The phrase "his name" here refers to his reputation. AT: "for his reputation" or "so that people will honor him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
