This psalm continues to tell about how God cares for us as a shepherd cares for his sheep.

## he guides me along right paths ##

The word "paths" represents how a person lives. AT: "he shows me how to live right" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## for his name's sake ##

The phrase "his name" here refers to his reputation. AT: "for his reputation" or "so that people will honor him"
