Now the psalm tells how God is like someone who welcomes a guest into his home and protects him.

## You prepare a table ##

A table represents a feast because people would put all the food on a table. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## anointed my head with oil ##

People sometimes put oil on their guest's heads in order to honor them.

## my cups runs over ##

Here a cup of wine that overflows represents many blessings. AT: "You fill my cup so much that it overflows" or "You give me many blessings" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
