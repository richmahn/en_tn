# General Information:

Now the writer tells how God is like someone who welcomes a guest into his home and protects him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])

# You prepare a table

A table represents a feast because people would put all the food on a table. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# in the presence of my enemies

The meaning here is that the writer is not worried about his enemies because he is an honored guest of the Lord and therefore protected from harm. Alternate translation: "despite the presence of my enemies"

# anointed my head with oil

People sometimes put oil on their guests' heads in order to honor them.

# my cup runs over

Here a cup of wine that overflows represents many blessings. Alternate translation: "You fill my cup so much that it overflows" or "You give me many blessings" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
