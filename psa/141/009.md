# the snares that they have laid for me

The psalmist speaks of deceiving a good man so the good man will sin or so that the evil people can defeat him as if it were laying a trap for an animal. The word "snares" is a metonym for the people themselves. AT: "people who are looking for ways to harm me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# snares ... traps

Bible experts disagree on the exact meanings of these words. It would be best either to translate one of them with the word for a net or cage that contains the prey and the other as a rope or vine that catches the prey by the leg or neck or to translate both with the general word for "traps." See how these words are translated in [Psalms 140:5](../140/005.md).

# from the traps of evildoers

The verb may be supplied from the previous phrase. AT: "and protect me from the traps that those who do evil have set" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
