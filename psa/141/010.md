# Let the wicked fall into their own nets

The psalmist speaks of evil people deceiving good people as if hunters were trapping animals. AT: "Let the wicked fall into the net traps they have made to trap other people" or "Let the bad things the wicked planned for the righteous happen to the wicked instead"
