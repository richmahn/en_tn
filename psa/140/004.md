## translationNotes

* **set a trap ... spread a net ... set a snare** - The exact kinds of traps are less important than the idea that the "wicked ... violent men" are planning to trap the writer. If your readers do not know much about trapping, you may need to reduce this down to one line, as the UDB reduces two lines of ULB to one in [[:en:bible:notes:psa:140:001]]. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
* **trap** - This is a trap designed to catch birds.
* **net** - trap made of ropes
* **snare** - trap that attracts the victim
