# the hands of the wicked

That is, the power of the wicked (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# set a trap ... spread a net ... set a snare

The exact kinds of traps are less important than the idea that the "wicked ... violent men" are planning to make trouble for the psalmist. If your readers do not know much about trapping, you may need to reduce this down to one line, as the UDB reduces two lines of ULB to one in [Psalms 140:3](./001.md).
