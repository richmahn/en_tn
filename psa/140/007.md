# you shield my head in the day of battle

A person's head is in great danger during battle. Protecting the person's head represents protecting the whole person. AT: "you protect me when I go to war" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# battle

Here "battle" probably stands for any kind of severe trouble (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
