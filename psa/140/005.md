# have set a trap ... have spread a net ... have set a snare

The exact kinds of traps are less important than the idea that wicked and proud people are planning to make trouble for the psalmist. If your readers do not know much about different ways of trapping, you may need to reduce this to one line. Alternate translation: "have set a trap to catch me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
