## listen to my cries ##

See how you translated this in [Psalms 5:1](../005/001.md)

## you shield my head in the day of battle ##

AT: "you protect me when I go to war" (See [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## do not grant the desires of the wicked ##

"please do not allow wicked people to have what they desire"
