# General Information:

There is a shift here to the second person. This may mean 1) the writer begins speaking to the people of Israel or 2) the writer is quoting another person speaking to the writer. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# your foot to slip

The slipping of a foot is associated with falling. Alternate translation: "you to fall" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# he who protects you will not slumber

Here to "slumber" means he would stop protecting. The negative form strengthens the statement. Alternate translation: "God will not fall asleep and stop protecting you" or "God will always protect you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])

# he who protects you

God

# will not slumber ... never slumbers or sleeps

These two phrases have similar meanings. The second one strengthens the thought in the first. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
