## from all evil ##

AT: "from all evil things" or "from being harmed" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## Yahweh will protect you from all harm, and he will protect your life ##

These two clauses have similar meanings. The second one strengthens the thought in the first. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
