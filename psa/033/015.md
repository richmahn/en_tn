# shapes the hearts of them all

Here "hearts" refers to the thinking of these people. The writer speaks of Yahweh guiding the thinking of the people as if he were a potter who was shaping a bowl. Alternate translation: "guides their thinking as a potter shapes a bowl" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
