# May Yahweh, the God of Israel, be praised

This can be stated in active form. AT: "May people praise Yahweh the God of Israel" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# from everlasting to everlasting

This refers to two extremes and means for all time. See how you translated this in [Psalms 41:13](../041/013.md). AT: "for all eternity" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
