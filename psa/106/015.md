# but he sent a horrible disease

Here David speaks about Yahweh causing the people to be afflicted by a disease as if Yahweh sent a disease to them in the same way that someone sends a person or a messenger. Alternate translation: "but he caused them to suffer from a horrible disease" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# a horrible disease

a disease that caused people to slowly become weak and caused some of them to die
