# he will take nothing away

"he will take nothing with him to the grave"

# his glory will not go down after him

The phrase "go down" refers to when the man dies. Alternate translation: "his glory will not go along with him when he dies" or "he will not keep his reputation when he dies" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
