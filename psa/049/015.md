# God will redeem my life from the power of Sheol

The writer speaks of Sheol as if it were a person who has power over those who die. From the context, it is implied that this power refers to consuming the bodies of the dead. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# God will redeem my life

Here the word "life" refers to the whole person. Alternate translation: "God will redeem me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
