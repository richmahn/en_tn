# It is certain that no one

"There is no way that any of them can" or Alternate translation: "No one can"

# no one can redeem his brother or give God a ransom for him

Both of these phrases express that a person cannot give God enough money to be able to avoid death. Alternate translation: "no one can pay money to God so that their brother will not die" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
