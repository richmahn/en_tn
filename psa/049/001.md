# General Information:

Parallelism is common in Hebrew poetry. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# For the chief musician

"This is for the director of music to use in worship"

# Hear this, all you peoples; give ear, all you inhabitants

These two phrases are parallel. Together they strengthen the command for all people to listen. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# give ear

This idiomatic expression means to use one's ears to listen. Alternate translation: "listen" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
