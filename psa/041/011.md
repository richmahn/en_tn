# By this I know that you delight in me, for my enemy does not triumph over me

The word "this" refers to what the writer will say next. For clarity, the clauses may be reversed. Alternate translation: "Because my enemy does not triumph over me, I know that you delight in me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-events]])

# By this I know that you delight in me, for my enemy does not triumph over me

This can also be translated in future tense, since Yahweh has not yet healed him. Alternate translation: "If you enable me to do that, with the result that my enemies do not defeat me, I will know that you are pleased with me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
