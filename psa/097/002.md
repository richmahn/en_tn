# Clouds and darkness surround him

"We cannot see him; it is as if he were sitting in the dark with clouds all around him"

# Righteousness and justice are the foundation of his throne

The word "throne" is a metonym for the deeds and words of the one who sits on it. The psalmist speaks as if righteousness and justice were physical objects that made the throne secure. Alternate translation: "He is righteous and just in everything he does" or "He is able to rule because he rules righteously and justly" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the foundation of his throne

Here "the foundation of his throne" refers to how Yahweh rules his kingdom. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
