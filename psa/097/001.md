# let the earth rejoice; let the many coastlands be glad

Possible meanings are 1) "lands near the seas" or 2) "islands."

# Clouds and darkness surround him

# Righteousness and justice are the foundation of his throne

The word "throne" is a metonym for the deeds and words of the one who sits on it. The psalmist speaks as if righteousness and justice were physical objects that made the throne secure. AT: "He is righteous and just in everything he does" or "He is able to rule because he rules righteously and justly" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the foundation of his throne

Here "the foundation of his throne" refers to how Yahweh rules his kingdom. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
