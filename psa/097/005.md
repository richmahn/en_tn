# The mountains melt like wax before Yahweh

The writer speaks of the mountains crumbling before Yahweh as if they were wax that was exposed to a fire. Alternate translation: "The mountains are unable to stand as Yahweh comes near" or "The mountains crumble in Yahweh's presence" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
