# Offer the sacrifices of righteousness

"Offer the right sacrifices"

# put your trust in Yahweh

Here "trust" is spoken of as if it were an object that could be put somewhere. The abstract noun "trust" can be stated as a verb. Alternate translation: "trust in Yahweh" or "trust Yahweh" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
