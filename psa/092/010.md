# You have lifted up my horn like the horn of the wild ox

The psalmist speaks of God as if he had made him as strong as a wild animal. Here his "horn" represents his strength. AT: "You have made me as strong as a wild ox" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# I am anointed with fresh oil

Possible meanings are that the oil that God has put on the psalmist is a metaphor for God 1) making him happy "you have made me very happy" or 2) making him strong, "you have made me strong" or 3) enabling him to defeat his enemies, "you have enabled me to defeat my enemies." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
