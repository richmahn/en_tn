# to proclaim that

These words continue the thought begun  by the words "they stay fresh and green" in ([Psalms 92:14](../092/014.md)). Possible meanings are 1) "they stay fresh and green, so that they can proclaim" or 2) "they stay fresh and green. This shows that."

# He is my rock

"Yahweh is the one who protects me." The psalmist speaks of Yahweh as if he were a rock that would protect him. See how this is translated in [Psalms 18:2](../018/002.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
