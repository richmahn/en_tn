# General Information:

These verses are the same as those in [Psalms 60:6-7](../060/006.md).

# God has spoken in his holiness

Here David describes God speaking something because he is holy as speaking "in his holiness," as if his holiness were something that he was physically inside of. Alternate translation: "God, because he is holy, has said" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# I will divide Shechem and apportion out the Valley of Succoth

Here God is speaking about dividing the land of Shechem and the Valley of Succoth.
