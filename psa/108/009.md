# General Information:

These verses are the same as those in [Psalms 60:8-9](../060/008.md).

# Moab is my washbasin

God speaks of Moab being unimportant as if Moab were a washbasin or a lowly servant. AT: "Moab is like a bowl that I use for washing" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# over Edom I will throw my shoe

God was probably speaking of taking ownership of Edom as if he were symbolically throwing his shoe onto that land to show that he owns it. However some versions have other interpretations. AT: "I take ownership of the land of Edom" or "I throw my shoe onto the land of Edom to show that it is mine" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
