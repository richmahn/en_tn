# General Information:

These verses are the same as those in [Psalms 60:10-12](../060/010.md), but notice that 108:11 does not have the phrase "But you," like the beginning of 60:10.

# God, have you not rejected us?

The psalmist uses this question to express his sadness that it seems that God has rejected them. Alternate translation: "It seems like you have rejected us!" or "God, you seem to have abandoned us!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# You do not go into battle with our army

The psalmist speaks of God helping their army as if God were to go and fight with them. Alternate translation: "you do not help our army when we go into battle" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
