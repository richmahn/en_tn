# He will judge the world with righteousness ... he will execute judgment for the nations with fairness

These two clauses express the same meaning. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# He will judge the world with righteousness

Here "the world" refers to all the people in the world. Alternate translation: "He will judge all the people of the world righteously" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
