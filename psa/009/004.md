# you sit on your throne, a righteous judge

Kings had authority to judge people, and they would sit on their throne when they judged. David speaks as if God were an earthly king. Alternate translation: "you judge like a king who sits on his throne, and you are righteous" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
