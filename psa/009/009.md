# Yahweh also will be a stronghold for the oppressed

God is spoken of as if he were a place that people could go to for safety. Alternate translation: "Yahweh will also protect the oppressed" or "Yahweh will also provide safety for those who are oppressed" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
