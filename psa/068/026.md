# from the fountain of Israel

The word "fountain" is a metaphor for the ability of the man Israel to be the ancestor of many people: as much water comes from a fountain, so Israel is the ancestor of many people. This also implies that the call is to those who serve God as the man Israel did. AT: "true descendants of Israel" or "all of you descendants from Israel"(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
