# Kings of armies ... why did you do this?

The information in [Psalms 68:12-13](./011.md) has been rearranged so its meaning can be more easily understood. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge]])

# Kings of armies flee, they flee

The kings represent themselves and their entire armies. It is understood that they flee because they are defeated by Israel's army. Alternate translation: "Kings and their armies flee from us because they are defeated" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# plunder

things that are taken from the defeated army and brought to the victorious army's home.

# doves covered with silver ... gold

This means that some of the plunder is very valuable because it is covered with precious metals.

# When some of you people stayed among the sheepfolds, why did you do this?

This question is used to rebuke the people who did not participate in the battle. Alternate translation: "Those who stayed among the sheepfolds should not have stayed; they should have gone to the battle." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
