# General Information:

David begins to tell the story of God leading the Israelites through the desert to Mt. Sinai.

# when you went out ... when you marched through

These two phrases refer to the same event. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# you went out before your people

"you led your people"

# when you marched through the wilderness

God is spoken of as if he was a soldier marching ahead of the people of Israel. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
