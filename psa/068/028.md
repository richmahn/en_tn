# Your God, Israel, has decreed your strength

Some versions understand the Hebrew text differently: "Summon your strength, God" or "Use your strength, God"

# Your God, Israel, has decreed

"People of Israel, your God has decreed"

# to us ... to us

The word "us" refers to the writer and the people of Israel, but not to Yahweh, to whom he is speaking. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

# Reveal your power to us from your temple at Jerusalem

"When you are present in the temple at Jerusalem, show us your power"

# Reveal your power

The abstract noun "power" can be stated as "strong." AT: "Show us that you are strong" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
