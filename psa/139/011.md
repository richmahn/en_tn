## If I say, "Surely the darkness will hide me, and the night will be my light" ##

AT: The darkness could not hide me, and neither could the night"

AT: "The day and night are the same to God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

## for the darkness and the light are both alike  ##

AT: "because God's knowledge does depend on circumstances"
