# too much for me

"too much for me to understand"

# it is too high, and I cannot reach it

Being high and out of reach is an expression, in this case, about some knowledge that human beings cannot have. Alternate translation: "it is too difficult to understand" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
