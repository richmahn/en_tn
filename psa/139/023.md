# Examine me

This is a request for God to tell the psalmist about any sinful thoughts that he may have. AT: "Please search me" or "I beg you to search me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# Examine me, God, and know my heart; test me and know my thoughts

These two sentences have similar meanings. The second one strengthens the thought in the first. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
