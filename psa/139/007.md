# Where can I go from your Spirit? ... Where can I flee from your presence?

These two questions are in parallel. The psalmist says that he cannot go away from God's presence. Alternate translation: "I cannot escape from your Spirit." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
