# get away from me, you violent men

The psalmist is only pretending to speak directly to the violent men whom he has in mind. Translators may decide to express this command as a wish. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe]])

# They rebel against you

"They rebel against your authority, God"

# your enemies tell lies

"your enemies lie about you"
