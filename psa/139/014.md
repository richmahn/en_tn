# My soul knows this very well

Here "soul" probably refers to the psalmist's innermost ability to be certain about God's love and guidance. The translator may, however, treat "soul" here as metonymy for the psalmist's mind and heart. AT: "I know this with all my heart" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
