# If I fly away on the wings of the morning and go to live in the uttermost parts across the sea

The author uses exaggeration to explain that wherever he is, God is there too. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])

# If I fly away on the wings of the morning

In the ancient near east, the sun was often imagined as if it had wings which enabled it to fly across the sky. Alternate translation: "If the sun could carry me with itself across the sky" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# in the uttermost parts across the sea

"very far away to the west"
