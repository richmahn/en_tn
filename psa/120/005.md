# I temporarily live in Meshech; I lived previously among the tents of Kedar

These two places were far away from each other. The writer is likely using the names metaphorically to represent living among cruel and barbaric people. Alternate translation: "It is as if I live in Meshech or among the tents of Kedar" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the tents of Kedar

This phrase represents the people of Kedar who live in those tents. Alternate translation: "the people who live in Kedar" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
