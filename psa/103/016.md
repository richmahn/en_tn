# The wind blows over it, and it disappears ... where it once grew

These phrases continue to talk about flowers and grass. They compare how flowers and grass die to how man dies. Alternate translation: "The wind blows over the flowers and grass and they disappear, and no one can tell where they once grewâ€”it is the same way with man" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
