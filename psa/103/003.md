This is exaggeration. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]]) In some languages it is more  natural to say "many."

## you/your ##

Many translations express this with "I/me/my" as the UDB does.

## he crowns you with covenant faithfulness and acts of tender mercy. ##

AT: "he blesses you with his promised faithfulness and acts of mercy."

## your youth is renewed like the eagle ##

AT: "you are made strong like an eagle" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
