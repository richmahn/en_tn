# your ... you

Many translations express this with "my, I, me" as the UDB does.

# He redeems your life from destruction

This means that Yahweh keeps him alive. AT: "He saves me from dying" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# he crowns you with covenant faithfulness and acts of tender mercy

Here blessing someone and treating them with great honor is described as if it were placing a crown on that person's head. The abstract nouns "faithfulness" and "mercy" can be translated with adverbs. AT: "he blesses you by acting faithfully and mercifully towards you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# He satisfies your life with good things

The phrase "your life" refers to "you," but it emphasizes that Yahweh gives blessings throughout life. AT: "He satisfies you with good things through your life" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# your youth is renewed like the eagle

Having your "youth renewed" means to feel young again. Here David compares this feeling of youth to the swiftness and strength of an eagle. AT: "you feel young and are strong like an eagle" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# your youth

The word "youth" refers to the strength one had as a young adult. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
