# Everyone says ... everyone speaks

The two occurrences of "everyone" are exaggerations, used to emphasize that this is true of very many people. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# everyone speaks with flattering lips and a double heart

Here "lips" is a metonym for what people say, and "a double heart" is a metaphor for deception. AT: "everyone speaks with flattering words and deception" or "everyone praises people falsely and tells lies" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
