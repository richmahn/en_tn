# The locusts ate up all of the vegetation ... They ate up all the crops of the ground

These two phrase have basically the same meaning and are used together for emphasis. Alternate translation: "The insects ate all the plants and all the crops in the land" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
