# Connecting Statement:

The psalmist is writing about Israel.

# when they were only few in number

The word "they" refers to the Israelites.

# were strangers in the land

It is implied that "the land" refers to Canaan. AT: "were foreigners in the land of Canaan" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# They went from

"They continued to wander"

# from nation to nation and from one kingdom to another

These two phrases have similar meanings and are used together for emphasis. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
