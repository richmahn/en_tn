# Connecting Statement:

The psalmist is writing about Israel.

# for their sakes

"for their own well-being." This is referring to Israel.

# Do not touch my anointed ones

Here "touch" means to harm, it's an exaggeration Yahweh used to strengthen his warning to not harm his people. AT: "Do not harm the people I have anointed" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
