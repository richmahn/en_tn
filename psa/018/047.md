# the God who executes vengeance for me

To "execute vengeance" means to punish people for their evil actions. This can be restated to remove the abstract noun "vengeance." Alternate translation: "the God who punishes people for the evil things they have done to me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
