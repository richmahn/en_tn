# my hands were clean

To have "clean hands" means that one is innocent of wrongdoing. See how you translated this in [Psalms 18:20](./020.md): AT: "I was innocent" or "my actions were right" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# before his eyes

This refers to God's presence. AT: "before him" or "according to him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
