# For who is God except Yahweh? Who is a rock except our God?

The implied answer is no one. Alternate translation: "Only Yahweh is God! Only our God is a rock!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# a rock

David speaks of Yahweh as if he were a rock that he could climb to get away from his enemies. See how you translated this in [Psalms 18:2](./002.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
