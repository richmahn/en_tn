# Yahweh is my rock

David speaks of Yahweh as if he were a rock. The word "rock" is a picture of a safe place. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# my rock, my fortress

Here the words "rock" and "fortress" share similar meanings and emphasize that Yahweh provides safety from enemies. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# take refuge in him

Going to Yahweh for protection is spoken of as taking refuge in him. Alternate translation: "go to him for protection" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# my shield, the horn of my salvation, and my stronghold

David speaks of Yahweh as if he were a "shield," "the horn" of his salvation, and his "stronghold." Yahweh is the one who protects him from harm. Here a similar idea is repeated three ways for emphasis. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
