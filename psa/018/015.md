The Psalmist continues to speak of Yaweh's great power.

## Then the water channels appeared; the foundations of the world were exposed  ##

"the bottom of the ocean was seen" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## the foundations of the world were exposed at your battle cry, Yahweh ##

You, Yahweh, exposed the foundations of the world" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## blast of the breath of your nostrils ##

AT: "air forced out with strength through the nose."  Though God does not have human physical characteristics, this pictures his mighty strength. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
