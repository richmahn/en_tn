# He is a shield to everyone who takes refuge in him

A shield protects a soldier. David speaks as if God were a shield protecting him. See how you translated this in [Psalms 3:3](../003/003.md). Alternate translation: "You, Yahweh, protect like a shield everyone who takes refuge in you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
