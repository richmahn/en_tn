# is your goodness

This can be expressed with a verb. Alternate translation: "are the good things you do" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# that you have stored up

Yahweh's goodness is spoken of as if it was something that could be stored up like a harvest. Alternate translation: "that you are keeping ready to use" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# those who revere you

"those who respect you greatly"

# take refuge in you

Going to Yahweh for protection is spoken of as taking refuge in him. See how you translated this in [Psalms 31:1](../031/001.md). Alternate translation: "those who go to you for protection" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
