# Let us tear off the shackles ... throw off their chains

The people of other nations speak of Yahweh and the Messiah's rule over them as if it were shackles and chains. AT: "We should free ourselves from their control; we should not let them rule over us any longer" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
