# I myself

Yahweh is emphasizing that he, and not someone else, has anointed his king.

# anointed my king

"appointed my king to rule"

# I will announce a decree of Yahweh. He

The person saying this is the king. This can be stated clearly. AT: "The king says, 'I will announce a decree of Yahweh.' He" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# He said to me

"Yahweh said to me"

# You are my son! This day I have become your father

Among many peoples in that part of the world then, men could decide to legally adopt children, who would become their heirs. Here Yahweh adopts a man and makes him king of Israel. AT: "I make you my son. This day I have become your father" or "Now you are my son and am your father"
