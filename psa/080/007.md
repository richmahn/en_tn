# General Information:

Asaph is speaking on behalf of the people of Israel. He begins in verse 8 to speak of the way God settled Israel in their land as if God were a man clearing ground to plant a grapevine. If you need to translate the meaning of the story rather than the story itself, see how the UDB translates it.

# make your face shine on us

The writer speaks of Yahweh acting favorably towards them as if Yahweh's face shone a light on them. See how you translated this in [Psalms 80:3](./001.md). AT: "act favorably towards us" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# we will be saved

This can be stated in active form. AT: "you will save us" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# You brought a vine out of Egypt

Asaph compares the nation of Israel to a vine made ready to transplant. AT: "You brought us, like a vine, out of Egypt" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# you drove out nations and transplanted it

The psalmist speaks of his people as if they were a plant that Yahweh was transplanting. AT: "you drove out nations from their land and gave it to us, the vine, and planted us there" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
