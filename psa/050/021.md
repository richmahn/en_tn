# you thought that I was someone just like yourself

Since God had kept silent and not yet rebuked the wicked people for their actions, they thought that God approved of what they did. AT: "you thought that I was someone who acts just like you do" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# reprove

tell someone he is guilty of doing wrong

# bring up ... all the things you have done

God speaks of listing all of the evil things that they have done. AT: "list ... all the things you have done" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# right before your eyes

Here, to be "before your eyes" means that it is in a place where they can see. This means that they will not be able to deny the charges that God brings against them. AT: "right in front of you" or "so that you can not deny them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
