# the cattle on a thousand hills

The phrase "on a thousand hills" does not represent the total number of cattle that God owns. The number is an exaggeration that emphasizes that God owns all of the cattle in the world. The verb may be supplied from the previous phrase. Alternate translation: "all the cattle in the world are mine" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# thousand hills

"1,000 hills" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])
