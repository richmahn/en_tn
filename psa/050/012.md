# If I were hungry

This describes something that could not happen, since God does not get hungry. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])

# Will I eat the flesh of bulls or drink the blood of goats?

God asks this rhetorical question to emphasize that he does not do these things and so has no need for their sacrifices. AT: "I do not eat the flesh of bulls or drink the blood of goats." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
