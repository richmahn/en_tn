# What have you to do with declaring my statutes ... and throw my words away?

God uses this question to rebuke wicked people. This question can be turned into a statement. Alternate translation: "It does not make sense that you declare my statutes and my covenant, since you hate my instructions and throw away my words." or "It is not right for you to declare my statutes ... away." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# throw my words away

God speaks of the wicked people rejecting what he says as if they were throwing away trash. Alternate translation: "reject what I say" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
