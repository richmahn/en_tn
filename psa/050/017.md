# since you hate instruction and throw my words away

This is the end of the rhetorical question begun with the words "What have you to do" ([Psalms 50:16](./016.md). God uses this question to rebuke wicked people. This question can be turned into a statement: "It is not right for you to declare my statutes and my covenant, since you hate instruction and throw my words away." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# throw my words away

God speaks of the wicked people rejecting what he says as if they were throwing away trash. Alternate translation: "reject what I say" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
