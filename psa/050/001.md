This psalm is a song that teaches people.

# The Mighty One, God, Yahweh

The author uses three different names to speak of God.

# called the earth

Here the word "earth" refers to the people who live on the earth. Alternate translation: "called all people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# from the rising of the sun to its setting

This phrase refers to the directions east, where the sun rises, and west, where the sun sets. The writer uses these two extremes to represent everywhere on earth. Alternate translation: "everywhere on earth" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
