# You sit and speak against your brother; you slander your own mother's son

These two phrases have the same meaning but use different words. God accuses them of speaking falsely against members of their own family. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# You sit and speak

To "sit and speak" against someone implies that this person deliberately thinks of bad things to say about someone. Alternate translation: "You always think of ways to speak" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
