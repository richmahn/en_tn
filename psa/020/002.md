# send help from the holy place

God helping from his holy place is spoken of as if God were sending help. Alternate translation: "may Yahweh help you from his holy place" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# holy place ... Zion

Both of these refer to God's temple in Jerusalem. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
