# Yahweh, rescue the king

Possible interpretations are 1) the people ask God to protect the king or 2) the king continues to speak about himself in the third person.

# the king; help us when we call

Some translations understand the Hebrew differently. Some translate it as the people speaking to Yahweh their king. Alternate translation: "King, help us when we call you"
