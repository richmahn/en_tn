# Now

This word is used here to mark a break in the psalm. It transitions from the people speaking to the king speaking.

# I know

The word "I" probably refers to the king who is speaking in this section.

# his anointed one ... answer him ... rescue him

The king is speaking about himself in the third person. This can be stated in first person. AT: "me, his anointed one ... answer me ... rescue me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# from his holy heaven

God dwells in heaven as well as in the temple in Jerusalem. (See: [Psalms 20:2](./002.md))

# with the strength of his right hand that can rescue him

God's right hand represents his power. AT: "with his great strength he will rescue him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
