# They are of greater value than gold ... they are sweeter than honey

Yahweh's decrees are spoken of as if they could be bought and tasted. Alternate translation: "If you could buy them, they would be of greater value than gold ... if you could taste them, they would be sweeter than honey" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# even more than much fine gold

The word "valuable" is understood from the previous phrase and can be repeated. Alternate translation: "even more valuable than a lot of fine gold" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# fine gold

"pure gold" or "expensive gold"
