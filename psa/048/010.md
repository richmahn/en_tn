# As your name is ... so is your praise to the ends of the earth

Here the word "name" represents God's character and reputation. The two phrases compare the greatness of God's reputation with how greatly people praise him. AT: "Your name is very great ... and so people throughout the world praise you greatly" or "People all throughout the world have heard of you ... so people throughout the world praise you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# to the ends of the earth

This is an idiomatic expression that means everywhere in the word. See how you translated this in [Psalms 46:9](../046/009.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# your right hand is full of righteousness

The writer speaks of righteousness as if it were an object that God could hold in his hand. Here the word "hand" refers to God's power and authority to rule. AT: "you rule with righteousness" or "you are righteous as you rule" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
