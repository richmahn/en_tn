## in the middle of your temple ##

"while in the middle of your temple"

## As your name is ... so is your praise to the ends of the earth ##

These phrases are connected to say God is both praised and known in every place on earth. AT: "People know your name and praise you in every place on earth" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

## to the ends of the earth ##

See how you translated this in [Psalms 46:8](../046/008.md).

## your right hand is full of righteousness ##

Since God's right hand is full with righteousness, it cannot hold anything unrighteous.  God's right hand refers to his actions. AT: "you only use your power to do righteous things" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
