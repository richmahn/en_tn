## translationNotes

* **With the east wind you break the ships of Tarshish** - This can be translated two different way: 1) As the author stops his description to address God and describe an example of his great power. (See: like you break [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_apostrophe]]) 2) As a simile. AT: "They shook like you shatter the ships of Tarshish with the east wind"
* **the ships of Tarshish** - This refers to large ocean ships. AT: "the strong ships of Tarshish" or "the strong ocean ships"
* **the east wind** - "a strong wind"
* **As we have heard** - This refers to the stories of Yahweh's power like the example used in the previous sentence. AT: "As we have heard about your great power" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
* **in the city of Yahweh of hosts, in the city of our God** - Both of these phrases refer to the same city. AT: "in the city of our God, Yahweh of hosts" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
