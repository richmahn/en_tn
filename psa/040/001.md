# General Information:

Parallelism is common in Hebrew poetry. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# For the chief musician

"This is for the director of music to use in worship."

# I waited patiently for Yahweh

This means the writer was waiting for Yahweh to help him.

# he listened to me ... heard my cry

These mean the same thing, and can be combined into one statement. Alternate translation: "he listened to me when I called out to him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
