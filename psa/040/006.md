# You have no delight in sacrifice or offering

This is an exaggeration to express that other things are much more important to God. AT: "Sacrifices and other offerings are not the things that delight you most" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# you have opened my ears

Here "ears" refers to the ability to hear. AT: "you have enabled me to hear your commands" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# you have not required burnt offerings or sin offerings

This is an exaggeration to show that these things were not the most important to God. AT: "animals burned on the altar and other offerings for our sins are not what you require most" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
