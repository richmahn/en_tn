# your thoughts which are about us cannot be numbered

This can be stated in active form. AT: "no one can count all the things you think about us" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# cannot be numbered ... more than could be counted

These phrases mean essentially the same thing. The first is stated in negative form, and the second is stated in positive form. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])

# You have no delight in sacrifice or offering

This is an exaggeration to express that other things are much more important to God. AT: "Sacrifices and other offerings are not the things that delight you most" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# you have opened my ears

Here "ears" refers to the ability to hear. AT: "you have enabled me to hear your commands" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# you have not required burnt offerings or sin offerings

This is an exaggeration to show that these things were not the most important to God. AT: "animals burned on the altar and other offerings for our sins are not what you require most" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
