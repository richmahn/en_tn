# Yahweh despises violent and deceitful men

Since David is speaking to God in this psalm, this sentence can be stated with the word "you." AT: "Yahweh, you despise violent and deceitful men" or "Yahweh, you hate men who do violent acts and deceive others" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
