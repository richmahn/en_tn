# From the rising of the sun to its setting

This phrase refers to the directions east, where the sun rises, and west, where the sun sets. The writer uses these two extremes to represent everywhere on earth. See how you translated this in [Psalms 50:1](../050/001.md). Alternate translation: "Everywhere on earth" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])

# Yahweh's name should be praised

Here the word "name" represents Yahweh, himself. This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "people should praise Yahweh" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
