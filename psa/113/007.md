# He raises up the poor ... from the ash heap

These two phrases are parallel. The writer speaks of Yahweh helping and honoring people who are poor as if Yahweh caused them to stand up from sitting in dirt and ashes. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# out of the dirt ... from the ash heap

Sitting in dirt and ashes represents either poverty or despair. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
