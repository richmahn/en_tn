# He raises up the poor ... from the ash heap

These two phrases are parallel. The writer speaks of Yahweh helping and honoring people who are poor as if Yahweh caused them to stand up from sitting in dirt and ashes. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# out of the dirt ... from the ash heap

Sitting in dirt and ashes represents either poverty or despair. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])

# so that he may seat him with princes, with the princes of his people

Here the second phrase clarifies that the first phrase refers to the princes of Yahweh's people. These two statements can be combined. AT: "so that Yahweh may seat him next to rulers of his people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
