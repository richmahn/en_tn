# who looks down at the sky and at the earth

This is the second part of a rhetorical question that the writer asks to emphasize that there is no one like Yahweh. It may be translated as a statement that begins a new sentence. Alternate translation: "There is no one like Yahweh our God, who looks down at the sky and at the earth." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
