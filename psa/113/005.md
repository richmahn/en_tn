# Who is like Yahweh our God, who has his seat on high

This is the first part of a rhetorical question that the writer asks to emphasize that there is no one like Yahweh. It may be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: "There is no one like Yahweh our God, who has his seat on high" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# who has his seat on high

"who is enthroned on high" or "who rules in the highest position"
