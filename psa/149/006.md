# May the praises of God be in their mouths

The mouth represents the whole person. Alternate translation: "May they always be ready to praise God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# a two-edged sword in their hand

If swords are not known, use the name of a local weapon. The word "sword" is a metonym for being ready to fight in war. Alternate translation: "may they always be ready to go to war for him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
