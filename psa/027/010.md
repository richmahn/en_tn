# Even if my father and my mother forsake me

"Even if my father and my mother were to forsake me." He is not saying that they actually have done this or that they would do it. His point is that even if they did that, God would not abandon him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])

# Yahweh will take me in

"Yahweh will keep me" or "Yahweh will take care of me"
