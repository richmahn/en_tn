# For your servant David's sake

"Because of what happened to your servant David." See how you translated a similar phrase in [Psalms 132:1](./001.md).

# do not turn away from your anointed king

Here "turning away" means to reject someone. AT: "do not abandon the king that you anointed" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
