"will abundantly bless Zion"

# will satisfy her poor with bread

Here "poor" refers to the poor people in Zion and "bread" probably represents food in general. AT: "will satisfy the poor people in Zion with food" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# I will clothe her priests with salvation
