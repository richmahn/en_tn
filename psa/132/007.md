# we will worship at his footstool

Worshiping God at the covenant box is spoken of as bowing at the feet of the king who is sitting on his throne. This communicates humility and submission to God. AT: "we will go to God's covenant box and worship him as king" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
