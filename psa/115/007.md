# Those idols have hands

The idols do not have real hands, feet, or mouths. Rather, people made them with the likeness of hands, feet, and mouths. The writer is emphasizing that these idols are not really alive. You can make this implicit information clear. Alternate translation: "People have given hands to those idols" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
