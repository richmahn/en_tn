Alternate translation: "Do not bring honor to us, Yahweh" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# to us

The word "us" refers to the people of Israel.

# but to your name bring honor

# for your covenant faithfulness and for your trustworthiness

Alternate translation: "because you are faithful to your covenant and you are worthy of people trusting you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
