# Those who make them are like them, as is everyone who trusts in them

Those who make and worship idols become lifeless and powerless, just like those idols. The full meaning of this statement can be made clear. Alternate translation: "Those who make them become lifeless like they are, as does everyone who trusts in them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
