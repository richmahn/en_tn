## The dead ##

"People who are dead"

## who go down into silence ##

AT: "who go into the grave." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]]), [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])

## But we ##

The word "we" refers to the people of Israel, the descendants of Israel, and whoever reveres Yahweh.

## we will bless Yahweh ##

See how you translated "I will bless Yahweh" in [Psalms 32:1](../032/001.md), but notice that "we" and "I" are different.
