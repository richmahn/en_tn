# They will be made to stumble

The writer speaks of God's causing the evildoers' plans to fail as if God were making them stumble in their paths. This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "God will make them stumble" or "God will cause their plans to fail" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# since their own tongues are against them

Here "tongues" represents the words that they say. Alternate translation: "since the words that they say are against them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
