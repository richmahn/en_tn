## A song of ascents ##

See how you translated this in [Psalms 120:1](../120/001.md)

## Blessed is everyone who honors Yahweh ##

"Yahweh will bless everyone who honors him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## What your hands provide ##

Here a man is being referred to by his hands because that is the part of the body he works with. AT: "What you provide" or "What you work for" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

## blessed and prosper ##

These two words emphasize God's favor. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
