# General Information:

Parallelism is common in Hebrew poetry. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# song of ascents

Possible meanings are 1) "song people sang while going up to Jerusalem for a celebration" or 2) "song people sang while going up the steps into the temple" or 3) "song whose words are like steps." See how you translated this in [Psalms 120:1](../120/001.md)

# Blessed is everyone who honors Yahweh

This phrase occurs in the passive voice to avoid implying that Yahweh is obligated to bless those who honor him. This can be stated in active form. AT: "Yahweh will bless everyone who honors him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# What your hands provide

A man can be referred to by his hands because that is the part of the body he works with. AT: "What you provide" or "What you work for" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# you will be blessed and prosper

The words "be blessed" and "prosper" share similar meanings and emphasize God's favor. AT: "Yahweh will bless you and prosper you" or "Yahweh will make you blessed and prosperous" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
