# oceans ... oceans'

Some versions read "floods ... floods'." The word often refers to a river (See: "the River" in [Psalms 72:8](../072/008.md)), but "oceans ... oceans'" has been chosen here because oceans, not rivers, have "waves" that "crash and roar."

# have lifted up their voice; the oceans' waves crash and roar

The psalmist speaks of the ocean as if it were a person who could speak. AT: "have made a mighty noise because their waves crash and roar" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# roar

make a long, loud sound.

# Above the crashing of many waves, the mighty breakers of the sea

The phrase "the mighty breakers of the sea" means basically the same thing as "many waves" and emphasizes how great these waves are. AT: "Above the crashing of all of the very great waves of the sea" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# breakers

large waves coming to land

# on high

The psalmist speaks of where God lives as if it were high above the earth. AT: "in heaven" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
