# oceans ... oceans'

Some versions read "floods ... floods'." The word often refers to a river (See: "the River" in [Psalms 72:8](../072/008.md)), but "oceans ... oceans'" has been chosen here because oceans, not rivers, have "waves" that "crash and roar."

# have lifted up their voice; the oceans' waves crash and roar

The psalmist speaks of the ocean as if it were a person who could speak. Alternate translation: "have made a mighty noise because their waves crash and roar" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# roar

make a long, loud sound.
