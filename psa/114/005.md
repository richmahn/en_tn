# General Information:

Verses 5-6 contain four rhetorical questions. The expected answer to each question is found in verse 7, "because of the presence of the Lord." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# skip like rams ... skip like lambs

The writer speaks of the mountains and hills as if they are alive. He is probably speaking of an earthquake when he describes their fear at the presence of Yahweh as if they were jumping like rams and lambs. See how you translated similar phrases in [Psalms 114:3-4](./003.md). AT: "shake like jumping rams ... shake like jumping lambs" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Tremble, earth, before the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob

The last two phrases are parallel. The verb may be supplied in the second line. AT: "Tremble, earth, before the Lord, tremble at the presence of the God of Jacob" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# Tremble, earth

Possible meanings are 1) the writer is speaking to the earth as if it were a person and commands it to tremble with fear before God or 2) the word "earth" is a metonym for those who live on the earth. AT: "Tremble, everyone one earth" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
