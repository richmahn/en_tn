# General Information:

Parallelism is common in Hebrew poetry. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# When Israel left Egypt, the house of Jacob from that foreign people

These two lines are parallel, with "Israel" and "the house of Jacob" meaning the same thing and "Egypt" and "that foreign people" referring to the same people. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# the house of Jacob from a people who spoke a foreign language

The word "house" here represents the family or descendents. The verb may be supplied to this phrase. AT: "the descendants of Jacob departed from those people who spoke a language the descendants of Jacob did not understand." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# Judah became his holy place, Israel his kingdom

Possible meanings for "Judah" and "Israel" are 1) they refer to the land. AT: "The land of Judah became Yahweh's holy place, the land of Israel became his kingdom" or 2) they are metonyms for the people of Judah and Israel. AT: "The people of Judah became those among whom Yahweh lived, the people of Israel became those over whom he ruled" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
