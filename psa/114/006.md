# skip like rams ... skip like lambs

The writer speaks of the mountains and hills as if they are alive. He is probably speaking of an earthquake when he describes their fear at the presence of Yahweh as if they were jumping like rams and lambs. See how you translated similar phrases in [Psalms 114:3-4](./003.md). AT: "shake like jumping rams ... shake like jumping lambs" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
