# At the time of your anger

"When you are angry and begin to act"

# your anger ... you will burn

The words "your" and "you" refers to either 1) God or 2) the king.

# you will burn them up as in a fiery furnace

Yahweh or the king destroying their enemies is spoken of as if their enemies are wood and Yahweh or the king will throw them into a furnace. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Yahweh will consume them in his wrath, and the fire will devour them

Both clauses mean basically the same thing. Yahweh completely destroying his enemies is spoken of as if his wrath is a fire that completely burns up his enemies. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
