# His glory

"The king's honor" or "The king's fame"

# you have bestowed on him splendor and majesty

"you have placed on him splendor and majesty." Causing the king to be wealthy and powerful is spoken of as if splendor and majesty are objects that are placed on him. Alternate translation: "you have made him wealthy and powerful" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
