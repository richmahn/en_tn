# He will repay my enemies with evil

Punishment is spoken as if it were payment. AT: "He will do the evil to my enemies that they have done to me" or "He will cause the evil that my enemies have done to me to be done to them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# in your faithfulness, destroy them

Here David changes from talking about God to talking to God. AT: "God, destroy them because you are faithful to me"
