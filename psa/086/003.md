# all day long

This is an exaggeration. David cries out continually, but not literally at all times from dawn to dusk. AT: "continually" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# Make your servant glad

David refers to himself as "your servant," that is, God's servant. AT: "Make me, your servant" or "Make me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
