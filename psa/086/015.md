# and abundant in covenant faithfulness and trustworthiness

God constantly being faithful and trustworthy is spoken of as if faithfulness and trustworthiness were objects of which God has a large quantity. The two abstract nouns can be translated as adjectives. Alternate translation: "always faithful to your covenant and very worthy of people trusting you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
