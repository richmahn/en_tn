# whom you choose ... your courts

The words "you" and "your" in this verse refer to Yahweh.

# live in your courts

This exaggeration expresses that the man is in the temple very frequently to worship Yahweh. Alternate translation: "worship often in your courts" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# We will be satisfied with the goodness of your house, your holy temple

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "The goodness of your house, your holy temple, will satisfy us" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# We will be

Here the word "we" refers to David and the people of Israel, but not to God, to whom he is speaking. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

# your house, your holy temple

"your house, which is your holy temple"
