# Iniquities prevail against us

David speaks about iniquity as if it were a person that is able to defeat or oppress. Alternate translation: "It is as if our own sins were defeating us" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# you will forgive them

The word "them" refers to our "iniquities."
