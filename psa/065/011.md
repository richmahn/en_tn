# You ... your

The words "You" and "your" refer to Yahweh and so are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# You crown the year with your goodness

Here the "year" is given the human quality of wearing a crown. Alternate translation: "You have honored the year with a good harvest" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# your wagon tracks overflow with abundance

Yahweh making the soil so good and fertile that it produces an abundant harvest is spoken of as if Yahweh were traveling through an empty land in a cart, leaving abundant food behind wherever he goes. Alternate translation: "everywhere you have been, you have left abundant food" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
