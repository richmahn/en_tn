# But it was you

The psalmist speaks as though the person who had rebuked and taunted him were there listening to him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe]])

# myself, my companion and my close friend

This can be divided and a new sentence begun. AT: "myself. You were my companion and my close friend"
