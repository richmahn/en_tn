# heritage

property that a person can inherit from his ancestors. Children normally receive an inheritance from their parents. Inheritance goes from parents to children. This passage uses parents inheriting children from Yahweh as a metaphor for Yahweh being the only one who can give children. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs-metaphor]])
