# worship at his footstool

Here the word "footstool" likely refers to the ark of the covenant, which the biblical writers often spoke of as if it were Yahweh's footstool upon which he rested his feet as he sat on his throne in heaven above. The translation can make explicit that the people are to worship Yahweh. Alternate translation: "worship Yahweh at his footstool" or "worship Yahweh before his throne in the temple" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
