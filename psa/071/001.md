This psalm is a prayer for help.

# In you, Yahweh, I take refuge

Going to Yahweh for protection is spoken of as taking refuge in him. Alternate translation: "go to you, Yahweh, for protection" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# let me never be put to shame

This can be stated in active form. See how "do not let me be humiliated" is translated in [Psalms 25:2](../025/002.md). Alternate translation: "never let my enemies put me to shame" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
