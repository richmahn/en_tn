# Be to me a rock for refuge

The psalmist requests that Yahweh make him as safe as he would be if he were hiding in a large rock or cliff where his enemies could not find him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# rock ... rock

These are hills or mountains, not rocks one can hold in one's hand.

# you have given a command

"you have commanded your angels"

# you are my rock and my fortress

The psalmist believes that Yahweh will protect him and make him as safe as if he were hiding on top of a large mountain or inside a man-made fortress. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
