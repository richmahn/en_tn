Yahweh continues to speak to the lord.

## on the day of your power  ##

or "when you gather your army"

## from the womb of the dawn ##

Yahweh describes the dew as a baby to whom the dawn gives birth. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

## from the womb of the dawn your youth will be to you like the dew. ##

AT: "Your youthful strength will act for you like the dew that waters the earth early in the morning."
