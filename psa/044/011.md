# You have made us like sheep to be slaughtered

The writer compares the Israelites to sheep that people kill and eat. As sheep are helpless before those who kill them, so the Israelites are helpless before their enemies. This can be translated in active form. Alternate translation: "You have allowed our enemies to kill us like they would kill a sheep and eat it" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# scattered us among the nations

"caused us to live in many different nations"
