# Awake, why do you sleep, Lord?

This does not mean that God is actually asleep. The writer speaks of God's seeming inactivity as if God is sleeping. He asks the question to rebuke God for appearing not to be concerned about their troubles. Alternate translation: "Wake up! I feel like you are sleeping, Lord!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# do not throw us off

The writer speaks of God's rejection of Israel as if he were discarding an unwanted piece of clothing. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Psalms 44:9](../044/009.md). Alternate translation: "do not reject us" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
