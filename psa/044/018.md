# Our heart has not turned back ... have not gone from your way

These two phrases are parallel. The writer speaks of loyalty to God as if it were following him, and disloyalty as if it were turning away from him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Our heart has not turned back

Here the word "heart" refers to the emotions, and specifically to loyalty and devotion. Alternate translation: "We have not stopped being loyal to you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
