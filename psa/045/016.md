# Connecting Statement:

The writer continues to address the king.

# In the place of your fathers will be your children

This means that the king's sons will replace him as king, just as he replaced his ancestors as king.

# you will make princes in all the earth

The phrase "in all the earth" is an exaggeration to emphasize that they will rule over many nations. Alternate translation: "you will make rulers over many nations" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
