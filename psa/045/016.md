# Connecting Statement:

The writer continues to address the king.

# In the place of your fathers will be your children

This means that the king's sons will replace him as king, just as he replaced his ancestors as king.

# you will make princes in all the earth

The phrase "in all the earth" is an exaggeration to emphasize that they will rule over many nations. AT: "you will make rulers over many nations" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# I will make your name to be remembered in all generations

Here the word "I" refers to the writer. The word "name" refers to the king's character and reputation. This can be stated in active form. AT: "I will cause people in every generation to know about your greatness" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
