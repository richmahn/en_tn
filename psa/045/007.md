# God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness

The writer speaks of gladness as if it were an oil that God used to anoint the king. That God has anointed him is a symbolic action that represents God's choosing him to be king. AT: "when God appointed you as king, he made you very glad" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
