# General Information:

The author lists things that he would like God to do to wicked people.

# Break their teeth ... break out the great teeth of the young lions

In both of these phrases, the wicked people are spoken of as if they were lions, and making them powerless to kill people is spoken of as breaking their teeth. Alternate translation: "Take away their power to kill. Make them powerless like young lions whose teeth have been broken and fallen out" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
