# General Information:

Parallelism is common in Hebrew poetry. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# A song of ascents

Possible meanings are 1) "song people sang while going up to Jerusalem for a celebration" or 2) "song people sang while going up the steps into the temple" or 3) "song whose words are like steps." See how you translated this in [Psalms 120:1](../120/001.md)

# Jerusalem, our feet are standing within your gates!

The writer briefly stops speaking to his audience and speaks directly to the city of Jerusalem. Jerusalem is spoken to as if it was a person who could hear the writer. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# our feet are standing

Here "feet" refers to the whole person. AT: "we are standing" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# within your gates

Here "gates" refers to the city. AT: "inside you, Jerusalem" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
