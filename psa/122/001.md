## A song of ascents ##

See how you translated this in [Psalms 120:1](../120/001.md)

## our feet are ##

Here the people are being referred to by their feet since people stand on their feet. AT: "We are" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

## inside your gates, Jerusalem ##

AT: in the city of Jerusalem" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe]])

## Jerusalem was build like a city that is compact together ##

AT: "Jerusalem was built with great unity"
