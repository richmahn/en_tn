# Connecting Statement:

This verse finishes the prayer that the writer wants his audience to pray. He asks them to speak directly to the city of Jerusalem, as if the city was a person who could hear them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# May there be peace within ... may they have peace within

These two phrases have the same meanings and are used together to strengthen each other. Alternate translation: "May the people in Jerusalem live in peace" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# within the walls that defend you ... within your fortresses

Here Jerusalem is referred to by the fortress walls that protects it. The terms "walls" and "fortress" refer to the same thing. Alternate translation: "within Jerusalem" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
