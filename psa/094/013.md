# until a pit is dug for the wicked

The psalmist speaks of Yahweh's punishing the wicked as if Yahweh were trapping an animal in a pit. This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "until you dig a pit for the wicked" or "until you destroy the wicked" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
