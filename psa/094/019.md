# When cares within me are many, your consolations make me happy

The psalmist speaks of care as if he could count separate cares. The abstract noun "consolations" can be translated with the verb "console" or "comfort." Alternate translation: "When I have been worried about many things, you have comforted me and made me happy" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
