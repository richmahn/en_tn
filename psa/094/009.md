# He who made the ear, does he not hear? He who formed the eye, does he not see?

These rhetorical questions can be translated as statements or commands. Alternate translation: "God made ears, so he can hear. God made eyes, so he can see." or "God made ears, so stop acting as if he does not hear. God made eyes, so stop acting as if he does not see." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
