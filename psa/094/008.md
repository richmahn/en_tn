The Psalmist now instructs the wicked people.

## when will you ever learn? ##

This question stresses how important it is to understand and learn. AT: "stop your foolish ways" or "learn from your mistakes" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## He who made the ear, does he not hear? He who formed the eye, does he not see? ##

These questions are asked to emphasize a point. AT: "God made ears, so he hears everything. God made eyes, so he sees everything." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
