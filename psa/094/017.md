# Unless Yahweh had been my help ... silence

This is a hypothetical situation. Yahweh did help him, so he was not lying in the place of silence. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])

# Unless Yahweh had been my help

The abstract noun "help" can be expressed as a verb. AT: "If Yahweh had not helped me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# I would soon be lying down in the place of silence

Here "would be lying down" refers to "death" and "in the place of silence" refers to the grave." AT: "in a short time, I would be dead, lying in a silent grave" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
