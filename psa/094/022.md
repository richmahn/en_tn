# Yahweh has been my high tower

Here "tower" is a metaphor for protection. AT: "Yahweh has protected me from my enemies" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# God has been the rock of my refuge

The psalmist speaks of having God protect him as if God were a place where the psalmist could go to be safe. See how "rock" and "refuge" are translated in [Psalms 62:7](../062/007.md). AT: "I have asked God to protect me, and he has kept me safe by his power" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
