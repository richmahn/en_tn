## For Yahweh will not forsake his people or abandon his inheritance. ##

Here "inheritance" refers to his people. AT: "Yahweh will not leave or forget his promise to his people." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## Who will rise up to defend me against the evildoers? Who will stand up for me against the wicked? ##

These questions are used to express a need for help; they share similar meanings and are repeated for emphasis. AT: "No one will defend me against evil people. No one will help me fight against wicked people." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
