# Rise up, judge of the earth, give to the proud what they deserve

"Come, judge of the earth, and punish the proud"

# Rise up

The psalmist speaks of starting to do something as getting up. If your language has a word for beginning to act, use it here. Alternate translation: "Take action" or "Do something" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
