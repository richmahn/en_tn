# How long will the wicked, Yahweh, how long will the wicked rejoice?

The psalmist repeats the question to show that he is unhappy with how long Yahweh has allowed the wicked to rejoice. This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: "You have waited too long Yahweh; you have waited too long to stop the wicked from rejoicing." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# will the wicked rejoice

Why the wicked rejoice can be stated clearly. Alternate translation: "will the wicked rejoice because you never punish them for the evil deeds they do" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
