# He sends out his command and melts them

The writer speaks of Yahweh's command as if it were his messenger. The word "command" can be translated with a verb. Alternate translation: "He commands the ice to melt" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
