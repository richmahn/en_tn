# He dispenses

"He sends"

# hail

small pieces of ice that fall from the sky like rain

# who can withstand the cold he sends?

The writer uses this question to emphasize that it is difficult to endure the cold weather that Yahweh causes. Alternate translation: "no one can live in the cold he sends." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
