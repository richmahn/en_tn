# He heals the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds

The writer speaks of the people's sorrow and discouragement as if they were physical wounds, and of Yahweh encouraging them as if he were healing those wounds. AT: "He encourages those who are sad and helps them to heal from their emotional wounds" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
