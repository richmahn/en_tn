# you have been my high tower and a refuge

High towers and refuges are places that people can go to for shelter from their enemies. The psalmist speaks of God protecting him as if God were a strong, safe shelter. Alternate translation: "you have protected me like a high tower and a refuge" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# in the day of my distress

"whenever I have had troubles"
