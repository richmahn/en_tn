"This is for the director of music to use in worship"

# set to Al Tashheth

This probably tells what musical style or tune to use when singing the psalm. See how you translated this in [Psalms 57:1](../057/001.md).

# A psalm of David

Possible meanings are 1) David wrote the psalm or 2) the psalm is about David or 3) the psalm is in the style of David's psalms.

# A michtam

The meaning of the word "michtam" is uncertain. You may use the word "psalm" instead. This can be written as: "This is a psalm that David wrote." See how you translated this in [Psalms 16:1](../016/001.md).

Rising up against someone represents attacking him. Alternate translation: "attack me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
