# will remember and turn to Yahweh

Starting to obey Yahweh is spoken of as if the people physically turn toward Yahweh. Alternate translation: "will remember Yahweh and obey him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# all the families of the nations will bow down before you

This means the same thing as the first part of the sentence. The writer is emphasizing that everyone from every place will worship and obey Yahweh. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# will bow down before you

This is a sign of giving honor and respect to someone. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])

# before you

Here "you" refers to Yahweh. It can be translated in the third person to match the first part of the sentence. Alternate translation: "before him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
