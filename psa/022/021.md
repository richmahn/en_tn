# claws of wild dogs ... lion's mouth ... horns of the wild oxen

The writer speaks about his enemies as if they were dogs, lions, and wild oxen to emphasize how dangerous his enemies are. Also, the claws, mouth, and horns stand for the animals as a whole in a synecdoche. The writer emphasizes these parts of the animals because they are the parts that the animals would use to kill someone. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# wild dogs ... wild oxen

The word "wild" here means that no one has captured and tamed the animal.
