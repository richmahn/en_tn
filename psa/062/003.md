# all of you

"my enemies" or "all my enemies"

# How long ... will you attack a man ... or a shaky fence?

David uses a rhetorical question to express his frustration. No answer is expected. AT: "It seems like my enemies will never stop attacking me. I feel that I am as weak against you as a leaning wall or a broken-down fence." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# attack a man

"attack me"

# They consult with him only to

"They intend to" or "They plan to"

# consult with him ... bring him ... bless him ... curse him

In these verses, David is referring to himself by "him."
