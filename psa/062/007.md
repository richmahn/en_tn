# the rock of my strength and my refuge are in God

The writer speaks of God as if he were a rock that keeps one safe from his enemies. He also speaks of God as if he were a shelter that provides protection. Alternate translation: "God always gives me strength and protection" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
