# He alone is my rock and my salvation; he is my high tower

The writer speaks of God as if he were a rock and a high tower. Both of these metaphors show how God provides protection from one's enemies. Here "salvation" means that God rescues the writer. See how you translated this in [Psalms 62:2](./002.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# I will not be moved

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "nothing can move me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
