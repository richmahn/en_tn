# men of low standing ... men of high standing are a lie

This refers to men of all levels of wealth and importance. The phrases "are vanity" and "are a lie" have the same meaning. One cannot confidently trust in anyone. AT: "you cannot place your trust in men, no matter how important they are" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# weighed together, they are lighter than nothing

If you put all of these kinds of men together on a scale, they would have no weight. This means that they have no real value to you.
