## for my hopes are set on him ##

"for I set my hopes on him"

## He alone is my rock and my salvation; he is my high tower ##

See how you translated this in [Psalms 62:1](./001.md).

## I will not be moved ##

This can also be translated: “I will never be moved” or AT: “nothing can move me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
