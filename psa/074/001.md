# God, why have you rejected us forever?

This can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: "God, we have done nothing wrong, but you have rejected us forever!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Why does your anger burn against the sheep of your pasture?

This can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: "We are the ones you have promised to care for, and we have done nothing wrong, but now you are angry with us!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# the sheep of your pasture

Asaph speaks of the people of Israel as if they were sheep. Alternate translation: "against Israel, who are like the sheep whom you feed in your pasture" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
