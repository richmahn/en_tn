# General Information:

This begins a new theme: Asaph is proclaiming God's mighty deeds in the history of his people.

# God has been my king from ancient times

Possible meanings are 1) Asaph is speaking as Israel's representative, "God has been our king since we Israelites first became a nation" or 2) "God, my king, was alive even in ancient times."

# bringing salvation

The abstract noun "salvation" can be translated with the verb "to save." Here Yahweh saving people is spoken of as if salvation were an object that he brings with him. AT: "saving people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# You divided ... in the waters

Asaph is probably speaking of the time God brought Israel out of Egypt, divided the Sea of Reeds, led Israel through it on dry land, then drowned Pharaoh's army. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# You divided the sea by your strength

Asaph is speaking of God as if God had a physical body. "You are so strong you were able to make dry land in the middle of the sea." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# the sea

"the great water"

# you smashed the heads of the sea monsters in the waters

Asaph is probably speaking of Pharaoh and his army as if they were sea monsters. If possible, translate these words literally. AT: "when you killed Pharaoh's army, it was as if you smashed the heads of sea monsters in the waters" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
