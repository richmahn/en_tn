# Do not let the oppressed be turned back in shame

"Do not let wicked people defeat the oppressed and make them ashamed"

# the oppressed

These are people who are treated cruelly by powerful people.

# the poor and oppressed

The words "poor" and "oppressed" mean basically the same thing and emphasize that Yahweh saves many who need his help. See how these words are translated in [Psalms 35:10](../035/010.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
