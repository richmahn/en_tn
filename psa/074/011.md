# Why do you hold back your hand, your right hand?

The psalmist speaks of God as if he had a physical body. This can be translated as a statement. AT: "Stop holding back your hand, your right hand!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# hold back your hand

Here the word "hand" is a metonym for power. AT: "not show your power" or "not use your power to destroy your enemies" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# your right hand

"your strongest hand"

# Take your right hand from your garment

The psalmist speaks of God as if he had a physical body. "Stop hiding your power and take action" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
