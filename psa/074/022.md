# defend your own honor

"show everyone that you are right"

# call to mind

"Pay attention to." God has not forgotten how fools insult him, but he does not seem to be thinking about it. See how this is translated in verse [Psalms 2](./001.md).

# the voice of your adversaries

The word "voice" is a metonym for the words people use when they speak. AT: "what your adversaries are saying" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# or the uproar of those who continually defy you

The psalmist speaks of the words of those who defy God as if they were the loud sound of animals or non-living objects like water or the wind. AT: "and pay attention to the loud and meaningless words of those who continually defy you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
