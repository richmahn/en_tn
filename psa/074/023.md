# or the uproar of those who continually defy you

The psalmist speaks of the words of those who defy God as if they were the loud sound of animals or non-living objects like water or the wind. AT: "and pay attention to the loud and meaningless words of those who continually defy you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
