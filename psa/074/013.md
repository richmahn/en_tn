# You divided ... in the waters

Asaph is probably speaking of the time God brought Israel out of Egypt, divided the Sea of Reeds, led Israel through it on dry land, then drowned Pharaoh's army. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# You divided the sea by your strength

Asaph is speaking of God as if God had a physical body. "You are so strong you were able to make dry land in the middle of the sea." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# the sea

"the great water"

# you smashed the heads of the sea monsters in the waters

Asaph is probably speaking of Pharaoh and his army as if they were sea monsters. If possible, translate these words literally. Alternate translation: "when you killed Pharaoh's army, it was as if you smashed the heads of sea monsters in the waters" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
