# General Information:

Asaph continues his lament to Yahweh.

# the dark regions of the land are full of places of violence

Asaph speaks of "regions" as if they were containers in which one could put "places of violence." AT: "violent people do evil deeds in dark places in the land wherever they can" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the dark regions of the land

The word "dark" is probably a metaphor for a place where bad things happen or for the lands to which the Israelites had been sent in exile, but these words should be translated literally if possible. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Do not let the oppressed be turned back in shame

"Do not let wicked people defeat the oppressed and make them ashamed"

# the oppressed

These are people who are treated cruelly by powerful people.

# the poor and oppressed

The words "poor" and "oppressed" mean basically the same thing and emphasize that Yahweh saves many who need his help. See how these words are translated in [Psalms 35:10](../035/009.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
