# General Information:

Asaph continues his lament to Yahweh.

# the dark regions of the land are full of places of violence

Asaph speaks of "regions" as if they were containers in which one could put "places of violence." Alternate translation: "violent people do evil deeds in dark places in the land wherever they can" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the dark regions of the land

The word "dark" is probably a metaphor for a place where bad things happen or for the lands to which the Israelites had been sent in exile, but these words should be translated literally if possible. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
