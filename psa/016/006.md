# Measuring lines ... in pleasant places

Here laying down measuring lines is a metonym for measuring land and giving it to someone, and here this is a metaphor for God blessing David in many great ways. This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "You have measured off land for me in pleasant places" or "You have given me land in pleasant places" or "You bless me like one who gives land in pleasant places" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# Measuring lines

These are ropes that people use to measure a plot of land and mark its boundaries.

# surely a pleasing inheritance is mine

Here David speaks of Yahweh's blessings as if they were an inheritance that he has received. Alternate translation: "I am delighted with all the things that he has given me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
