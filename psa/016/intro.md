Psalm 16 is a psalm of praise, thanking God for all his mercies. The New Testament considers this psalm to be a messianic psalm: a psalm about Christ. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/mercy]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/christ]])

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Messiah #####
God has been so good to the psalmist, who will worship no other god. The New Testament considers the tenth verse to be about Christ's resurrection when it says that he is God's anointed one, and that God will not leave his body in the grave to decay. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/good]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/falsegod]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/resurrection]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/anoint]])

##### Superscription #####
The term "Michtam" is used in the superscription for this psalm. There is much discussion about this term, but in the end no one is certain what it means. So it is easiest to transliterate this word into your language, or you are welcome to translate it as "psalm."
