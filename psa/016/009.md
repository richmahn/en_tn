David continues to speak to God.

## Therefore my heart is glad … my honored heart exalts him ##

The speaker is saying that it brings him honor to be able to praise God. Both of these clauses express very similar meanings. AT: "Therefore I am glad; I am honored to praise him," (UDB) (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

## my heart … my honored heart ##

Here the "heart" represents the speaker's thoughts and emotions. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
