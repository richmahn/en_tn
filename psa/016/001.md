Parallelism is common in Hebrew poetry. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# A michtam of David

The meaning of the word "michtam" is uncertain. You may use the word "psalm" instead. This can be written as: "This is a psalm that David wrote."

# take refuge in you

Going to Yahweh for protection is spoken of as taking refuge in him. AT: "go to you for protection" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

Here "holy people" refers to God's own people who trust him. AT: "your people who live in this land" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
