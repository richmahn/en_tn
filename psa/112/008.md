The person who sings this song continues to describe a person who reveres Yahweh.

## His heart is tranquil ##

AT: "He is confident." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## his righteousness endures forever ##

See how you translated this in [Psalms 111:1](../111/001.md), but notice that here "his" refers to the man who reveres Yahweh and not to Yahweh.

## he will be exalted with honor ##

AT: "Yahweh will exalt him by giving him honor." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
