Most of this psalm is addressed to God, and the words “you” and "your" almost always refer to him.

## they walk in his ways ##

"they walk in Yahweh's ways." Their behavior is spoken of as walking, and the way God wants us to behave is spoken of as his ways. AT: "they behave as Yahweh wants them to" (UDB)

## keep your instructions ##

"obey all the things that you have declared that we should do"
