# HETH

This is the name of the eighth letter of the Hebrew alphabet. In the Hebrew language, each line of verses 57-64 begins with this letter.

# Yahweh is my portion

This means Yahweh is all he wants. Just as the Levites did not receive vast territories of land for the Lord was to be their portion so the writer claims Yahweh as the satisfier of his needs. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
