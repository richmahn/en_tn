# turned my feet

Here "feet" represent the whole person. To repent and choose to obey God's laws is like turning one's feet on a path to head in another direction. Alternate translation: "changed my direction" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
