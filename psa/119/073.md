# Your hands have made and fashioned me

God creating a person is spoken of as if God used his hands to shape the person the way someone may shape clay into an object. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Your hands

Here "hands" represents God's power or action. Alternate translation: "You" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
