# May my lips pour out praise

The psalmist speaks of his lips as if they were a container and his praise a liquid that could be poured out. Here the word "lips" is a synecdoche which represents the whole person. AT: "I desire to praise you much" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
