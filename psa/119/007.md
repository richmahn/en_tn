# an upright heart

"a sincere heart." A person who is sincere will do what is right. The heart refers to the center of emotions in a person. See how you translated "uprightness" in [Psalms 25:21](../025/021.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
