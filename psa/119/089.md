# your word stands forever

"what you have said will be true forever"

# your word is established firmly in heaven

This speaks about what God has said as if it were an object that stands firmly upright. Alternate translation: "what you have said will be true in heaven forever" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
