# NUN

This is the name of the fourteenth letter of the Hebrew alphabet. In the Hebrew language, each line of verses 105-112 begins with this letter.

# Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light for my path

These two phrases have similar meanings. They speak about God telling a person how to live as if the person were walking on a path and God's words were a light that helps the person see where to go. AT: "Your words tell me how to live my life" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Your word

Here "word" represents all that God communicates to people.
