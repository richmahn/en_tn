## You remove all of the wicked of the earth like slag ##

Slag is the waste or undesired leftovers in the process of refining gold or other metals. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

## solemn commands ##

See how you translated this in [Psalms 25:10](../025/010.md).

## trembles in fear of you ##

AT: "shakes because I fear you"
