# General Information:

Parallelism is common in Hebrew poetry. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# Blessed are those

"How good it is for those"

# those whose ways are blameless

How a person behaves is spoken of as "ways" or "paths." Alternate translation: "those whose behavior is blameless" or "those whom no one can blame for doing wrong" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# who walk in the law of Yahweh

The way a person lives or behaves is spoken of as walking. Alternate translation: "who live according to the law of Yahweh" or "who obey the law of Yahweh." This phrase clarifies the meaning of "whose ways are blameless" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
