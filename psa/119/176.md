# I have wandered off like a lost sheep

The psalmist compares his disobedience to Yahweh to a sheep that has wandered away from the flock. AT: "I have left your way like a sheep that has left its flock" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# seek your servant

"because I am your servant, come and search for me"
