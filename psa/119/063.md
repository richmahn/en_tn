# I am a companion of all who honor you

"I am a friend of all who honor you"

# The earth, Yahweh, is full of your covenant faithfulness

People everywhere in the world being able to see evidence of Yahweh's covenant faithfulness is spoken of as if his covenant faithfulness filled the earth. The abstract noun "covenant faithfulness" can be translated as an adjective. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Psalms 33:5](../033/004.md). AT: "People everywhere on earth can see that you, Yahweh, are faithful to your covenant" or "Throughout the earth, there is evidence that you, Yahweh, are faithful to your covenant" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
