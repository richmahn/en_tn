# KAPH

This is the name of the eleventh letter of the Hebrew alphabet. In the Hebrew language, each line of verses 81-88 begins with this letter.

# I have hope in your word

"I confidently trust in what you say"

# My eyes long to see your promise

Here "eyes" represents the whole person. AT: "I wait and wait for you to do what you promised to do" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
