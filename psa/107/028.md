# Then they called out to Yahweh in their trouble

It is implied that they are praying to Yahweh so that he will help them. See how you translated this in [Psalms 107:6](./004.md). AT: "Then they prayed to Yahweh to help them in their trouble" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# Then they

The word "they" refers to the sailors.

# He calmed the storm

"He made the wind stop"

# the waves were stilled

This can be stated in active form. AT: "he made the waves still" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# he brought them

"he guided them"

# their desired harbor

"to the harbor where they wanted to go"
