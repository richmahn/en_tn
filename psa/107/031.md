## Oh that people...for humanity ##

See how you translated this in [Psalms 107:8](./008.md).

## Let them exalt ##

AT: â€œThey should praise"

## in the assembly of the people ##

"when the people gather together"

## in the council of the elders ##

"when the elders sit together." The elders sat together to discuss issues in the community and to make decisions for the community.
