## He brought them ##

"Yahweh brought those in prison"

## darkness and gloom ##

See how you translated this in [Psalms 107:8](./008.md).

## Oh that people...for humanity ##

See how you translated this in [Psalms 107:8](./008.md).

## For he ##

"because he"

## For he has broken the gates of bronze and cut through the bars of iron ##
