# He brought them

"Yahweh brought those in prison"

# darkness and gloom

Both "darkness" and "gloom" have basically the same meaning and are used to emphasize how dark the prison was. See how you translated this in [Psalms 107:10](./010.md). AT: "complete darkness" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
