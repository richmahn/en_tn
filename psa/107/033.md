# He turns

"Yahweh makes"

# because of the wickedness of its people

"because the people that live there are wicked"

# He turns the wilderness into a pool of water and dry land into springs of water

Both of these phrases have similar meaning and emphasize how Yahweh makes water appear in the wilderness. AT: "He make springs and lakes in land that used to be desert" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
