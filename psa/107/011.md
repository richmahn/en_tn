## translationNotes

* **This was because they had rebelled against God's word and rejected the instruction of the Most High** - These clauses have much the same meaning. AT: "They were in prison because they refused to obey God." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
* **He humbled their hearts through hardship** - The heart represents the will of a person. AT: "He used suffering to make them willing to listen to himself." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
* **hardship** - Possible meanings are 1) "trouble" or 2) "hard labor."
* **they stumbled and there** - The word "stumbled" refers to times when these people got into very difficult situations and could not get themselves out of these situations. AT: "they were in trouble, but there."
* **Then they called outâ€¦their distress** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:psa:107:004]], but notice that "rescued" and "brought" are different ideas, although they express the same general thought.
* **he brought** - "he saved"
