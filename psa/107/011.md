## This was because they had rebelled against God's word and rejected the instruction of the Most High ##

These clauses have much the same meaning. AT: "They were in prison because they refused to obey God." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## He humbled their hearts through hardship ##

The heart represents the will of a person. AT: "He used suffering to make them willing to listen to himself." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## hardship ##

Possible meanings are 1) "trouble" or 2) "hard labor."

## they stumbled and there ##

The word "stumbled" refers to times when these people got into very difficult situations and could not get themselves out of these situations. AT: "they were in trouble, but there."

## Then they called outâ€¦their distress ##

See how you translated this in [Psalms 107:4](./004.md), but notice that "rescued" and "brought" are different ideas, although they express the same general thought.

## he brought ##

"he saved"
