# will inherit the land

The possession of the land is spoken of as if it had been received as an inheritance. See how you translated this in [Psalms 37:9](../037/009.md). Alternate translation: "will receive the land as their own possession" or "will be allowed to live safely in the land" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
