# They are preserved forever

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "Yahweh will protect them forever" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# will be cut off

The destruction of the wicked is spoken of as if they were a branch of plant that was cut off and thrown away. See how you translated this in [Psalms 37:9](../037/009.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
