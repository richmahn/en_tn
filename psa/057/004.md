# My life is among lions

The psalmist speaks of his enemies as if they were lions. Alternate translation: "I live among fierce enemies" or "Fierce enemies surround me like lions" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# those who are ready to devour me

Destroying is spoken of as devouring or eating something up. Some versions understand the Hebrew text to mean "fiery beasts." Both images speak of his enemies as if they were wild beasts. Alternate translation: "those who are ready to destroy me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# people whose teeth are spears and arrows

The enemies' spears and arrows are spoken of as if they were lions' teeth. The psalmist continues to speak of his enemies as if they were lions. Alternate translation: "people who kill others with spears and arrows as lions kill with their sharp teeth" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# spears and arrows

Since both of these terms are weapons, if your culture knows only one, it is acceptable to use it alone. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# whose tongues are sharp swords

The tongue represents what someone says, and the enemies' cruel words are spoken of as if they were swords. Alternate translation: "whose cruel words are like sharp swords" or "who cause terrible trouble for me by what they say" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
