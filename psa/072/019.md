# May his glorious name be blessed forever

This can be stated in active form. AT: "May people bless his glorious name forever" or, treating "name" as a metonym for Yahweh himself, "May people forever know how glorious he is" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# his glorious name be blessed

"he, who is glorious, be blessed"

# may the whole earth be filled with his glory

This can be stated in active form. AT: "may his glory fill the whole earth" or "may he fill the whole earth with his glory" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# Amen and Amen

The word "Amen" is repeated to emphasize approval of what has been said. See how you translated this in [Psalms 41:13](../041/013.md). AT: "May it certainly be so"
