# while the sun endures, and as long as the moon lasts

The sun and the moon are metonyms for the day and the night, which together are a merism for all time. Alternate translation: "forever, and without ending" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
