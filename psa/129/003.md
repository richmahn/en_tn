# The plowers plowed on my back

The cuts from a whipping are spoken of as the plow of a plowman. A farmer plowed deep lines into a field. AT: "My enemies have cut me deeply on my back" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# they made their furrows long

This is a continuation of the plowing metaphor. The "furrow" is the line the farmer plowed. AT: "they made their cuts long" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
