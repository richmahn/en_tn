## A song of ascents ##

See how you translated this in [Psalms 120:1](../120/001.md)

## they have attacked ##

AT: "my enemies have attacked"

## The plowers have plowed on my back ##

Here the cuts being inflicted on someone's back by whipping is being compared to a farmer plowing a field. AT: "My enemies have cut me deeply on my back" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## they made their furrows long ##

AT: "They made their cuts long and deep" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
