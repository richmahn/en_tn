# May they be like the grass on the housetops that withers before it grows up

The psalmist speaks of his enemies dying and being few in number. He compares them to the little bit of grass that grows on the roof of a house and withers and is not enough to cut or bundle. Alternate translation: "May they die and may there be few of them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
