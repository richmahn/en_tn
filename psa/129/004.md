# he has cut the ropes of the wicked

Israel is spoken of as being bound by evil people. AT: "he has freed us from our enemies" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# May they all be put to shame and turned back

Yahweh is not explicitly mentioned as the one who does these things. This can be stated in active form. AT: "May Yahweh shame them and defeat them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
