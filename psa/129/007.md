# May they be like the grass ... bundles of grain together

The psalmist speaks of his enemies dying and being few in number. They are compare to the little bit of grass that grows on the roof of a house and withers and is not enough to cut or bundle. Alternate translation: "May they die and may there be so few of them that they would be like the grass ... bundles of grain together" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
