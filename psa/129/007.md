# that cannot fill ... together

These words finish the simile that begins in ([Psalms 129:6](./006.md)). The psalmist speaks of his enemies dying and being few in number. He compares them to the little bit of grass that grows on the roof of a house and withers and is not enough to cut or bundle. "May they be like the grass, which cannot fill ... together" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
