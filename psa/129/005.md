# May they all be put to shame and turned back

Yahweh is not explicitly mentioned as the one who does these things. This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "May Yahweh shame them and defeat them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
