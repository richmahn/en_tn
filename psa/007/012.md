# God will sharpen his sword and will prepare his bow for battle

In verses 12 and 13, David speaks of God deciding to punish the wicked as if God were a warrior preparing to fight against them with weapons. Alternate translation: "God will take action against him like a warrior who sharpens his sword and prepares his bow for battle" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
