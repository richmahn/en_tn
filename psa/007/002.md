# they will rip me apart like a lion, tearing me in pieces

David speaks of his enemies attacking him as if they would rip his body apart and tear it in pieces as a lion would. Alternate translation: "they will violently kill me like a lion ripping apart its victim's body and tearing it in pieces" or "they will violently kill me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# with no one else able to bring me to safety

"and no one else will be able to save me"
