# You are gods, and all of you sons of the Most High

Here "gods" refers to the same group as in [Psalms 82:1](./001.md). Whether this refers to spiritual beings or human beings, they are not gods like Yahweh is God, and they are not literally his sons. By calling them "gods" and "sons of the Most High," Yahweh is acknowledging that he has given them great power and authority.

# sons of the Most High

Yahweh is speaking about himself as "the Most High." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
