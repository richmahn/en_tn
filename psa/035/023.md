# Arouse yourself and awake

This does not mean that God is actually asleep. The writer wants God to intervene. Both words mean basically the same thing and emphasize the urgency of this request. Alternate translation: "I feel like you are sleeping! Wake up" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# to my defense

This abstract noun "defense" can be stated as "defend." Alternate translation: "to defend me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# my cause

This refers to the writer. Alternate translation: "me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
