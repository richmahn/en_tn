# when they were sick

The word "they" refers to the "unrighteous witnesses" ([Psalms 35:11](../035/011.md)).

# I wore sackcloth

"I showed that I was sad"

# with my head bowed on my chest

This was a symbol of prayer. "with my head bent down in prayer" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
