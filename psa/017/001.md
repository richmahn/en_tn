# General Information:

Parallelism is common in Hebrew poetry. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# A prayer of David

"This is a prayer that David wrote."

# Give ear to my prayer from lips without deceit

The phrase "give ear" is a metaphor for listening, and "lips without deceit" is synecdoche for a person who does not lie. AT: "Listen to my prayer for I speak without deceit" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# Let my vindication come from your presence

Vindication coming from God represents God judging someone and declaring him innocent. God's "presence" is a metonym for God himself. AT: "Let my vindication come from you" or "Declare that I am innocent" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# let your eyes see what is right!

Here "your eyes" is synecdoche for God himself, and "see" is a metaphor for paying attention and firmly deciding to do something. AT: "please see what is right" or "do what is right" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
