# Give ear to my prayer from lips without deceit

The phrase "give ear" is a metaphor for listening, and "lips without deceit" is synecdoche for a person who does not lie. Alternate translation: "Listen to my prayer for I speak without deceit" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
