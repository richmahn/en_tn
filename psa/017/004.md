# it is at the word of your lips that I have kept myself from the ways of the lawless

Here "the word of your lips" is a metonym for God's instruction, and "the ways of the lawless" is a metaphor for the things that lawless people do. Alternate translation: "it is by obeying your instruction that I have kept myself from doing the things that lawless people do" or "your instruction has caused me to avoid doing wicked things" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
