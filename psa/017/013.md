# Rescue my life from the wicked by your sword ... Rescue me from men by your hand, Yahweh, from men of this world

These two clauses have similar meanings. The repetition adds intensity to the writer's words. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# by your sword ... by your hand

Here "sword" and "hand" both represent the power of Yahweh. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
