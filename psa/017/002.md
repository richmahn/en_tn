# Let my vindication come from your presence

Vindication coming from God represents God judging someone and declaring him innocent. God's "presence" is a metonym for God himself. Alternate translation: "Let my vindication come from you" or "Declare that I am innocent" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# let your eyes see what is right!

Here "your eyes" is synecdoche for God himself, and "see" is a metaphor for paying attention and firmly deciding to do something. Alternate translation: "please see what is right" or "do what is right" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
