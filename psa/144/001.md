# General Information:

Parallelism is common in Hebrew poetry. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# my rock

Possible meanings are 1) "the one who keeps me safe" or 2) "the one who gives me strength" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# who trains my hands for war and my fingers for battle

The words "hands" and "fingers" are synecdoches for "me." If "war" and "battle" are the same word in your language, you can translate this as one line. Alternate translation: "who trains me for war and trains me for battle" or "who trains me for war" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
