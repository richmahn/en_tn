# Rescue me and free me

"Please rescue me and free me"

# from the hand of foreigners

Here "hand" refers to power. See how you translated these words in [Psalms 144:7-8](./007.md). Alternate translation: "from the power of foreigners" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# Their mouths speak lies

The people are represented by their "mouths." See how you translated these words in [Psalms 144:7-8](./007.md). Alternate translation: "They speak lies" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# their right hand is falsehood

Possible meanings are 1) David speaks of the custom of raising the right hand to swear that what one is about to say in court is true, "they lie even when they swear to tell the truth," or 2) the "right hand" is a metaphor for power, "everything they have gotten, they have gotten by telling lies."See how you translated these words [Psalms 144:7-8](./007.md).
