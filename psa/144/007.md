# Reach out your hand from above; rescue me out of many waters

David speaks as if God were on land above a flood and had physical hands with which he could pull David out of a flood. The flood is a metaphor for the troubles caused by the "foreigners." Alternate translation: "You who are able to act, help me overcome my troubles" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# from the hand of foreigners

Here "hand" refers to power. Alternate translation: "from the power of foreigners" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
