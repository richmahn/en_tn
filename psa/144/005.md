# Cause ... come down ... touch ... make

These words should probably be translated as requests, not commands, since the psalmist knows that God is greater than he is.

# Cause the sky to sink

Possible meanings are 1) tear the sky open or 2) bend the heavens like a tree branch bends when someone walks on it or as one bends a bow before shooting arrows.
