# No one will break through our walls

"No one will be able to invade our city"

# no outcry

Here the outcry is associated with a severe problem that causes the person to cry out. Alternate translation: "no one crying in pain" or "no one crying for help" or "no one calling out for justice" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
