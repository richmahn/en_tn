# like plants who grow to full size

healthy and strong

# in their youth

the time when people develop

# our daughters like carved corner pillars

"may our daughters be like carved corner pillars"

# carved corner pillars

"beautiful posts that hold up the corners of a large house"

# pillars, shapely like those of a palace

"pillars that are carved to make a palace beautiful"
