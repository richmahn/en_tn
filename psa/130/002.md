# let your ears be attentive

The ears represent Yahweh, but because the author knows that Yahweh hears everything, he is really asking for Yahweh to respond. Alternate translation: "please listen" or "please respond" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# to my pleas for mercy

The abstract noun "mercy" can be stated as "merciful." Alternate translation: "to my pleas and be merciful to me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
