# General Information:

Parallelism is common in Hebrew poetry. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# song of ascents

Possible meanings are 1) "song people sang while going up to Jerusalem for a celebration" or 2) "song people sang while going up the steps into the temple" or 3) "song whose words are like steps." See how you translated this in [Psalms 120:1](../120/001.md)

# Out of the depths

The author's sadness is spoken of as if it were a container. His sadness comes from the bottom of the container. Sadness is often spoken of as being a container that fills from the top to the bottom. AT: "Because I am very sad," (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# let your ears be attentive

The ears represent Yahweh, but because the author knows that Yahweh hears everything, he is really asking for Yahweh to respond. AT: "please listen" or "please respond" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# to my pleas for mercy

The abstract noun "mercy" can be stated as "merciful." AT: "to my pleas and be merciful to me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
