# at a time that you will accept

"in your accepted time" or "when you are willing"

# answer me in the trustworthiness of your salvation

The abstract nouns "trustworthiness" and "salvation" can be stated as "faithfully" and "rescue." Alternate translation: "rescue me because you faithfully love me, as you have promised to do" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
