# Let their table before them become a snare ... let it become a trap

The writer would like for his enemies' food to completely ruin them as if they were small animals caught in a snare or a trap. Alternate translation: "May their food ruin them like a snare ... may it destroy them like a trap" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# their table

This refers to food that was served on the tables, possibly at a feast. Alternate translation: "their own food" or "sacrificial feasts" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
