## because your mercies for me are many ##

AT: "because you are very merciful to me"

## turn to me ##

The idea of turning towards someone means to pay attention to them or help them. AT: "help me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## my distress ##

See how you translated this in [Psalms 25:17](../025/017.md)
