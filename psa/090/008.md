# You have set our iniquities before you, our hidden sins in the light of your presence

God considering people's sins is spoken of as if sins were an objects he could place in front of himself and look at them. Alternate translation: "You see every sinful thing we do, even the sinful things we do in secret" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
