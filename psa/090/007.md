# we are consumed in your anger

God destroying people in his anger is spoken of as if God's anger were a fire that completely burns up the people. This can be stated in active form. AT: "You destroy us in your anger" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# in your wrath we are terrified
