# For a thousand years in your sight are as yesterday when it is past, and as a watch in the night

The writer means that a long period of time seems like a short period of time to God. Alternate translation: "You consider a thousand years the same as one day in the past, or as a few short hours in the night" or "Even a thousand years is not a long time to you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# a thousand years

"1,000 years" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])

# in your sight

Here sight represents judgment or evaluation. Alternate translation: "to you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
