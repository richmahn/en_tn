# You sweep them away as with a flood and they sleep

God causing people to die suddenly is spoken of as if he swept them away with a broom. This sweeping is also spoken of as if it were a flood that carried people away. Alternate translation: "Lord, you destroy the people as with a flood and they die" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
