# He gave us their land as an inheritance

God's gift of the land to the Israelites is spoken of as if it were inheritance from father to son. Alternate translation: "He gave us their land to have forever" or "He gave us their land to be ours forever" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
