## translationNotes

* **The nations' idols are silver and gold, the work of menâ€™s hands** - The people who do not obey God make statues to worship out of gold or silver.
* **those idols have mouths, but they do not speak** - while the physical representation of their idols have a mouth, the figure is unable to use that mouth because the false god they represent do not have any power
* **are like them** - AT: "are completely useless" or "are completely powerless" (see:[[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
