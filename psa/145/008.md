# abounding in covenant faithfulness

The psalmist speaks of covenant faithfulness as if it were a physical object of which one could possess a large amount. The abstract noun "faithfulness" can be translated with an adjective. AT: "completely faithful to his covenant" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
