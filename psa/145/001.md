# General Information:

Parallelism is common in Hebrew poetry. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# extol you

"tell people how wonderful you are"

# bless your name

The word "name" is a metonym for Yahweh himself. See how "may his glorious name be blessed" is translated in [Psalms 72:19](../072/019.md). Alternate translation: "bless you" or "do what makes you happy" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
