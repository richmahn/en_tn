# the rock of our salvation

The psalmist speaks of Yahweh as if Yahweh were a mountain the people could climb so they would be safe. See how "rock" and "of my salvation" are translated in [Psalms 18:46](../018/046.md). AT: "the rock where we can go and God will save us" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
