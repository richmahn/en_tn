# the people of his pasture

The word "pasture" is a metonym for the food that animals eat in the pasture, which in turn is a synecdoche for everything that Yahweh provides for his people. AT: "we are the people whose needs he meets" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# pasture

an area where animals find grass to eat

# the sheep of his hand

The word "hand" here refers to how Yahweh protects his people the way a shepherd protects his sheep. AT: "the people whom he protects like a shepherd protects his sheep" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Todayâ€”oh, that you would hear his voice!

"Oh, that you would hear his voice today!" The psalmist purposely interrupts what he is saying.

# hear his voice

Here "his voice" represents God speaking or what he says. AT: "listen to God speak" or "hear what God says" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
