Now the Psalmist writes the words that Yahweh spoke.

## Meribah, Massah ##

Both words refer to a place in the dessert that Moses named because the Israelites rebelled against God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

## challenged my authority and tried my patience ##

AT: "tested my authority and patience," (See:[[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

## my deeds ##

AT: "the amazing things I had done."
