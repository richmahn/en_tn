# God will scatter the bones of whoever will camp against you

Scattering people's bones represents killing them and allowing their bones to remain wherever they have died and not be buried properly. "God will completely destroy whoever will camp against you, and their bones will lie scattered on the ground" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# whoever will camp against you

Camping against people represents attacking them. Enemy armies would travel and set up camps to live in temporarily near the people they wanted to attack. Alternate translation: "whoever will attack you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
