# then they would have swallowed us up alive

This is the end of a hypothetical statement that begins with the words "If Yahweh had not been on our side" in [Psalms 124:1](./001.md) and continues with the words "if it had not been Yahweh who was on our side when men rose up against us" in [Psalms 124:2](./002.md). It describes a result that did not happen because Yahweh was actually on their side. "They were not able to swallow us up alive because Yahweh was on our side." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])

# swallowed us up alive

This metaphor describes how the Israelites could have died to how a fierce animal would attack a smaller animal to eat. Alternate translation: "killed us" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# their anger raged against us

Here "their anger" refers to the enemies who were angry. Alternate translation: "they were very angry with us" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
