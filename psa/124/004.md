# General Information:

In these two verses the author compares the enemies of Israel to a flood of water.

# The water would have swept us away; the torrent would have overwhelmed us

This is the end of a hypothetical statement that begins with the words "If Yahweh had not been on our side" in [Psalms 124:1](./001.md) and continues with the words "if it had not been Yahweh who was on our side when men rose up against us" in [Psalms 124:2](./002.md). It describes a result that did not happen because Yahweh was actually on their side. "The water did not sweep us away, and the torrent did not overwhelm us because Yahweh was on our side" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])

# The water would have swept us away

Here the enemies of the writer are spoken of as if they were a flood of water. Alternate translation: "Our enemies would have easily defeated us" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the torrent would have overwhelmed us

Here the enemies of the writer are spoken of as if they were a flood of water that would have drowned the Israelites. Alternate translation: "our enemies would have overwhelmed us" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
