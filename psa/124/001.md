## A song of ascents ##

See how you translated this in [Psalms 120:1](../120/001.md)

## if it had not been Yahweh who was on our side ##

AT: "Without Yahweh's help"

## swallowed us up alive ##

This metaphor compares how the Israelites could've died to how a fierce animal would attack a smaller animal to eat. AT: "killed us" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## their anger raged against us ##

AT: "They attacked us"
