# They tremble

The word "they" refers to those who do evil things.

# God is with the righteous assembly

To say that "God is with" those who are righteous means that he helps them. This can be stated clearly in the translation. Alternate translation: "God helps those who act righteously" or "God helps those who do the right things" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
