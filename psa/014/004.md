## Will they not know anything ... who do not call on Yahweh? ##

The writer puts this verse in the form of a question to add emphasis. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## those who commit iniquity ##

AT: "those who behave in evil ways,"

## those who eat up my people ##

Just as people "eat" bread, those who do evil things destroy God's people. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
