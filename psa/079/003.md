# They have shed their blood like water

The word "blood" is a metonym for innocent life. To shed blood is to kill innocent people. Most people saw water every day, so for blood to be as common as water, many innocent people would have to die. Alternate translation: "They have killed so many innocent people that the blood is everywhere, like water after it rains" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
