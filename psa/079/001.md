# They have shed their blood like water

The word "blood" is a metonym for innocent life. To shed blood is to kill innocent people.

AT: "They have killed so many innocent people that the blood is everywhere, like water after it rains" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
