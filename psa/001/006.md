How people live is spoken of as if it were a "way" or "road" that they are walking on. AT: "how the righteous live" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the way of the wicked will perish

AT: "The wicked will die because of how they live" or 2) the way perishing is a metaphor for no longer being able to live the way they do. AT: "the wicked will no longer be able to live the way they live" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
