# General Information:

Parallelism is common in Hebrew poetry. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# who does not walk in the advice of the wicked

The "advice of the wicked" is spoken of as if it were a path to follow. Alternate translation: "who does not follow the advice of the wicked" or "who does not do what wicked people advise" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# stand in the pathway with sinners

Here the word "pathway" represents the way people live. The word "stand" is in parallel with "walk." Alternate translation: "imitate the behavior of sinful people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# or sit in the assembly of mockers

Sitting with people who mock God represents joining people who mock God. Alternate translation: "or join those who mock God" or "or mock God with others who mock him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
