# at a time of great distress

"when they are in great trouble."

# Then when the surging waters overflow, they will not reach those people

Difficulties are spoken of as if they were a flood of water. Alternate translation: "Then when difficulties come like a flood of water, those people will be safe" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
