# at a time of great distress

"when they are in great trouble."

# When the surging waters overflow, the waters will not reach them

Difficulties are spoken of as if they were a flood of water. Alternate translation: "Then when difficulties come like a flood of water, those people will be safe" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
