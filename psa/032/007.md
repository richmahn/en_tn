# You are my hiding place

Yahweh is spoken of as if he was a safe place from the attacks of the writer's enemies. Alternate translation: "You are like a place where I can hide myself from my enemies" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# You will surround me with the songs of victory

This metaphor apparently means that Yahweh's protection of the writer is the cause for songs of victory to be sung. Alternate translation: "Because of you I will sing songs of victory" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
