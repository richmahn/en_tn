## Selah ##

See how you translated this in [Psalms 3:1](../003/001.md).

## at a time of great distress ##

AT: "when they are in great trouble." Other translations may read "while you may be found."

## Then when the surging waters overflow, they will not reach those people ##

The waters are a metaphor for difficulties. AT: "Then when difficulties come like a flood of water, they will be safe" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
