# Selah

This may be a musical term that tells people how to sing or play their instruments here. Some translations write the Hebrew word, and some translations do not include it. See how you translated this in [Psalms 3:2](../003/001.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate]])

# at a time of great distress

"when they are in great trouble."

# Then when the surging waters overflow, they will not reach those people

Difficulties are spoken of as if they were a flood of water. AT: "Then when difficulties come like a flood of water, those people will be safe" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
