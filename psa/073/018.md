## translationNotes

* **put them** - The word "them" refers to the wicked.
* **slippery places** - AT: "unsafe or unstable ground."
* **How they become a wilderness in a moment** - This phrase means  "How quickly they are destroyed."
* **like a dream after one wakes up** - This phrase means "easily forgotten." The wicked will last no longer than what we see in a dream. It disappears as soon as one wakes up.(See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
