# General Information:

In verses 13 and 14, Asaph continues to describe how he sometimes wants to complain to God about those who are "arrogant" and "wicked" ([Psalms 73:3](./001.md)). In verse 15 he begins to talk about what he is really thinking.

# I have

The word "I" refers to Asaph.

# guarded my heart

Asaph speaks of guarding his heart as if he were guarding a city or building against enemies. AT: "I have kept my thoughts pure" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# washed my hands in innocence

The writer speaks of his purity as if he had washed his hands with innocence instead of with water. See how you translated this in [Psalms 26:6](../026/006.md). AT: "my actions have remained pure" or "I have washed my hands to show that I am innocent" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# all the day long

"always" or "every day"

# I have been afflicted

"You have made me suffer." See how "they are not afflicted" is translated in [Psalms 73:5](./004.md).

# I have been ... disciplined

"I have been ... punished"

# If I had said, "I will say these things," then I would have betrayed this generation of your children

This hypothetical situation did not happen. AT: "I never said, 'I will say these things,' so I did not betray this generation of your children" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
