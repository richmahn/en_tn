# General Information:

In verses 13 and 14, Asaph continues to describe how he sometimes wants to complain to God about those who are "arrogant" and "wicked" ([Psalms 73:3](../073/003.md)). In verse 15 he begins to talk about what he is really thinking.

# I have

The word "I" refers to Asaph.

# guarded my heart

Asaph speaks of guarding his heart as if he were guarding a city or building against enemies. Alternate translation: "I have kept my thoughts pure" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# washed my hands in innocence

The writer speaks of his purity as if he had washed his hands with innocence instead of with water. See how you translated this in [Psalms 26:6](../026/006.md). Alternate translation: "my actions have remained pure" or "I have washed my hands to show that I am innocent" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
