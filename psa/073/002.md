# my feet almost slipped; my feet almost slipped out from under me

The psalmist speaks of being unable to trust God and wanting to sin as if he had almost fallen while walking on a slippery path. AT: "I almost stopped trusting in God; I was almost guilty of committing a great sin against him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
