# General Information:

Asaph begins to describe how he sometimes wants to complain to God about those who are "arrogant" and "wicked" ([Psalms 73:3](./001.md)).

# the burdens of other men

The words "burdens" is a metonym for the struggles of daily life (need for food, shelter, clothing, and health). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# they are not afflicted like other men

"they do not suffer the way other people do"
