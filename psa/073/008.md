# General Information:

Asaph continues to describe how he sometimes wants to complain to God about those who are "arrogant" and "wicked" ([Psalms 73:3](./001.md)).

# They mock

Whom they mock can be stated clearly. AT: "They mock God and his people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# They set their mouth against the heavens

Here "their mouth" is a metonym for their speech, and "heavens" is a metonym for God, who lives in the heavens. AT: "They speak against God, who is in the heavens" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# their tongues march through the earth

The word "tongues" represents the people themselves. Possible meanings are 1) "they go through the earth saying bad things about God" or "they go everywhere and boast about themselves." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
