Asaph continues to describe how he sometimes wants to complain to God about those who are "arrogant" and "wicked" ([Psalms 73:3](../073/003.md)).

# They mock

Whom they mock can be stated clearly. Alternate translation: "They mock God and his people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
