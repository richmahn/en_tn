# How does God know? Is there knowledge with the Most High?

These rhetorical questions are to show contempt for God. These questions can be translated as statements. AT: "Surely God does not know what we are doing. The Most High has no knowledge of it." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
