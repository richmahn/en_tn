## translationNotes

* The wicked people influence Israel.
* **drink deeply at their words** - This expression means "to listen." AT: "receive and absorb their words" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
* **They say** - The word "They" here refers to the wicked people.
* **How does God know? Does God know what goes on?** - These two rhetorical questions share similar meanings and are combined for emphasis. The wicked doubt God's ability to know all things. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
