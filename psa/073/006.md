## translationNotes

* Asaph continues to offer his thoughts about "the wicked."
* **Pride adorns them like a necklace around their neck; violence clothes them like a robe.** - This means the wicked do not try to hide their pride or violence. They show them openly so that everyone can see them just like a person wears a necklace or beautiful robe so every can see them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
* **necklace...robe** - A "necklace" is chain usually made of gold or jewels that a person wears around their neck. Both the necklace and the robe are symbols of a person's status and rank.
