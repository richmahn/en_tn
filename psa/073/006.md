# General Information:

Asaph continues to describe how he sometimes wants to complain to God about those who are "arrogant" and "wicked" ([Psalms 73:3](./001.md)).

# Pride adorns them like a necklace around their neck; violence clothes them like a robe

This means the wicked show everyone how proud and violent they are as if they were wearing a necklace or beautiful robe. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# necklace ... robe

This refers to things that rich and important people wear.

# necklace

a chain usually made of gold or jewels that goes around the neck

# Out of such blindness comes sin

Because they are like blind people who cannot see where they are going, they sin without knowing it. Being blind is a metaphor for a person being unable to see how wicked he is. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# evil thoughts pass through their hearts

Here the psalmist describes people's thoughts as if they were people. He also describes the inner beings of wicked people as if they were a building in which those people could walk. AT: "in their inner beings they are always thinking about more evil things to do" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
