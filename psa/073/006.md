Asaph continues to offer his thoughts about "the wicked."

## Pride adorns them like a necklace around their neck; violence clothes them like a robe. ##

This means the wicked do not try to hide their pride or violence. They show them openly so that everyone can see them just like a person wears a necklace or beautiful robe so every can see them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

## necklace...robe ##

A "necklace" is chain usually made of gold or jewels that a person wears around their neck. Both the necklace and the robe are symbols of a person's status and rank.
