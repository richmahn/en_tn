# Your rebuke made the waters ... they fled

These two phrases have basically the same meaning and are used together to emphasize how God spoke and the waters went away. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# recede

move back, go down

# they fled

Here the psalmist speaks about the waters receding as if they fled like an animal after hearing Yahweh's voice. The word "fled" means to run away quickly. Alternate translation: "rushed away" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
