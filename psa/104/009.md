# a boundary for them that they will not cross

Here the psalmist speaks of God causing the waters not to cross the boundary that he created for them as if the waters themselves chose not to cross it. They are described this way to emphasize God's authority over them. Alternate translation: "a boundary for them that they cannot cross" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
