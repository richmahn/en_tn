# Will your covenant faithfulness be proclaimed in the grave, your loyalty in the place of the dead?

Both questions mean the same thing. The writer uses questions to emphasize that a dead person is not able to praise God's faithfulness. The abstract nouns "faithfulness" and "loyalty" can be translated as adjectives. This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "Nobody will proclaim your covenant faithfulness or loyalty from the grave." or "Nobody will proclaim from the grave that you are faithful to your covenant and loyal to your people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# the grave ... the place of the dead 

These represent the place where people go after they die.

# your loyalty in the place of the dead?

This can be translated as a separate sentence. Alternate translation: "Will your loyalty be proclaimed in the place of the dead?" or "Those who are dead will not proclaim your loyalty." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
