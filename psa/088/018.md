# every friend and acquaintance

"every person I love and know"

# My only acquaintance is the darkness

This speaks about darkness as if it were a person that could be friends with someone else. The writer is emphasizing that he feels completely alone. Alternate translation: "Everywhere I go it is dark" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
