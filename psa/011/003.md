# For if the foundations are ruined, what can the righteous do?

Here "the foundations" may refer to law and order. This rhetorical question is asked to add emphasis. It can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: "Righteous people cannot do anything when evil people are not punished when they disobey the laws!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
