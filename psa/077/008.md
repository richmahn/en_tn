# General Information:

Because Asaph was not sure of the answer to these questions, they are probably literal questions and should be translated literally.

# Was his covenant faithfulness gone forever?

Asaph speaks of Yahweh no longer acting faithfully to his covenant as if Yahweh's covenant faithfulness had gone away. The abstract noun "faithfulness" can be translated with an adjective. AT: "Has he stopped being faithful to his covenant forever?" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# Had God forgotten to be gracious? Had his anger shut off his compassion?

These are two expressions stating similar concept of God not showing compassion. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# Had his anger shut off his compassion

Asaph speaks of anger as if it were a person shutting a door to keep another person, compassion, from coming out, AT: "Had God stopped showing us compassion because he was angry with us" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
