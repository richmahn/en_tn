# General Information:

Because Asaph was not sure of the answer to these questions, they are probably literal questions and should be translated literally.

# Was his covenant faithfulness gone forever?

Asaph speaks of Yahweh no longer acting faithfully to his covenant as if Yahweh's covenant faithfulness had gone away. The abstract noun "faithfulness" can be translated with an adjective. Alternate translation: "Has he stopped being faithful to his covenant forever?" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
