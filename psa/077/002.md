# I stretched my hands out

"I prayed with my arms extended"

# My soul refused to be comforted

The "soul" represents the person. This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "I would not allow anyone to try to comfort me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
