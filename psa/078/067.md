## translationNotes

* The writer continues to describe what God did for the people of Israel.
* **He rejected the tent of Joseph ... and he did not chose the tribe of Ephraim.** - These words mean almost the same thing. The writer uses them both to strongly say that it was not Joseph and his descendants with whom God chose to dwell. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
* **Joseph ... Ephraim** - Ephraim was Joseph's son.
* **Judah ... Mount Zion** - Mount Zion was in the land where the tribe of Judah lived.
