The writer continues to describe what God did for the people of Israel.

## He rejected the tent of Joseph ... and he did not chose the tribe of Ephraim. ##

These words mean almost the same thing. The writer uses them both to strongly say that it was not Joseph and his descendants with whom God chose to dwell. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## Joseph ... Ephraim ##

Ephraim was Joseph's son.

## Judah ... Mount Zion ##

Mount Zion was in the land where the tribe of Judah lived.
