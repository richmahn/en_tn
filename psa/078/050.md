# General Information:

The writer continues to describe what God did to the Egyptians.

# He leveled a path for his anger

The psalmist speaks of anger as if it were a person who could walk Yahweh getting ready to punish the people as if he were making a smooth road for a person to walk on. AT: "He was so angry that he did everything he could to harm them" or "It was as if his anger was an army and he made a smooth road for it to march on" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# he did not spare them from death

"he did not keep the Egyptians from dying" or "he did not permit the Egyptians to live"

# gave them over to the plague

Asaph speaks of the plague as if it were a person who was going to harm the Egyptians. AT: "he made them all very ill with the plague" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
