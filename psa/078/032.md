# did not believe his wonderful deeds

The word "deeds" is a metonym for God, who did the deeds. What they did not believe can be stated clearly. Alternate translation: "did not believe that he would take care of them even though he had done such wonderful deeds" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
