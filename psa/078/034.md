# to seek him

to ask him what they needed to do so he would protect them (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# afflicted them, they would ... they would return and look

These are different people from those whose days God "cut short." When some of them died, others would "start to seek" God.

# would return

"would repent" or "would be truly sorry for their sins"

# look earnestly

"look urgently" or "look as best they could"
