# General Information:

The writer continues to describe what God did for the people of Israel.

# challenged and defied

These words mean almost the same thing. The writer uses them both to emphasize that the Israelites did not believe that God would either provide for them or punish evil as he had said he would. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# challenged

They wanted God to prove that he could do what he said he would do before they would believe him. See how you translated this idea in [Psalms 78:18](./018.md).

# defied

refused to obey
