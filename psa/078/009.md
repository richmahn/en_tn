# The Ephraimites ... day of battle

This is possibly a metaphor for not keeping the covenant (verse 10), but it is best to translate literally.

# The Ephraimites

"The Ephraimite soldiers"

# were armed with bows

The soldiers probably also had arrows. AT: "had bows and arrows for weapons" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
