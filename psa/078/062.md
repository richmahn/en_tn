# General Information:

The writer continues to describe what God did for the people of Israel.

# He handed his people over to the sword

Asaph speaks of God's people as if they were a small object God would give as a gift, and of the sword, a metonym for death in war, as if it were a person who could receive a gift. Alternate translation: "He allowed people to kill all his people in war" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# he was angry with his heritage

"he was angry with the people he had said would be his forever"
