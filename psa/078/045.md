# swarms of flies

so many flies that it looked like a cloud

# that devoured them

The flies made the Egyptians almost as unhappy as they would have if they had eaten the Egyptians. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# overran their land

"went everywhere in their land"
