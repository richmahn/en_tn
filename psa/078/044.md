# General Information:

The writer describes what God did.

# swarms of flies

so many flies that it looked like a cloud

# that devoured them

The flies made the Egyptians almost as unhappy as they would have if they had eaten the Egyptians. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# gave their crops to the grasshopper and their labor to the locust

"allowed the grasshoppers to eat all their crops and allowed the locusts to eat everything they had worked hard to produce"

# overran their land

"went everywhere in their land"

# grasshopper

a plant-eating insect with long legs used for jumping

# He gave their crops to the grasshopper

Asaph speaks of the crops as a gift that God gave to the grasshoppers. AT: "He allowed the grasshopper to eat their crops" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# their labor to the locust

"he gave their labor to the locust." Asaph speaks of the people's labor as if it were a gift that God gave to the grasshoppers. The word "labor" is a metonym for the crops that their labor had produced. AT: "he allowed the locusts to eat the crops they had worked so hard to produce" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
