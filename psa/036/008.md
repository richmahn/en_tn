# They feast upon the abundance of your house

Eating much food as guests in a house is a metaphor for God providing all his people need. Alternate translation: "They will have all they need because you will provide it to them" or "You have plenty to give, and you will provide them with all they need" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# you let them drink from the river of your delights

There are two metaphors here. God's abundant blessings are spoken of as if they are the water in a flowing river. Also, those who receive those blessings are spoken of as if they are drinking them like water. Alternate translation: "your precious blessings are like a river from which you will let them drink" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
