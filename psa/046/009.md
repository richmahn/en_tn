# He makes wars cease

"He makes nations stop fighting wars"

# to the ends of the earth

This is an idiom that refers to everywhere in the word. Alternate translation: "everywhere in the world" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# he breaks the bow ... burns up the shields

One way in which Yahweh will make all wars to cease is by destroying the weapons that the armies use to fight one another.
