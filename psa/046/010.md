## I will be exalted among the nations; I will be exalted on the earth ##

These two phrases mean basically the same thing and are used together to emphasize that God will be exalted everywhere. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## God of Jacob is our refuge ##

See how you translated this in [Psalms 46:6](./006.md).
