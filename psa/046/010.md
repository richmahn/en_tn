# Be quiet and know that I am God

Here, God begins to speak.

# Be quiet

In this context, these words are likely a command to the nations to stop their wars. AT: "Stop fighting" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# know that I am God

Here the word "know" means to understand and to confess that Yahweh is the true God.

# I will be exalted among the nations; I will be exalted on the earth

These two phrases mean basically the same thing and emphasize that the people of every nation in the world will exalt God. This can be stated in active form. AT: "People from every nation will exalt me; people all over the earth will exalt me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
