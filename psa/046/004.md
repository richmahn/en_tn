# There is a river whose streams make the city of God happy

The imagery of a running river symbolizes peace and prosperity for the city of God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage]])

# make the city of God happy

The phrase "the city of God" refers to Jerusalem, and represents the people who live in that city. AT: "make the people who live in Jerusalem happy" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# the holy place where the Most High dwells

This phrase describes "the city of God." AT: "the holy place where the Most High lives" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# in the middle of her; she will not be moved ... help her

The words "her" and "she" refer to "the city of God."

# she will not be moved

Here, the word "moved" is the same word translated as "shaken" in [Psalms v. 2](./001.md). The writer speaks of the destruction of Jerusalem by armies as if an earthquake were to destroy it. This can be stated in active form. AT: "nothing will be able destroy her" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
