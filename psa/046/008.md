# He makes wars cease

"He makes nations stop fighting wars"

# to the ends of the earth

This is an idiomatic expression that means everywhere in the word. AT: "everywhere in the world" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# he breaks the bow ... burns up the shields

One way in which Yahweh will make all wars to cease is by destroying the weapons that the armies use to fight one another.
