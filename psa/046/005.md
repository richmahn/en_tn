# in the middle of her; she will not be moved ... help her

The words "her" and "she" refer to "the city of God."

# she will not be moved

Here, the word "moved" is the same word translated as "shaken" in [Psalms v. 2](./001.md). The writer speaks of the destruction of Jerusalem by armies as if an earthquake were to destroy it. This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "nothing will be able destroy her" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
