# General Information:

Parallelism is common in Hebrew poetry. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# with my whole heart

Here the word "heart" represents the person's entire inner being and emotions. AT: "with all that I am" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# in the assembly of the upright, in their gathering

These two phrases mean that same thing and may be combined if necessary. AT: "in the gathering of upright people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
