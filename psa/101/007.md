# Deceitful people will not ... liars will not

These two phrases have the same idea and are used together to emphasize how David will not tolerate deceitful people. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# liars will not be welcome

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "I will not welcome liars" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# before my eyes

Here "my eyes" refers to David himself. Alternate translation: "before me" or "in my presence" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
