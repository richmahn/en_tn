# what can man do to me?

The writer asks this rhetorical question to emphasize that there is nothing that man can do to hurt him since Yahweh is with him. This question can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: "people cannot do anything to harm me." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
