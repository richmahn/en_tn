# They surrounded me like bees

The writer compares the enemy armies to a swarm of bees. AT: "They surrounded me like a swarm of bees would surround a person" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# they disappeared as quickly as fire among thorns

Just like dry thorns burn out quickly, the attack of the enemy armies was quickly over. AT: "their attack lasted only a short time, as a fire that consumes thorns quickly dies" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
