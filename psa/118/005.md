# what can man do to me?

The writer asks this rhetorical question to emphasize that there is nothing that man can do to hurt him since Yahweh is with him. This question can be translated as a statement. AT: "people cannot do anything to harm me." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Yahweh is on my side as my helper

To be on one's side is an idiomatic expression that indicates that that person approves of and will help another. AT: "Yahweh approves of me and will help me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# I will look in triumph on those who hate me
