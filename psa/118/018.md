# Yahweh has punished me

"Yahweh has disciplined me"

# he has not handed me over to death

The writer speaks of death as if it were a person under whose power Yahweh could place the writer. AT: "he has not allowed me to die" or "he has not allowed my enemies to kill me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
