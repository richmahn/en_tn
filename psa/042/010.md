# As with a sword in my bones

The writer describes his adversaries' rebukes as his receiving a fatal wound. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# they always say to me

This is an exaggeration; his enemies are not saying this constantly but are saying it often. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# Where is your God?

The writer's enemies use this question to mock him and to express that they do not see God helping him. AT: "Your God is not here to help you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
