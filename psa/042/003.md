# My tears have been my food

The author refers to his tears as if they are food that he eats. This means that he is so sad that he cannot eat. Alternate translation: "My tears are like my food and I eat nothing else" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# day and night

This phrase refers to the entire day by referring to both its beginning and end. Alternate translation: "all day long" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])

# my enemies are always saying to me

This is an exaggeration. His enemies are not saying this constantly; they are saying it often. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# Where is your God?

The author's enemies use this question to mock him and to express that they do not see his God helping him. Alternate translation: "Your God is not here to help you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
