# He will remain before God forever

Here "to remain before God" means to be in God's presence or to be with God. This can be stated clearly in the translation. Alternate translation: "God will be with him forever" or "God will be with the king forever" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
