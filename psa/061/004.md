# take refuge under the shelter of your wings

Going to Yahweh for protection is spoken of as taking refuge in him. Here there is a second metaphor that speaks of Yahweh's protection as if he was a hen protecting her baby chicks under her wings. AT: "go to you for protection as a chick is safe under the wings of its mother" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
