# you have lifted me up to throw me down

God has not literally lifted and thrown David's body to the ground; rather David says this to describe what he is feeling and experiencing. Alternate translation: "it is like you have lifted me up to throw me down" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
