# Yahweh writes in the census book of the nations

Yahweh acknowledging that the people from other nations belong to him is spoken of as if he were a king writing down the names of the people who live in his city. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# This one was born there

"This one" refers to the people from the nations that the writer mentions. Although they were not physically born in Zion, those who follow God are natives of Jerusalem spiritually. See how you translated this in [Psalms 87:4](./004.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
