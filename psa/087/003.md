# Glorious things are said of you, city of God

The writer speaks to the city of Jerusalem as if it were listening to him. This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "You people in Jerusalem, other people say wonderful things about your city" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
