# Hear my prayer

The words "my prayer" are a metonym for the person who is praying. See how these words are translated in [Psalms 39:12](../039/012.md). Alternate translation: "Listen to me as I pray to you" or "Be willing to do what I ask you to do" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
