# I will raise the cup of salvation

This is probably a reference to a drink offering, which was a sacrifice that involved pouring wine on the altar, and which the writer will offer in response to Yahweh saving him. The full meaning of this statement can be made explicit. Alternate translation: "I will present a drink offering to Yahweh because he saved me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# call on the name of Yahweh

Here the word "name" represents Yahweh himself. Alternate translation: "call on Yahweh" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
