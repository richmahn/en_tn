# the son of your servant woman

This is likely a reference to the writer's mother and indicates that she faithfully worshiped Yahweh. The full meaning of this can be made clear. AT: "as my mother was" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# you have taken away my bonds

The writer speaks of being in danger of dying as if he had been chained in prison. AT: "you have saved me from death" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the sacrifice of thanksgiving

"a sacrifice to express my thankfulness"

# will call on the name of Yahweh

Here the word "name" represents Yahweh himself. AT: "will call on Yahweh" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
