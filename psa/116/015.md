# Precious in the sight of Yahweh is the death of his saints

The word "Precious" here does not imply that Yahweh values the death of his saints, but that the death of his saints is costly to him and grieves him. Here sight represents judgment or evaluation.  AT: "Yahweh considers the death of his saints to be a costly thing" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
