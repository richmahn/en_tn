The person who made this song continues to speak.

## I will fulfill...all his people ##

See how you translated this in [Psalms 116:12](./012.md).

## in the courts of Yahweh's house ##

"in the courtyards of the temple of Yahweh"

## in your midst, Jerusalem ##

The singer speaks to Jerusalem as though it were a person. AT: "in Jerusalem." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
