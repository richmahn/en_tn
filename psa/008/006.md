# You make him to rule over the works ... you have put all things under his feet

These two clauses express similar meanings. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# You make him ... under his feet

"you make them ... under their feet." The words "him" and "his" here refer to people.

# the works of your hands

The hands represent what God has done. Alternate translation: "the things that you made" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# you have put all things under his feet

Having authority to rule others or control things is spoken of as having them under one's feet. This means God gave people authority over all that he created. Alternate translation: "you have given him authority over all things" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
