# General Information:

Now Yahweh tells what actually happened after he warned the people.

# to my words

"to what I said" or "to me"

# So I gave them over to their own stubborn way

God allowing the people to remain stubborn is spoken of as if God were giving them over to an enemy to let the enemy harm them. AT: "Therefore, I let them be stubborn" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
