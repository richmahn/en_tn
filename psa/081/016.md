# I would feed Israel with the finest wheat

God causing the best wheat to grow in Israel is spoken of as if he would literally feed the wheat to the people. AT: "I would allow the Israelites to eat the finest wheat" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# feed Israel ... satisfy you

Both "Israel" and "you" refer to the Israelites.

# honey out of the rock
