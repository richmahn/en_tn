Yahweh reminds the people what he said while they were in the desert.

## for I will warn you, ##

"because I am giving you a warning,"

## Israel ##

The name of the country represents the people (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]]). Yahweh talks to the nation as if it was a person (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

## if you would only listen to me! ##

"but you must start listening to me!"

## Open your mouth wide, and I will fill it. ##

AT: "Tell me what you want me to do for you and I will do it." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
