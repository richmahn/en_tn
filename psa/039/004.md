## Yahweh, make me know â€¦ the extent of my days ##

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## Show me how transient I am ##

AT: "Show me how quick my life is" or "Show me how soon I will die"

## See, you have made my days only the width of my hand ##

AT: "It seems that you have caused me to live only a short time;" (UDB). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## Surely every man is a single breath. ##

AT: "The time that humans live is too short." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
