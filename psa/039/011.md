# consume the things they desire like a moth

God will take away the things they value in the same way as a moth eats a piece of cloth. Alternate translation: "consume the things they desire like a moth eats away at clothing" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# all people are nothing but vapor

The writer speaks of the frailty of people as if they were mist that disappears quickly. Alternate translation: "everyone is completely fragile" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
