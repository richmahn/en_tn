# or of the plague that roams

The psalmist speaks of illness as if it were a person who went about at night killing other people. Alternate translation: "You will not be afraid of dying from illness" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# roams

goes wherever he wants to go at any time

# in the darkness ... at noontime

These two phrases taken together refer to all possible times of night and day. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])

# disease
