# No evil will overtake you

The writer speaks of a person experiencing bad or evil things as if evil were a person who overtakes another person. Alternate translation: "Nothing evil will happen to you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# no affliction will come near your home
