# I will say of Yahweh

"I will say about Yahweh"

# my refuge and my fortress

A "refuge" is any place a person can go and have someone or something protect him. A "fortress" is something that people make so they can protect themselves and their property. Asaph uses them here as metaphors for protection. AT: "the one to whom I can go and he will protect me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
