# They will lift you

"Yahweh's angels will lift you"

# you will not hit your foot on a stone

The angels will protect not only the reader's foot but the rest of his body as well. The words "not ... hit your foot on a stone" is an exaggerated metonym to say that not even small bad things will happen. This should probably not be taken as a promise that no bad things will ever happen again. AT: "you will not even hit your foot on a stone" or "not even the smallest bad thing will happen to you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# You will crush lions and adders under your feet; you will trample on young lions and serpents

Where "hit your foot on a stone" is a minor problem, lions and snake are examples of great dangers. The psalmist speaks of lions and snakes as if they were small enough to be crushed under a person's foot. AT: "You will be able kill lions and adders as if they were small animals you could crush under your feet" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# adders

types of poisonous snake.

# trample
