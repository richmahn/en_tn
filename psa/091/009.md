# Yahweh is my refuge

The writer speaks of Yahweh protecting him as if Yahweh were a safe place for him to find protection from his enemies. Alternate translation: "Yahweh protects me, like a person finds protection in a place of refuge" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Make the Most High your refuge also

"You should make the Most High your refuge also." The psalmist stops speaking to God and speaks to the reader.
