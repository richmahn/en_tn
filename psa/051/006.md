# See, you desire trustworthiness

The use of "See" here draw our attention to the contrast between this sentence and "See, I was born in iniquity" (verse 5). "Truly I was born in iniquity ... But you desire trustworthiness"

# you desire trustworthiness in my inner self

The "inner self" represents either 1) the person's desires or 2) the whole person. Alternate translation: "you want me to desire trustworthiness" or "you want me to be trustworthy" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
