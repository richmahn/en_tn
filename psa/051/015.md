# Lord, open my lips, and my mouth will express your praise

Here the person is represented by his "mouth." Being able to talk is spoken of as the lips being open. Here not being able to speak is a symbol of being guilty of sin and not being able to make a defense. Alternate translation: "Lord, make me able to speak, and I will praise you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
