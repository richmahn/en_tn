## translationNotes

* **shedding blood** - This phrase refers to killing another person. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
* **Lord, open my lips, and my mouth will express your praise** - When David asks Yahweh to allow him to speak again, he refers to the part of his body he speaks with. Here not being able to speak is a symbol of being guilty of sin and not being able to make a defense. In this way, being allowed to speak means being forgiven of sin. AT: “Lord, allow me to speak, and I will be able to praise you.” (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
