## Lord, open my lips, and my mouth will express your praise ##

When David asks Yahweh to allow him to speak again, he refers to the part of his body he speaks with. Here not being able to speak is a symbol of being guilty of sin and not being able to make a defense. In this way, being allowed to speak means being forgiven of sin. AT: “Lord, allow me to speak, and I will be able to praise you.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
