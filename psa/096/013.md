# He is coming to judge the earth. He will judge the world ... and the peoples

The three phrase have similar meanings; the last two phases are used to strengthen the first. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# to judge ... will judge

Another possible meaning is "to rule ... will rule."

# He will judge the world with righteousness

Here "the world" is a metonym for all the people in the world. See how these words are translated in [Psalms 9:8](../009/008.md). AT: "He will judge all the people of the world righteously" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# the peoples with his faithfulness

The words "he will judge" are understood. AT: "he will judge the peoples with his faithfulness" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# with his faithfulness

The can be restated to remove the abstract noun "faithfulness." Possible meanings are 1) AT: "fairly, according to what he knows is true" or 2) AT: "using the same standard for all people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
