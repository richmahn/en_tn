# Ascribe to Yahweh ... ascribe praise to Yahweh for his glory and strength

This can be restated to removed the abstract nouns "praise," "glory," and "strength." See how these words are translated in [Psalms 29:1](../029/001.md). AT: "Praise Yahweh ... praise Yahweh because he is glorious and strong" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
