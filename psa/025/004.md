# Make known to me your ways, Yahweh; teach me your paths

Both statements mean the same thing. God teaching a person how they should behave is spoken of as if he were showing a person the correct path on which a person should travel. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# I hope in you

"I depend on you" or "I wait patiently for you"

# Guide me into your truth and teach me

Guide and teach mean the same thing, to give instruction. AT: "Instruct me to conduct my life by obeying your truth" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# the God of my salvation

The abstract noun "salvation" can be stated as "saves." AT: "the one who saves me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
