The abstract noun "strength" can be stated as an adjective. Alternate translation: "You make them wonderfully strong" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# You are their

# we are victorious

Here "we" refers to the writer and the Israelites but not to Yahweh, to whom he speaks. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
