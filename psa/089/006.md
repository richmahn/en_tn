# For who in the skies can be compared to Yahweh? Who among the sons of the gods is like Yahweh?

Both questions mean the same thing. The writer is using question to emphasize that there in no one in heaven like Yahweh. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# sons of the gods

Here "sons of" means having the characteristics of. This is a way of referring to other spiritual beings that live in heaven. Alternate translation: "angels" or "divine beings" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
