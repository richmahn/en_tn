# You have shortened the days of his youth

This is a way of saying God made the king seem old even while he was still young. AT: "Even while he is young you have made him weak like an old man" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# covered him with shame

Yahweh completely humiliating the king is spoken of as if shame were a garment that God used to cover the king. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
