# I will place his hand over the sea and his right hand over the rivers

Here "hand" and "right hand" represent power and authority. Here "the sea" seems to refer to the Mediterranean Sea west of Israel, and "rivers" refers to the Euphrates river in the east. This means David will have authority over everything from the sea to the river. Alternate translation: "I will give him authority over everything from the Mediterranean sea to the Euphrates river" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
