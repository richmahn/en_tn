# General Information:

Parallelism is common in Hebrew poetry. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# Why, Yahweh, do you stand far off? Why do you hide yourself in times of trouble?

The speaker uses these questions to express his distress that God has not helped him. Alternate translation: "Yahweh, it seems as though you are far away from me and you hide from me whenever I am in trouble" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
