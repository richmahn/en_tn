"you know the path I should take." The psalmist speaks as if what a person does were a path that that person walked along. AT: "you know the way I should live" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# In the way that I walk they have hidden a trap for me

The psalmist speaks of people wanting to harm him as if they were trying to trap an animal. AT: "They are making plans so that whatever I do they can harm me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
