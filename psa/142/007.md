# Bring my soul out of prison

This is a request. The "soul" represents the whole person. AT: "bring me out of prison" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# give thanks to your name

The word "name" is a metonym for the person. See how you translated this in [Psalms 5:11](../005/011.md). AT: "give thanks to you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
