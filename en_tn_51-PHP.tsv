Greeting, thanksgiving and prayer (1:1-11)<br>1. Paul’s report on his ministry (1:12-26)<br>1. Instructions<br>    - To be steadfast (1:27-30)<br>    - To be united (2:1-2)<br>    - To be humble (2:3-11)<br>    - To work out our salvation with God working in you (2:12-13)<br>    - To be innocent and light (2:14-18)<br>1.

Final remarks<br>    - Values (4:8-9)<br>    - Contentment (4:10-20)<br>    - Final Greetings (4:21-23)<br><br>### Who wrote the Book Philippians?<br><br>Paul wrote Philippians. Paul was from the city of Tarsus. He had been known as Saul in his early life. Before becoming a Christian, Paul was a Pharisee. He persecuted Christians. After he became a Christian, he traveled several times throughout the Roman Empire telling people about Jesus.<br><br>Paul wrote this letter while in prison in Rome.<br><br>### What is the Book of Philippians about?<br><br>Paul wrote this letter to the believers in Philippi, a city in Macedonia. He wrote it to thank the Philippians for the gift they had sent him. He wanted to tell them about how he was doing in prison and to encourage them to rejoice even if they are suffering. He also wrote to them about a man named Epaphroditus. He was the one who brought the gift to Paul. While visiting Paul, Epaphroditus became ill. So, Paul decided to send him back to Philippi. Paul encouraged the believers in Philippi to welcome and to be kind to Epaphroditus when he returns.<br><br>### How should the title of this book be translated?<br><br>Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “Philippians.” Or they may choose a clearer title, such as “Paul’s Letter to the Church in Philippi,” or “A Letter to the Christians in Philippi.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])<br><br>## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts<br><br>### What was the city of Philippi like?<br><br>Philip, the father of Alexander the Great, founded Philippi in the region of Macedonia. This meant that the citizens of Philippi were also considered citizens of Rome. The people of Philippi were proud of being citizens of Rome. But Paul told the believers that they are citizens of heaven (3:20).<br><br>## Part 3: Important Translation Issues<br><br>### Singular and plural “you”<br><br>In this book, the word “I” refers to Paul. The words “you” and “your” always refer to the believers in Philippi except for one time in 4:3. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])<br><br>### Who were the “enemies of the cross of Christ” (3:18) in this letter?<br><br>The “enemies of the cross of Christ” were probably people who called themselves believers, but they did not obey God’s commands. They thought that freedom in Christ meant that believers could do whatever they desired and God would not punish them (3:19).<br><br>### Why were the words “joy” and “rejoice” frequently used in this letter?<br><br>Paul was in prison when he wrote this letter (1:7). Even though he suffered, Paul said many times that he was joyful because God had been kind to him through Jesus Christ. He wanted to encourage his readers to have the same trust in Jesus Christ. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])<br><br>### What does Paul mean by the expression “in Christ,” “in the Lord,” etc.?<br><br>This kind of expression occurs in 1:1, 8, 13, 14, 26, 27; 2:1, 5, 19, 24, 29; 3:1, 3, 9, 14; 4:1, 2, 4, 7, 10, 13, 19, 21. Paul meant to express the idea of a very close union with Christ and the believers. See the introduction to the Book of Romans for more details about this kind of expression.<br><br>### What are the major issues in the text of the Book of Philippians?<br><br>Some versions have “Amen” at the end of the final verse in the letter (4:23). The ULT, UST, and other many modern versions do not. If “Amen” is included, it should be put inside square brackets ([]) to indicate that it is probably not original to the Book of Philippians.<br><br>(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
PHP	1	intro	kd3g			0		# Philippians 1 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Paul includes a prayer in the beginning of this letter. At that time, religious leaders sometimes began informal letters with a prayer.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### The day of Christ<br><br>This probably refers to the day when Christ returns. Paul often connected the return of Christ with motivating godly living. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/godly]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Paradox<br><br>A paradox is a true statement that appears to describe something impossible. This statement in verse 21 is a paradox: “to die is gain.” In verse 23 Paul explains why this is true. ([Philippians 1:21](../../php/01/21.md))

Paul’s audience would have understood that he was referring to his body. If this would be confusing in your language consider using a different word or phrase to avoid misunderstanding. See UST.

Both of these phrases are used figuratively to mean “to have unity in ones primary purposes and beliefs”. Both phrases refer to being in agreement about what matters.

PHP	2	intro	ixw8			0		# Philippians 2 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Some translations, like the ULT, set apart the lines of verses 6-11.

PHP	2	19	uvzh	figs-ellipsis	κἀγὼ εὐψυχῶ	1		Here, the word **also** indicates that there is an ellipsis in the words that follow it. The word **also** expresses and implies that if Paul was able to send Timothy to the Philippian Christians, that they would be encouraged by news of Paul also. If this would be unclear in your language consider stating this explicitly. Alternate translation: “I, as well as you, might be encouraged” or see UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
PHP	2	20	d9mw		οὐδένα γὰρ ἔχω ἰσόψυχον	1	For I have no one like-minded	Alternate translation: “For I have no one else who loves you like I do, except Timothy”
PHP	2	21	b922	figs-explicit	οἱ πάντες γὰρ τὰ ἑαυτῶν ζητοῦσιν, οὐ τὰ Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	For they all	Here, the words **they** and **their** refer to a group of people Paul does not feel he can trust to send to Philippi. If this would be unclear in your language consider stating that explicitly. Alternate translation: “All the other people I might send to you seek what they want and not the things Jesus Christ wants” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
PHP	2	21	ycle	figs-abstractnouns	τὰ ἑαυτῶν ζητοῦσιν, οὐ τὰ Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ	1		Alternate translation: “what they care about and not what Jesus Christ cares about” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
PHP	2	22	gm8i	figs-simile	ὡς πατρὶ τέκνον	1	as a child with his father, he served with me	Sons try to follow and imitate their fathers and often want to work alongside their fathers as they work. Paul was not Timothy’s biological father but uses this simile to illustrate how Timothy worked alongside him as a spiritual son so that together they advanced the gospel. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
PHP	2	22	clvw	figs-abstractnouns	τὴν δὲ δοκιμὴν αὐτοῦ γινώσκετε	1		If it would be clearer in your language you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **worth** with an adjective such as “valuable.” Alternate translation: “But you know how valuable Timothy is” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
PHP	2	22	xdn5	figs-metonymy	εἰς τὸ εὐαγγέλιον	1	in the gospel	Here, **the gospel** means the work of advancing the gospel. If this would be unclear in your language consider stating this explicitly.

PHP	2	24	yn62		πέποιθα…ἐν Κυρίῳ, ὅτι καὶ αὐτὸς ταχέως ἐλεύσομαι	1	I am confident in the Lord that I myself will also come soon	Alternate translation: “I am sure, if it is the Lord’s will, that I will also come soon”
PHP	2	24	l7mv		πέποιθα	1		The phrase **I trust** expresses a stronger idea of confidence than the phrase **I hope** in verse 23. Make sure that your translation reflects this.
PHP	2	24	qqpo	figs-explicit	ὅτι καὶ αὐτὸς ταχέως ἐλεύσομαι.	1		Here, the word **also** expresses that Paul was confident that he would be able to visit the Philippian Christians, in addition to sending Timothy to them. If this would be unclear in your language consider stating this explicitly. Alternate translation: “that I myself, in addition to Timothy, will also come soon” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
PHP	2	24	wbpc	figs-go	ὅτι καὶ αὐτὸς ταχέως ἐλεύσομαι	1		Your language may say “go” instead of **come** in contexts such as this. Alternate translation: “that I myself will also go soon” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])
PHP	2	25	k4wz	translate-names	Ἐπαφρόδιτον	1	Epaphroditus	This is the name of a man sent by the Philippian church to minister to Paul in prison. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
PHP	2	25	csw5	figs-metaphor	ἀδελφὸν…μου	1		Here, the phrase **my brother** does not mean that Epaphroditus was Paul’s biological brother. Rather, Paul calls Epaphroditus his **brother** because they were both members of God’s spiritual family through their faith in Jesus Christ. If this would be unclear in your language consider stating this explicitly. Alternate translation: “my spiritual brother” or “my brother in Christ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
PHP	2	25	c3ce	figs-metaphor	συνστρατιώτην	1	fellow worker and fellow soldier	Here, the phrase **fellow soldier** does not mean that Epaphroditus and Paul were actual soldiers in a military. What Paul means is that he and Epaphroditus were spiritual soldiers fighting together for God in the spiritual battle against Satan and evil. If this would be unclear in your language you could express this explicitly or modify the phrase **fellow soldier** to further explain what Paul means here. Alternate translation: “fellow believer who works and struggles along with us” or “fellow soldier of God” or “fellow warrior of God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

If this would be unclear in your language consider clarifying this in your translation.

If this would be unclear in your language consider clarifying this in your translation. Alternate translation: “For indeed Epaphroditus was sick nearly to death. But God had mercy on him, and not on him only, but also on me, so that I might not have sorrow upon sorrow” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
PHP	2	27	rl0m	figs-abstractnouns	ἠσθένησεν παραπλήσιον θανάτῳ	1		If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **death** with an adjective such as “dying”. Alternate translation: “he was sick nearly to the point of dying” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
PHP	2	27	n0zd	figs-abstractnouns	ἀλλὰ ὁ Θεὸς ἠλέησεν	1		If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **mercy** with an adjective such as “merciful”.

PHP	2	27	ioqq	figs-explicit	λύπην ἐπὶ λύπην	1		If the expression **sorrow upon sorrow** would be unclear in your language consider using an equivalent expression from your language or state the meaning of this phrase explicitly. Alternate translation: “sorrow added to sorrow” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
PHP	2	27	dzgz		λύπην ἐπὶ λύπην	1		The expression **sorrow upon sorrow** could mean: (1) adding the sorrow of Epaphroditus’ death to the sorrow of Epaphroditus’ sickness.

If this would be unclear in your language consider clarifying this in your translation. Alternate translation: “Therefore, I sent Epaphroditus all the more eagerly, so that, having seen him again, you might rejoice, and I might be free from pain” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
PHP	2	28	y5gc		κἀγὼ ἀλυπότερος ὦ	1	and I might be free from pain	Alternate translation: “and I might be less anxious” or “and I might be less concerned about you”
PHP	2	29	y95x	figs-yousingular	προσδέχεσθε οὖν αὐτὸν	1	Therefore welcome him	The word **welcome** is a command given to the Philippian Christians in the plural form. In the original language that Paul wrote this letter in the word **welcome** could be translated as “you welcome”. If your language has a plural command form that would be appropriate to use in this context, consider using it in your translation of this word. Alternate translation: “I exhort each of you to welcome” or “each of you welcome” or “all of you welcome” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])<br><br>
PHP	2	29	qx14	figs-abstractnouns	ἐν Κυρίῳ μετὰ πάσης χαρᾶς	1	in the Lord with all joy	If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **joy** with an adverb such as “joyfully” as the UST does or you can use a verbal form of this word such as “rejoicing”. Alternate translation: “Therefore, welcome him in the Lord with rejoicing” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
PHP	2	29	l59w		ἐντίμους ἔχετε	1		The phrase **hold in honor** is a command given to the Philippian Christians in the plural form. In the original language that Paul wrote this letter in the phrase **hold in honor** could be translated as “you hold in honor”.

Alternate translation: “I exhort each of you to hold in honor” or “each of you honor” or “all of you honor” 
PHP	2	30	ns1y	writing-pronouns	ὅτι διὰ τὸ ἔργον Χριστοῦ μέχρι θανάτου ἤγγισεν, παραβολευσάμενος τῇ ψυχῇ, ἵνα ἀναπληρώσῃ τὸ ὑμῶν ὑστέρημα, τῆς πρός με λειτουργίας	1	he came near even to death	Here, the pronouns **he** and **him** refer to Epaphroditus. If this would be unclear in your language consider clarifying this in your translation. Alternate translation: “since for the sake of the work of Christ, Epaphroditus came near even to death, risking his life so that he might make up your lack of service to me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
PHP	2	30	g98z		ἵνα ἀναπληρώσῃ τὸ ὑμῶν ὑστέρημα, τῆς πρός με λειτουργίας	1	he might make up your lack of service to me	The **lack of service** Paul speaks of here is the inability of the Philippian believers to be present with him in prison. By sending Epaphroditus to Paul, the Philippian believers ministered to his needs through Epaphroditus and so Epaphroditus supplied what they could not. Alternate translation: “so that he might supply what you could not give me” or “so that he might make up for what you could not give”
PHP	3	intro	btx3			0		# Philippians 3 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>In verses 4-8, Paul lists how he qualifies for being considered a righteous Jew. In every way, Paul was an exemplary Jew. But he contrasts this with the greatness of knowing Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]])<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Dogs<br><br>The people of the ancient Near East used dogs as an image to refer to people in a negative way. Not all cultures use the term “dogs” in this way.<br><br>### Resurrected Bodies<br><br>We know very little about what people will be like in heaven. Paul teaches here that Christians will have some kind of glorious body and will be free from sin. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/heaven]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Prize<br><br>Paul uses an extended illustration to describe the Christian life. The goal of the Christian life is attempting to grow to be like Christ until a person dies. We can never achieve this goal perfectly, but we must strive for it.
PHP	3	1	zu9l	figs-gendernotations	ἀδελφοί	1	brothers	Although the term **brothers** is masculine, Paul is using the word here in a spiritual sense to include both men and women who believe in Jesus. See how you translated this word in [Philippians 1:12](../01/12.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]]) 
PHP	3	1	ymm2	figs-yousingular	χαίρετε ἐν Κυρίῳ	1	rejoice in the Lord	The word **rejoice** is a command given to the Philippian Christians in the plural form. In the original language that Paul wrote this letter in, the word **rejoice** could be translated as “you rejoice”. If your language has a plural command form that would be appropriate to use in this context, consider using it in your translation of this word. Alternate translation: “I exhort each of you to rejoice in the Lord” or “each of you rejoice in the Lord” or “all of you rejoice in the Lord” (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular)
PHP	3	1	qb78	figs-explicit	ὑμῖν δὲ ἀσφαλές	1	and is a safeguard for you	If it would be helpful in your language you can state explicitly how writing these things is a **safeguard** for the Philippians. Alternate translation: “because these teachings will protect you from those who teach what is false” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
PHP	3	2	ttws		βλέπετε	1		All three times that the phrase **Beware of** occurs in this verse it is a command given to the Philippian Christians in the plural form. If your language has a plural command form that would be appropriate to use in this context, consider using it in your translation of this phrase. Alternate translation: “I exhort each of you to beware of” or “Each of you beware of”
PHP	3	2	ny6y		βλέπετε	1	Beware	Alternate translation: “Watch out for” or “Look out for” or “Be on guard against”
PHP	3	2	zin8		τοὺς κύνας…τοὺς κακοὺς ἐργάτας…τὴν κατατομήν	1	the dogs … the evil workers … the mutilation	The phrases **the dogs**, **the evil workers**, and **the mutilation** are three different ways of describing the same group of Jewish teachers who were corrupting the gospel. Paul uses strong expressions to convey his feeling about these Jewish teachers.
PHP	3	2	yeax	translate-unknown	τοὺς κύνας	1	the dogs	Paul speaks of the Jewish teachers who were corrupting the gospel as though they were **dogs** in order to show strong contempt for them. A dog is an animal that is common in many parts of the world. Dogs are despised in some cultures but not despised in other cultures so using the term **dogs** in some cultures may not have the derogatory meaning that Paul intended. If you have a different animal in your culture that is despised or whose name is used as an insult, you could use this animal instead if it would fit well in this context. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])<br>
PHP	3	2	i40z		βλέπετε	2		See how you translated the phrase **beware of** earlier in this verse.
PHP	3	2	n44a		κακοὺς ἐργάτας	1		Here, the phrase **evil workers** refers to Jewish teachers who were teaching things that were contrary to the gospel.
PHP	3	2	h2ai		βλέπετε	3		See how you translated the phrase **beware of** earlier in this verse.
PHP	3	2	vc2u	translate-unknown	τὴν κατατομήν	1		The word **mutilation** is a sarcastic way of referring to circumcision and **the mutilation** is a sarcastic way of referring to those who taught that circumcision was necessary in order to be in right standing with God. At the time Paul wrote this letter it was a common practice for those who practiced false religions to cut themselves in order to try to earn favor from their god. By using the term **mutilation**, Paul is showing the Philippian believers that those who trust in circumcision, and not solely in Christ, are like pagan false worshipers who mistakenly think that they can earn God’s favor by cutting their bodies. Consider the term that would best communicate this idea in your language. Alternate translation: “those who cut themselves” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])<br>
PHP	3	2	x8r2	figs-metonymy	τὴν κατατομήν	1	the mutilation	Here, **the mutilation** refers to the Jewish teachers who were all circumcised and were corrupting the gospel <br>by teaching that it was necessary to be circumcised. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
PHP	3	3	y8yt	figs-exclusive	ἡμεῖς γάρ ἐσμεν	1	For we are	Here, Paul uses **we** to refer to himself and all true believers in Christ, including the Philippian believers. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
PHP	3	3	xt5r		ἡ περιτομή	1	the circumcision	Here, the term **the circumcision** is used metonymously to refer to all true Christians. Here, Paul is using this term in contrast to its normal usage in the Bible. Normally the term **the circumcision** was used to refer to Jewish males since all Jewish males were circumcised at this time. Here, Paul intentionally uses this term in a way that would have been surprising to his readers. Here, Paul uses this term with a spiritual sense to refer to all Christians, both Jews and non-Jews. Paul uses the term **the circumcision** here, to refer to the inward, spiritual circumcision that the Holy Spirit performs in the hearts of all true Christians. Paul discusses this spiritual circumcision in [Romans 11:21–24](../11/21-24.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]]) 
PHP	3	3	wn2n		 οἱ Πνεύματι Θεοῦ λατρεύοντες	1		Alternate translation: “the ones who are empowered by God’s Spirit to worship him” or “the ones who are enabled to worship God by his Spirit” or “the ones who worship God through his Spirit”
PHP	3	3	k8ph	figs-ellipsis	οὐκ ἐν σαρκὶ πεποιθότες	1	having no confidence in the flesh	Here, the phrase **confidence in the flesh** is leaving out some implied words that would need to be supplied in some languages in order to make this idea complete. Paul is leaving out the words “works of the” in this phrase and means **having no confidence in the works of the flesh**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could supply these words which are implied from the context. Alternate translation: “having no confidence in the works of the flesh” or “not trusting that circumcision will please God” “not trusting that circumcision will earn God’s favor” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
PHP	3	3	nkrs		καυχώμενοι ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ, καὶ οὐκ ἐν σαρκὶ πεποιθότες	1		The phrase **boasting in Christ Jesus** and the phrase **and having no confidence in the flesh** are complementary ideas which express a similar truth. If a person truly places their confidence in Christ as their only means of earning God’s favor they will not put their confidence in themself or religious acts and conversely if a person puts their confidence in religious rituals and observances they cannot place their full confidence in Christ. Consider the best way to clearly express the coordinate ideas in your language. See UST. 
PHP	3	4	upw5	figs-hypo	ἐγὼ ἔχων πεποίθησιν καὶ ἐν σαρκί. εἴ τις δοκεῖ ἄλλος πεποιθέναι ἐν σαρκί, ἐγὼ μᾶλλον	1	I myself, having confidence even in the flesh. If anyone else seems to have confidence in the flesh, I even more	Beginning with the phrase **if anyone**, Paul explains why, if anyone has a reason to be confident in religious works, he does. Beginning with this phrase, and continuing through the end of [3:6](../03/6.md), Paul gives his religious credentials and accomplishments in order to make the point that if earning God’s favor should be sought by observing the law then he had reason to boast more than anyone because. However, this is a hypothetical situation and Paul does not think that the Philippian believers should trust in keeping the law but rather in Christ. Paul is using a hypothetical situation to teach the Philippian believers what they should hope. Paul goes on to explain in [3:7–11](../3/7-11.md) that his hope is in Christ and not in the law. Alternate translation: See UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
PHP	3	5	d5bq		 περιτομῇ ὀκταήμερος ἐκ γένους Ἰσραήλ φυλῆς Βενιαμείν, Ἑβραῖος ἐξ Ἑβραίων, κατὰ νόμον Φαρισαῖος	1		In this verse and the next verse, Paul lists a total of seven things that he put his confidence in before he believed in Christ. In this verse he lists five of those things and in the next verse he lists the remaining two. 
PHP	3	5	yq98	figs-explicit	φυλῆς Βενιαμείν	1	circumcision	The phrase **of the tribe of Benjamin** means that Paul was from the Israelite tribe of Benjamin and therefore descended from Jacob’s son Benjamin. Consider the best way to say this in your language. Alternate translation: See UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
PHP	3	5	p4ik	figs-extrainfo	Ἑβραῖος ἐξ Ἑβραίων	1	a Hebrew of Hebrews	The phrase **a Hebrew of Hebrews** could mean: (1) that Paul had retained Hebrew customs and spoke the language of the Hebrew people which was Aramaic. Alternate translation: See UST. (2) that Paul had no Gentile ancestors but rather was a pure-blooded Hebrew. Alternate translation: “a Hebrew whose parents and ancestors are all full-blooded Jews” (3) a combination of both of the above. Alternate translation: “a full-blooded Jew who has retained the Hebrew culture, customs, and language” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])
PHP	3	5	we4t	figs-extrainfo	κατὰ νόμον Φαρισαῖος	1	according to the law, a Pharisee	The phrase **according to the law, a Pharisee** means that prior to his conversion Paul had been a Pharisee who related to the law of Moses as a Pharisee and therefore strictly obeyed it as well as all of the additional rules that the scribes had added to the law of Moses to try to safeguard it. Alternate translation: “in relation to the law of Moses I was a Pharisee” or “in relation to how I observed the law of Moses, I was a Pharisee and therefore I strictly obeyed every detail of it including the teachings of the scribes” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])
PHP	3	6	f81s		κατὰ ζῆλος διώκων τὴν ἐκκλησίαν, κατὰ δικαιοσύνην τὴν ἐν νόμῳ γενόμενος ἄμεμπτος	1		In this verse Paul finishes naming the things that he put his confidence in before he believed in Christ. 
PHP	3	6	ksr3		κατὰ ζῆλος διώκων τὴν ἐκκλησίαν	1	according to zeal, persecuting the church	Paul’s zeal was his enthusiasm for honoring God. He believed that by **persecuting the church** he proved how zealous he was for God. Alternate translation: “having so much zeal for God that I persecuted the church” or “wanting so much to honor God, I persecuted the church”
PHP	3	6	n51b	grammar-collectivenouns	τὴν ἐκκλησίαν	1	persecuting the church	Here, **church** is a collective noun and the phrase **the church** refers to Christians as a whole and includes anyone belonging to the group of people who follow Jesus. What Paul means by saying that he persecuted the church is that he formerly persecuted anyone who was a Christian. Alternate translation: “persecuting Christians” or “persecuting anyone who was a Christian” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns]])
PHP	3	6	hln8	figs-explicit	κατὰ δικαιοσύνην τὴν ἐν νόμῳ γενόμενος ἄμεμπτος	1	according to righteousness that is under the law, having become blameless	The phrase **righteousness that is in the law** refers to obeying the righteous guidelines for living that the law of Moses required. Paul obeyed the law so carefully that he believed that no one could find any part of it that he disobeyed. Alternate Translation: “As regards obeying the law, no one could say that I ever disobeyed the law” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
PHP	3	7	i2td		ἅτινα ἦν μοι κέρδη, ταῦτα ἥγημαι διὰ τὸν Χριστὸν ζημίαν	1		This entire verse is Paul’s response to the seven things he listed in [3:5–6](../3/5-6.md) that he once considered to be spiritually and religiously profitable to himself. In this verse Paul contrasts his former way of viewing things as a Pharisee with his new way of viewing things in light of Christ. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
PHP	3	7	lb8f	figs-metaphor	ἅτινα ἦν μοι κέρδη, ταῦτα ἥγημαι διὰ τὸν Χριστὸν ζημίαν	1	a profit … loss	In the original language that Paul wrote this letter in, the words **gains** and **loss** were common business terms used for accounting. These terms were used to describe things a business person determined to be either profitable or unprofitable. Here, Paul is using these two terms metaphorically to portray the things he considers spiritually profitable and unprofitable. If your language has similar business or accounting terms that would be natural to use in this context, consider using them here. Alternate translation: “Whatever things I formerly counted as gains, these things I now count as loss for the sake of Christ” or “Whatever things I formerly accounted as gains, these things I now account as loss for the sake of Christ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
PHP	3	7	n4lg	figs-explicit	ἅτινα ἦν μοι κέρδη	1	Whatever was a profit for me	Here, the phrase **Whatever was profit to me** refers specifically to the list of seven things that Paul has just listed in [3:5–6](../3/5-6.md) and to anything else he would have formerly put confidence in before he believed in Christ. Alternate translation: “Whatever things I formerly considered profitable” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
PHP	3	7	yxtx	figs-abstractnouns	ταῦτα ἥγημαι διὰ τὸν Χριστὸν ζημίαν	1		If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **loss** by expressing the idea of loss in a verbal phrase such as “worth losing”. Alternate translation: “I consider these things worth losing for the sake of Christ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
PHP	3	8	e1fp	figs-metaphor	ἀλλὰ μενοῦνγε καὶ ἡγοῦμαι πάντα ζημίαν εἶναι, διὰ τὸ ὑπερέχον τῆς γνώσεως Χριστοῦ Ἰησοῦ τοῦ Κυρίου μου, δι’ ὃν τὰ πάντα ἐζημιώθην καὶ ἡγοῦμαι σκύβαλα, ἵνα Χριστὸν κερδήσω	1	I consider even all things to be loss	In this verse, Paul continues the business metaphor which he began in [3:7](../03/07.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
PHP	3	8	epts	figs-metaphor	ἡγοῦμαι	1		See how you translated the word **consider** in [3:7](../03/07.md).

PHP	3	8	iji5	figs-abstractnouns	καὶ ἡγοῦμαι πάντα ζημίαν εἶναι, διὰ τὸ ὑπερέχον τῆς γνώσεως Χριστοῦ Ἰησοῦ τοῦ Κυρίου μου	1		If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun <br>**value** with an adjective such as “valuable”.  Alternate translation: “I consider everything worth losing for the sake of what is most valuable, namely, knowing Christ Jesus my Lord” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
PHP	3	8	cv55		διὰ τὸ ὑπερέχον τῆς γνώσεως Χριστοῦ Ἰησοῦ τοῦ Κυρίου μου	1	because of the surpassing value of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord	Alternate translation: “because knowing Christ Jesus my Lord is worth so much more” 
PHP	3	8	g1hy		γνώσεως Χριστοῦ Ἰησοῦ τοῦ Κυρίου μου	1		Here, the word **knowledge** does not refer to simply being mentally aware of something or someone but rather refers to having a deep, intimate, personal knowledge and experience of something or someone. Here, it refers to having an intimate and personal knowledge or experience of Christ.

PHP	3	8	ovd9	translate-unknown	σκύβαλα	1		During Paul’s time this word was used to refer to excrement and that which was considered worthless and worthy of being thrown out. In the original language that Paul wrote this letter in the term **dung** was a crude term that referred to things that were discarded as garbage including dung and the specific meaning was determined by context. Here, this word could be referring to: (1) excrement, since in the preceding verses Paul has been discussing what comes from the flesh. Alternate translation: “excrement” or “crap” (2) garbage, since Paul is discussing what he now considers worth throwing away in order to gain and know Christ. Alternate translation: “garbage” or “refuse” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

PHP	3	9	g9a9	figs-explicit	 ἀλλὰ τὴν διὰ πίστεως Χριστοῦ	1	not having my own righteousness that is from the law	The word **that** refers to “righteousness”.

PHP	3	9	dely	figs-ellipsis	ἐπὶ τῇ πίστει	1		In the phrase **by faith** Paul is leaving out some words that would be needed in many languages.

PHP	3	10	tam1		τοῦ γνῶναι αὐτὸν, καὶ τὴν δύναμιν τῆς ἀναστάσεως αὐτοῦ, καὶ κοινωνίαν παθημάτων αὐτοῦ	1<br>		In the original language that Paul wrote this letter in, he closely connects the phrase **the power of his resurrection** and the phrase **the fellowship of his sufferings**. He does this because in Paul’s mind these two things are inseparably linked and a person cannot know the power of Christ’s resurrection without first sharing in Christ’s suffering. Consider the best way to show the close connection between these two phrases in your language.
PHP	3	10	ngz6		τοῦ γνῶναι αὐτὸν	1<br>		Here, the word **know** does not refer to simply being mentally aware of something or someone but rather refers to having a deep, intimate, personal knowledge and experience of something or someone.

(2) an intensive phrase which modifies the phrase **pursuing it**. Alternate translation: “if indeed”. You may also choose to leave this phrase untranslated in your translation.

PHP	3	13	hjs9	figs-ellipsis	ἓν δέ	1	forgetting what is behind and straining for what is ahead	In the phrase **But one thing** Paul is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete.

PHP	3	13	ia2b	figs-metaphor	τὰ μὲν ὀπίσω ἐπιλανθανόμενος, τοῖς δὲ ἔμπροσθεν ἐπεκτεινόμενος	1	forgetting what is behind and straining for what is ahead	In the phrase **forgetting what is behind and straining for what is ahead** Paul is using the imagery of a runner who is running in a race against other runners for the purpose of winning the prize. Paul portrays himself as a runner in this metaphor and he continues using this metaphor until the end of [Philippians 3:14](../03/14.md). If this metaphor is unfamiliar in your culture consider using another metaphor that would be familiar or you may state this in plain language without using a metaphor as the UST does. Alternate translation: “like a runner I forget what is behind me and put all of my effort into running toward the finish line that is in front of me” or “like a runner, I have one focus, and therefore I do not look backward as I run but only forward as I strain with all my might so that I will reach the finish line” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

In this verse Paul says that his **goal**, which he works hard for, is to win the **prize** which God promises to give every person who obediently follows Christ. If this metaphor would be unfamiliar in your culture consider using another metaphor or use plain language to translate the idea behind this metaphor. Alternate translation: “I do all I can to pursue the goal of winning the prize of God’s upward call in Christ Jesus” or “I work hard so that I can reach my goal of receiving God’s reward which he gives to all those who obey his upward call in Christ Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
PHP	3	14	jhtv		σκοπὸν…εἰς τὸ βραβεῖον τῆς ἄνω κλήσεως τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	I press on toward the goal to the prize of the upward calling of God in Christ Jesus	The phrases **the goal** and **the prize** could be related to each other in one of two ways. They could: (1) both be focusing on the same basic idea. Alternate translation: “the goal which is to be given the prize of God’s upward call” or “my goal which is to receive the prize of God’s upward call” (2) both be focusing on different things in which case **the goal** is referring to the goal of Paul’s life and **the prize** is referring to what Paul hopes to receive once he has successfully achieved his goal.

In other words, the phrase **the upward calling of God** probably refers both to the fact that the **calling** is from God and that the calling is also a heavenly calling to move towards God. Alternate translation: “God’s heavenward call” or see UST
PHP	3	14	agwg		διώκω…ἄνω κλήσεως τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ	1	of the upward calling	The phrase **in Christ Jesus** could be: (1) modifying **the upward calling of God**.
