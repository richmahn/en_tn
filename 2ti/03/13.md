# impostors

An imposter is a person who wants other people to think he is someone other, usually more important, than who he is.

# will go from bad to worse

"will become even more evil"

# leading others and themselves astray

Here, to lead someone astray is a metaphor for persuading someone to believe something that is not true. Alternate translation: "deceiving themselves and others" or "believing lies and teaching lies" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
