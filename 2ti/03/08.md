# Jannes and Jambres

These are names of men. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# stood against

Paul speaks of those who argue against someone as if they were standing against them. AT: "opposed" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# stand against the truth

"oppose the gospel of Jesus"

# They are men corrupt in mind

"Their minds are corrupt" or "They cannot think rightly"

# and with regard to the faith they are proven to be false

They have been tested in how well they trust in Christ and obey him, and they have failed the test. AT: "and without sincere faith" or "and they have shown that their faith is not genuine"

# they will not advance very far

Paul uses an expression about physical movement to mean that the false teachers will not have much success among the believers. AT: "they will not have much success" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
