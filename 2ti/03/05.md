# They will have a shape of godliness, but they will deny its power

Paul speaks of godliness, the habit of honoring God, as if it were a physical object that had a shape and had physical power. AT: "They will appear to honor God, but they way they act will show that they do not really believe in God's power" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# have a shape of godliness

"appear to have godliness" or "appear to honor God"

# Turn away from these people

"Turn away" here is a metaphor for avoiding someone. AT: "Avoid these people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# enter into households and captivate

"enter into houses and greatly influence"

# foolish women

"women who are spiritually weak." These women may be spiritually be weak because they fail to work at becoming godly or because they are idle and have many sins.

# who are heaped up with sins

Paul speaks of the attraction of sin as if sin were heaped up on the backs of these women. Possible meanings are 1) "who sin often" or 2) "who feel terrible guilt because they continue to sin." The idea is that these men can easily influence these women because the women are unable to stop sinning. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# are led away by various desires

Paul speaks about these various desires as if they could lead another person away. This can be stated in active form. AT: "they desire to sin in various ways rather than obey Christ" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
