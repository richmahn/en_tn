# the sacred writings. These are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus

Paul speaks of the sacred writings as if they were a person who could make someone else wise. Alternate translation: "that when you read the word of God, you can become wise so as to receive salvation from Christ Jesus by faith" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
