# General Information:

Just as precious and common containers can be used for honorable ways in a wealthy house, any person who turns to God can be used by God in honorable ways in doing good works. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the firm foundation of God stands

Possible meanings are 1) "God's truth is like a firm foundation" or 2) "God has established his people like a building on a firm foundation" or 3) "God's faithfulness is like a firm foundation." In any case, Paul speaks of this idea as if it were a building's foundation laid in the ground. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# who names the name of the Lord

"who calls on the name of the Lord." Here "name of the Lord" refers to the Lord himself. Alternate translation: "who calls on the Lord" or "who says he is a believer in Christ" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# depart from unrighteousness

Paul speaks of unrighteousness as if it were a place from which one could leave. Alternate translation: "stop being evil" or "stop doing wrong things" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
