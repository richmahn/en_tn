## translationNotes

* **Flee … pursue** - These metaphors share the idea of running as fast as you can. To flee is to run from something that will harm you; to pursue is to run toward something that will do you good. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]].)
* **Flee youthful lusts** - “run away from lusts that tempt younger people” the way a person flees an attacking animal or murderer.
