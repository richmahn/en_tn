# No soldier serves while entangled in the affairs of this life

"No soldier serves when he is involved in the everyday business of this life" or "When soldiers are serving, they do not get distracted by the ordinary things that people do." Christ's servants should not allow everyday life to keep them from working for Christ.

# while entangled

Paul speaks of this distraction as if it were a net that tripped people up as they were walking. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# his superior officer

"his leader" or "the one who commands him"
