# This is a trustworthy saying

"These are words you can trust"

# If we have died with him ... he cannot deny himself

This is most likely a song or poem that Paul is quoting. If your language has a way of indicating that this is poetry you could use it here. If not, you could translate this as regular prose rather than poetry. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry]])

# died with him

Paul uses this expression to mean that people share in Christ's death when they trust in him, deny their own wants, and obey him.

# if we are unfaithful

"even if we fail God" or "even if we do not do what we believe God wants us to do"

# he cannot deny himself

"he must always act according to his character" or "he cannot act in ways that are the opposite of his real character"
