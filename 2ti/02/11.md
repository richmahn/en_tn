# This is a trustworthy saying

"These are words you can trust"

# If we have died with him, we will also live with him

This is most likely the beginning of a song or poem that Paul is quoting. If your language has a way of indicating that this is poetry, you could use it here. If not, you could translate this as regular prose rather than poetry. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry]])

# died with him

Paul uses this expression to mean that people share in Christ's death when they trust in him, deny their own wants, and obey him.
