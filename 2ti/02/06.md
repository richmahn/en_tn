## translationNotes

* **The hardworking farmer must receive his share of the crops first** - This is the third metaphor that Paul gives Timothy. The reader should understand that Christ's servants need to work hard. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **Think about what I am saying** - Paul gave Timothy three metaphors, but he did not explain their meanings. He expected Timothy to figure out what Paul was saying about Christ's servants.
* **for the Lord** - "because the Lord"
