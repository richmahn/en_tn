# as an athlete, he is not crowned unless he competes by the rules

Paul is implicitly speaking of Christ's servants as if they were athletes. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# he is not crowned unless he competes by the rules

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "they will crown him as winner only if he competes by the rules" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# he is not crowned

"he does not win the prize." Athletes in Paul's time were crowned with wreaths made from the leaves of plants when they won competitions.

# competes by the rules

"competes according to the rules" or "strictly obeys the rules"
