# whom I serve from my forefathers

"whom I serve as my ancestors did"

# with a clean conscience

Paul speaks of his conscience as if it could be physically clean. A person with a "clean conscience" does not feel guilty because he has always tried to do what was right. Alternate translation: "knowing I have tried my hardest to do what is right" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# as I constantly remember you

Here "remember" is used to mean "mention" or "talk about." Alternate translation: "when I mention you continually" or "while I talk about you all the time"

# night and day

Here "night and day" are used together to mean "always." Alternate translation: "always" or "at all times" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
