# Connecting Statement:

Paul encourages Timothy to live in power, love, and discipline and not to be ashamed because of Paul's suffering in prison because of his (Paul's) faith in Christ.

# This is the reason

"For this reason" or "Because of your sincere faith in Jesus"

# to rekindle the gift

Paul speaks about Timothy's need to start using his gift again as if he were restarting a fire. Alternate translation: "to start using again the gift" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands

"the gift of God that you received when I laid my hands on you." This refers to a ceremony in which Paul placed his hands on Timothy and prayed that God would enable him to do the work he had commanded him to do.
