# Paul ... to Timothy

Your language may have a particular way of introducing the author of a letter. Also, immediately after introducing the author, you may need to tell to whom the letter is written, as in the UDB.

# beloved child

"dear child" or "child whom I love. Here "child" is a term of great love and approval. It is also likely that Timothy was converted to Christ by Paul, and so this is why Paul considered him like his own child. AT: "who is like my beloved child" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Grace, mercy, and peace from

"May grace, mercy, and peace be yours from" or "May you experience kindness, mercy, and peace within from"

# God the Father and

"God, who is our Father, and." This is an important title for God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])

# Christ Jesus our Lord

"Christ Jesus, who is our Lord"
