# to Timothy

Your language may have a particular way of introducing the person who receives a letter. Also, immediately after introducing the author, you may need to tell to whom the letter is written, as in the UST.

# beloved child

"dear child" or "child whom I love. Here "child" is a term of great love and approval. It is also likely that Paul introduced Christ to Timothy, and so this is why Paul considered him like his own child. Alternate translation: "who is like my beloved child" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Grace, mercy, and peace from

"May you experience kindness, mercy, and peace within you from" or "I pray that you will have grace, mercy, and peace from" 

# God the Father and

"God, who is the Father, and." This is an important title for God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]]) Paul could be referring to God here as 1) the Father of Christ, or 2) the Father of believers.

# Christ Jesus our Lord

"Christ Jesus, who is our Lord"
