# who put an end to death

# brought life that never ends to light through the gospel

Paul speaks of teaching about eternal life as if it were an object that could be brought from darkness into light so that people could see it. Alternate translation: "taught what life that never ends is by preaching the gospel" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
