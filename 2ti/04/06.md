# I am already being poured out

Paul speaks of his readiness to die as if he were a cup of wine ready to be poured out as a sacrifice to God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# The time of my departure has come

Here "departure" is a polite way of referring to death. AT: "Soon I will die and leave this world" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
