# The crown of righteousness has been reserved for me

This can be stated in active form. AT: "God has reserved the crown of righteousness for me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# crown of righteousness

Possible meanings are 1) the crown is the prize that God gives to people who have lived the right way or 2) the crown is a metaphor for righteousness. Just as the judge of a race gives a crown to the winner, when Paul finishes his life, God will declare that Paul is righteous. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

Paul speaks about this event as if it has already happened. It can be stated as a future event. AT: "but also he will give it to those who are eagerly waiting for him to return" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture]])
