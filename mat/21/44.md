# Whoever falls on this stone will be broken to pieces

Here, "this stone" is the same stone as in [Matthew 21:42](./42.md). This is a metaphor that means the Christ will destroy anyone who rebels against him. This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "The stone will break into pieces anyone who falls on it" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# But anyone on whom it falls will be crushed

This means basically the same thing as the previous sentence. It is a metaphor that means the Christ will have the final judgment and will destroy everyone who rebels against him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
