# General Information:

In verse 16, Jesus quotes from the Psalms to justify how the people had responded to him.

# the marvelous things

"the wonderful things" or "the miracles." This refers to Jesus healing the blind and lame people in [Matthew 21:14](./12.md).

# Hosanna

This word means "save us" but can also mean "praise God!" See how you translated this in [Matthew 21:09](./09.md).

# the Son of David

Jesus was not David's literal son, so this may be translated as "descendant of king David." However, "Son of David" is also a title for the Messiah, and the children were probably calling Jesus by this title. See how you translated this in [Matthew 21:09](./09.md).

# they became very angry

It is implied that they were angry because they did not believe Jesus was the Christ and they did not want other people praising him. AT: "they became very angry because people were praising him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# Do you hear what they are saying?

The chief priests and scribes ask this question to rebuke Jesus because they are angry with him. AT: "You should not allow them to say these things about you!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# But have you never read ... praise'?

Jesus asks this question to remind the chief priests and scribes of what they have studied in the scriptures. AT: "Yes, I hear them, but you should remember what you read in the scriptures ... praise.'" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Out of the mouths of little children and nursing infants you have prepared praise

The phrase "out of the mouths" refers to speaking. AT: "You caused little children and nursing infants to prepare to give praise to God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# Jesus left them

"Jesus left the chief priests and scribes"
