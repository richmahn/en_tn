# General Information:

In verse 16, Jesus quotes from the Psalms to justify how the people had responded to him.

# the marvelous things

"the wonderful things" or "the miracles." This refers to Jesus healing the blind and lame people in [Matthew 21:14](./14.md).

# Hosanna

This word means "save us" but can also mean "praise God!" See how you translated this in [Matthew 21:09](./09.md).

# the Son of David

Jesus was not David's literal son, so this may be translated as "descendant of king David." However, "Son of David" is also a title for the Messiah, and the children were probably calling Jesus by this title. See how you translated this in [Matthew 21:09](./09.md).

# they became very angry

It is implied that they were angry because they did not believe Jesus was the Christ and they did not want other people praising him. AT: "they became very angry because people were praising him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
