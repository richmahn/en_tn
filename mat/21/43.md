# I say to you

This adds emphasis to what Jesus says next.

# to you

Here "you" is plural. Jesus was speaking to the religious leaders and also to the Jewish people in general. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and will be given to a nation

Here "kingdom of God" refers to God's rule as king. This can be stated in active form. AT: "God will take his kingdom away from you and will give it to a nation" or "God will reject you, the Jewish people, and he will be king over people from other nations" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# will be taken away from you

No one is sure if Jesus meant that God would someday give the kingdom back or that he would never give it back. Your translation should allow both possible understandings.

# that produces its fruits

"Fruits" here is a metaphor for "results" or outcome." AT: "that produces good results" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
