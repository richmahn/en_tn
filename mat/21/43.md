# I say to you

This adds emphasis to what Jesus says next.

# to you

Here "you" is plural. Jesus was speaking to the religious leaders who had rejected him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and will be given to a nation

Here "kingdom of God" refers to God's rule as king. This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "God will take his kingdom away from you and will give it to a nation" or "God will reject you and he will be king over people from other nations" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# that produces its fruits

"Fruits" here is a metaphor for "results" or outcome." Alternate translation: "that produces good results" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
