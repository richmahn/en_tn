# Connecting Statement:

This begins the account of the religious leaders questioning Jesus' authority.

# had come into the temple

It is implied that Jesus did not enter the actual temple. He entered the courtyard around the temple. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# these things

This refers to Jesus teaching and healing in the temple. It probably also refers to Jesus driving out the buyers and sellers the previous day.
