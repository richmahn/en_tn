# Connecting Statement:

Jesus tells a parable about two sons to rebuke the religious leaders and to illustrate their unbelief. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])

# But what do you think?

Jesus uses a question to challenge the religious leaders to think deeply about the parable he will tell them. Alternate translation: "Tell me what you think about what I am about to tell you." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
