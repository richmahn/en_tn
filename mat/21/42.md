Jesus uses the prophets to explain the parable.

## Jesus said to them ##

"Jesus said to the people" ([Matthew 21:40](./40.md))

## 'The stone which the builders rejected has been made the cornerstone. ##

AT: "The stone that was rejected by the builders became the most important one." The authorities will reject Jesus, but God will make him the head of his kingdom. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## This was from the Lord ##

"The Lord has caused this great change"
