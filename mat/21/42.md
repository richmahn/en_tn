# General Information:

Jesus quotes the prophet Isaiah to show that God will honor the one whom the religious leaders reject.

# Connecting Statement:

Here Jesus begins to explain the parable of the rebellious servants.

# Jesus said to them

It is unclear to whom Jesus asks the following question. If you need to make "them" specific, use the same audience as you did in [Matthew 21:41](./41.md).

# Did you never read ... eyes'?

Jesus uses a question to make his audience think deeply about what this scripture means. Alternate translation: "Think about what you have read ... eyes.'" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# The stone which the builders rejected has been made the cornerstone

Jesus is quoting from the Psalms. This is a metaphor that means the religious leaders, like builders, will reject Jesus, but God will make him the most important in his kingdom, like the cornerstone in a building. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# has been made the cornerstone

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "has become the cornerstone" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# This was from the Lord

"The Lord has caused this great change"

# it is marvelous in our eyes

Here "in our eyes" refers to seeing. Alternate translation: "it is wonderful to see" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
