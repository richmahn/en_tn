# Connecting Statement:

To rebuke the religious leaders and illustrate their unbelief, Jesus tells a parable about rebellious servants. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])

# a landowner

"a person who owned a piece of property"

# a hedge

"a wall" or "a fence"

# dug a winepress in it

"dug a hole in the vineyard in which to press the grapes"

# rented it out to vine growers

The owner still owned the vineyard, but he allowed the vine growers to take care of it. When the grapes became ripe, they were to give some of them to the owner and keep the rest.

# vine growers

These were people who knew how to take care of vines and grapes.
