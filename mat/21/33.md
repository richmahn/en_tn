# Connecting Statement:

To rebuke the religious leaders and illustrate their unbelief, Jesus tells a parable about rebellious servants. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])

# a landowner

"a person who owned a piece of property"

# a hedge

"a wall" or "a fence"

# dug a winepress in it

"dug a hole in the vineyard to press the grapes"

# rented it out to vine growers

"put vine growers in charge of the vineyard." The owner still owned the vineyard.

# vine growers

These were people who knew how to take care of vines and grapes.
