# He remained

It is implied that Joseph, Mary, and Jesus remained in Egypt. Alternate translation: "They remained" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# until the death of Herod

Herod does not die until [Matthew 2:19](../02/19.md). This statement describes the length of their stay in Egypt, and it does not say that Herod died at this time.

# Out of Egypt I have called my son

"I have called my son out of Egypt"

# my son

In Hosea this refers to the people of Israel. Matthew quoted it to say that this was true of God's Son, Jesus. Translate it using a word for son that could refer to the only son or the first son.
