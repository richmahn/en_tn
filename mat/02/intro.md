# Matthew 02 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations indent each line of poetry to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetry in verses 6 and 18, which is quoted from the OT.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### "His star" #####

This is probably a reference to a star that the learned men believed to be the sign of a new king of Israel. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sign]])

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### "Learned men" #####

English translations use many different words to translate this phrase. These terms include "magi" and "wise men." These men could have been scientists or astrologers. It is best to translate this with the generic term "learned men," if possible.
