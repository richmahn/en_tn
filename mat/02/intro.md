# Matthew 02 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetry in verses 6 and 18, which are words from the Old Testament.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### "His star" #####

These words probably refer to a star that the learned men believed to be the sign of a new king of Israel. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sign]])

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### "Learned men" #####

English translations use many different words to translate this phrase. These words include "magi" and "wise men." These men could have been scientists or astrologers. If you can, you should translate this with the general word "learned men."
