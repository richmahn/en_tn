# They fell down and worshiped him

"They knelt down and put their faces close to the ground." They did this to honor Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])

# their treasures

Here "treasures" refers to the boxes or bags they used to carry their treasures. Alternate translation: "the containers that held their treasures" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
