# General Information:

In verse 6, the chief priests and scribes of the people quote the prophet Micah to show that the Christ would be born in Bethlehem.

# In Bethlehem of Judea

"In the town of Bethlehem in the province of Judea"

# this is what was written by the prophet

This can be stated in active form. AT: "this is what the prophet wrote long ago" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# you, Bethlehem, ... are not the least among the leaders of Judah

Micah was speaking to the people of Bethlehem as if they were with him but they were not. Also, "are not the least" can be translated with a positive phrase. AT: "you, people of Bethlehem, ... your town is among the most important towns in Judah" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])

# who will shepherd my people Israel

Micah speaks of this ruler as a shepherd. This means he will lead and care for the people. AT: "who will lead my people Israel as a shepherd leads his sheep" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
