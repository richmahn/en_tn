# General Information:

In verse 15, Matthew quotes the prophet Hosea to show that the Christ would spend time in Egypt.

# they had departed

"the learned men had departed"

# appeared to Joseph in a dream

"came to Joseph while he was dreaming"

# Get up, take ... flee ... Remain ... you

God is speaking to Joseph, so these should all be singular forms. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# until I tell you

The full meaning of this statement can be made explicit. AT: "until I tell you it is safe to come back" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# I tell you

Here "I" refers to God. The angel is speaking for God.
