This continues the account of what happened when Jesus was born as the King of the Jews.

## they had departed ##

"the learned men had departed"

## Get up, take … flee …. Remain … you ##

God is speaking to Joseph, so these should all be singular forms. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

## until the death of Herod ##

Herod does not die until [Matthew 2:19](./19.md). This statement describes the length of the their stay in Egypt, and does not say that Herod died at this time.

## Out of Egypt I have called my son ##

This is a quotation from Hosea [Hosea 11:1](../../hos/11/01.md). The wording of the Greek text in Matthew is somewhat different than the Hebrew text in Hosea. The emphasis is on "out of Egypt," not some other place: "It is out of Egypt that I have called my son."
