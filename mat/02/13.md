## translationNotes

* This continues the account of what happened when Jesus was born as the King of the Jews.
* **they had departed** - "the learned men had departed"
* **Get up, take … flee …. Remain … you** - God is speaking to Joseph, so these should all be singular forms. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
* **until the death of Herod** - Herod does not die until [[:en:bible:notes:mat:02:19]]. This statement describes the length of the their stay in Egypt, and does not say that Herod died at this time.
* **Out of Egypt I have called my son** - This is a quotation from Hosea [[:en:bible:notes:hos:11:01]]. The wording of the Greek text in Matthew is somewhat different than the Hebrew text in Hosea. The emphasis is on "out of Egypt," not some other place: "It is out of Egypt that I have called my son."
