# General Information:

These events happen before Herod's death, which Matthew mentioned in [Matthew 2:15](../02/15.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-events]])

# Connecting Statement:

Here the scene shifts back to Herod and tells what he did when he learned that the learned men had deceived him.

# he had been mocked by the learned men

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "the learned men had embarrassed him by tricking him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# He sent and killed all the male children

Herod did not kill the children himself. Alternate translation: "He gave orders for his soldiers to kill all the boys" or "He sent soldiers there to kill all the boy babies" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# two years old and under

"2 years old and younger" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])
