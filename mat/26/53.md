# Do you think that I could not call ... angels?

Jesus uses a question to remind the person with the sword that Jesus could stop those who are arresting him. AT: "Surely you know that I could call ... angels" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Do you think

Here "you" is singular and refers to the person with the sword. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# my Father

This is an important title for God that describes the relationship between God and Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])

# more than twelve legions of angels

The word "legion" is a military term that refers to a group of about 6,000 soldiers. Jesus means God would send enough angels to easily stop those who are arresting Jesus. The exact number of angels is not important. AT: "more than 12 really large groups of angels" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])
