# Have you come out with swords and clubs to seize me like a robber?

Jesus is using this question to point out the wrong actions of those arresting him. Alternate translation: "You know that I am not a robber, so it is wrong for you to come out to me bringing swords and clubs" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# clubs

large pieces of hard wood for hitting people

# in the temple

It is implied that Jesus was not in the actual temple. He was in the courtyard around the temple. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
