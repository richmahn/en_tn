## Have you come out with swords and clubs to seize me like a robber? ##

AT: "You know that I am not a robber, so it is wrong for you to come out to me bringing swords and clubs." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## clubs ##

large pieces of hard wood for hitting people

## left him ##

If your language has a word that means that they left him when they should have stayed with him, use it here.
