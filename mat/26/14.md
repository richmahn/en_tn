One of the disciples agrees to help the Jewish leaders arrest and kill Jesus.

## deliver him to you ##

"turn Jesus over to you" or "help you arrest Jesus"

## thirty pieces of silver ##

Since these words are the same as those in an Old Testament prophecy, keep this form instead of changing it to modern money.

## to deliver him to them ##

"to help the chief priests arrest Jesus"
