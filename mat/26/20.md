# he sat down to eat

Use the word for the position people in your culture usually are in when they eat.

# Truly I say to you

"I tell you the truth." This adds emphasis to what Jesus says next.

# Surely not I, Lord?

"I am surely not the one, am I, Lord?" Possible meanings are 1) this is a rhetorical question since the apostles were sure they would not betray Jesus. AT: "Lord, I would never betray you!" or 2) this was a sincere question since Jesus' statement probably troubled and confused them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
