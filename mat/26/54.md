# But how then would the scriptures be fulfilled, that this must happen?

Jesus uses a question to explain why he is letting these people arrest him. This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "But if I did that, I would not be able to fulfill what God said in the scriptures must happen" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
