# Son of God

This is an important title that describes the relationship between the Christ and God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])

# the living God

Here "living" contrasts the God of Israel to all the false gods and idols that people worshiped. Only the God of Israel is alive and has power to act. See how you translated this in [Matthew 16:16](../16/16.md).
