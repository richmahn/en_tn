# Is it I, Rabbi?

"Rabbi, am I the one who will betray you?" Judas may be using a rhetorical question to deny that he is the one who will betray Jesus. AT: "Rabbi, surely I am not the one who will betray you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# You have said it yourself

This is an idiom that Jesus uses to mean "yes" without being completely clear about what he means. AT: "You are saying it" or "You are admitting it" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
