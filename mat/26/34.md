# Truly I say to you

"I tell you the truth." This adds emphasis to what Jesus says next.

# before the rooster crows

Roosters often crow about the time the sun comes up, so the hearers might have understood these words as a metonym for the sun coming up. However, the actual crowing of a rooster is an important part of the story later on, so keep the word "rooster" in the translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# rooster

a male chicken, a bird that calls out loudly around the time the sun comes up

# crows

This is the common English word for what a rooster does to make his loud call.

# you will deny me three times

"you will say three times that you are not my follower"
