# Matthew 26 General Notes

#### Structure and formatting

Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 26:31, which is words from the Old Testament.

#### Special concepts in this chapter

##### Sheep
Sheep are a common image used in Scripture to refer to the people of Israel. In [Matthew 26:31](../../mat/26/31.md), however, Jesus used the words "the sheep" to refer to his disciples and to say that they would run away when he was arrested.

##### Passover
The Passover festival was when the Jews would celebrate the day God killed the firstborn sons of the Egyptians but  "passed over" the Israelites and let them live.

##### The eating of the body and blood
[Matthew 26:26-28](./26.md) describes Jesus' last meal with his followers. At this time, Jesus told them that what they were eating and drinking were his body and his blood. Nearly all Christian churches celebrate "the Lord's Supper," the "Eucharist", or "Holy Communion" to remember this meal.

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter

##### Judas' kiss for Jesus
[Matthew 26:49](../../mat/26/49.md) describes how Judas kissed Jesus so the soldiers would know whom to arrest. The Jews would kiss each other when they greeted each other.

##### "I am able to destroy the temple of God"
Two men accused Jesus of saying that he could destroy the temple in Jerusalem and then rebuild it "in three days" ([Matthew 26:61](../../mat/26/61.md)). They were accusing him of insulting God by claiming that God had given him the authority to destroy the temple and the power to rebuild it. What Jesus actually said was that if the Jewish authorities were to destroy this temple, he would certainly raise it up in three days ([John 2:19](../../jhn/02/19.md)).
