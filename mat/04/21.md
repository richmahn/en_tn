# Connecting Statement:

Jesus calls more men to be his disciples.

# He called them

"Jesus called John and James." This phrase also means that Jesus invited them to follow him, live with him, and become his disciples.

# immediately

"at that moment"

# left the boat ... and followed him

It should be clear that this is a life change. These men are no longer going to be fishermen and are leaving the family business to follow Jesus for the rest of their lives.
