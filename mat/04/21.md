## translationNotes

* This continues the account of the beginning of Jesus' ministry in Galilee.
* **they were mending their nets ** - <b>they were mending their nets <b>- "They" might include the two brothers and Zebedee, or just the two brothers.
* **He called them,** - "Jesus called John and James." This phrase also means that Jesus invited them to follow him, live with him, and become his disciples.
* **immediately ** - <b>immediately <b>- "at that moment"
* **left the boat â€¦ and followed him** - It should be clear that this is a life change. These men are no longer going to be fishermen and are leaving the family business to follow Jesus for the rest of their lives.
