# Connecting Statement:

This is the end of the part of the story about the beginning of Jesus' ministry in Galilee. These verses summarize what he did and how the people responded. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-endofstory]])

# teaching in their synagogues

"teaching in the synagogues of the Galileans" or "teaching in the synagogues of those people"

# preaching the gospel of the kingdom

Here "kingdom" refers to God's reign as king. AT: "preaching the good news about how God will show himself as king" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# every kind of disease and sickness

The words "disease" and "sickness" are closely related but should be translated as two different words if possible. "Disease" is what causes a person to be sick.

# sickness

is the physical weakness or affliction that results from having a disease.
