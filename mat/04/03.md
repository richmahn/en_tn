# the devil ... The tempter

These refer to the same being. You may have to use the same word to translate both.

# If you are the Son of God, command

It is best to assume that Satan knew that Jesus is the Son of God. Possible meanings are 1) this is a temptation to do miracles for Jesus' own benefit. Alternate translation: "You are the Son of God, so you can command" or 2) this is a challenge or accusation. Alternate translation: "Prove that you are the Son of God by commanding"

# the Son of God

This is an important title for Jesus that describes his relationship to God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])

# command these stones to become bread.

You could translate this with a direct quotation. Alternate translation: "say to these stones, 'Become bread.'" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])

# bread

Here "bread" refers to food in general. Alternate translation: "food" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
