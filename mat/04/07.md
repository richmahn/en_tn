## translationNotes

* This continues the account of how Satan tempted Jesus.
* **Again it is written ** - This could be translated "Again, I will tell you something that is in the Scriptures."
* **He said to him ** - "The devil said to Jesus"
* **All these things I will give you ** - "I will give you all these things." The tempter is emphasizing that he will give "all these things," not just some of them.
