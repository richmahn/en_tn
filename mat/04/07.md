# General Information:

In verse 7, Jesus rebukes Satan with another quotation from Deuteronomy.

# Again it is written

It is understood that Jesus is quoting scripture again. This can be stated in active form. AT: "Again, I will tell you what Moses wrote in the scriptures" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# You must not test

Here "you" refers to anyone. AT: "One should not test" or "No person should test"

# Again, the devil

"Next, the devil"

# He said to him

"The devil said to Jesus"

# All these things I will give you

"I will give you all these things." The tempter is emphasizing here that he will give "all these things," not just some of them.
