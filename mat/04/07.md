This continues the account of how Satan tempted Jesus.

## Again it is written  ##

<b>Again it is written <b>- This could be translated "Again, I will tell you something that is in the Scriptures."

## He said to him  ##

<b>He said to him <b>- "The devil said to Jesus"

## All these things I will give you  ##

<b>All these things I will give you <b>- "I will give you all these things." The tempter is emphasizing that he will give "all these things," not just some of them.
