# He said to him

"The devil said to Jesus"

# All these things I will give you

"I will give you all these things." The tempter is emphasizing here that he will give "all these things," not just some of them.

# fall down

"put your face near the ground." This was a common action to show that a person was worshiping. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
