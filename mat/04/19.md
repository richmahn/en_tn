# Come, follow me

Jesus invites Simon and Andrew to follow him, live with him, and become his disciples. AT: "Be my disciples"

# I will make you fishers of men

This metaphor means Simon and Andrew will teach people God's true message, so others will also follow Jesus. AT: "I will teach you to gather men to me like you used to gather fish" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
