# the kingdom of heaven has come near

The phrase "the kingdom of heaven" refers to God ruling as king. This phrase is only in the book of Matthew. If possible, include a word that means "heaven" in your translation. See how you translated this in [Matthew 3:2](../03/02.md). AT: "our God in heaven will soon show himself to be king" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
