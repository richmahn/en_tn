# Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has come near

The phrase "kingdom of heaven" refers to God ruling as king. This phrase is only in the book of Matthew. If possible, use the word "heaven" in your translation. See how you translated this in [Matthew 3:2](../03/01.md). AT: "our God in heaven will soon show himself to be king" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
