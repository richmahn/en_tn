# General Information:

In verse 6, Satan quotes from the Psalms in order to tempt Jesus.

# If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down

It is best to assume that Satan knew that Jesus is the Son of God. Possible meanings are 1) this is a temptation to do a miracle for Jesus' own benefit. AT: "Since you are truly the Son of God, you can throw yourself down" or 2) this is a challenge or accusation. AT: "Prove that you are truly the Son of God by throwing yourself down"

# Son of God

This is an important title that describes the relationship between God and Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])

# throw yourself down

"let yourself fall to the ground" or "jump down"

# for it is written

This can be stated in active form. AT: "for the writer wrote in the scriptures" or "for it says in the scriptures" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# He will command his angels to take care of you

"God will command his angels to take care of you." This can be translated with a direct quotation. AT: "God will say to his angels, 'Take care of him'" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])

# They will lift you up

"The angels will hold you"
