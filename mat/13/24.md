# Connecting Statement:

Here Jesus describes the kingdom of heaven by telling a parable about a field with both wheat and weeds growing in it. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])

# The kingdom of heaven is like a man

The translation should not equate the kingdom of heaven to a man, but rather the kingdom of heaven is like the situation described in the parable. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# The kingdom of heaven is like

Here "kingdom of heaven" refers to God's rule as king. The phrase "kingdom of heaven" is used only in Matthew. If possible, use "heaven" in your translation. AT: "When our God in heaven shows himself to be king, it will be like" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# good seed

"good food seeds" or "good grain seeds." The audience probably thought that Jesus was talking about wheat. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
