## translationNotes

* Jesus continues to tell a large crowd of people different parables that describe what the kingdom of God is like.
* **Jesus presented another parable to them** - Jesus told another parable to the crowd of people.
* **The kingdom of heaven is like a man** - The translation should not equate the kingdom of heaven to a man, but rather the kingdom of heaven is like the situation described in the parable (see UDB).
* **good seed** - "good food seeds" or "good grain seeds." The audience probably thought that Jesus was talking about wheat. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
* **his enemy came ** - "his enemy came to the field."
* **weeds** - This can be translated "bad seed" or "weed seeds." These weeds look like food plants when they are young, but the grain is poison.
* **When the blades sprouted** - "when the wheat seeds sprouted" or "when the plants came up"
* **brought forth their crop** - "produced grain" or "produced the wheat crop"
* **then the weeds appeared also ** - Alternate translation: "then people could see that there were weeds in the field also."
