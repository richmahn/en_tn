Jesus went into a house with his disciples and continued to explain the parables about the kingdom of God.

## end of the world ##

"end of the age"

## come forth ##

"come out" or "go out" or "come from heaven"

## throw them ##

"throw the wicked"

## furnace of fire ##

This can be translated “fiery furnace.” This is a metaphor for the fires of hell that uses the imagery of the Old Testament passage Daniel 3:6. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]]) If the term “furnace” is not known, “oven” can be used.

## where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth ##

"where the wicked people will cry and grind their teeth"
