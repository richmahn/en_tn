# General Information:

In verse 14, Jesus quotes the prophet Isaiah to show that the people's failure to understand Jesus' teaching is a fulfillment of prophecy.

# Connecting Statement:

Jesus continues to explain to his disciples why he teaches in parables.

# to them ... they

All occurrences of "them" and "they" refer to the people in the crowd.

# Though they are seeing, they do not see; and though they are hearing, they do not hear, or understand.

Jesus uses this parallelism to tell and emphasize to the disciples that the crowd refuses to understand God's truth. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
