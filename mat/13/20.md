Jesus continues to tell a large crowd of people different parables that describe what the kingdom of God is like. Here he is explaining the parable he told in [Matthew 13:3](./03.md)-[Matthew 13:7](./07.md).

## He who was sown on the rocky ground ##

If a literal translation makes no sense, try to translate so the reader understands that Jesus is the sower, the message is the seed, and the hearer is the rocky ground. Possible translation: "This is how it is with what was sown on the rocky ground." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

## he has no root ##

"he has shallow roots" or "he allows the young plant no place for its roots" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## because of the word  ##

"because of the message"

## he stumbles immediately  ##

"immediately he falls away" or "immediately he abandons his faith." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
