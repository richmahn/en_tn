# the evil one comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart

Jesus speaks of Satan causing the person to forget what he has heard as if Satan were a bird snatching the seed from the ground. AT: "The evil one causes him to forget the message that he has heard just as a bird snatches away seed from the ground" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the evil one

This refers to Satan. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# snatches away

Try to use a word that means to grab something away from someone who is the rightful owner.

# what has been sown in his heart

This can be translated in active form: AT: "the message that God sowed in his heart" or "the message that he heard" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# in his heart

Here "heart" refers to the mind of the hearer. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
