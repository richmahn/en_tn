## translationNotes

* Jesus continues to tell a large crowd of people different parables that describe what the kingdom of God is like. These verses continue the parable of the weeds.
* **the landowner** - This is the same person who sowed good seed in his field.
* **did you not sow good seed in your field?** - "you sowed good seed in your field." The landowner probably had his servants plant the seeds (see UDB). (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [en:ta:translate:metonymy]]).
* **He said to them** - "The landowner said to the servants"
* **So do you want us** - The word "us" refers to the servants.
