# Connecting Statement:

Jesus continues to tell a parable about a field with both wheat and weeds growing in it.

# the landowner

This is the same person who sowed good seed in his field.

# did you not sow good seed in your field?

The servants used a question to emphasize their surprise. AT: "you sowed good seed in your field!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# did you not sow

The landowner probably had his servants plant the seeds. AT: "we sowed" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# He said to them

"The landowner said to the servants"

# So do you want us

The word "us" refers to the servants.
