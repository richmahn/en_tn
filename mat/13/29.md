Jesus continues to tell a large crowd of people different parables that describe what the kingdom of God is like. These verses conclude the parable of the weeds.

## The landowner said ##

"The landowner said to his servants"

## I will say to the reapers, "First pull out the weeds and tie them in bundles to burn them, but gather the wheat into my barn" ##

You can translate this as an indirect quote: "I will tell the reapers to first gather up the weeds and tie them in bundles to burn them, then gather the wheat into my barn." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])

## my barn ##

A barn is a farm building that can be used for storing grain.
