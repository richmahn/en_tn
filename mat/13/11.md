This can be translated with the active form and with implied information expressed clearly. Alternate translation: "God has given you the privilege of understanding mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but God has not given it to these people" or "God has made you able to understand mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but he has not enabled these people to understand" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# You have been given the privilege

The word "You" is plural here and refers to the disciples. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# mysteries of the kingdom of heaven

Here "kingdom of heaven" refers to God's rule. The phrase "kingdom of heaven" occurs only in the book of Matthew. If possible, try to keep it in your translation. Alternate translation: "the secrets about our God in heaven and his rule" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
