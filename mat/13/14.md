# To them the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled, that which says

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "They are fulfilling what God said long ago through the prophet Isaiah"

# While hearing you will hear, but you will in no way understand; while seeing you will see, but you will in no way perceive

This begins a quote from the prophet Isaiah about the unbelieving people of Isaiah's day. Jesus uses this quote to describe the very crowd that was listening to him. These statements are again parallel and emphasize that the people refused to understand God's truth. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# While hearing you will hear, but you will in no way understand

"You will hear things, but you will not understand them." You can make explicit what the people will hear. Alternate translation: "You will hear what God says through the prophets, but you will not understand its true meaning" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# while seeing you will see, but you will in no way perceive

You can make explicit what the people will see. Alternate translation: "you will see what God does through the prophets, but you will not understand it" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
