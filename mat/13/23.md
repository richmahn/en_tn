# What was sown on the good soil

"The good soil where seeds were sown"

# He bears fruit and makes a crop

The person is spoken of as if he were a plant. AT: "Like a healthy plant that bears a crop of fruit, he is productive" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# yielding one hundred times as much as was planted, some sixty, and some thirty times as much

The phrase "as much as was planted" is understood following each of these numbers. See how you translated this in [Matthew 13:8](./08.md). AT: "Some people produce 100 times as much as was planted, some produce 60 times as much, and some produce 30 times as much" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])
