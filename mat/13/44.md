# General Information:

In these two parables, Jesus uses two similes to teach his disciples what the kingdom of heaven is like. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# Connecting Statement:

Jesus describes the kingdom of heaven by telling two parables about people who sold their possessions to purchase something of great value. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])

# The kingdom of heaven is like

Here "kingdom of heaven" refers to God's rule as king. The phrase "kingdom of heaven" is used only in Matthew. If possible, use "heaven" in your translation. See how you translated this in [Matthew 13:24](./24.md). AT: "When our God in heaven shows himself to be king, it will be like" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# like a treasure hidden in a field

This can be stated in active form. AT: "a treasure that someone had hidden in a field" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# treasure

a very valuable and precious thing or collection of things

# hid it

"covered it up"

# sells everything he possesses, and buys that field

The implied information is that the person buys the field to take possession of the hidden treasure. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
