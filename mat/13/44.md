Jesus went into a house with his disciples and continued to explain the parables about the kingdom of God. In these two parables, Jesus uses two similes to teach his disciples what the kingdom of heaven is like. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

## The kingdom of heaven is like ##

See how you translated this in [Matthew 13:24](./24.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

## a treasure hidden in a field ##

A treasure is a very valuable and precious thing or collection of things. This can be translated with an active verb: "a treasure that someone had hidden in a field" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## hid it ##

"covered it up"

## sells everything he possesses, and buys that field ##

The implied information is that the person buys the field to take possession of the hidden treasure. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

## a merchant ##

A merchant is a trader or wholesale dealer, often obtaining merchandise from distant places.

## looking for valuable pearls ##

The implied information is that the man was looking for valuable pearls that he could buy. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

## valuable pearls ##

This can be translated "fine pearls" or "beautiful pearls". A "pearl" is a smooth, hard, shiny, white or light-colored bead formed inside mollusks in the sea and highly prized as a gem or to make valuable jewelry.
