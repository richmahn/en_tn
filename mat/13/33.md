## translationNotes

* Jesus continues to tell a large crowd of people different parables that describe what the kingdom of God is like.
* **Jesus then told them another parable** - "Jesus then told another parable to the crowd"
* **The kingdom of heaven is like** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:13:24]]. The kingdom is not like the yeast, but the spread of the kingdom is like the spreading of the yeast. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
* **three measures of flour** - “a large amount of flour” or with a term that your culture uses for measuring large amounts of flour (see UDB).
* **until it rose** - until the dough rose. The implied information is that the yeast and the three measures of flour were made into dough for baking. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
