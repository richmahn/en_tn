Jesus continues to tell a large crowd of people different parables that describe what the kingdom of God is like.

## Jesus then told them another parable ##

"Jesus then told another parable to the crowd"

## The kingdom of heaven is like ##

See how you translated this in [Matthew 13:24](./24.md). The kingdom is not like the yeast, but the spread of the kingdom is like the spreading of the yeast. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

## three measures of flour ##

“a large amount of flour” or with a term that your culture uses for measuring large amounts of flour (see UDB).

## until it rose ##

until the dough rose. The implied information is that the yeast and the three measures of flour were made into dough for baking. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
