# Connecting Statement:

Jesus describes the kingdom of heaven by telling a parable about the effect that yeast has on flour. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])

# The kingdom of heaven is like yeast

The kingdom is not like the yeast, but the spread of the kingdom is like the spreading of the yeast. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# The kingdom of heaven is like

Here "kingdom of heaven" refers to God's rule as king. The phrase "kingdom of heaven" is used only in Matthew. If possible, use "heaven" in your translation. See how you translated this in [Matthew 13:24](./24.md). Alternate translation: "When our God in heaven shows himself to be king, it will be like" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# three measures of flour

Say "a large amount of flour" or use a term that your culture uses for measuring large amounts of flour. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bvolume]])

# until all the dough had risen

The implied information is that the yeast and the three measures of flour were made into dough for baking. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
