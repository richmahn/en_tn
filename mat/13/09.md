# He who has ears, let him hear

Jesus is emphasizing that what he has just said is important. The word "ear" here is a metonym for either 1) the ability to hear his message. AT: "Since you can hear what I am saying, listen carefully" or 2) the desire to listen and obey. AT: "Let the one who is willing to listen, listen" See how you translated this in [Matthew 11:15](../11/15.md). (See [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
