# Connecting Statement:

Here Jesus begins to explain to his disciples the parable about a person who sows seeds, which he began in [Matthew 13:3](./03.md).

# the word of the kingdom

Here "word" refers to a message. And "kingdom" refers to God's rule as king. AT: "the message about God's rule as king" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# the evil one comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart

Jesus speaks of Satan causing the person to forget what he has heard as if he were a bird snatching the seed from the ground. AT: "The evil one causes him to forget the message that he has heard just like a bird that snatches away seed from the ground" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the evil one

This refers to Satan. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# snatches away

Try to use a word that means to grab something away from someone who is the rightful owner.

# what has been sown in his heart

This can be translated in active form: AT: "the message that God sowed in his heart" or "the message that he heard" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# in his heart

Here "heart" refers to the mind of the hearer. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# This is the seed that was sown beside the road
