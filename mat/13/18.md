[Matthew 13:7](./07.md).

## the evil one comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart ##

"Satan causes him to forget the word of God that he has heard".

## snatches away  ##

Try to use a word that means to grab something away from someone who is the rightful owner.

## what has been sown in his heart ##

This can be translated with the active form: "the word God sowed in his heart." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## in his heart ##

in the heart of the hearer

## This is he who was sown on the wayside ##

If a literal translation makes no sense, try to translate so the reader understands that Jesus is the sower, the message is the seed, and the hearer is the soil on the wayside. Possible translation: "This is how it is with what was sown on the wayside." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

## wayside  ##

"road" or "path." Translate this as you did in [Matthew 13:3](./03.md).
