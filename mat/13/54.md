# General Information:

This is the beginning of a new part of the story that runs through [Matthew 17:27](../17/26.md), where the writer tells of continued opposition to Jesus' ministry and teaching about the kingdom of heaven. Here, the people of Jesus' home town reject him.

# his own region

"his hometown." This refers to the town of Nazareth where Jesus grew up. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# in their synagogue

The pronoun "their" is referring to the people of the region.

# they were astonished

"they were amazed"

# Where does this man get his wisdom and these miracles from?

The people use this question to express their amazement that Jesus was so wise and was able to do miracles. AT: "How can an ordinary man like this be so wise and do such great miracles?" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Is not this man the carpenter's son? Is not his mother called Mary? Are not his brothers James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas? Are not all his sisters with us?

The crowd uses these questions to express their belief that they know who Jesus is and that he is just an ordinary man. AT: "He is just the son of a carpenter. We know his mother Mary, and his brothers James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas. And all his sisters are with us, too." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# the carpenter's son

A carpenter is someone who makes things with wood or stone. If "carpenter" is not known, "builder" can be used.

# Where did he get all these things?

The crowd uses this question to show their surprise that an ordinary person from their region would be able to do these things. AT: "An ordinary man should not be able to do these things!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
