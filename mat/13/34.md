## translationNotes

* Jesus continues to tell a large crowd of people different parables that describe what the kingdom of God is like.
* **All these things Jesus said to the crowds in parables; and without parables he said nothing to them** - The order "said...parables...parables...said" is meant to emphasize that he spoke to them in parables.
* **All these things** - This refers to what Jesus taught beginning at [[:en:bible:notes:mat:13:01]].
* **without parables he said nothing to them** - "he taught them nothing except by parables." Alternate translation: "everything he said to them he said in parables." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]] and [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
* **what had been said through the prophet might come true, when he said ** - This can be translated with an active verb: "he made come true what God told one of the prophets to write long ago" (UDB). (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
* **when he said** - "when the prophet said"
* **things that were hidden** - This can be translated with an active verb: "things that God has kept hidden".(See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
* **from the foundation of the world** - "since the beginning of the world" or "since God created the world."
