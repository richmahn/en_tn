# General Information:

Here the author quotes from the Psalms to show that Jesus' teaching in parables fulfilled prophecy.

# All these things Jesus said to the crowds in parables; and he said nothing to them without a parable

Both sentences mean the same thing. They are combined to emphasize that Jesus taught the crowds only with parables. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# All these things

This refers to what Jesus taught beginning at [Matthew 13:1](./01.md).

# he said nothing to them without a parable

"he taught them nothing except by parables." The double negative can be expressed in a positive way. AT: "everything he taught them he said in parables" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])

# what had been said through the prophet might come true, when he said

This can be stated in active form. AT: "he made come true what God told one of the prophets to write long ago" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# when he said

"when the prophet said"

# I will open my mouth

This is an idiom that means to speak. AT: "I will speak" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# things that were hidden

This can be stated in active form. AT: "things that God has kept hidden" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# from the foundation of the world

"since the beginning of the world" or "since God created the world"
