# General Information:

Here the author quotes from the Psalms to show that Jesus' teaching in parables fulfilled prophecy.

# All these things Jesus said to the crowds in parables; and he said nothing to them without a parable

Both sentences mean the same thing. They are combined to emphasize that Jesus taught the crowds only with parables. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# All these things

This refers to what Jesus taught beginning at [Matthew 13:1](./01.md).

# he said nothing to them without a parable

"he taught them nothing except by parables." The double negative can be expressed in a positive way. Alternate translation: "everything he taught them he said in parables" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
