# Connecting Statement:

Jesus describes the kingdom of heaven by telling a parable about fishermen who use a large net to catch fish. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])

# the kingdom of heaven is like a net

The kingdom is not like the net, but the kingdom draws all kinds of people like a net catches all kinds of fish. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# the kingdom of heaven is like

Here "kingdom of heaven" refers to God's rule as king. The phrase "kingdom of heaven" is used only in Matthew. If possible, use "heaven" in your translation. See how you translated this in [Matthew 13:24](./24.md). Alternate translation: "When our God in heaven shows himself to be king, it will be like" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# like a net that was cast into the sea

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "like a net that some fishermen cast into the sea" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# was cast into the sea

"was thrown into the sea"

# gathered creatures of every kind

"caught all kinds of fish"
