Jesus went into a house with his disciples and continued to explain the parables about the kingdom of God. In this parable, Jesus again uses a simile to teach his disciples what the kingdom of heaven is like. (See: Simile)

## the kingdom of heaven is like ##

See how you translated this in [Matthew 13:24](./24.md). The kingdom is not like the net, but the kingdom draws all kinds of people like a net catches all kinds of fish. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

## like a net that was cast into the sea ##

This can be translated with an active verb: "like a net that some fishermen cast into the sea."

## a net that was cast into the sea ##

"a net that was thrown into the lake"

## gathered creatures of every kind ##

"caught all kinds of fish"

## drew it up on the beach ##

"pulled the net up onto the beach" or "pulled the net ashore"

## the good things ##

"the good ones"

## the worthless things  ##

"the bad fish" or "the inedible fish"

## threw away ##

"did not keep"
