## translationNotes

* Jesus continues to tell a large crowd of people different parables that describe what the kingdom of God is like.
* **to them ** - to the disciples
* **You have been given the privilege of understanding mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given** - This can be translated with the active form and supplying implied information: “God has given you the privilege of understanding mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but God has not given it to these people” or “God has made you able to understand mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but he has not enabled these people.” (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] and [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
* **You** - the disciples
* **mysteries** - Truths that had been kept hidden but Jesus is now revealing. Alternate translation: "secrets" or "hidden truths" (see UDB).
* **whoever has** - “whoever has understanding” or “whoever receives what I teach.”
* **to him will be given more** - This can be translated with the active form: “God will give him more understanding.” (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
* **he will have a great deal** - "he will understand clearly"
* **whoever has not ** - “whoever does not have understanding” or “whoever does not receive what I teach”
* **from him will be taken away even what he has ** - This can be translated with the active form: "God will take away even what he has." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
