#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations indent each line of poetry to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetry in 13:14-15, which is quoted from the OT.

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter ####

##### Parables #####

A parable is a short story used to illustrate a moral or religious lesson. In this chapter, the parables, reveal truth about the kingdom of heaven to those who have faith in Jesus. They also conceal these same truths from those who reject Jesus ([Matthew 13:11-13](./10.md)). These parables usually take the form of stories.

##### Synecdoche #####
In this chapter, Jesus refers to the eyes seeing and the ears hearing. He uses these figures of speech to encourage his listeners to understand the lessons of these parables.
