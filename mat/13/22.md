# Connecting Statement:

Jesus continues to explain to his disciples the parable about a person who sows seeds.

# What was sown

This refers to seed that was sown or that fell. Alternate translation: "The seed that was sown" or "The seed that fell" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# What was sown among the thorn plants

"The ground with the thorn plants where seed was sown"

# this is the person

"this represents the person"

# the word

"the message" or "God's teaching"

# the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word

Jesus speaks about the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of riches distracting a person from obeying God's word as if they were weeds that could wind around a plant and keep it from growing. Alternate translation: "as weeds prevent good plants from growing, the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of riches keep this person from listening to God's word" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# cares of the world

"the things in this world that people worry about"

# the deceitfulness of riches

Jesus describes "riches" as if it were a person who could deceive someone. This means people think having more money will make them happy, but it will not. Alternate translation: "the love of money" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# he becomes unfruitful

The person is spoken of as if he were a plant. Being unfruitful represents being unproductive. Alternate translation: "he becomes unproductive" or "he does not do what God wants" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
