## translationNotes

* [[:en:bible:notes:mat:13:07]].
* **He who was sown among the thorn plants...He who was sown on the good soil** - If a literal translation makes no sense, try to translate so the reader understands that Jesus is the sower, the message is the seed, and the hearer is the ground with thorn plants. Possible translation: "This is how it is with what was sown on the ground with thorn plants...This is how it is with what was sown on the good soil." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]] and [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
* **the word** - "the message"
* **the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and he becomes unfruitful** - This can be translated "as weeds prevent good plants from growing, the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of riches keep this person from becoming fruitful” (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **cares of the world ** - “the things in this world that people worry about”
* **becomes unfruitful ** - “becomes unproductive"
* **this is he who truly produces fruit and brings it forth** - “these are the ones who are fruitful and productive” or “like healthy plants that produce good fruit, these people are productive.” (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
