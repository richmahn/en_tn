# Connecting Statement:

Jesus finishes explaining to his disciples why he teaches with parables.

# But blessed are your eyes, for they see; and your ears, for they hear

Both of these statements mean the same thing. Jesus is emphasizing that they have pleased God because they have believed what Jesus has said and done. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# But blessed are your eyes, for they see

Here "eyes" refers to the whole person. AT: "You are blessed because your eyes are able to see" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# your ... you

All occurrences of these words are plural and refer to the disciples. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# your ears, for they hear

Here "ears" refer to the whole person. You can also make clear the understood information. AT: "you are blessed because your ears are able to hear" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
