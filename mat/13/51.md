## translationNotes

* Jesus went into a house with his disciples and continued to explain the parables about the kingdom of God.
* **"Have you understood all these things?" The disciples said to him, "Yes."** - If necessary, this can be written as an indirect quotation such as "Jesus asked them if they had understood all this, and they said they had." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotations]])
* **has become a disciple to** - "has learned about"
* **treasure** - A treasure is a very valuable and precious thing or a collection of things. Here it may refer to the place where these things are stored, the "treasury" or "storeroom."
