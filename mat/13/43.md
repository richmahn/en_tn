# shine like the sun

If this simile is not understandable in your language, you can use: "be as easy to see as the sun." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# Father

This is an important title for God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])

# He who has ears, let him hear

Jesus is emphasizing that what he has just said is important. You may need to use the second person. The word "ear" here is a metonym for either 1) the ability to hear his message. AT: "Let everyone who can hear what I am saying listen carefully" or "Since you can hear what I am saying, listen carefully" or 2) the desire to listen and obey. AT: "Let the one who is willing to listen, listen" or "Since you are willing to listen, listen" See how you translated similar words in [Matthew 11:15](../11/15.md) (See [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
