# Connecting Statement:

Jesus describes the kingdom of heaven by telling a parable about a person who sows seeds.

# Jesus said many things to them in parables

"Jesus told them many things in parables"

# to them

"to the people in the crowd"

# Behold

"Look" or "Listen." This word calls attention to what is to be said next. AT: "Pay attention to what I am about to tell you"

# a farmer went out to sow seed

"a farmer went out to scatter seeds in a field"

# As he sowed

"As the farmer scattered the seed"

# beside the road

This refers to a "path" next to the field. The ground there would have been hard from people walking on it.

# devoured them

"ate all the seeds"

# rocky ground

This is ground full of rocks with just a thin layer of soil on top of the rocks.

# Immediately they sprang up

"The seeds quickly sprouted and grew"

# they were scorched

This can be stated in active form. AT: "the sun scorched the plants, and they became too hot" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# they withered away

"the plants became dry and died"
