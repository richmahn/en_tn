Jesus continues to tell a large crowd of people different parables that describe what the kingdom of God is like.

## fell among the thorn plants ##

"fell where thorn plants would also grow"

## choked them ##

"choked the new sprouts." Use the usual word for the way weeds prevent other plants from growing well.

## produced grain  ##

"produced a crop" or "grew more seeds" or "gave fruit"

## He who has ears, let him listen ##

It may be more natural in some languages to use the second person: "You who have ears to listen, listen." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

## He who has ears ##

"Whoever can hear" or "Whoever hears me"

## let him listen ##

"let him listen well" or "let him pay attention to what I say"
