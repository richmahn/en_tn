# Connecting Statement:

Jesus finishes telling a parable about a person who sows seeds.

# fell among the thorn plants

"fell where plants with thorns grew"

# choked them

"choked the new sprouts." Use your word for the way weeds prevent other plants from growing well.

# produced grain

"produced a crop" or "grew more seeds" or "gave fruit"

# some one hundred times as much, some sixty, and some thirty

You can make clear the understood information as was done in the UDB. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# one hundred ... sixty ... thirty

"100 ... 60 ... 30" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])

# He who has ears

This is a way of referring to everyone there who was hearing what Jesus was saying. See how you translated this in [Matthew 11:15](../11/13.md). AT: "Whoever can hear me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# listen

Here "listen" represents paying attention. See how you translated this in [Matthew 11:15](../11/13.md). AT: "pay attention to what I am saying" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
