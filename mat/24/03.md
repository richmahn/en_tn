# What will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age

Here "your coming" refers to when Jesus will come in power, establishing God's reign on earth and bringing this age to an end. AT: "What will be the sign that you are about to come and that the world is about to end" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
