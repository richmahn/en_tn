# What will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age

Here "your coming" refers to when Jesus will come in power, establishing God's reign on earth and bringing this age to an end. AT: "What will be the sign that you are about to come and that the world is about to end?" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# Be careful that no one leads you astray

To lead one "astray" is a metaphor, as if the person is on the correct path, but is suddenly led off the path by being deceived. AT: "Be careful that you do not follow anyone who would deceive you about these things." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]]).

# many will come in my name

Here "name" refers to "in the authority" or "as the representative" of someone. AT: "many will claim that they have come as my representative" or "many will say they speak for me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# and will lead many astray.

AT: "and they will deceive many."
