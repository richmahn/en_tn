# the Son of Man ... He ... his

Jesus is speaking about himself in the third person. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# He will send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet

"He will have a trumpet sounded and send his angels" or "He will have an angel blow a trumpet, and he will send his angels"

# they will gather

"his angels will gather"

# his elect

These are the people whom the Son of Man has chosen.

# from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other

Both of these mean the same thing. They are idioms that mean "from everywhere." Alternate translation: "from all over the world" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
