# Connecting Statement:

Jesus concludes his proverb of a master and servants to illustrate that his disciples should be prepared for his return. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-proverbs]])

# says in his heart

Here "heart" refers to the mind. AT: "thinks in his mind" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# My master has been delayed

This can be stated in active form. AT: "My master is slow to return" or "My master will not return for a long time" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# on a day that the servant does not expect and at an hour that he does not know

Both of these statements mean the same thing. They emphasize that the master will come when the servant is not expecting him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# cut him in pieces

This is an idiom that means to make the person suffer terribly. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# assign him a place with the hypocrites

"put him with the hypocrites" or "send him to the place where hypocrites are sent" 

# there will be weeping and grinding of teeth

"Grinding of teeth" here is a symbolic act, representing extreme suffering. See how you translated this in [Matthew 8:12](../08/11.md). AT: "people will weep and grind their teeth because of their suffering" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
