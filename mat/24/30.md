Jesus continues to tell his disciples what will happen before he comes again.

## beat their breasts ##

hit their chests to show they are afraid of the coming punishment

## they will gather ##

"his angels will gather"

## his elect ##

the people whom the Son of Man has chosen

## the four winds ##

AT: "from the north, the south, the east, and the west" (see UDB) or "from everywhere." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
