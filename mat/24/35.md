# Heaven and the earth will pass away

The words "heaven" and "earth" are a synecdoche that includes everything that God has created, especially those things that seem permanent. Jesus is saying that his word, unlike these things, is permanent. AT: "Even heaven and the earth will pass away" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# my words will never pass away

Here "words" refers to what Jesus has said. AT: "what I say will always be true" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
