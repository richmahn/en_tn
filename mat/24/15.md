# the abomination of desolation

"the shameful one who defiles the things of God"

# which was spoken of by Daniel the prophet

This can be stated in active form. AT: "about which Daniel the prophet wrote" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# let the reader understand

This is not Jesus speaking. Matthew added this to alert the reader that Jesus was using words that they would need to think about and interpret.

# let him who is on the housetop

Housetops where Jesus lived were flat, and people could stand on them.
