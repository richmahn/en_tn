#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### "The end of the world" #####

In this chapter, Jesus gives an answer to his disciples when they ask how they will know when he will come again. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-apocalypticwriting]])

##### The example of Noah #####

In the time of Noah, God sent a great flood to punish people for their sins. He warned them many times about this coming flood, but it actually began suddenly. In this chapter, Jesus draws a comparison between that flood and the last days. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### "Let" #####

The ULB uses this word to begin several commands of Jesus, such as "let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains" (24:16), "let him who is on the housetop not go down to take out anything that is in his house" (24:17), and "and let him who is in the field not return to take his cloak" (24:17). There are many different ways to form a command. Translators must select the most natural ways in their own languages.
