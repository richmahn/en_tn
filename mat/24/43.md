Jesus tells his disciples how to get ready for his return.

## the thief ##

Jesus is saying he will come when people are not expecting him, not that he will come to steal.

## he would have been on guard ##

"he would have guarded his house" to keep it safe

## and would not have allowed his house to be broken into ##

"he would not have allowed anyone to get into his house to steal things" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
