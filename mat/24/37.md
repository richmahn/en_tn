## translationNotes

* Jesus continues to tell his disciples what will happen before he comes again.
* **As the days of Noah were, so will be the coming of the Son of Man** - AT: "The day when the Son of Man comes again will be like the days of Noah were" because no one will know that bad things will happen to them.
* **For as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking, ... took them all awayâ€”so will be the coming of the Son of Man** - AT: "The days before the Son of Man comes will be like the days before the flood, when everyone was eating and drinking, ... took them all away"
