# Be careful that no one leads you astray ... and will lead many astray

Here "leads you astray" is a metaphor for persuading someone to believe something that is not true. Alternate translation: "Be careful that no one deceives you ... and will deceive many people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
