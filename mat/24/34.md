Jesus continues to tell his disciples what will happen before he comes again.

## this generation will not pass away ##

"the people living today will not all die" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])

## until all of these things will have occurred ##

AT: "until God causes all these things to happen"

## Heaven and the earth will pass away ##

"Heaven and the earth will no longer exist"
