# Truly I say to you

"I tell you the truth." This adds emphasis to what Jesus says next.

# this generation will not pass away

Here "pass away" is a polite way of saying "die." AT: "this generation will not all die" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])

# this generation

Possible interpretations are 1) "all people alive today," referring to the people alive when Jesus was speaking, or 2) "all people alive when these things I have just told you about happen." Try to translate so that both interpretations are possible.

# until all of these things will have happened

"until God causes all these things to happen"

# Heaven and the earth will pass away

The words "heaven" and "earth" are a synecdoche that includes everything that God has created, especially those things that seem permanent. Jesus is saying that his word, unlike these things, is permanent. AT: "Even heaven and the earth will pass away" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# pass away

"disappear" or "someday no longer exist"

# my words will never pass away

Here "words" refers to what Jesus has said. AT: "what I say will always be true" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
