# Truly I say to you

"I tell you the truth." This adds emphasis to what Jesus says next.

# this generation will not pass away

Here "pass away" is a polite way of saying "die." Alternate translation: "this generation will not all die" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])

# this generation

Possible interpretations are 1) "all people alive today," referring to the people alive when Jesus was speaking, or 2) "all people alive when these things I have just told you about happen." Try to translate so that both interpretations are possible.

# until all of these things will have happened

"until God causes all these things to happen"

# pass away

"disappear" or "someday no longer exist"
