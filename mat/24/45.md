# Connecting Statement:

Jesus continues his proverb of a master and servants to illustrate that his disciples should be prepared for his return.

# So who is the faithful and wise servant whom his master ... time?

Jesus uses this question to make his disciples think. Alternate translation: "So who is the faithful and wise servant? He is the one whom his master ... time." or "Be like the faithful and wise servant, whom his master ... time." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# give them their food

"give the people in the master's home their food"
