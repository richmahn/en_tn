# so as to lead astray, if possible, even the elect

Here "lead astray" is a metaphor for persuading someone to believe something that is not true. This can be translated as two sentences. Alternate translation: "so as to deceive, if possible, even the elect" or "so as to deceive people. If possible, they would even deceive the elect" (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
