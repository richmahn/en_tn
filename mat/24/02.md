# Do you not see all these things?

Jesus uses a question to make the disciples think deeply about what he will tell them. AT: "Let me tell you something about all these buildings." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Truly I say to you

"I tell you the truth." This adds emphasis to what Jesus says next.

# not one stone will be left on another that will not be torn down

It is implied that enemy soldiers will tear down the stones. This can be stated in active form. AT: "when the enemy soldiers come, they will tear down every stone in these buildings" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
