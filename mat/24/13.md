# the one who endures to the end will be saved

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "God will save the person who endures to the end" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# the one who endures

"the person who stays faithful"

# to the end

It is not clear whether the word "end" refers to when a person dies or when the persecution ends or the end of the age when God shows himself to be king. The main point is that they endure as long as necessary.

# the end

"the end of the world" or "the end of the age"
