Jesus continues to tell his disciples what will happen before he comes again.

## as the lightning shines … so will be the coming … ##

He will come very fast and be easy to see. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

## Wherever a dead animal is, there the vultures will gather ##

Possible meanings: 1) when the Son of Man comes, everyone will see him and know that he has come (see UDB) or 2) wherever spiritually dead people are, false prophets ([Matthew 24:9](./09.md)) will be there to tell them lies. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## vultures ##

birds that eat the bodies of dead or dying creatures
