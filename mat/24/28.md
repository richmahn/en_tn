# Wherever a dead animal is, there the vultures will gather

This is probably a proverb that the people of Jesus' time understood. Possible meanings are 1) when the Son of Man comes, everyone will see him and know that he has come, or 2) wherever spiritually dead people are, false prophets will be there to tell them lies. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-proverbs]])

# vultures

birds that eat the bodies of dead or dying creatures
