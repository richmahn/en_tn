## translationNotes

* Jesus begins to tell his disciples what will happen before he comes again.
* **Do you not see all these things?** - Possible meanings: Jesus is talking about 1) the temple buildings (AT: "Let me tell you something about all these buildings.") or 2) the destruction he has just described ("You should have understood what I just told you, but you do not!"). (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
