# General Information:

This event happened after Jesus' trial in front of the council of Jewish religious leaders, but we do not know if it happened before or during Jesus' trial before Pilate. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-events]])

# Connecting Statement:

The author has stopped telling the story of Jesus' trial so he can tell the story of how Judas killed himself.

# Then when Judas

If your language has a way of showing that a new story is starting, you may want to use that here.

# that Jesus had been condemned

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "that the Jewish leaders had condemned Jesus" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# the thirty pieces of silver

This was the money that the chief priests had given Judas to betray Jesus. See how you translated it in [Matthew 26:15](../26/15.md).
