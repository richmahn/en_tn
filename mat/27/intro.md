# Matthew 27 General Notes #

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### "Delivered him to Pilate the governor" #####

The Jewish leaders needed to get permission from Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor, before they could kill Jesus. This was because Roman law did not allow them to kill Jesus themselves. Pilate wanted to set Jesus free, but they wanted him to free a very bad prisoner named Barabbas.

##### The tomb #####

The tomb in which Jesus was buried ([Matthew 27:60](../27/60.md)) was the kind of tomb in which wealthy Jewish families buried their dead. It was an actual room cut into a rock. It had a flat place on one side where they could place the body after they had put oil and spices on it and wrapped it in cloth. Then they would roll a large rock in front of the tomb so no one could see inside or enter.

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter ####

##### Sarcasm #####

The soldiers said, "Hail, King of the Jews!" ([Matthew 27:29](../27/29.md)) to mock Jesus. They did not think that he was the king of the Jews. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])
