# Now

This word is used here to mark a break in the main story line. Here Matthew starts to tell a new part of the story.

# from the sixth hour ... until the ninth hour

"from about noon ... for three hours" or "from about twelve o'clock midday ... until about three o'clock in the afternoon"

# darkness came over the whole land

The word "darkness" is an abstract noun. AT: "it became dark over the whole land" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# Jesus cried

"Jesus called out" or "Jesus shouted"

# Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani

These words are what Jesus cried out in his own language. Translators usually leave these words as is. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate]])
