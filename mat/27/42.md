# He saved others, but he cannot save himself

Possible meanings are 1) the Jewish leaders do not believe that Jesus saved others or that he can save himself, or 2) they believe he did save others but are laughing at him because now he cannot save himself. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])

# He is the King of Israel

The leaders are mocking Jesus. They call him "King of Israel," but they do not really believe he is king. Alternate translation: "He says that he is the King of Israel" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])
