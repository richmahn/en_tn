# Connecting Statement:

This begins the account of the events that happened when Jesus died.

# Behold

The word "behold" here alerts us to pay attention to the surprising information that follows.

# the curtain of the temple was split in two

This can be stated in active form. AT: "the curtain of the temple tore in two" or "God caused the curtain of the temple to tear in two" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# The tombs were opened, and the bodies of many godly people who had fallen asleep were raised

This can be stated in active form. AT: "God opened the tombs and raised the bodies of many godly people who had died" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# fallen asleep

This is a polite way of referring to dying. AT: "died" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])

# The tombs were opened ... appeared to many

The order of events is unclear. After the earthquake when Jesus died and the tombs were opened 1) the holy people came back to life, then after Jesus came back to life, the holy people entered Jerusalem where many people saw them, or 2) Jesus came back to life, then the holy ones came back to life and entered the city where many people saw them.
