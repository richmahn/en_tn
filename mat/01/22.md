Matthew quotes a prophecy that the birth of Jesus would fulfill.

## what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet ##

This could be stated in the active voice as "what the Lord told the prophet Isaiah to write long ago." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## Behold ##

Alternative translation: “Look” or “Listen” or “Pay attention to what I am about to tell you.”

## the virgin will conceive and give birth to a son ##

This verse is a direct quotation from [Isaiah 7:13](../../isa/07/13.md).
