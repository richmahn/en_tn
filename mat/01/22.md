# General Information:

The author quotes the prophet Isaiah to show that Jesus' birth was according to scripture. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])

# All this happened

The angel is no longer speaking. Matthew is now explaining the importance of what the angel said.

# what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet

This can be stated in active form. AT: "what the Lord told the prophet to write long ago" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# the prophet

There were many prophets. Matthew was speaking of Isaiah. AT: "the prophet Isaiah" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# Behold ... Immanuel

Here Matthew quotes the prophet Isaiah.

# Behold, the virgin

"Pay attention, because what I am about to say is both true and important: the virgin"

# Immanuel

This is a male name. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# which means, "God with us."

This is not in the book of Isaiah. Matthew is explaining the meaning of the name "Immanuel." You could translate it as a separate sentence. AT: "This name means 'God with us.'"
