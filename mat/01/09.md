The list of Jesus' ancestors continues. Use the same wording that you used in Matthew [Matthew 1:1](./01.md).

## Amon ##

Sometimes this is translated "Amos."

## Josiah the father of Jechoniah ##

Josiah was actually Jechoniah's grandfather (see UDB).

## at the time of the deportation to Babylon ##

"when they were forced to move to Babylon" or "when the Babylonians made them go live in Babylon." If your language needs to specify who went to Babylon, you could say "the Israelites" or "the Israelites who lived in Judah."
