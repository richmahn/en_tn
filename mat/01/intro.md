# Matthew 01 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations set a quotation from the Old Testament farher to the right on the page than the rest of the text. The ULB does this for the quoted material in 1:23.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Genealogy #####

A genealogy is a list that records a person's ancestors or descendants. Jews used genealogies to choose the right man to become king. They did this because only a son of a king could become king. Most important people had records of their genealogies.
 
#### Important figures of speech in this chapter ####

##### Use of the passive voice #####

The writer uses the passive voice very purposefully in this chapter to indicate that Mary did not have a sexual relationship with anyone. She became pregnant with Jesus because the Holy Spirit performed a miracle. Many languages do not have a passive voice, so translators in those languages must find other ways to present the same truths. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
