# Matthew 01 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations indent quotations from the Old Testament. The ULB indents the quoted material in 1:23.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Genealogy #####

A genealogy is a list that records a person's ancestors or descendants. These lists were very important because the king would inherit his authority from his father. So the Jews used genealogies to choose the right man to become king. Most important people had records of their genealogies.

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter ####

##### Use of the passive voice #####

The writer uses the passive voice very purposefully in this chapter to indicate that Mary did not have a sexual relationship with anyone. She became pregnant with Jesus because the Holy Spirit performed a miracle. Many languages do not have a passive voice, so translators in those languages must find other ways to present the same truths. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
