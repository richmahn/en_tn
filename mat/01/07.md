## translationNotes

* The list of Jesus' ancestors continues. Use the same wording that you used in Matthew [[:en:bible:notes:mat:01:01]].
* **Asa** - Sometimes his name is translated as "Asaph."
* **Joram the father of Uzziah** - Joram was actually Uzziah's grandfather's grandfather, so "father" can be translated as "ancestor" (UDB).
