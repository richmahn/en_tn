The list of Jesus' ancestors continues. Use the same wording that you used in Matthew [Matthew 1:1](./01.md).

## Asa ##

Sometimes his name is translated as "Asaph."

## Joram the father of Uzziah ##

Joram was actually Uzziah's grandfather's grandfather, so "father" can be translated as "ancestor" (UDB).
