17 list the ancestors of Jesus Christ.

## the son of David, the son of Abraham ##

Alternate translation: "a descendant of David, who was a descendant of Abraham." There were many generations between Abraham and his descendant David, and between David and his descendant Jesus. "Son of David" is used as a title in [Matthew 9:27](../09/27.md) and other places, but here it seems to be used only to identify Jesus' ancestry.

## Abraham was the father of Isaac ##

Alternate translation: "Abraham became the father of Isaac" or "Abraham had a son Isaac" or "Abraham had a son named Isaac." It may be more clear for your readers if you choose one way of saying this and use it throughout the rest of the list.

## Tamar ##

Languages that have masculine and feminine forms of names should use a feminine form for her name.
