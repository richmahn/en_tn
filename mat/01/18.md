"before they got married." This may refer to Mary and Joseph sleeping together. AT: "before they had slept together" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])

# she was found to be pregnant

This can be stated in active form. AT: "they realized that she was going to have a baby" or "it happened that she was pregnant" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
