## translationNotes

* This continues to tell about the events leading up to the birth of Jesus.
* **appeared** - an angel came suddenly to Joseph
* **son of David** - In this case, the expression "son of" means "descendant of." David was not Joseph's father, but David was Joseph's ancestor.
* **the one who is conceived in her is conceived by the Holy Spirit** - "the Holy Spirit conceived the baby with whom Mary is pregnant." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
* **She will give birth to a son** - Because God sent the angel, the angel knew the baby was a boy.
* **you will call his name** - This is a command: "call his name" or "give him the name" or "name him"
* **he will save his people** - "his people" refers to the Jews
