Jesus continues to teach about marriage and divorce.

## eunuchs who were so born from their mother's womb ##

"males born without working sex organs"

## eunuchs who made themselves eunuchs ##

Possible meanings are 1) "eunuchs who have cut their sex organs off" or 2) "men who choose to remain unmarried and sexually pure" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]]).

## for the kingdom of heaven's sake ##

"so they can serve God better"

## receive this teaching...receive it ##

See how you translated "accept this teaching...accept it" in 19:11.
