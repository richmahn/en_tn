# Connecting Statement:

Jesus begins to teach about marriage and divorce.

# came to him

"came to Jesus"

# testing him, saying to him

Here "tested" is used in a negative sense. AT: "and challenged him by asking him" or "and wanted to trap him by asking him"

# Have you not read that he who made them from the beginning made them male and female?

Jesus uses this question to remind the Pharisees of what the scripture says about men, women, and marriage. AT: "Surely you have read that in the beginning when God created people he made them male and female." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
