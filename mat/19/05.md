Jesus continues to teach about marriage and divorce.

## And that he said...? ##

This continues the question from [Matthew 19:3](./03.md): "Have you not also read that he said...?" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

## cleave to his wife ##

"stay close to his wife"

## one flesh ##

"one person" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
