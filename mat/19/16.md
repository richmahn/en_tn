# Connecting Statement:

Here the scene shifts to a different time when Jesus explains to a rich man what it will cost to follow him.

# Behold

The word "behold" alerts us to a new person in the story. Your language may have a way of doing this.

# good thing

This means a thing that pleases God.

# Why do you ask me about what is good?

Jesus uses a question to respond to the man. AT: "You should not ask me about what is good" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Only one is good

"God alone is completely good"

# to enter into life

"to receive eternal life"
