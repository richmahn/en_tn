# Connecting Statement:

Here the scene shifts to a different time when Jesus explains to a rich man what it will cost to follow him.

# Behold

The word "behold" alerts us to a new person in the story. Your language may have a way of doing this.

# good thing

This means a thing that pleases God.

# Why do you ask me about what is good?

Jesus uses this rhetorical question to encourage the man to think about his reason for asking Jesus about what is good. AT: "You ask me about what is good" or "Think about why you ask me about is good." (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion)

# Only one is good

"God alone is completely good"

# to enter into life

"to receive eternal life"
