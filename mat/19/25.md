# they were very astonished

"the disciples were amazed." It is implied that they were astonished because they believed having riches was proof that God approved of someone. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# Who then can be saved?

The disciples use a question to emphasize their surprise. This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "Then there is no one whom God will save!" or "Then there is no one who will receive eternal life!"
