# I say to you

This adds emphasis to what Jesus says next.

# marries another

You can make clear the understood information. AT: "marries another woman" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# and the man who marries a woman who is divorced commits adultery

Many early texts do not include these words. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
