# even Solomon ... was not clothed like one of these

Jesus speaks about the lilies as if they were people who wore clothes. The lilies being clothed is a metaphor for the plants having beautiful and colorful flowers. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# I say to you

This adds emphasis to what Jesus says next.

# was not clothed like one of these

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "did not wear clothes that are as beautiful as these lilies" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
