Jesus continues to teach his disciples. This event began in [Matthew 5:1](../05/01.md).
Jesus is talking to a group of people about what might happen to them as individuals. All occurances of “you” and “your” in verses 17 and 18 are singular, but you may want to translate them as plural to match the plural "you" in verse 16.

## Moreover ##

"Also"

## anoint your head ##

"look the same as you usually do." To "anoint" the head here is to take normal care of one's hair. It has nothing to do with "Christ" meaning "anointed one."
