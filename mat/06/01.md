# Connecting Statement:

Jesus continues to teach his disciples in his Sermon on the Mount, which began in [Matthew 5:3](../05/01.md). In this section, Jesus addresses the "acts of righteousness" of alms, prayer, and fasting.

# General Information:

Jesus is talking to a group of people about what might happen to them as individuals. All "you" and "your" are plural.

# before people to be seen by them

It is implied that those who see the person will honor him. This can be stated in active form. AT: "in front of people just so that they can see you and give you honor for what you have done" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# Father

This is an important title for God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])

# do not sound a trumpet before yourself

This metaphor means to do something that purposefully gets people's attention. AT: "do not draw attention to yourself like someone who plays a loud trumpet in a crowd" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Truly I say to you

"I tell you the truth." This phrase adds emphasis to what Jesus says next.
