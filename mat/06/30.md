# so clothes the grass

This is a metaphor that means God makes the flowers beautiful. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# grass

If your language has a word that includes "grass" and the word you used for "lilies" in the previous verse, you can use it here.

# is thrown into the oven

The Jews at that time used grass in their fires to cook their food. This can be stated in active form. AT: "someone throws it into a fire" or "someone burns it" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# how much more will he clothe you ... faith?

Jesus is using a question to teach the people. AT: "he will certainly clothe you ... faith" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# you of little faith

"you who have such little faith." Jesus is scolding the people because they have little faith in God.

# Therefore

"Because of all of this"
