# so clothes the grass in the fields

Jesus continues to speak about the lilies as if they were people who wore clothes. The lilies being clothed is a metaphor for the plants having beautiful and colorful flowers. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# grass

If your language has a word that includes "grass" and the word you used for "lilies" in the previous verse, you can use it here.

# is thrown into the oven

The Jews at that time used grass in their fires to cook their food. This can be stated in active form. AT: "someone throws it into a fire" or "someone burns it" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# how much more will he clothe you ... faith?

Jesus uses this question to teach the people that God will provide what they need. AT: "he will certainly clothe you ... faith." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# you of little faith

"you who have such little faith." Jesus addresses the people this way because their anxiety about clothing shows they have little faith in God.

# Therefore

"Because of all of this"

# What clothes will we wear

In this sentence, "clothes" is a synecdoche for material possessions. AT: "What possessions will we have"  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
