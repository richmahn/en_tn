Jesus continues to teach his disciples. This event began in [Matthew 5:1](../05/01.md).
Jesus is talking to a group of people about what might happen to them as individuals. The instances of “you” and “your” are plural.

## For ... for ##

These each introduce a sentence that explains [Matthew 6:30](./30.md). That is, the Gentiles seek these things, so "do not be anxious"; "your heavenly Father knows that you need them," so "do not be anxious."

## Therefore ##

Alternative translation: "Because of all of this."

## tomorrow will be anxious for itself ##

This personification actually refers to the person who lives "the next day"  (see UDB). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

## Sufficient to the day is its own evil ##

this can be translated as "the day will have enough bad things in it."
