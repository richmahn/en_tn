## translationNotes

* Jesus continues to teach his disciples. This event began in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:05:01]].
* Jesus is talking to a group of people about what might happen to them as individuals. The instances of “you” and “your” are plural.
* **For ... for** - These each introduce a sentence that explains [[:en:bible:notes:mat:06:30]]. That is, the Gentiles seek these things, so "do not be anxious"; "your heavenly Father knows that you need them," so "do not be anxious."
* **Therefore** - Alternative translation: "Because of all of this."
* **tomorrow will be anxious for itself** - This personification actually refers to the person who lives "the next day"  (see UDB). (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
* **Sufficient to the day is its own evil** - this can be translated as "the day will have enough bad things in it."
