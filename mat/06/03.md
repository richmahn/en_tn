# Connecting Statement:

Jesus continues to teach his disciples about alms.

# General Information:

Jesus is talking to a group of people about what might happen to them as individuals. All "you" and "your" are plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing

This is a metaphor for total secrecy. Just as hands usually work together and can be said to "know" what each other is doing at all times, you should not let even those closest to you know when you are giving to the poor. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# your gift may be given in secret

This can be stated in active form. AT: "you can give to the poor without other people knowing" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
