# General Information:

Jesus is talking to a group of people about what they as individuals should or should not do. The instances of "you" and "your" are all singular, but in some languages they may need to be plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# The eye is the lamp of the body ... how great is that darkness

This compares healthy eyes that allow a person to see to diseased eyes that cause a person to be blind. This is a metaphor referring to spiritual health. Often Jewish people used the phrase "bad eye" to refer to greed. The meaning is that if a person is completely devoted to God and sees or considers things the way God does, then he is doing what is right. If a person is greedy for more, then he is doing what is evil. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# The eye is the lamp of the body

This metaphor means the eyes allow a person to see just as a lamp helps a person see in the dark. Alternate translation: "Like a lamp, the eye allows you to see things clearly" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# eye

You may have to translate this as plural, "eyes."
