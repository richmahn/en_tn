Jesus continues to teach his disciples. This event began in [Matthew 5:1](../05/01.md).
Jesus is talking to a group of people about what might happen to them as individuals. The instances of "you" and "your" are all singular, but you may need to translate them as plurals.

## The eye is the lamp of the body ##

"like a lamp, the eye allows you to see things clearly" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## if your eye is good, the whole body is filled with light ##

If your eyes are healthy, if you can see, then your whole body is able to function properly. That is, you can walk, work, etc. This is a metaphor for seeing things as God sees them, specifically in the area of generosity and greed (see UDB).

## eye ##

You may have to translate this as plural.

## filled with light ##

This is a metaphor for having understanding.

## if your eye is bad ##

This does not refer to magic. Alternative translation: "you do not see things as God sees them." It can also be a metaphor for greed (see UDB "How greedy you will be" and [Matthew 20:15](../20/15.md)).

## the light that is in you is actually darkness ##

"what you think is light is actually darkness." This is a metaphor for thinking one sees things as God sees them when one does not.

## how great is that darkness ##

To be in darkness is bad. To be in darkness and think one is in light is even worse.

## for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will be devoted to one and despise the other ##

These two phrases refer to the same issue--being unable to love and be devoted to both God and money at the same time. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## You cannot serve God and wealth ##

"You cannot worship God and money at the same time"
