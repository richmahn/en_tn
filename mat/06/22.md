## translationNotes

* Jesus continues to teach his disciples. This event began in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:05:01]].
* Jesus is talking to a group of people about what might happen to them as individuals. The instances of "you" and "your" are all singular, but you may need to translate them as plurals.
* **The eye is the lamp of the body** - "like a lamp, the eye allows you to see things clearly" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **if your eye is good, the whole body is filled with light** - If your eyes are healthy, if you can see, then your whole body is able to function properly. That is, you can walk, work, etc. This is a metaphor for seeing things as God sees them, specifically in the area of generosity and greed (see UDB).
* **eye** - You may have to translate this as plural.
* **filled with light** - This is a metaphor for having understanding.
* **if your eye is bad** - This does not refer to magic. Alternative translation: "you do not see things as God sees them." It can also be a metaphor for greed (see UDB "How greedy you will be" and [[:en:bible:notes:mat:20:15]]).
* **the light that is in you is actually darkness** - "what you think is light is actually darkness." This is a metaphor for thinking one sees things as God sees them when one does not.
* **how great is that darkness** - To be in darkness is bad. To be in darkness and think one is in light is even worse.
* **for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will be devoted to one and despise the other** - These two phrases refer to the same issue--being unable to love and be devoted to both God and money at the same time. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
* **You cannot serve God and wealth** - "You cannot worship God and money at the same time"
