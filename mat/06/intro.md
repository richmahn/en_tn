# Matthew 06 General Notes #

#### Structure and Formatting ####

Matthew 6 continues Jesus' extended teaching known as "The Sermon on the Mount." 

You may wish to set apart the prayer in 6:9-11 by placing it farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text.

Jesus spoke about many different subjects in this sermon, so you may wish to help the reader by putting an empty line into the text whenever Jesus changed the subject.
