# Matthew 06 General Notes #

#### Structure and Formatting ####

Matthew 6 continues Jesus' extended teaching known as "The Sermon on the Mount." 

The translator may wish to set apart the prayer in 6:9-11 by setting it farher to the right on the page than the rest of the text. Since this chapter quickly shifts from one topic to another, it is possible to use a line of space between topics to help the readers recognize the changes in topic more easily.
