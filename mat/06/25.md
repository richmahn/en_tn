# I say to you

This adds emphasis to what Jesus says next.

# to you

Jesus is talking to a group of people about what they as individuals should or should not do.

# is not life more than food, and the body more than clothes?

Jesus uses a question to teach the people. Alternate translation: "obviously life is more than what you eat, and your body is more than what you wear." or "clearly there are things in life that are more imortant than food, and there are things concerning the body that are more important than clothes."
