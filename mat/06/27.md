# General Information:

Jesus is talking to a group of people about what might happen to them as individuals. All instances of "you" and "your" are plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# Which one of you by being anxious can add one cubit to his lifespan?

Jesus uses a question to teach the people. AT: "None of you can, just by worrying, add years to your life. You cannot add even one minute to your life! So you should not worry about things you need." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# one cubit

A cubit is a measure of a little less than half a meter. Here it is a metaphor for adding time to how long a person will live. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bdistance]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
