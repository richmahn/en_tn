# Which one of you by being anxious can add one cubit to his lifespan?

Jesus uses a question to teach the people. Here to "add one cubit to his lifespan" is a metaphor for adding time to how long a person will live. AT: "None of you can, just by worrying, add years to your life. You cannot add even one minute to your life! So you should not worry about things you need." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# one cubit

A cubit is a measure of a little less than half a meter. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bdistance]])
