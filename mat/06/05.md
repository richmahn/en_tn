Jesus continues to teach his disciples. This event began in [Matthew 5:1](../05/01.md).
Jesus is talking to a group of people about what might happen to them as individuals. All “you” and “your” in verses 5 and 7 are plural; in verse 6 they are singular, but you may have to translate them as plural.

## your Father who sees in private ##

This can be translated "your Father sees what people do in private."
