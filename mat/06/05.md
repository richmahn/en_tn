# General Information:

Jesus is talking to a group of people about what they as individuals should and should not do. All occurrences of "you" and "your" in verses 5 and 7 are plural; in verse 6 they are singular, but in some languages they may need to be plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# Connecting Statement:

Jesus begins to teach about prayer.

# so that they may be seen by people

It is implied that those who see them will give them honor. This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "so that people will see them and give them honor" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# Truly I say to you

"I tell you the truth." This phrase adds emphasis to what Jesus says next.
