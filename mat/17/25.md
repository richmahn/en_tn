# the house

"the place where Jesus was staying"

#  "What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth collect tolls or taxes? From their sons or from others?"

Jesus asks these questions to teach Simon, not to gain information for himself. AT: "Listen, Simon. We know that when kings collect taxes, they collect it from people who are not members of their own family" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
