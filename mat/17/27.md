# But so that we do not cause the tax collectors to sin, go

"But we do not want to make the tax collectors angry. So, go."

# throw in a hook

Fishermen tied hooks to the end of a line, then threw it in the water to catch fish. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# its mouth

"the fish's mouth"

# a shekel

a silver coin worth four days' wages (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney]])

# Take it

"Take the shekel"

# for me and you

Here "you" is singular and refers to Peter. Each man had to pay a half shekel tax. So one shekel would be enough for Jesus and Peter to pay their taxes. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
