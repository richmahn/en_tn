# Connecting Statement:

Here the scene shifts again to a later time when Jesus teaches Peter about paying the temple tax.

# When they

"When Jesus and his disciples"

# the half-shekel tax

This was a tax that Jewish men paid to support the temple in Jerusalem. AT: "the temple tax" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-fraction]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# the house

"the place where Jesus was staying"

#  "What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth collect tolls or taxes? From their sons or from others?"

Jesus asks these questions to teach Simon, not to gain information for himself. AT: "Listen, Simon. We know that when kings collect taxes, they collect it from people who are not members of their own family" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
