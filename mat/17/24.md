# Connecting Statement:

Here the scene shifts again to a later time when Jesus teaches Peter about paying the temple tax.

# When they

"When Jesus and his disciples"

# the half-shekel tax

This was a tax that Jewish men paid to support the temple in Jerusalem. AT: "the temple tax" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-fraction]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# the house

"the place where Jesus was staying"

# What do you think, Simon? The kings on earth, from whom do they receive tax or tribute? From their subjects or from foreigners?

Jesus asks these questions to teach Simon, not to gain information for himself. AT: "Listen, Simon. We know that when kings collect taxes, they collect it from foreigners rather than their own citizens" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# kings on earth

This refers to leaders in general.

# subjects

people under a ruler or king
