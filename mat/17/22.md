# Connecting Statement:

Here the scene shifts momentarily, and Jesus foretells his death and resurrection a second time.

# they stayed

"Jesus and his disciples stayed"

# The Son of Man will be delivered

This can be stated in active form. AT: "Someone will deliver the Son of Man" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# delivered into the hands of people

The word "hands" here is a metonym for the power that people use hands to exercise. AT: "taken and put under the power of people" or "taken and given to people who will control him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# The Son of Man ... him ... he

Jesus is referring to himself in the third person. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# into the hands of people

Here "hands" refers to power or control. AT: "to the control of the people" or "to the people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
