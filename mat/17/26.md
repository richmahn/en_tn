# General Information:

This is the end of the part of the story that began in [Matthew 13:54](../13/54.md), where Matthew tells of continued opposition to Jesus' ministry and teaching about the kingdom of heaven.

# Connecting Statement:

Jesus continues to teach Peter about paying the temple tax.

# When he said, "From others," Jesus said

If you translated Jesus' questions as statements in [Matthew 17:25](./25.md), you may need to give an alternate response here. You could also state it as an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: "When Peter said, 'Yes, that is true. Kings collect taxes from foreigners,' Jesus said" or "After Peter agreed with Jesus, Jesus said" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])

# From others

In modern times, leaders usually tax their own citizens. But, in ancient times, the leaders often taxed the people they had conquered rather than their own citizens.

# sons

people over whom a ruler or king rules
