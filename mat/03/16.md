This continues the account of how Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist.

## After he was baptized  ##

<b>After he was baptized <b>- This could be translated by saying: "After John baptized Jesus."

## the heavens were opened to him ##

Alternative translation: "he saw the sky open" or "he saw the heavens open." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## coming down like a dove  ##

<b>coming down like a dove <b>- This can 1) be a plain statement that the Spirit was in the form of a dove (see UDB) or 2) be a simile that compares the Spirit coming down upon Jesus gently, the way a dove would. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
