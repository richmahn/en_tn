# Now ... wild honey

The word "Now" is used here to mark a break in the main story line. Here Matthew tells background information about John the Baptist. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])

# wore clothing of camel's hair and a leather belt around his waist

This clothing symbolizes that John is a prophet like the prophets from long ago, especially the prophet Elijah. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# Then Jerusalem, all Judea, and all the region

The words "Jerusalem," "Judea," and "the region" are metonyms for the people from those areas. The word "all" is an exaggeration to emphasize that very many people went out. AT: Then very may people from Jerusalem, Judea, and that region" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# They were baptized by him

This can be stated in active form. AT: "John baptized them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# They

This refers to the people coming from Jerusalem, Judea, and the region around the Jordan River.
