# General Information:

This is the beginning of a new part of the story where Matthew tells of the ministry of John the Baptist. In verse 3, Matthew quotes the prophet Isaiah to show that John the Baptist was God's appointed messenger to prepare for Jesus' ministry.

# In those days

This is many years after Joseph and his family left Egypt and went to Nazareth. This is probably near the time that Jesus begins his ministry. Alternate translation: "Some time later" or "Some years later"
