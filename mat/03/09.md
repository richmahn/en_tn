# We have Abraham for our father

"Abraham is our ancestor" or "We are descendants of Abraham." The Jewish leaders thought that God would not punish them since they were descendants of Abraham. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# For I say to you

This adds emphasis to what John is about to say.

# God is able to raise up children for Abraham even out of these stones

"God is able to make physical descendants out of even these stones and give them to Abraham"
