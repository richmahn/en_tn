# for repentance

"to show that you have repented"

# But he who comes after me

Jesus is the person who comes after John.

# is mightier than I

"is more important than I am"

# He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire

This metaphor compares John's baptism with water to the future baptism with fire. This means John's baptism only symbolically cleanses people of their sins. The baptism by Holy Spirit and fire will truly cleanse people of their sins. If possible, use the word "baptize" in your translation to keep the comparison to John's baptism.
