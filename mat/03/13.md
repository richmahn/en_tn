# Connecting Statement:

Here the scene shifts to a later time when John the Baptist baptizes Jesus.

# to be baptized by John

This can be stated in active form. AT: "so John could baptize him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?

John uses a question to show his surprise at Jesus' request. AT: "You are more important than I am. I should not baptize you. You should baptize me." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# for us

Here "us" refers to Jesus and John. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-inclusive]])
