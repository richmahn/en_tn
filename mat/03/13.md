## translationNotes

* This begins the account of how Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist.
* **I need to be baptized by you ** - "I" refers to John the Baptist and "you" refers to Jesus Christ.
* **do you come to me?** - This is a rhetorical question. Alternative translation: "Since you are not a sinner, you should not come to me and have me baptize you." Note that "you" refers to Jesus Christ and "me" refers to John the Baptist. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
