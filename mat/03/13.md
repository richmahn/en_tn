This begins the account of how Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist.

## I need to be baptized by you  ##

<b>I need to be baptized by you <b>- "I" refers to John the Baptist and "you" refers to Jesus Christ.

## do you come to me? ##

This is a rhetorical question. Alternative translation: "Since you are not a sinner, you should not come to me and have me baptize you." Note that "you" refers to Jesus Christ and "me" refers to John the Baptist. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
