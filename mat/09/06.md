# that you may know

"I will prove to you." The "you" is plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# your mat ... your house

Here "you" is singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# go to your house

Jesus is not forbidding the man to go elsewhere. He is giving the man the opportunity to go home.
