Jesus uses a figure of speech about harvesting to tell his disciples how they should respond to the needs of the crowds in the previous section.

## The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few ##

This metaphor compares the great number of people who will believe in God and be added to his kingdom to food growing in a field, and those who tell others about God to the laborers. The point of the metaphor is that there are too few people to tell the many people about God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## harvest ##

"collection of ripe food"

## laborers ##

"workers"

## pray to the Lord of the harvest ##

"pray to the Lord. He is in charge of the harvest."
