# But Jesus

"The woman was hoping she could touch him secretly, but Jesus"

# Daughter

The woman was not Jesus' real daughter. Jesus was speaking to her politely. If this is confusing, it can also be translated "Young woman" or even omitted.

# your faith has made you well

"because you believed in me, I will heal you"

# the woman was healed from that hour

This can be stated in active form. AT: "Jesus healed her at that moment" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
