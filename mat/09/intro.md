# Matthew 09 General Notes #

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### "Sinners" #####

When the people of Jesus' time spoke of "sinners," they were talking about people who did not obey the law of Moses and instead committed sins like stealing or sexual sins. When Jesus said that he came to call "sinners," he meant that only people who believe that they are sinners can be his followers. This is true even if they are not what most people think of as "sinners." (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### Passive voice #####

Many sentences in this chapter tell that a person had something happen to him without saying who caused that something to happen. You may have to translate the sentence so that it tells the reader who performed the action. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

##### Rhetorical questions #####

Speakers in this chapter asked questions to which they already knew the answer. They asked the questions to show that they were not happy with the hearers or to teach them or to get them to think. Your language may have another way of doing this. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

##### Proverbs #####

Proverbs are very short sentences that use words that are easy to remember to tell about something that is generally true. People who understand proverbs usually have to know much about the language and culture of the speaker. When you translate the proverbs in this chapter, you may have to use many more words than the speakers used so that you can add information that the hearers knew but your reader do not know.
