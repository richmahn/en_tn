This concludes the account of Jesus' healing a paralyzed man. Jesus then calls a tax collector to be one of his disciples.

## praise ##

Use the same word you used in [Matthew 5:15](../05/15.md).

## such authority ##

the authority to declare sins forgiven

## Matthew...him...he ##

Church tradition says that this Matthew is the author of the Gospel, but the text gives no reason to change the pronouns from "him" and "he" to "me" and "I."

## he said to him ##

"Jesus said to Matthew"

## As Jesus passed by from there ##

This phrase is used here to mark the introduction to the incident that begins with "behold" in [Matthew 9:7](./07.md). If your language has a way for doing this, you could consider using it here.

## passed by ##

Use a general term for going. It is not clear whether Jesus was moving uphill or downhill or toward Capernaum or away from it.

## He got up and followed him ##

"Matthew got up and followed Jesus" as a disciple (see UDB), not simply to Jesus' next destination.
