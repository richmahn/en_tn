## translationNotes

* This concludes the account of Jesus' healing a paralyzed man. Jesus then calls a tax collector to be one of his disciples.
* **praise** - Use the same word you used in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:05:15]].
* **such authority** - the authority to declare sins forgiven
* **Matthew...him...he** - Church tradition says that this Matthew is the author of the Gospel, but the text gives no reason to change the pronouns from "him" and "he" to "me" and "I."
* **he said to him** - "Jesus said to Matthew"
* **As Jesus passed by from there** - This phrase is used here to mark the introduction to the incident that begins with "behold" in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:09:07]]. If your language has a way for doing this, you could consider using it here.
* **passed by** - Use a general term for going. It is not clear whether Jesus was moving uphill or downhill or toward Capernaum or away from it.
* **He got up and followed him** - "Matthew got up and followed Jesus" as a disciple (see UDB), not simply to Jesus' next destination.
