## translationNotes

* This begins the account of Jesus healing two blind men.
* **As Jesus passed by from there** - Jesus was leaving the region.
* **passed by** - It is not clear whether Jesus was moving uphill or downhill. Use a general term for going.
* **Son of David** - Jesus was not David's literal son, so this may be translated as "Descendant of David" (UDB). However, "Son of David" is also a title given to the Messiah (see [[:en:bible:notes:mat:21:09]]), and the men were probably calling Jesus by this title.
* **When Jesus had come into the house** - This could be either Jesus' own house (UDB) or the house in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:09:10]].
* **Yes, Lord** - "Yes, Lord, we believe you can heal us."
