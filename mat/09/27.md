This begins the account of Jesus healing two blind men.

## As Jesus passed by from there ##

Jesus was leaving the region.

## passed by ##

It is not clear whether Jesus was moving uphill or downhill. Use a general term for going.

## Son of David ##

Jesus was not David's literal son, so this may be translated as "Descendant of David" (UDB). However, "Son of David" is also a title given to the Messiah (see [Matthew 21:9](../21/09.md)), and the men were probably calling Jesus by this title.

## When Jesus had come into the house ##

This could be either Jesus' own house (UDB) or the house in [Matthew 9:10](./10.md).

## Yes, Lord ##

"Yes, Lord, we believe you can heal us."
