# Connecting Statement:

This begins the account of Jesus healing two blind men.

# As Jesus passed by from there

As Jesus was leaving the region

# passed by

"was leaving" or "was going"

# followed him

This means they were walking behind Jesus, not necessarily that they had become his disciples.

# Have mercy on us

It is implied that they wanted Jesus to heal them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# Son of David

Jesus was not David's literal son, so this may be translated as "Descendant of David." However, "Son of David" is also a title for the Messiah, and the men were probably calling Jesus by this title.

# When Jesus had come into the house

This could be either Jesus' own house or the house in [Matthew 9:10](./10.md).

# Yes, Lord

The full content of their answer is not stated, but it is understood. AT: "Yes, Lord, we believe you can heal us" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
