This describes how Jesus healed another woman while on the way to heal the daughter of the Jewish official.

## Behold ##

The word "behold" alerts us to a new person in the story. Your language may have a way of doing this.

## had severe bleeding  ##

"had a severe flow of blood." She was probably bleeding from her womb even when it was not the normal time for it. Some cultures may have a polite way of referring to this condition. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])

## If I only touch his garment, I will be made well  ##

She did not believe the garment would heal her. She believed Jesus would heal her. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

## garment  ##

"robe"

## But ##

"Instead." What the woman hoped would happen did not happen.

## Daughter ##

The woman was not Jesus' real daughter. Jesus was speaking to her politely. If this is confusing, it can also be translated "Young woman" or even omitted.
