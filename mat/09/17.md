# Connecting Statement:

Jesus continues to answer the question that disciples of John had asked.

# Neither do people put new wine into old wineskins

Jesus uses another proverb to answer John's disciples. This means the same as the proverb in [Matthew 9:16](./16.md).

# Neither do people put

"Neither does anyone pour" or "People never put"

# new wine

This refers to wine that has not fermented yet. If grapes are unknown in your area, use the general term for fruit. AT: "grape juice" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

# old wineskins

This refers to wineskins that have been used many times.

# wineskins

"wine bags" or "skin bags." These were bags made out of animal skins.

# the wine will be spilled, and the wineskins will be destroyed

This can be stated in active form. AT: "and this will ruin the wineskin and spill the wine" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# the skins will burst

When the new wine ferments and expands, the skins tear open because they can no longer stretch out.

# fresh wineskins

"new wineskins" or "new wine bags." This refers to wineskins that no one has used.

# both will be preserved

This can be stated in active form. AT: "this will keep safe both the wineskin and the wine" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
