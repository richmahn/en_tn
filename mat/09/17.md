## translationNotes

* Jesus continues to answer the question asked by the disciples of John.
* **Neither do people put new wine into old wineskins** - This is a metaphor or parable to answer the question of John's disciples, which was "Why do we and the Pharisees often fast, but your disciples do not fast?" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **Neither do people put ** - "neither does anyone pour" (UDB) or "people never put"
* **new wine** - "grape juice." This refers to wine that has not fermented yet. If grapes are unknown in your area, use the general term for fruit.
* **old wineskins** - This refers to wineskins that have been used many times.
* **wineskins ** - These were bags made out of animal skins. They could also be called "wine bags" or "skin bags" (UDB).
* **the skins will burst** - When the new wine ferments and expands, they would tear open because they could no longer stretch out.
* **destroyed** - "ruined" (UDB)
* **fresh wineskins ** - "new wineskins" or "new wine bags." This refers to wineskins that have never been used.
