## translationNotes

* These events occur at the house of Matthew the tax collector.
* **the house** - This is probably Matthew's house (see UDB), but it could also be Jesus' house ("dined with Jesus and his disciples"). Specify only if needed to avoid confusion.
* **behold** - The word "behold" alerts us to these new people in the story. Your language may have a way of doing this. English uses "There was a man who was…”
* **When the Pharisees saw it ** - "When the Pharisees saw that Jesus was eating with the tax collectors and sinful people"
