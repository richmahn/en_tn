This continues the account of Jesus' healing a paralyzed man.

## Behold ##

This marks the beginning of another event in the larger story. It may involve different people than the previous events. Your language may have a way of doing this.

## among themselves ##

This can mean either "to themselves," in their minds, or "to each other," using their mouths. Jesus was claiming to be able to do things the scribes thought only God can do.

## knew their thoughts ##

Jesus knew what they were thinking either supernaturally or because he could see them talking to each other.

## Why are you thinking evil in your hearts? ##

Jesus used this question to rebuke the scribes. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## you…your ##

plural

## evil ##

This is moral evil or wickedness, not simply error in fact.

## which is easier…? ##

Jesus asked this question to remind the scribes that they believed that the man was paralyzed because of his sins and that if his sins were forgiven, he would be able to walk, so that when he healed the paralyzed man, the scribes would know that he could forgive sins. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## which is easier to say, 'Your sins are forgiven' or to say 'Get up and walk'? ##

"Is it easier to say, 'Your sins are forgiven'? or is it easier to say 'Get up and walk'?"

## Your sins are forgiven ##

This can mean 1) "I forgive your sins" (UDB) or 2) "God forgives your sins." The "your" is singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## But that you may know  ##

"I will prove to you." The "you" is plural.

## your…your ##

singular

## go to your house ##

Jesus is not forbidding the man to go elsewhere. He is giving the man the opportunity to go home.
