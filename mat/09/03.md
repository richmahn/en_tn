# Behold

This marks the beginning of another event in the larger story. It may involve different people than the previous events. Your language may have a way of doing this.

# among themselves

Possible meanings are 1) each one was thinking to himself, or 2) they were speaking among themselves.

# blaspheming

Jesus was claiming to be able to do things the scribes thought only God can do.

# knew their thoughts

Jesus knew what they were thinking either supernaturally or because he could see them talking to each other.

# Why are you thinking evil in your hearts?

Jesus used this question to rebuke the scribes. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# evil

This is moral evil or wickedness, not simply error in fact.

# in your hearts

Here "hearts" refers to their minds or their thoughts. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# For which is easier to say, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up and walk'?

Jesus uses a question to challenge the scribes. He does not mean one action is harder for him than the other. He is reminding the scribes that they believe when God heals a person's body it means he has forgiven them of their sins. AT: "For you know it is just as easy to say, 'Your sins are forgiven,' as it is to say, 'Get up and walk'." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# which is easier to say, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up and walk'?

This can be translated as an indirect quotation. AT: "it is just as easy to tell a person his sins are forgiven as it is to tell him to get up and walk" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])

# Your sins are forgiven

Here "your" is singular. This can be stated in active form. AT: "I have forgiven your sins" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# that you may know

"I will prove to you." The "you" is plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# your mat ... your house

Here "you" is singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# go to your house

Jesus is not forbidding the man to go elsewhere. He is giving the man the opportunity to go home.
