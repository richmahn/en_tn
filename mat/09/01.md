# Connecting Statement:

Matthew returns to the theme, which he began in [Matthew 8:1](../08/01.md), of Jesus healing people. This begins an account of Jesus healing a paralyzed man.

# Jesus entered a boat

It is implied that the disciples were with Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# a boat

This is probably the same boat as in [Matthew 8:23](../08/23.md). You only need to specify this if needed to avoid confusion.

# into his own city

"to the town where he lived." This refers to Capernaum.

# Behold

This marks the beginning of another event in the larger story. It may involve different people than the previous events. Your language may have a way of showing this.

# they brought

"some men from the city"

# their faith

This refers to the faith of the men and may also include the faith of the paralyzed man.

# Son

The man was not Jesus' real son. Jesus was speaking to him politely. If this is confusing, it can also be translated "My friend" or "Young man" or even omitted.

# Your sins have been forgiven

This can be stated in active form. AT: "I have forgiven your sins" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
