# Connecting Statement:

Matthew returns to the theme, which he began in [Matthew 8:1](../08/01.md), of Jesus healing people. This begins an account of Jesus healing a paralyzed man.

# Jesus entered a boat

It is implied that the disciples were with Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# a boat

This is probably the same boat as in [Matthew 8:23](../08/23.md). You only need to specify this if needed to avoid confusion.

# into his own city

"to the town where he lived." This refers to Capernaum.
