## translationNotes

* This begins an account of Jesus healing a paralyzed man.
* **Jesus entered a boat ** - The disciples probably went with Jesus (see UDB).
* **a boat** - Probably the same boat as in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:08:23]]. Specify only if you need to avoid confusion.
* **came into his own city** - "the city where he was staying" (UDB).
* **Behold** - This marks the beginning of another event in the larger story. It may involve different people than the previous events. Your language may have a way of doing this.
* **they...their** - those who brought the paralyzed man to Jesus. It may include the paralyzed man himself.
* **Son** - The man was not Jesus' real son. Jesus was speaking to him politely. If this is confusing, it can also be translated "My friend" or "Young man," or even omitted.
* **your sins have been forgiven** - "God has forgiven your sins" or "I have forgiven your sins"
