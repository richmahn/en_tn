# their eyes were opened

This means they were able to see. This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "God healed their eyes" or "the two blind men were able to see" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# See that no one knows about this

Here "See" means "be sure." Alternate translation: "Be sure no one finds out about this" or "Do not tell anyone that I healed you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
