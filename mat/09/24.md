# Go away

Jesus was speaking to many people, so use the plural command form if your language has one.

# the girl is not dead, but she is asleep

Jesus is using a play on words. It was common in Jesus' day to refer to a dead person as one who "sleeps." But here the dead girl will get up, as though she had only been sleeping. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
