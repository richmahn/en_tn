# General Information:

Verse 36 begins a new part of the story where Jesus teaches his disciples and sends them to preach and heal as he has done.

# Connecting Statement:

Verse 35 is the end of the part of the story that began in [Matthew 8:1](../08/01.md) about Jesus' healing ministry in Galilee. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-endofstory]])

# all the cities

The word "all" is an exaggeration to emphasize how very many cities Jesus went to. He did not necessarily go to every one of them. Alternate translation: "many of the cities" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# cities ... villages

"large villages ... small villages" or "large towns ... small towns"

# the good news of the kingdom

Here "kingdom" refers to God's rule as king. See how you translated this in [Matthew 4:23](../04/23.md).

# all kinds of disease and all kinds of sickness

"every disease and every sickness." The words "disease" and "sickness" are closely related but should be translated as two different words if possible. "Disease" is what causes a person to be sick. "Sickness" is the physical weakness or affliction that results from having a disease.
