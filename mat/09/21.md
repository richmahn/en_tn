# For she had said to herself, "If only I touch his clothes, I will be made well."

She said this to herself before she touched Jesus' garment. This tells why she touched Jesus' garment. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-events]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge]])

# If only I touch his clothes

According to Jewish law, because she was bleeding she was not supposed to touch anyone. She touches his clothes so that Jesus' power would heal her and yet (she thought) he would not know that she touched him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
