# For which is easier, to say, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up and walk'?

Jesus uses this question to make the scribes think about what might prove whether or not he could really forgive sins. AT: "I just said 'Your sins are forgiven.' You may think that it is harder to say 'Get up and walk,' because the proof of whether or not I can heal the man will be shown by whether or not he gets up and walks." or "You may think that it is easier to say 'Your sins are forgiven' than it is to say 'Get up and walk.'" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# which is easier, to say, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up and walk'?

The quotes can be translated as indirect quotes. AT: "which is easier, to tell someone that his sins are forgiven, or to tell him to get up and walk?" or "you may think that it is easier to tell someone that his sins are forgiven than to tell him to get up and walk." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])

# Your sins are forgiven

Here "your" is singular. This can be stated in active form. AT: "I have forgiven your sins" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
