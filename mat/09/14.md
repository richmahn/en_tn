## translationNotes

* The disciples of John the Baptist question the fact that Jesus' disciples do not fast.
* **Can wedding attendants be sorrowful...them?** - No one would expect the wedding attendants to fast while the bridegroom was with them. (See    [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **wedding attendants** - a metaphor for Jesus' disciples (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **the bridegroom is still with them...when the bridegroom will be taken away** - The "bridegroom" is Jesus, who is still alive and so "is still with" his disciples. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **the bridegroom will be taken away** - "someone will take the bridegroom away." This is a metaphor for being killed. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]], [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
* **be sorrowful** - "mourn...be sad" (UDB)
