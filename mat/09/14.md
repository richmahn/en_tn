The disciples of John the Baptist question the fact that Jesus' disciples do not fast.

## Can wedding attendants be sorrowful...them? ##

No one would expect the wedding attendants to fast while the bridegroom was with them. (See    [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## wedding attendants ##

a metaphor for Jesus' disciples (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## the bridegroom is still with them...when the bridegroom will be taken away ##

The "bridegroom" is Jesus, who is still alive and so "is still with" his disciples. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## the bridegroom will be taken away ##

"someone will take the bridegroom away." This is a metaphor for being killed. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]], [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## be sorrowful ##

"mourn...be sad" (UDB)
