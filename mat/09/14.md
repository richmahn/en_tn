# Connecting Statement:

The disciples of John the Baptist question the fact that Jesus' disciples do not fast.

# do not fast

"continue to eat regularly"

# Can wedding attendants be sorrowful while the bridegroom is still with them?

Jesus uses a question to answer John's disciples. They all knew that people do not mourn and fast at a wedding celebration. Jesus uses this proverb to show that his disciples do not mourn because he is still there with them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-proverbs]])

# the days will come when

This is a way of referring to some time in the future. AT: "the time will come when" or "someday"

# the bridegroom will be taken away from them

This can be stated in active form. AT: "the bridegroom will not be able to be with them any longer" or "someone will take the bridegroom away from them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# will be taken away

Jesus is probably referring to his own death, but this should not be made explicit here in the translation. To maintain the imagery of a wedding, it is best to just state that the bridegroom will not be there any longer.
