# As Jesus passed by from there

This phrase marks the beginning of a new part of the story. If your language has a way for doing this, you could consider using it here.

# passed by

"was leaving" or "was going"

# Matthew ... him ... He

Church tradition says that this Matthew is the author of this Gospel, but the text gives no reason to change the pronouns from "him" and "He" to "me" and "I."

# He said to him

"Jesus said to Matthew"

# He got up and followed him

"Matthew got up and followed Jesus." This means Matthew became Jesus' disciple.
