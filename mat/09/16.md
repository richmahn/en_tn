# Connecting Statement:

Jesus continues to answer the question that the disciples of John had asked.

# No man puts a piece of new cloth on an old garment

This proverb means that people who know only the old traditions are not eager to accept new ones. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-proverbs]])

# garment

"clothing"

# the patch

"the piece of new cloth." This is the piece of cloth used to cover a hole in the old garment.

# a worse tear will be made

This can be stated in active form. AT: "this will make the tear worse" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
