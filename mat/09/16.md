# Connecting Statement:

Jesus continues to answer the question that the disciples of John had asked. He did this by giving two examples of old things and new things that people do not put together.

# No man puts a piece of new cloth on an old garment

"No one sews a piece of new cloth on an old garment" or "People do not sew a piece of new cloth as a patch an old garment"

# an old garment ... the garment

"old clothing ... the clothing""

# the patch will tear away from the garment

If someone were to wash the garment, the patch of new cloth would shrink, but the old garment would not shrink. This would tear the patch off the garment and leave a bigger hole.

# the patch

"the piece of new cloth." This is the piece of cloth used to cover a hole in the old garment.

# a worse tear will be made

This can be stated in active form. AT: "this will make the tear worse" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
