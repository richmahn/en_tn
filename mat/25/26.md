# Connecting Statement:

Jesus continues telling a parable about the servants and the talents. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])

# You wicked and lazy servant

"You are a wicked servant who does not want to work"

# I reap where I have not sowed and harvest where I have not scattered

These two statements mean the same thing. They refer to a farmer who gathers crops that do not belong to him. The servant uses this metaphor to accuse the master of being a ruthless businessman. See how you translated this in [Matthew 25:24](./24.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# received back my own

The understood information can be stated clearly. AT: "received back my own money" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# interest

payment from the banker for the temporary use of the master's money
