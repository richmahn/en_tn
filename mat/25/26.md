Jesus continues to tell a parable about faithful and unfaithful servants.

## You wicked and lazy servant ##

"You are a wicked servant who does not want to work"

## I reap where I have not sowed and harvest where I have not scattered ##

See how you translated this idea in [Matthew 25:24](./24.md)

## received back my own ##

"received back my own gold" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

## interest ##

<b>interest<b>- payment from the banker for the temporary use of the master's money
