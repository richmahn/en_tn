# Connecting Statement:

Jesus continues telling a parable about the servants and the talents. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])

# You wicked and lazy servant, you knew

"You are a wicked servant who does not want to work. You knew"

# I reap where I have not sowed and harvest where I have not scattered

The words "reap where I have not sowed" and "harvest where I have not scattered" mean the same thing. They refer to a farmer who gathers crops that people who work for him have planted. See how you translated this in [Matthew 25:24](./24.md), where the servant uses these words to accuse the farmer. The readers should understand that the farmer is acknowledging that he does indeed gather what others have planted but is saying that he is right to do so. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
