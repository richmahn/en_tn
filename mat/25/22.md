# Connecting Statement:

Jesus continues telling the parable about the servants and the talents. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney]])

# I have made two more talents

"I have earned two more talents"

# Well done

"You have done well" or "You have done right." Your culture might have an expression that a master (or someone in authority) would use to show that he approves of what his servant (or someone under him) has done. See how you translated this in [Matthew 25:21](./19.md).

# Enter into the joy of your master

The phrase "Enter into the joy" is an idiom. Also, the master is speaking about himself in the third person. See how you translated this in [Matthew 25:21](./19.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
