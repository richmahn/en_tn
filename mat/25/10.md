# Connecting Statement:

Jesus concludes the parable about the ten virgins. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])

# they went away

"the five foolish virgins went away"

# to buy

The understood information can be stated clearly. AT: "to buy more oil" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# those who were ready

These are the virgins who had extra oil.

# the door was shut

This can be stated in active form. AT: "the servants shut the door" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# open for us

This implicit information can be stated explicitly. AT: "open the door for us so we can come inside" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# Truly I say to you

"I tell you the truth." This adds emphasis to what the master says next.

# I do not know you

"I do not know who you are." This is the end of the parable.

# you do not know the day or the hour

Here "day" and "hour" refer to an exact time. The implied information can be stated explicitly. AT: "you do not know the exact time when the Son of Man will return" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
