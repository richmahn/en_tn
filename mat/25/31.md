# Connecting Statement:

Jesus begins to tell his disciples how he will judge people when he returns at the end time.

# the Son of Man

Jesus is speaking about himself in the third person. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# Before him will be gathered all the nations

This can be stated in active form. AT: "He will gather all the nations before him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# Before him

"In front of him"

# all the nations

Here "nations" refers to people. AT: "all people from every country" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats

Jesus uses a simile to describe how he will separate the people. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# He will place the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on his left

This is a metaphor that means the Son of Man will separate all people. He will put the righteous people at his right side, and he will put the sinners at his left side. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
