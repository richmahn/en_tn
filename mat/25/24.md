# Connecting Statement:

Jesus continues telling the parable about the servants and the talents. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney]])

# You reap where you did not sow, and you harvest where you did not scatter

These two statements mean the same thing. They refer to a farmer who gathers crops that do not belong to him. The servant uses this metaphor to accuse the master of being a ruthless businessman. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# scatter

In those days they often threw small amounts of seed around instead of planting in rows.

# See, you have here what belongs to you

"Look, here is what is yours"
