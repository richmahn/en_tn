# Connecting Statement:

Jesus continues telling the parable about the servants and the talents. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney]])

# You reap where you did not sow, and you harvest where you did not scatter

The words "reap where I have not sowed" and "harvest where I have not scattered" mean the same thing. They refer to a farmer who gathers crops that other people have planted. The servant uses this metaphor to accuse the master of taking what rightfully belongs to others. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# scatter

"scatter seed." This refers to sowing seed by gently throwing small amounts in different direction.

# See, you have here what belongs to you

"Look, here is what is yours"
