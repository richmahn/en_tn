Jesus begins to tell a parable about faithful and unfaithful servants.

## it is like ##

"the kingdom of heaven is like" (See [Matthew 25:1](./01.md))

## was about to go ##

"was ready to go" or "was to go soon"

## gave over to them his wealth ##

"put them in charge of his wealth"

## his wealth ##

"his property"

## five talents ##

A "talent" was worth twenty years' wages. Avoid translating this into modern money. The parable is comparing the relative amounts of five, two, and one as well as the large amount of wealth involved. (See UDB, "five bags of gold" and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/biblicalmoney]])

## he went on his journey ##

"the master went on his journey"

## and made another five talents ##

"and earned another five talents"
