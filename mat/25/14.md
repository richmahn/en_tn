# Connecting Statement:

Jesus tells a parable about faithful and unfaithful servants to illustrate that his disciples should remain faithful during his absence and be prepared for his return. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])

# it is like

"the kingdom of heaven is like" (See: [Matthew 13:24](../13/24.md))

# was about to go

"was ready to go" or "was to go soon"

# gave over to them his wealth

"put them in charge of his wealth"

# his wealth

"his property"

# to another he gave two ... gave one talent

The word "talents" is understood from the previous phrase. Alternate translation: "to another he gave two talents of gold ... gave one talent of gold" or "to another he gave two bags of gold ... gave one bag of gold" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
