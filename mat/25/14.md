"five talents of gold." Avoid translating this into modern money. A "talent" of gold was worth twenty years' wages. The parable is contrasting the relative amounts of five, two, and one, as well as the large amount of wealth involved. AT: "five bags of gold" or "five bags of gold, each worth 20 years' wages" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney]])

# to another he gave two ... gave one talent

The word "talents" is understood from the previous phrase. AT: "to another he gave two talents of gold ... gave one talent of gold" or "to another he gave two bags of gold ... gave one bag of gold" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# according to his own ability

The implicit information can be stated explicitly. AT: "according to each servant's skill in managing wealth" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# made another five talents

"out of his investments, he earned another five talents"
