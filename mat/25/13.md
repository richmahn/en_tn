# you do not know the day or the hour

Here "day" and "hour" refer to an exact time. The implied information can be stated explicitly. Alternate translation: "you do not know the exact time when the Son of Man will return" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
