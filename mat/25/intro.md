##### The parable of the ten virgins

Jesus told the parable of the ten virgins ([Matthew 25:1-13](./01.md)) to tell his followers to be ready for him to return. His hearers could understand the parable because they knew Jewish wedding customs.

When the Jews arranged marriages, they would plan for the wedding to take place weeks or months later. At the proper time, the young man would go to his bride's house, where she would be waiting for him. The wedding ceremony would take place, and then the man and his bride would travel to his home, where there would be a feast. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-apocalypticwriting]])
