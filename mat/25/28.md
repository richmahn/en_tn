# Connecting Statement:

Jesus concludes the parable about the servants and the talents. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney]])

# take away the talent

The master is speaking to other servants.

# talent

A "talent" was worth twenty years' wages. Avoid translating this into modern money. See how you translated this in [Matthew 25:15](./15.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney]])
