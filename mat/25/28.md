# even more abundantly

"even much more"

# from anyone who does not possess anything

It is implied that the person does possess something but he does not use it wisely. AT: "from anyone does not use well what he has" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# will be taken away

This can be stated in active form. AT: "God will take away" or "I will take away" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
