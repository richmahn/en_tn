## translationNotes

* Jesus continues to tell a parable about faithful and unfaithful servants.
* **I have made five more talents** - "I have earned five more talents"
* **talents** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:25:14]].
* **Well done ** - "You have done well" or "You have done right." Your culture might have an expression that a master (or someone in authority) would use to show that he approves of what his servant (or someone under him) has done.
