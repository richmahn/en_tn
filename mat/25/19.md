# Connecting Statement:

Jesus continues telling the parable about the servants and the talents. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney]])

# Now

This word is used here to mark a break in the main storyline. Here Jesus starts to tell a new part of the story.

# I have made five talents more

"I have earned five more talents"

# talents

A "talent" was worth twenty years' wages. Avoid translating this into modern money. See how you translated this in [Matthew 25:15](./14.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney]])

# Well done

"You have done well" or "You have done right." Your culture might have an expression that a master (or someone in authority) would use to show that he approves of what his servant (or someone under him) has done.

# Enter into the joy of your master

The phrase "Enter into the joy" is an idiom. Also, the master is speaking about himself in the third person. AT: "Come and be happy with me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
