Jesus continues to tell a parable about faithful and unfaithful servants.

## I have made five more talents ##

"I have earned five more talents"

## talents ##

See how you translated this in [Matthew 25:14](./14.md).

## Well done  ##

<b>Well done <b>- "You have done well" or "You have done right." Your culture might have an expression that a master (or someone in authority) would use to show that he approves of what his servant (or someone under him) has done.
