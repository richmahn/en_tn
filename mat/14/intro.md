# Matthew 14 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Verses 1 and 2 continue the account from chapter 13. Verses 3-12 stop the account and speak of things that happened earlier, possibly soon after Satan tempted Jesus (see [Matthew 4:12](../04/12.md)). Verse 13 continues the account from verse 2. Be sure to have words in verses 3-12 that tell the reader that the writer has stopped his account to give new information before he continues. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])

#### Possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### Passive voice #####

Many sentences in this chapter tell that a person had something happen to him without saying who caused that something to happen. For example, the writer does not tell who brought John's head to Herodias's daughter ([Matthew 14:11](./11.md)). You may have to translate the sentence so that it tells the reader who performed the action. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
