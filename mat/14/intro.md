# Matthew 14 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

14:3-12 mentions events that have previously occurred. Therefore, there is a break in the chronology of the narrative. The purpose of this break is explanatory; the translator will find it necessary to signal this break.

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter ####

##### Irony #####

Herod believe that breaking an oath was dishonorable, so he ordered the execution of John the Baptist. However, the murder for which he was responsible was a much greater evil. This is irony. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])
