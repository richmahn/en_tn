# He said

"Herod said"

# has risen from the dead

The words "from the dead" speak of all dead people together in the underworld. To rise from the dead speaks of coming alive again. 

# Therefore these powers are at work in him

Some Jews at that time believed if a person came back from the dead he would have powers to do mighty things.
