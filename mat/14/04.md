# For John ... as your wife

If needed, you can present the events of 14:3-4 in the order that they happened, as in the UDB. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-events]])

# For John had said to him, "It is not lawful for you to have her as your wife."

This can be expressed as an indirect quote, if needed. Alternate translation: "For John had said to Herod that it was not lawful for Herod to have Herodias as his wife." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])

# For John had said to him

"For John had kept saying to Herod"

# It is not lawful

Philip was still alive when Herod married Herodias. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
