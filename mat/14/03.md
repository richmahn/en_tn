## translationNotes

* This continues the account of how Herod killed John the Baptist.
* **Herod had laid hold upon John, bound him, and put him in prison** - Most likely, Herod had ordered others to do these actions for him. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
* **Herod had laid hold upon John** - "Herod had John arrested"
* **For John had said to him, "It is not lawful for you to have her as your wife"** - "For John had said to him that it was not lawful for him to have her as his wife." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotations]])
* **For John had said to him** - "For John had kept saying to Herod" (see UDB).
* **It is not lawful** - UDB assumes Philip was still alive when Herod married Herodias, but the Law of Moses also forbade a man from marrying his brother's widow.
