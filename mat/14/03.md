This continues the account of how Herod killed John the Baptist.

## Herod had laid hold upon John, bound him, and put him in prison ##

Most likely, Herod had ordered others to do these actions for him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## Herod had laid hold upon John ##

"Herod had John arrested"

## For John had said to him, "It is not lawful for you to have her as your wife" ##

"For John had said to him that it was not lawful for him to have her as his wife." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])

## For John had said to him ##

"For John had kept saying to Herod" (see UDB).

## It is not lawful ##

UDB assumes Philip was still alive when Herod married Herodias, but the Law of Moses also forbade a man from marrying his brother's widow.
