# Connecting Statement:

Jesus concludes his response to the Pharisees' accusation that he healed the man by the power of Satan.

# I say to you

This adds emphasis to what Jesus says next.

# people will give an account for

"God will ask people about" or "people will have to explain to God"

# every idle word they will have said

Here "word" refers to something that someone says. AT: "every harmful thing they will have said" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# you will be justified ... you will be condemned

This can be stated in active form. AT: "God will justify you ... God will condemn you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
