# Matthew 12 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetry in 12:18-21, which are words from the OT.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### The Sabbath #####

This chapter has much to say about how God's people are to obey the Sabbath. Jesus said that the rules that the Pharisees made up did not help people obey the Sabbath the way God wanted them to. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sabbath]])

##### "Blasphemy against the Spirit" #####

No one knows for sure what actions people perform or what words they say when they commit this sin. However, they probably insult the Holy Spirit and his work. Part of the Holy Spirit's work is to make people understand that they are sinners and that they need to have God forgive them. Therefore, anyone who does not try to stop sinning is probably committing blasphemy against the Spirit. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/blasphemy]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/holyspirit]])

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### Brothers and sisters #####
Most people call those who have the same parents "brother" and "sister" and think of them as the most important people in their lives. Many people also call those with the same grandparents "brother" and "sister." In this chapter Jesus says that the most important people to him are those who obey his Father in heaven. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/brother]])
