# General Information:

The arrival of Jesus' mother and brothers becomes an opportunity for him to describe his spiritual family.

# behold

The word "behold" alerts us to a new people in the story. Your language may have a way of doing this.

# his mother

This is Mary, Jesus' human mother.

# his brothers

These are probably other children born to Mary, but it is is possible that the word "brothers" here refers to Jesus' cousins.

# seeking to speak

"wanting to speak"

# Someone said to him, "Look, your mother and your brothers stand outside, seeking to speak to you."

This can be translated as an indirect quotation. AT: "Someone told Jesus that his mother and brothers were outside and wanted to speak to him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
