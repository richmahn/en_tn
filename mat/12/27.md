# Satan ... Beelzebul

Both names refer to the same person.

# by whom do your sons drive them out?

Jesus uses another question to challenge the Pharisees. AT: "then you must say your followers also drive out demons by the power of Beelzebul. But, you know this is not true." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# your sons

Jesus was speaking to the Pharisees. The phrase "your sons" refers to their followers. This was a common way of referring to those who follow teachers or leaders. AT: "your followers" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# For this reason they will be your judges

"Because your followers cast out demons by the power of God, they prove that you are wrong about me."
