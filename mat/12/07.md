# Connecting Statement:

Jesus continues to respond to the Pharisees.

# General Information:

In verse 7, Jesus quotes the prophet Hosea to rebuke the Pharisees.

# If you had known what this meant, 'I desire mercy and not sacrifice,' you would not have condemned the guiltless

Here Jesus quotes scripture. AT: "The prophet Hosea wrote this long ago: 'I desire mercy and not sacrifice.' If you had understood what this meant, you would not have condemned the guiltless" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# I desire mercy and not sacrifice

In the law of Moses, God did command the Israelites to offer sacrifices. This means God considers mercy more important than the sacrifices.

# I desire

The pronoun "I" refers to God.

# the guiltless

This can be translated as an adjective. AT: "those who are not guilty" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])

# Son of Man

Jesus is referring to himself. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# is Lord of the Sabbath

"rules over the Sabbath" or "makes the laws about what people can do on the Sabbath"
