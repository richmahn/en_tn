# How can anyone enter the house ... belongings from his house

Jesus uses a parable to continue his response to the Pharisees. Jesus means he can drive out demons because he is more powerful than Satan. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])

# How can anyone enter ... without tying up the strong man first?

Jesus uses a question to teach the Pharisees and the crowd. Alternate translation: "No one can enter ... without tying up the strong man first." or "If a person wants to enter ... he must first tie up the strong man." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# without tying up the strong man first

"without taking control of the strong man first"

# Then he will steal

"The he can steal" or "Then he will be able to steal"
