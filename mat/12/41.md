## The men of Nineveh will stand up…with this generation…and will condemn it ##

Alternate translations: "The people of Nineveh will accuse this generation…and God will hear their accusation and condemn you" or "God will judge both the men of Nineveh…and this generation guilty of sin, but because they repented and you did not, he will condemn only you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## this generation ##
