# Connecting Statement:

Jesus continues to respond to the Pharisees.

# I say to you

This adds emphasis to what Jesus says next.

# say to you

Here "you" is plural. Jesus is speaking directly to the Pharisees, but he is also teaching the crowd. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men

This can be stated in active form. AT: "God will forgive every sin that people commit and every evil thing they say" or "God will forgive every person who sins or says evil things" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven

This can be stated in active form. AT: "God will not forgive the person who speaks evil things about the Holy Spirit" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
