# Connecting Statement:

Jesus responds to the Pharisees' criticism.

# What man would there be among you, who, if he had just one sheep ... would not grasp hold of it and lift it out?

Jesus uses a question to respond to the Pharisees. He is challenging them to think about what kind of work they do on the Sabbath. AT: "Every one of you, if you only had one sheep ... would grab the sheep and lift it out" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# How much more valuable, then, is a man than a sheep!

The phrase "how much more" adds emphasis to the statement. AT: "Obviously, a man is much more valuable than a sheep!" or "Just think about how much more important a man is than a sheep"

# it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath

"those who do good on the Sabbath are obeying the law"
