# Connecting Statement:

Jesus responds to the Pharisees' criticism.

# What man would there be among you, who, if he had just one sheep ... would not grasp hold of it and lift it out?

Jesus uses a question to respond to the Pharisees. He is challenging them to think about what kind of work they do on the Sabbath. AT: "Every one of you, if you only had one sheep ... would grab the sheep and lift it out." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
