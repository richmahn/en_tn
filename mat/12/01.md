## translationNotes

* Jesus defends his disciples when the Pharisees criticize them for picking grain to satisfy their hunger on the Sabbath.
* **grainfields** - a place to plant grain. If wheat is unknown and "grain" is too general, "fields of the plant they made bread from."
* **pluck heads of grain and eat them...do what is unlawful to do on the Sabbath** - Plucking grain in others' fields and eating it was not considered stealing (see UDB). The question was whether one could do this otherwise lawful activity on the Sabbath.
* **them ** - the heads of grain
* **heads of grain** - This is the topmost part of the wheat plant, which is a kind of large grass. It holds the mature grain or seeds of the plant.
* **See** - Alternative translation: “Look” or “Listen” or “Pay attention to what I am about to tell you.”
