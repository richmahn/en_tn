# At that time

# grainfields

a place to plant grain. If wheat is unknown and "grain" is too general, then you can use "fields of the plant they made bread from." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

# pluck heads of grain and eat them ... do what is unlawful to do on the Sabbath

Picking grain in others' fields and eating it was not considered stealing. The question was whether one could do this otherwise lawful activity on the Sabbath.

# to pluck heads of grain and eat them

"to pick some of the wheat and eat it" or "to pick some of the grain and eat it"

# heads of grain

This is the topmost part of the wheat plant. It holds the mature grain or seeds of the plant.
