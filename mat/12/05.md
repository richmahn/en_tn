# Connecting Statement:

Jesus continues to respond to the Pharisees.

# Have you not read in the law that ... but are guiltless?

Jesus uses a question to respond to the criticism of the Pharisees. Jesus is challenging them to think about the meaning of what they have read in the scriptures. AT: "Surely you have read in the law of Moses that ... but are guiltless." or "You should know that the law teaches that ... but are guiltless." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# profane the Sabbath

"do on the Sabbath what they would do on any other day"

# are guiltless

"God will not punish them" or "God does not consider them guilty"

# I say to you

This adds emphasis to what Jesus says next.

# one greater than the temple

"someone who is more important than the temple." Jesus was referring to himself as the one greater. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
