This continues an account of the Pharisees saying that it was by the power of Satan that Jesus healed a man.

## If Satan drives out Satan ##

"If Satan works against his own kingdom" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## how will his kingdom stand ##

“Satan's kingdom cannot stand,” or “Satan's kingdom will fall apart.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## drive out ##

"force out" or "cast out" or "throw out" or "put out"

## by whom do your followers drive them out  ##

Alternate translation: "it must also be the power of Beelzebul that enables your followers to drive out demons" (or see UDB). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## they will be your judges  ##

Alternate translation: “your followers who cast out demons by God's power will judge you for saying that I cast out demons by Beelzebul's power.”
