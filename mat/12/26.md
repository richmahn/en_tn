# Connecting Statement:

Jesus continues to respond to the Pharisees' accusation that he healed the man by the power of Satan.

# If Satan drives out Satan

The second use of Satan refers to the demons that serve Satan. Alternate translation: "If Satan works against his own demons" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# How then will his kingdom stand?

Jesus uses this question to show the Pharisees that what they were saying was illogical. Alternate translation: "If Satan were divided against himself, his kingdom would not be able to stand!" or "If Satan were to fight against his own demons, his kingdom would not last!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
