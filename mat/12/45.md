# When an unclean spirit ... with this evil generation

Jesus tells a parable to warn the people of the danger of not believing him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])

# It will be just like that with this evil generation

This means that if the people of Jesus' generation do not believe him and become his disciples, they will be in a worse situation than they were before he came.
