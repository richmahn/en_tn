# Connecting Statement:

This is the end of the part of the story that began in [Matthew 12:1](../12/01.md), where Matthew tells of growing opposition to Jesus' ministry.

# who told him

The details of the message the person told Jesus are understood and not repeated here. Alternate translation: "who told Jesus that his mother and brothers wanted to speak to him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# Who is my mother and who are my brothers?

Jesus uses these questions to teach the people. Alternate translation: "I will tell you who are really my mother and brothers" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
