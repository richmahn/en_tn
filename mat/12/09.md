# General Information:

Here the scene shifts to a later time when the Pharisees criticize Jesus for healing a man on the Sabbath.

# Then Jesus left from there

"Jesus left the grainfields" or "Then Jesus left"

# their synagogue

"a synagogue." Here "their" refers to the Jews in general not just the Pharisees from the previous section.

# Behold

The word "Behold" alerts us to a new person in the story. Your language may have a way of doing this.

# a man who had a withered hand

"a man who had a paralyzed hand" or "a man with a crippled hand"

# The Pharisees asked Jesus, saying, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?" so that they might accuse him of sinning

"The Pharisees wanted to accuse Jesus of sinning, so they asked him, 'Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?'"

# Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?

"According to the law of Moses, may a person heal another person on the Sabbath?"

# so that they might accuse him of sinning

They did not just want to accuse Jesus in front of the people. The Pharisees wanted Jesus to give an answer that contradicted the law of Moses so they could take him before a judge and legally charge him with breaking the law. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
