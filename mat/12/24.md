This refers to the miracle of the healing of a blind, deaf, and demon-possessed man.

# This man does not cast out demons except by Beelzebul

This can be stated in a positive form. "This man is only able to cast out the demon because he is a servant of Beelzebul" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])

# This man

The Pharisees avoid calling Jesus by name to show they reject him.
