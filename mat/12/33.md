This continues an account of the Pharisees saying that it was by the power of Satan that Jesus healed a man.

## Either make a tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree corrupt and its fruit corrupt ##

"Decide that either the fruit is good and so the tree is good, or the fruit is corrupt and so the tree is corrupt"

## good...corrupt ##

This can mean 1) "healthy...unhealthy" or 2) "edible...inedible."

## a tree is known by its fruit  ##

This can mean 1) "people know whether a tree is healthy or not by looking at its fruit" or 2) "people know what species a tree is by looking at its fruit." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## You...you ##

the Pharisees

## out of the content of the heart the mouth speaks ##

"a person can only say what is in his heart" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## good treasure...evil treasure ##

<b>good treasure...evil treasure<b>- "righteous thoughts...evil thoughts" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
