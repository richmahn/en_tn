# Connecting Statement:

Matthew continues to quote the prophet Isaiah.

# neither will anyone hear his voice in

Here "voice" refers to the whole person. AT: "And he will not speak loudly" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# his ... He

All occurrences of these words refer to God's chosen servant.

# in the streets

This is an idiom that means "publicly." AT: "in the cities and towns" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# He will not break any bruised reed; he will not quench any smoking flax

Both of these statements mean the same thing. They are metaphors emphasizing that God's servant will be gentle and kind. Both "bruised reed" and "smoking flax" represent weak and hurting people. If the metaphor is confusing, you could translate the literal meaning. AT: "He will be kind to weak people, and he will be gentle to those who are hurting" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# bruised reed

"damaged plant"

# he will not quench

"he will not put out"

# smoking flax

This refers to a lamp wick after the flame has gone out and when it is only smoking.

# flax, until

This can be translated with a new sentence: "flax. This is what he will do until"

# he leads justice to victory

"until he succeeds in bringing my justice and salvation to the people." The abstract noun "justice" can be translated as "just." The abstract noun "victory" can be stated as "save." AT: "the people know that I am just, and I will save them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# in his name

Here "name" refers to the whole person. AT: "in him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
