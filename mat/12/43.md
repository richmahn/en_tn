# Connecting Statement:

Jesus continues to rebuke the scribes and Pharisees.

# When an unclean spirit ... with this evil generation

Jesus tells a parable to warn the people of the danger of not believing him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])

# waterless places

"dry places" or "places where no people live"

# does not find it

Here "it" refers to rest.
