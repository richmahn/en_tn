Jesus continues to rebuke the unbelieving scribes and Pharisees because they demanded that he perform a sign.

## waterless places ##

"dry places" or “places where no people live” (see UDB)

## does not find it ##

"does not find any rest”

## it says ##

"the unclean spirit says"

## it finds that house swept out and put in order ##

Alternate translation: “the unclean spirit finds someone has swept the house clean and has put everything in the house where it belongs.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
