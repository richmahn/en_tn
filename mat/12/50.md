# whoever does

"anyone who does"

# Father

This is an important title for God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])

# that person is my brother, and sister, and mother

This is a metaphor meaning that those who obey God belong to Jesus' spiritual family. This is more important than belonging to his physical family. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
