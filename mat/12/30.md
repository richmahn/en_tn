# who is not with me

"who does not support me" or "who does not work with me"

# is against me

"opposes me" or "works against me"

# the one who does not gather with me scatters

Jesus is using a metaphor that refers to a person either gathering the flock of sheep to a shepherd or making them scatter away from the shepherd. Jesus means that a person is either helping to make people become disciples of Jesus or he is making people reject Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
