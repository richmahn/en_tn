# General Information:

Jesus quotes a verse from Leviticus as the second greatest commandment.

# a second commandment is like it

Possible meanings are 1) "there is another commandment that is next in importance" or 2) "there is a second commandment that is just as important." Either way, Jesus means these two commandments are more important than all other commandments.

# second commandment

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])

# like it

This means like the commandment in [Matthew 22:37](./37.md).

# your neighbor

Here "neighbor" means more than just those who live nearby. Jesus means a person must love all people.

# On these two commandments depend the whole law and the prophets

Here "whole law and the prophets" refer to all of scripture. AT: "Everything that Moses and the prophets wrote in the scriptures is based on these two commandments" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
