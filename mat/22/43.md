# General Information:

Jesus quotes from the Psalms to show that the Christ is more than just "the son of David."

# How then does David in the Spirit call him Lord

Jesus uses a question to make the religious leaders think deeply about the Psalm he is about to quote. AT: "Then, tell me why David in the Spirit calls him Lord" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# David in the Spirit

"David, whom the Holy Spirit is inspiring." This means the Holy Spirit is influencing what David says.

# call him

Here "him" refers to the Christ, who is also the descendant of David.

# The Lord said

Here "Lord" refers to God the Father.

# to my Lord

Here "Lord" refers to the Christ. Also, "my" refers to David. This means the Christ is superior to David.

# at my right hand

Here "my" refers to God the Father. The "right hand" is often used to indicate a place of honor. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# until I make your enemies your footstool

This is an idiom. AT: "until I conquer your enemies" or "until I make your enemies bow down before you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
