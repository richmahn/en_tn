# General Information:

Jesus quotes from the Psalms to show that the Christ is more than just "the son of David."

# How then does David in the Spirit call him Lord

Jesus uses a question to make the religious leaders think deeply about the Psalm he is about to quote. Alternate translation: "Then, tell me why David in the Spirit calls him Lord" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# David in the Spirit

"David, whom the Holy Spirit is inspiring." This means the Holy Spirit is influencing what David says.

# call him

Here "him" refers to the Christ, who is also the descendant of David.
