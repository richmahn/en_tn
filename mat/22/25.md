# Connecting Statement:

The Sadducees continue asking Jesus a question.

# The first ... the second ... the third ... the seventh

"The oldest ... the next oldest ... the next oldest ... the youngest" or "The oldest ... his oldest younger brother ... that brother's oldest younger brother ... the youngest" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])

# After them all

"After every brother had died"

# Now

Here the Sadducees shift from the story about the seven brothers to their actual question.

# in the resurrection

"when dead people come back to life"
