# Connecting Statement:

The Sadducees continue asking Jesus a question.

# The first ... the second ... the third ... the seventh

"The oldest ... the next oldest ... the next oldest ... the youngest" or "The oldest ... his oldest younger brother ... that brother's oldest younger brother ... the youngest" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
