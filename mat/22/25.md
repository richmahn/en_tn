# Connecting Statement:

The Sadducees continue asking Jesus a question.

# first ... second ... third ... seventh

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])

# After them all

"After every brother had died"

# Now

Here the Sadducees shift from the story about the seven brothers to their actual question.

# in the resurrection

"when dead people come back to life"
