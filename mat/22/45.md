# Connecting Statement:

This is the end of the account of the religious leaders trying to trap Jesus with several difficult questions.

# General Information:

This is the end of the part of the story that began in [Matthew 19:1](../19/01.md), that tells of Jesus ministering in Judea.

# If David then calls the Christ 'Lord,' how is he David's son?

Jesus uses a question to make the religious leaders think deeply about what he is saying. AT: "David calls him 'Lord,' so the Christ has to be more than just a descendant of David" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# If David then calls the Christ

David referred to Jesus as "Lord" because Jesus was not only a descendant of David, but he was also superior to him.

# to answer him a word

Here "word" refers to what people say. AT: "to answer him anything" or "to answer him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# any more questions

It is implied that no one asked him the kind of questions that were intended to make him say something wrong so the religious leaders could arrest him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
