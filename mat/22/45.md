# General Information:

This is the end of the part of the story that began in [Matthew 19:1](../19/01.md), that tells of Jesus ministering in Judea.

# Connecting Statement:

This is the end of the account of the religious leaders trying to trap Jesus with several difficult questions.

# If David then calls the Christ 'Lord,' how is he David's son?

Jesus uses a question to make the religious leaders think deeply about what he is saying. Alternate translation: "David calls him 'Lord,' so the Christ has to be more than just a descendant of David." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# If David then calls the Christ

David referred to Jesus as "Lord" because Jesus was not only a descendant of David, but he was also superior to him.
