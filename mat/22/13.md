# Connecting Statement:

Jesus concludes his parable about a marriage feast.

# Bind this man hand and foot

"Tie him up so that he cannot move his hands or feet"

# the outer darkness

Here "outer darkness" is a metonym for the place where God sends those who reject them. This is a place that is completely separated from God forever. See how you translated this in [Matthew 8:12](../08/11.md). AT: "the dark place away from God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# weeping and the grinding of teeth

"Grinding of teeth" is symbolic action, representing extreme sadness and suffering. AT: "weeping and expressing their extreme suffering" See how you translated this in [Matthew 8:12](../08/11.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])

# For many people are called, but few are chosen

This can be stated in active form. AT: "For God invites many people, but he only chooses a few" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# For

This marks a transition. Jesus has ended the parable and will now explain the point of the parable.
