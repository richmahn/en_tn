In 22:32, Jesus quotes from Exodus to prove that people live again after they die.

# have you not read what ... Jacob'?

Jesus asks this question to remind the religious leaders of what they know from scripture. AT: "I know you have read it, but you do not seem to understand what ... Jacob.'" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# what was spoken to you by God

This can be stated in active form. AT: "what God spoke to you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# God, saying, 'I am ... Jacob'?

You can translate this direct quotation as an indirect quotation. AT: "God, who said to Moses that he is the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])

# of the dead, but of the living

These nominal adjectives can be stated as adjectives. AT: "of dead people, but he is the God of living people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
