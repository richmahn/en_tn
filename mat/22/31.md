# Connecting Statement:

Jesus begins asking a question to show that people who have died will live again.

# have you not read ... God, saying,

Jesus scolds the Sadducees by asking a question. He is not looking for an answer. Alternate translation: "I know you have read ... God. You know that he said," (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# what was spoken to you by God

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "what God spoke to you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
