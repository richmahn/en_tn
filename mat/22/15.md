# Connecting Statement:

This begins an account of the religious leaders trying to trap Jesus with several difficult questions. Here the Pharisees ask him about paying taxes to Caesar.

# how they might entrap Jesus in his own talk

"how they could cause Jesus to say something wrong so they could arrest him"
