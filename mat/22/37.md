# General Information:

Jesus quotes a verse from Deuteronomy as the greatest commandment.

# with all your heart, with all your soul

The idiom "with all ... heart" means "completely" and "with all ... soul" means "with all ... being." See how you translated these two phrases in [Deuteronomy 4:29](../../deu/04/29.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# with all your mind

The mind is what people use to think.

# the great and first commandment

Here "great" and "first" mean the same thing. They emphasize that this is the most important commandment. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
