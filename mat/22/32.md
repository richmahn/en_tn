# Connecting Statement:

Jesus finishes asking the question he began in verse 31.

# 'I am the God ... Jacob'?

This is the end of the question that begins with the words "have you not read" in verse 31. Jesus asks this question to remind the religious leaders of what they know from scripture. "I know you have read it, but you do not seem to understand what ... Jacob.'" You can translate this direct quotation as an indirect quotation. "God, who said to Moses that he is the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# of the dead, but of the living

These nominal adjectives can be stated as adjectives. Alternate translation: "of dead people, but he is the God of living people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
