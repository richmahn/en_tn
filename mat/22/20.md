# to them

Here "them" refers to the Herodians and the disciples of the Pharisees.

# Whose image and name are these?

Jesus uses a question to get the people to think deeply about what he is saying. Alternate translation: "Tell me whose image and name you see on this coin." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
