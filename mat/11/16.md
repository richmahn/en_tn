Jesus continues to talk to the crowds about John the Baptist.

## To what should I compare  ##

This is the start of a rhetorical question. Jesus used it to introduce a comparison between the people of that day and what children might say in the marketplace. He begins with a rhetorical question. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## It is like children playing in the marketplace, who sit and call to one another ##

This simile can mean 1) Jesus "played the flute" and John "mourned," but "this generation" refused to dance or weep, metaphors for obedience, or 2) the Pharisees and other religious leaders criticized the common people for not obeying the laws they added to the Law of Moses. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]], [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## this generation  ##

“the people living now” or “these people” or “you people of this generation” (see UDB)

## marketplace  ##

This was a large, open-air area where people would come to sell their goods.

## We played a flute for you ##

"We" refers to the children sitting in the marketplace. "You" refers to "this generation" or the crowd who hears the music and does not respond.

## flute  ##

This is a long, hollow musical instrument, which is played by blowing air in or over one end.

## and you did not dance ##

“but you did not dance to the music”

## and you did not weep ##

“but you did not weep with us”
