# Connecting Statement:

Jesus continues to talk to the crowds about John the Baptist.

# To what should I compare this generation?

Jesus uses a question to introduce a comparison between the people of that day and what children might say in the marketplace. Alternate translation: "This is what this generation is like" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# this generation

"the people living now" or "these people" or "you people of this generation"

# marketplace

a large, open-air area where people buy and sell items
