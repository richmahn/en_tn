Jesus begins speaking against the people of the cities where he previously did miracles.

## rebuke the cities  ##

Jesus is here using a metonymy, accusing the people of these cities of doing wrong. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## cities  ##

"towns"

## in which most of his great deeds were done  ##

This can be translated with an active verb: "in which he did most of his great deeds" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]]).

## mighty deeds ##

This can be translated "mighty works" or "works of power" or "miracles" (UDB).

## because they had not repented ##

The pronoun "they" refers to the people in the cities that had not repented.

## Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! ##

Jesus speaks as if the people of the cities of Chorazin and Bethsaida were there listening to him, but they were not. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe]])

## Chorazin...Bethsaida...Tyre...Sidon  ##

The names of these cities are used as metonymy for the people living in these cities. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## If the mighty deeds had been done in Tyre and Sidon which were done in you ##

This can be translated with active forms: "If I did the mighty deeds in Tyre and Sidon that I did in you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]]).

## Woe to you ##

The pronoun "you" here is singular.

## they would have repented long ago  ##

The pronoun "they" refers to the people of Tyre and Sidon.

## repented  ##

"shown they were sorry for their sins"

## it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment than for you  ##

"God will show more mercy to Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgment than to you" or "God will punish you more severely at the day of judgment than the people of Tyre and Sidon" (see UDB). The implied information is “because you did not repent and believe in me, even though you saw me do miracles.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

## than for you  ##

The pronoun "you" is singular and refers to Chorazin or Bethsaida.
