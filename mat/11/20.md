# General Information:

Jesus begins to rebuke the people of the cities where he previously did miracles.

# rebuke the cities

Here "the cities" refers to the people who live there. AT: "rebuke the people of the cities" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# cities

"towns"

# in which most of his mighty deeds were done

This can be translated in active form. AT: "in which he did most of his mighty deeds" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# mighty deeds

"mighty works" or "works of power" or "miracles"

# which were done in you ... than for you

Here the "you" is plural and refers to Chorazin and Bethsaida. If it is more natural for your language, you could use a dual "you" to refer to the two cities, or a plural "you" to refer to the people of the cities. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
