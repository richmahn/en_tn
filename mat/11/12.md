# From the days of John the Baptist

"From the time John began preaching his message." The word "days" probably refers here to a period of months or even years.

# the kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and men of violence take it by force

There are various possible interpretations of this verse. The UST assumes that it means that some people want to use God's kingdom for their own selfish purposes, and that they are willing to use force against other people to accomplish this. Other versions assume a positive interpretation, that the call to enter the kingdom of God has become so urgent, that people must act in an extreme manner in order to answer that call and to resist the temptation to sin further. A third interpretation is that violent people are harming God's people and trying to stop God from ruling.
