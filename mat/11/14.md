# if you

Here "you" is plural and refers to the crowd. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# he is Elijah who was to come

The word "he" refers to John the Baptist. This does not mean John the Baptist is literally Elijah. Jesus means John the Baptist fulfills the prophecy about "Elijah, who is to come" or the next Elijah. AT: "when the prophet Malachi said that Elijah would return, he was speaking about John the Baptist"
