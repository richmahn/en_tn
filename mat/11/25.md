# General Information:

In verses 25 and 26, Jesus prays to his heavenly Father while still in the presence of the crowd. In verse 27, he begins to address the people again.

# Father

This is an important title for God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])

# Lord of heaven and earth

"Lord who rules over heaven and earth." The phrase "heaven and earth" is a merism that refers to all people and things in the universe. AT: "Lord who rules over the whole universe" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])

# you concealed these things ... and revealed them

It is not clear what is meant by "these things." If your language needs to specify what is meant, an alternative translation might be best. AT: "you concealed these truths ... and revealed them"

# you concealed these things from

"you hid these things from" or "you have not made these things known to." This verb is the opposite of "revealed."

# from the wise and understanding

These nominal adjectives can be translated as adjectives. AT: "from people who are wise and understanding" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])

# the wise and understanding

Jesus is using irony. He does not think these people are really wise. AT: "people who think they are wise and understanding" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])

# revealed them

"made them known." The pronoun "them" refers to "these things" earlier in this verse.

# to little children

Jesus compares ignorant people to little children. Jesus is emphasizing that many of those who believe him either are not well educated or do not think of themselves as wise. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
