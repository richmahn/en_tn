## translationNotes

* Jesus prays to his heavenly Father while still in the presence of the crowd of people.
* **Jesus answered and said** - This can mean 1) the disciples Jesus had sent out in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:10:05]] had returned (see [[:en:bible:notes:mat:12:01]]) and Jesus was responding to something someone had said, or 2) Jesus was concluding his condemnation of the unrepentant cities: "Furthermore, Jesus said."
* **O Father ** - This refers to God the Father, not an earthly father.
* **Lord of heaven and earth** - This can be translated as a metonym, “Master over everyone and everything in heaven and earth,” or as a merism, "Master of the universe." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
* **you concealed these things from the wise and understanding, and revealed them to those who are untaught, like little children** - It is not clear what is meant by "these things." If your language needs to specify what is meant, an alternative translation might be best: "You have revealed to ignorant people truths that you have not allowed wise and educated people to learn."
* **concealed ** - "hid" - This verb is the opposite of "revealed."
* **the wise and understanding** - “people who are wise and understanding.” Alternative translation: "people who think they are wise and understanding.” (See UDB, [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
* **revealed them** - The pronoun "them" refers to "these things" earlier in this verse.
* **to those who are untaught, like little children** - This whole phrase translates one word that combines the meanings of "young children" and "untaught" or "ignorant." Alternative translation: "ignorant little children"
* **like little children ** - a simile for people who are not wise or well-educated, or people who know that they are not wise and well-educated (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
* **for so it was well-pleasing in your sight** - pleasing in your sight**  - “for you saw that it was good to do that”
* **All things have been entrusted to me from my Father** - This can be translated with an active verb: "My Father has entrusted all things to me" or “My Father has handed everything over to me.”(See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
* **no one knows the Son except the Father** - “Only the Father knows the Son.”
* **knows the Son** - “knows from personal experience"
* **the Son** - Jesus was referring to himself in the third person. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
* **no one knows the Father except the Son** - “Only the Son knows the Father.”
* **knows the Father** - "knows from personal experience"
* **and anyone to whom the Son desires to reveal him** - Alternative translation: “people know who the Father is only if the Son wants to reveal the Father to them”
* **to whom the Son desires to reveal him** - The pronoun "him" refers to God the Father.
