# Connecting Statement:

Jesus continues to talk to the crowds about John the Baptist.

# all the prophets and the law have been prophesying until John

Here "prophets and the law" refer to the things that the prophets and Moses wrote in scripture. AT: "for these are the things that the prophets and Moses have prophesied through the scriptures until the time of John the Baptist" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
