Jesus continues to talk to the crowds about John the Baptist.

## law  ##

"law of Moses"

## John  ##

"John the Baptist"

## And if you  ##

The pronoun "you" refers to the people in the crowd.

## this is Elijah  ##

"This" refers to John the Baptist. This phrase is a metonym saying that John the Baptist corresponds to the prophecy of Elijah in the Old Testament, but it is not saying that John the Baptist is actually Elijah. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## He who has ears to hear, let him hear ##

AT: "You who have ears to hear, hear."

## He who has ears to hear ##

"Whoever can hear" or "Whoever hears me"

## let him hear ##

"let him listen well" or "let him pay attention to what I say"
