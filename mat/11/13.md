## translationNotes

* Jesus continues to talk to the crowds about John the Baptist.
* **law ** - <b>law <b>- "law of Moses"
* **John ** - <b>John <b>- "John the Baptist"
* **And if you ** - The pronoun "you" refers to the people in the crowd.
* **this is Elijah ** - "This" refers to John the Baptist. This phrase is a metonym saying that John the Baptist corresponds to the prophecy of Elijah in the Old Testament, but it is not saying that John the Baptist is actually Elijah. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
* **He who has ears to hear, let him hear** - It may be more natural in some languages to use the second person: "You who have ears to hear, hear." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
* **He who has ears to hear** - "Whoever can hear" or "Whoever hears me"
* **let him hear** - "let him listen well" or "let him pay attention to what I say"
