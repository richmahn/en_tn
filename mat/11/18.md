# Connecting Statement:

Jesus concludes talking to the crowds about John the Baptist.

# not eating bread or drinking wine

Here "bread" refers to food. It does not mean that John never ate food. It means he fasted often, and when he ate, he did not eat good, expensive food. Alternate translation: "frequently fasting and not drinking alcohol" or "not eating fancy food and not drinking wine" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# they say, 'He has a demon.'

This can be translated as an indirect quote. Alternate translation: "they say that he has a demon" or "they accuse him of having a demon" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])

# they say

All occurrences of "they" refer to the people of that generation, and most specifically to the Pharisees and religious leaders.
