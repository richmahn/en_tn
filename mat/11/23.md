Jesus continues speaking against the people of the cities where he previously did miracles.

## You, Capernaum ##

Jesus now speaks to the people in the city of Capernaum as if they were listening to him, but they were not. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe]]) The pronoun "you" is singular and refers to Capernaum throughout these two verses.

## Capernaum...Sodom  ##

The names of these cities are used as metonymies for the people living in Capernaum and in Sodom. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## do you think you will be exalted to heaven? ##

This is a rhetorical question in which Jesus rebukes the people of Capernaum for their pride. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]]) It can be translated with the active form: “will you go up to heaven?” or “do you think that God will honor you?” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## will be exalted  ##

<b>will be exalted <b>- “will be honored.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

## you will be brought down to hades  ##

This can be translated with the active form: "God will bring you down to hades." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## if in Sodom there had been done the great deeds that were done in you  ##

<b>if in Sodom there had been done the great deeds that were done in you <b>- This can be translated the active form: "if in Sodom I did the great deeds that I did in you." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## mighty deeds  ##

<b>mighty deeds <b>- "mighty works" or "works of power" or "miracles" (UDB)

## it would still have remained  ##

The pronoun "it" refers to the city of Sodom.

## it shall be easier for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment than for you ##

This can be translated “God will show more mercy to the land of Sodom in the day of judgment than to you” or “God will punish you more severely at the day of judgment than the people of Sodom” (see UDB). The implied information is “because you did not repent and believe in me, even though you saw me do miracles.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
