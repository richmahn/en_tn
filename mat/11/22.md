# which were done in you ... than for you

Here the "you" is plural and refers to Chorazin and Bethsaida. If it is more natural for your language, you could use a dual "you" to refer to the two cities, or a plural "you" to refer to the people of the cities. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment than for you

Here "Tyre and Sidon" refers to the people who live there. Alternate translation: "God will show more mercy to the people of Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgment than to you" or "God will punish you more severely at the day of judgment than the people of Tyre and Sidon" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# than for you

The implied information can be made explicit. AT "than for you, because you did not repent and believe in me, even though you saw me do miracles" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
