Jesus continues to talk to the crowds about John the Baptist.

## But what did you go out to see  ##

This continues the series of rhetorical questions about John the Baptist. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## But what did you go out to see--a prophet? Yes, I say to you  ##

The plural pronoun "you" is referring to the crowd in both cases.

## much more than a prophet  ##

“not an ordinary prophet” or “more important than a normal prophet”

## This is he  ##

"This" refers to John the Baptist.

## he of whom it was written ##

The pronoun "he" refers to "my messenger" in the next phrase.

## See, I am sending my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way before you.  ##

Jesus is quoting here from the prophet Malachi and saying that John was that messenger in the writings of Malachi [Malachi 3:1](../../mal/03/01.md).

## I am sending my messenger ##

The pronouns "I" and "my" refer to God. The writer of this Old Testament prophecy is quoting what God said.

## before your face  ##

“in front of you” or “to go ahead of you.” The pronoun “you” is singular, because God was speaking to the Messiah in the quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
