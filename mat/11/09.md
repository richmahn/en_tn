# General Information:

In verse 10, Jesus quotes the prophet Malachi to show that the life and ministry of John the Baptist fulfilled prophecy.

# Connecting Statement:

Jesus continues to talk to the crowds about John the Baptist.

# But what did you go out to seeâ€”a prophet?

Jesus uses a question to make the people think about what kind of man John the Baptist is. Alternate translation: "But surely you went out to the desert to see a prophet!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Yes, I say to you,

"I say to you yes,"

# much more than a prophet

This can be translated as a complete sentence. Alternate translation: "he is not an ordinary prophet" or "he is more important than a normal prophet" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
