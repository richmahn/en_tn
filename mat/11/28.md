## translationNotes

* Jesus finishes speaking to the crowd.
* **who labor and are heavy burdened** - This metaphor refers to the "yoke" of the Jewish law. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **I will give you rest** - "I will allow you to rest from your labor and burden" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
* **Take my yoke on you** - The pronoun "you" in this verse refers to "all you who labor and are heavy burdened." This metaphor means "accept the tasks that I assign you" (see UDB) or "work together with me." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **my burden is light** - The word "light" here is the opposite of heavy, not the opposite of dark.
