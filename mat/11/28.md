Jesus finishes speaking to the crowd.

## who labor and are heavy burdened ##

This metaphor refers to the "yoke" of the Jewish law. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## I will give you rest ##

"I will allow you to rest from your labor and burden" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

## Take my yoke on you ##

The pronoun "you" in this verse refers to "all you who labor and are heavy burdened." This metaphor means "accept the tasks that I assign you" (see UDB) or "work together with me." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## my burden is light ##

The word "light" here is the opposite of heavy, not the opposite of dark.
