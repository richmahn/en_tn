# Connecting Statement:

Jesus finishes speaking to the crowd.

# all you

All occurrences of "you" are plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# who labor and are heavy burdened

Jesus is speaking about the people as if they are animals, which their masters have made to carry too much weight on their backs. This is a metaphor for all the laws and rules the Jewish leaders expect the people to obey. AT: "who labor under all the laws the religious leaders place on you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# I will give you rest

"I will allow you to rest from your labor and burden"

# Take my yoke on you

Jesus continues the metaphor. Jesus is inviting the people to become his disciples and follow him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# I am meek and lowly in heart

Here "meek" and "lowly in heart" mean basically the same thing. Jesus combines them to emphasize that he will be much more kind than the religious leaders. AT: "I am gentle and humble" or "I am very gentle" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# lowly in heart

This is an idiom that means "humble." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# you will find rest for your souls

Here "soul" refers to the entire person. AT: "you will find rest for yourselves" or "you will be able to rest" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# For my yoke is easy and my burden is light

Both of these phrases mean the same thing. Jesus is emphasizing that it is easier to obey him than it is the Jewish law. AT: "For what I place on you, you will be able to carry because it is light" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# my burden is light

The word "light" here is the opposite of heavy, not the opposite of dark.
