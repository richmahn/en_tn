# This is he of whom it was written

This can be stated in active form. AT: "This is what the prophet Malachi wrote long ago about John the Baptist" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# I am sending my messenger

The pronouns "I" and "my" refer to God. Malachi is quoting what God said.

# before your face

Here "your" is singular, because God was speaking to the Messiah in the quotation. Also, "face" refers to the whole person. AT: "in front of you" or "to go ahead of you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# prepare your way before you

This is a metaphor that means the messenger will prepare the people to receive the Messiah's message. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
