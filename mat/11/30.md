# For my yoke is easy and my burden is light

Both of these phrases mean the same thing. Jesus is emphasizing that it is easier to obey him than it is the Jewish law. AT: "For what I place on you, you will be able to carry because it is light" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# my burden is light

The word "light" here is the opposite of heavy, not the opposite of dark.
