# Connecting Statement:

This concludes the account of Jesus healing two demon-possessed men.

# tending the pigs

"taking care of the pigs"

# what had happened to the men who had been possessed by demons

This can be stated in active form. AT: "what Jesus did to help the men whom demons had controlled" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# Behold

This marks the beginning of another event in the larger story. It may involve different people than the previous events. Your language may have a way of showing this.

# all the city

The word "city" is a metonym for the people of the city. The word "all" is probably an exaggeration to emphasize how very many people came out. Not necessarily every person came out. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# their region

"their area"
