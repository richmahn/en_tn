# Foxes have holes, and the birds of the sky have nests

Jesus answers with this proverb. This means even wild animals have somewhere to rest. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-proverbs]])

# Foxes

Foxes are animals like dogs. They eat nesting birds and other small animals. If foxes are unknown in your area, use a general term for dog-like creatures or other furry animals. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

# holes

Foxes make holes in the ground to live in. Use the appropriate word for the place where the animal you use for "foxes" lives.

# the Son of Man

Jesus is speaking about himself. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# nowhere to lay his head

This refers to a place to sleep. Alternate translation: "no place of his own to sleep" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
