# to them

"to the disciples"

# Why are you afraid ... faith?

Jesus was rebuking the disciples with this rhetorical question. AT: "You should not be afraid ... faith!" or "There is nothing for you to be afraid of ... faith!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# you of little faith

"you who have such little faith." Jesus is scolding the people because they have little faith in God. See how you translated this in [Matthew 6:30](../06/30.md).

# What sort of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him?

"Even the winds and the sea obey him! What sort of man is this?" This rhetorical question shows that the disciples were surprised. AT: "This man is unlike any man we have ever seen! Even the wind and the waves obey him!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# even the winds and the sea obey him

For people or animals to obey or disobey is not surprising, but for wind and water to obey is very surprising. This personification describes the natural elements as being able to hear and respond like people. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
