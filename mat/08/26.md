# to them

"to the disciples"

# Why are you afraid ... faith?

Jesus was rebuking the disciples with this rhetorical question. Alternate translation: "You should not be afraid ... faith!" or "There is nothing for you to be afraid of ... faith!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# you of little faith

"you who have such little faith." Jesus addresses his disciples this way because their anxiety about the storm shows they have little faith in him to control it. See how you translated this in [Matthew 6:30](../06/30.md).
