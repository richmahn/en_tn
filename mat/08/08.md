## translationNotes

* This continues the account of Jesus' healing several people.
* **you should enter under my roof** - "you should enter my home" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
* **say the word** - "give the command"
* **soldiers** - "skilled fighters"
* **not even in Israel have I found anyone with so much faith ** - Jesus' hearers would have thought that the Jews in Israel, who claim to be children of God, would have greater faith than anyone. Jesus is saying they are wrong and that the centurion's faith was greater.
