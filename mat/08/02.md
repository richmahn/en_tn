# Behold

The word "behold" alerts us to a new person in the story. Your language may have a way of doing this.

# a leper

"a man who had leprosy" or "a man who had a skin disease"

# bowed before him

This is a sign of humble respect before Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])

# if you are willing

"if you want to" or "if you desire." The leper knew that Jesus had the power to heal him, but he did not know if Jesus would want to touch him.

# you can make me clean

Here "clean" means to be healed and to be able to live in the community again. AT: "you can heal me" or "please heal me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
