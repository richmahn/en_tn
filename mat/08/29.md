# Behold

This marks the beginning of another event in the larger story. Your language may have a way of showing this.

# What do we have to do with you, Son of God?

The demons use a question but they are being hostile toward Jesus. Alternate translation: "Do not bother us, Son of God!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Son of God

This is an important title for Jesus, which describes his relationship to God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])

# Have you come here to torment us before the set time?

Again, the demons use a question in a hostile way. Alternate translation: "You should not disobey God by punishing us before the specific time God has set when he will punish us!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
