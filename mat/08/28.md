This begins an account of Jesus' healing two men with demons.

## to the other side ##

"to the other side of the Sea of Galilee"

## country of the Gadarenes  ##

<b>country of the Gadarenes <b>- The Gadarenes were named for the town of Gadara. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

## theyâ€¦were very violent, so that no traveler could pass that way ##

The demons that held these two men were so dangerous that no one could go through that area.

## Behold ##

This marks the beginning of another event in the larger story. It may involve different people than the previous events. Your language may have a way of doing this.

## What do we have to do with you, Son of God? ##

This first rhetorical question is hostile (see UDB, [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]]).

## Son of God ##

The demons use this title to show that Jesus is not welcome because of who he is.

## Have you come here to torment us before the set time? ##

This second rhetorical question is also hostile and means "You should not disobey God by punishing us before the specific time God has set when he will punish us." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
