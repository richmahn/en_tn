# Truly I say to you

"I tell you the truth." This phrase adds emphasis to what Jesus says next.

# I have not found anyone with such faith in Israel

Jesus' hearers would have thought that the Jews in Israel, who claim to be children of God, would have greater faith than anyone. Jesus is saying they are wrong and that the centurion's faith was greater. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
