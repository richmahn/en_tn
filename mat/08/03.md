# Be clean

By saying this, Jesus healed the man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])

# Immediately he was cleansed

"At that moment he was cleansed"

# he was cleansed of his leprosy

The result of Jesus saying "Be clean" was that the man was healed. This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "he was well" or "the leprosy left him" or "the leprosy ended" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
