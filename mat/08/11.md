## translationNotes

* This continues the account of Jesus' healing the Roman centurion's servant.
* **you** - This refers to "those who were following him" ([[:en:bible:notes:mat:08:08]]) and so is plural.
* **from the east and the west** - This is a merism: everywhere not east of a given point is west. This can be translated as "from everywhere" or "from far away in every direction." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
* **recline at table** - People in that culture would lie down beside the table while eating. This custom is used as a metonym for living together as family and friends. This can be translated as "live as family and friends with." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
* **the sons of the kingdom will be thrown** - "God will throw the sons of the kingdom" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
* **the sons of the kingdom** - The phrase "sons of" refers to those who belong to something, in this case the kingdom of God. There is also irony here because the "sons" will be thrown out while the strangers will be welcomed. This can be translated as "those who should have allowed God to rule over them" (see UDB). (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
* **the outer darkness** - This expression refers to the eternal destiny of those who reject God. "the dark place away from God." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
* **so may it be done for you** - "so I will do it for you." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
* **the servant was healed ** - "Jesus healed the servant." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
* **at that very hour** - "at the exact time Jesus said he would heal the servant."
