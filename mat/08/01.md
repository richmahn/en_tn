## translationNotes

* This begins an account of Jesus miraculously healing several people.
* **When Jesus had come down from the hill, large crowds followed him.** - Alternative translation: “After Jesus came down from the hill, a large crowd followed him.” The crowd may have included both people who had been with him on the mountain and people who had not been with him.
* **Behold** - The word “behold” alerts us to a new person in the story. Your language may have a way of doing this.
* **a leper** - “a man who had leprosy” or “a man who had a skin disease” (UDB)
* **if you are willing** - Alternative translation: “if you want to” or “if you desire”. The leper knew that Jesus had the power to heal him, but he did not know if Jesus would want to touch him.
* **you can make me clean** - Alternative translations: “you can heal me” or “please heal me” (UDB).
* **Immediately** - “Right away”
* **he was cleansed of his leprosy** - The result of Jesus saying “Be clean” was that the man was healed. Alternative translation: “he was well” or “the leprosy left him” or “the leprosy ended.”
