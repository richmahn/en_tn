# Connecting Statement:

Here the scene shifts to the account of Jesus calming a storm as he and his disciples cross the Sea of Galilee.

# entered a boat

"got onto a boat"

# his disciples followed him

Try to use the same words for "disciple" and "follow" that you used in ([Matthew 8:21-22](./21.md)).
