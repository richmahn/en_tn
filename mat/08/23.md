# Connecting Statement:

Here the scene shifts to the account of Jesus calming a storm as he and his disciples cross the Sea of Galilee.

# entered a boat

"got onto a boat"

# his disciples followed him

Try to use the same words for "disciple" and "follow" that you used in ([Matthew 8:21-22](./21.md)).

# Behold

This marks the beginning of another event in the larger story. Your language may have a way of showing this. AT: "Suddenly" or "Without warning"

# there arose a great storm on the sea

This can be stated in active form. AT: "a powerful storm arose on the sea" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# so that the boat was covered with the waves

This can be stated in active form. AT: "so that the waves covered the boat" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# woke him up, saying, "Save us

Possible meanings are 1) they first woke Jesus and then they said, "Save us" or 2) as they were waking Jesus up, they were saying "Save us."

# us ... we

If you need to translate these words as inclusive or exclusive, then inclusive is best. The disciples probably meant they wanted Jesus to save the disciples and himself from drowning. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-inclusive]])

# we are about to die

"we are going to die"
