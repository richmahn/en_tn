This begins an account of Jesus calming a storm.

## entered a boat  ##

"Jesus got onto a boat"

## his disciples followed him ##

Try to use the same words for "disciple" and "follow" that you used in ([Matthew 8:21](./21.md)) and ([Matthew 8:21](./21.md)).

## Behold ##

This marks the beginning of another event in the larger story. It may involve different people than the previous events. Your language may have a way of doing this.

## there arose a great storm on the sea ##

"a great storm arose on the sea."

## so that the boat was covered with the waves ##

"so that the waves covered the boat." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## woke him up, saying, "Save us" ##

They did not wake him up with the words "Save us." They first "woke him up" and then "said, 'Save us.'"

## we are about to die ##

"we are going to die"
