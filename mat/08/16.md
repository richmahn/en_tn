This concludes the account of Jesus healing several people.

## evening ##

UDB infers from Mark [Mark 1:21](../../mrk/01/21.md) and [Mark 1:29](../../mrk/01/29.md) that Jesus arrived in Capernaum on the Sabbath. Because the Jews did not work or travel on the Sabbath, they waited until evening to bring people to Jesus. You do not need to mention the Sabbath unless you need to avoid wrong meaning.

## he drove out the spirits with a word ##

This is hyperbole. Jesus could have spoken more than one word. This can be translated as "Jesus only had to speak once and the demons left the man." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

## was fulfilled that which had been spoken by Isaiah the prophet ##

"Jesus fulfilled the prophecy that God had told the prophet Isaiah to reveal to Israel." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## that which had been spoken by Isaiah  ##

"what Isaiah had said" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## took our sickness and bore our diseases ##

"freed people from being sick and made them well" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
