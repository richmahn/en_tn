# General Information:

In verse 17, Matthew quotes the prophet Isaiah to show that Jesus' healing ministry was a fulfillment of prophecy.

# Connecting Statement:

Here the scene shifts to later that evening and tells of Jesus healing more people and casting out demons.

# When evening had come

Because Jews did not work or travel on the Sabbath, "evening" may imply after the Sabbath. They waited until evening to bring people to Jesus. You do not need to mention the Sabbath unless you need to avoid wrong meaning. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# many who were possessed by demons

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "many people whom demons possessed" or "many people whom demons controlled" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# He drove out the spirits with a word

Here "word" stands for a command. Alternate translation: "He commanded the spirits to leave" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
