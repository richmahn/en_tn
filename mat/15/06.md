# that person does not need to honor his father

The words beginning with "But you say" (verse 5) have a quotation within a quotation. If necessary you can translate them as indirect quotations. "But you teach that a person does not need to honor his parents by giving them something that may help them if the person tells his parents that he has already given it as a gift to God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])

# does not need to honor his father

It is implied that "his father" means "his parents." This means the religious leaders taught that a person does not need to show respect to his parents by taking care of them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# you have made void the word of God for the sake of your traditions

"you have made your traditions more important than God's commands"
