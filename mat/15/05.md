This has a quotation within a quotation. If necessary you can translate them as indirect quotations. AT: "But you teach that a person does not need to honor his parents by giving them something that may help them if the person tells his parents that he has already given it as a gift to God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])

# But you say

Here "you" is plural and refers to the Pharisees and scribes. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
