# General Information:

These verses give background information about the miracle that Jesus is about to perform by feeding four thousand people. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]]).

# lame, blind, mute, and crippled people

"those who could not walk, those who could not see, those who could not talk, and those whose arms or legs did not function"

# They presented them at Jesus' feet

Apparently some of these sick or crippled people were unable to stand up, so when their friends brought them to Jesus, they placed them on the ground in front of him. AT: "The crowds placed the sick people on the ground in front of Jesus" 

# the crippled made well

This can be stated in active form. AT: "the crippled become well" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# the crippled ... the lame ... the blind

These nominal adjectives can be stated as adjectives. AT: "the crippled persons ... the lame persons ... the blind persons" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
