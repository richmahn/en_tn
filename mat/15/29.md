This begins the account of Jesus healing people in a large crowd in Galilee.

## lame, blind, mute, and crippled people ##

"people who could not walk, some who could not see, some who could not talk, and others whose arms and legs had been hurt." Some early texts have these words in different order.

## They presented them at Jesus' feet ##

"The crowds brought the sick to Jesus"
