# Connecting Statement:

Jesus continues to respond to the Pharisees.

# General Information:

In verse 4, Jesus quotes twice from Exodus to show how God expects people to treat their parents.

# will surely die

"the people will surely execute him"

# But you say, 'Whoever says to his father or mother "Whatever help you would have received from me is now a gift given to God,"' that person does not need to honor his father

This has a quotation within a quotation. If necessary you can translate them as indirect quotations. AT: "But you teach that a person does not need to honor his parents by giving them something that may help them if the person tells his parents that he has already given it as a gift to God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])

# But you say

Here "you" is plural and refers to the Pharisees and scribes. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# does not need to honor his father

It is implied that "his father" means "his parents." This means the religious leaders taught that a person does not need to show respect to his parents by taking care of them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# you have made void the word of God for the sake of your traditions

"Word of God" here is a metonym for all of the Bible. AT: "you have made your traditions more important than God's commands" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
