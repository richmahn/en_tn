# lame, blind, mute, and crippled people

"those who could not walk, those who could not see, those who could not talk, and those whose arms or legs did not function"

# They presented them at Jesus' feet

Apparently some of these sick or crippled people were unable to stand up, so when their friends brought them to Jesus, they placed them on the ground in front of him. Alternate translation: "The crowds placed the sick people on the ground in front of Jesus"
