# It is not right to take the children's bread and throw it to the little dogs

Jesus responds to the woman with a proverb. The basic meaning is that it is not right to take what is supposed to belong to Jews and give it to non-Jews. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-proverbs]])

# the children's bread

Here "bread" refers to food in general. Alternate translation: "the children's food" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# the little dogs

The Jews considered dogs to be unclean animals. Here they are used as an image for non-Jews.
