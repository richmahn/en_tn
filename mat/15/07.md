## well did Isaiah prophesy ##

AT: "Isaiah told the truth in this prophecy"

## when he said ##

AT: "when he told what God said"

## This people honors me with their lips ##

AT: "These people say all the right things"

## but their heart is far from me ##

AT: "but they do not really love me." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

## They worship me in vain ##

AT: "Their worship has no effect on me" or "They only pretend to worship me"

## the commands of people ##

"rules that people make up."
