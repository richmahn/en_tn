# Let them alone

The word "them" refers to the Pharisees.

# blind guides ... both will fall into a pit

Jesus uses another metaphor to describe the Pharisees. Jesus means that the Pharisees do not understand God's commands or how to please him. Therefore, they cannot teach others how to please God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
