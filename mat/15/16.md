# Connecting Statement:

Jesus explains the parable that he told in [Matthew 15:13-14](./13.md).

# Are you also still without understanding?

Jesus uses a question to rebuke the disciples for not understanding the parable. Also, the word "you" is emphasized. Jesus cannot believe his own disciples do not understand. Alternate translation: "I am disappointed that you, my disciples, still do not understand what I teach!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
