The woman responds by using the same imagery as Jesus used in the proverb he just spoke. She means non-Jews should be able to have a small amount of the good things Jews are throwing away. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# little dogs

Use words here for dogs of any size that people keep as pets. See how you translated this in [Matthew 15:26](../15/26.md).
