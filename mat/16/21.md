# Connecting Statement:

Jesus foretells his death and begins to tell his disciples what it will cost to follow him.

# From that time

After Jesus commanded his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Christ, he began sharing with them what must happen in Jerusalem.

# suffer many things at the hand of the elders and chief priests and scribes

Here "hand" refers to power. AT: "where the elders, chief priests, and scribes will cause him to suffer" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# be killed and be raised back to life on the third day

This can be stated in active form. The elders and chief priests would accuse Jesus so that others would kill him. AT: "they will put him to death, and on the third day God will raise him to life again" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# third day

"Third" is the ordinal form of "three." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])

# May this be far from you

This is an idiom that means "may this never happen." AT: "No" or "Never" or "May God forbid this" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me

Jesus means that Peter is acting like Satan because Peter is trying to prevent Jesus from accomplishing what God sent him to do. AT: "Get behind me, because you are acting like Satan! You are a stumbling block to me" or "Get behind me, Satan! I call you Satan because you are a stumbling block to me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Get behind me

"Get away from me"
