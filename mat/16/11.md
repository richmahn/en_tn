# Connecting Statement:

Jesus continues to warn his disciples about the Pharisees and Sadducees.

# How is it that you do not understand that I was not speaking to you about bread?

Jesus uses this question to rebuke the disciples. Alternate translation: "You should have understood that I was not really speaking about bread." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees

Here "yeast" represents evil ideas and wrong teaching. Translate as "yeast" and do not explain the meaning in your translation. In 16:12 the disciples will understand the meaning. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
