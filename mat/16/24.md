Jesus continues to tell his disciples the cost of following him.

## follow me ##

"come with me as a disciple"

## deny himself ##

"not give in to his own desires" or "forsake his own desires."

## take up his cross, and follow me ##

"lift up his cross, carry it, and walk behind me," being willing to suffer and die the way Christ did (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## For whoever wants ##

"For anyone who wants"

## if he gains the whole world ##

"if he gains everything in the world"

## but forfeits his life ##

"he himself is lost or destroyed"
