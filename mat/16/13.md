# Connecting Statement:

Here the scene shifts to a later time. Jesus asks his disciples if they understand who he is.

# Now

This word is used here to mark a break in the main story line or to introduce a new person. Here Matthew starts to tell a new part of the story.

# the Son of Man

Jesus is referring to himself. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
