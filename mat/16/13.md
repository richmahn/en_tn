# Connecting Statement:

Here the scene shifts to a later time. Jesus asks his disciples if they understand who he is.

# Now

This word is used here to mark a break in the main story line or to introduce a new person. Here Matthew starts to tell a new part of the story.

# the Son of Man

Jesus is referring to himself. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# the Son of the living God

This is an important title for Jesus that shows his relationship to God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])

# the living God

Here "living" contrasts the God of Israel to all the false gods and idols that people worshiped. Only the God of Israel is alive and has power to act.
