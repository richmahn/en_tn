# the Son of the living God

This is an important title for Jesus that shows his relationship to God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])

# the living God

Here "living" contrasts the God of Israel to all the false gods and idols that people worshiped. Only the God of Israel is alive and has power to act.
