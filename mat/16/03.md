# Connecting Statement:

Jesus continues his response to the Pharisees and Sadducees.

# When it is morning

The situation can be stated more clearly. AT: "If the sky is red in the morning" or "If the sky is red when the sun is rising" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# foul weather

"cloudy, stormy weather"

# red and overcast

"red and cloudy"

# You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky

"You know how to look at the sky and understand what kind of weather you will have"

# but you cannot interpret the signs of the times

"but you do not know how to look at what is happening right now and understand what it means"

# An evil and adulterous generation

Here "adulterous" is a metaphor for people who are not faithful to God. See how you translated this in [Matthew 12:39](../12/38.md). AT: "unfaithful generation" or "godless generation" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# seeks for a sign

This request angers Jesus because of the religious leaders skeptical attitude about Jesus. He had already performed many miracles, but they still did not believe him. See how you translated this in [Matthew 12:39](../12/38.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# no sign will be given to it

This can be stated in active form. See how you translated this in [Matthew 12:39](../12/38.md). AT: "God will not give a sign" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# except the sign of Jonah

"except the same sign God gave to Jonah the prophet." See how you translated this in [Matthew 12:39](../12/38.md).
