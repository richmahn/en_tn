# Connecting Statement:

Jesus continues his response to the Pharisees and Sadducees.

# When it is morning

The situation can be stated more clearly. Alternate translation: "If the sky is red in the morning" or "If the sky is red when the sun is rising" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# foul weather

"cloudy, stormy weather"

# red and overcast

"red and cloudy"

# You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky

"You know how to look at the sky and understand what kind of weather you will have"

# but you cannot interpret the signs of the times

"but you do not know how to look at what is happening right now and understand what it means"
