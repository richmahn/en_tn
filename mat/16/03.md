# Connecting Statement:

Jesus continues his response to the Pharisees and Sadducees.

# When it is morning

The situation can be stated more clearly. AT: "If the sky is red in the morning" or "If the sky is red when the sun is rising" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# foul weather

"cloudy, stormy weather"

# red and overcast

"red and cloudy"

# You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky

"You know how to look at the sky and understand what kind of weather you will have"

# but you cannot interpret the signs of the times

"but you do not know how to look at what is happening right now and understand what it means"

# An evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign ... given to it

Jesus is speaking to his present generation. AT: "You are an evil and adulterous generation who demands signs from me ... given to you" See how you translated this in [Matthew 12:39](../12/38.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# An evil and adulterous generation

Here "adulterous" is a metaphor for people who are not faithful to God. See how you translated this in [Matthew 12:39](../12/38.md). AT: "An unfaithful generation" or "A godless generation" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# no sign will be given to it

Jesus would not give them a sign because, though he had already performed many miracles, they refused to believe him. This can be stated in active form. See how you translated this in [Matthew 12:39](../12/38.md). AT: "I will not give it a sign" or "God will not give you a sign" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# except the sign of Jonah

"except the same sign God gave to Jonah the prophet." See how you translated this in [Matthew 12:39](../12/38.md).
