# You of little faith

"You who have such little faith." Jesus addresses his disciples this way because their concern about not bringing bread shows they have little faith in Jesus to provide for them. See how you translated this in [Matthew 6:30](../06/30.md).

# why do you reason ... taken no bread?

Jesus uses a question to rebuke his disciples for not understanding what he just said. Alternate translation: "I am disappointed that you think it was because you forgot to bring bread that I talked about the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
