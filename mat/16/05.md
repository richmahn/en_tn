# Connecting Statement:

Here the scene shifts to a later time. Jesus uses an opportunity to warn his disciples about the Pharisees and Sadducees.

# the other side

You can make clear the understood information. AT: "the other side of the lake" or "the other side of the Sea of Galilee" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees

Here "yeast" is a metaphor that refers to evil ideas and wrong teaching. Translate as "yeast" here and do not explain its meaning in your translation. This meaning will be made clear in 16:12. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# reasoned among themselves

"discussed with each other"

# You of little faith

"You who have such little faith." Jesus is scolding the people because they have little faith in God. See how you translated this in [Matthew 6:30](../06/30.md).

# why do you reason ... taken no bread?

Jesus uses a question to rebuke his disciples for not understanding what he just said. AT: "I am disappointed that you think it was because you forgot to bring bread that I talked about the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
