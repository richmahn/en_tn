# I will give to you

Here "you" is singular and refers to Peter. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# the keys of the kingdom of heaven

Keys are objects that are used to lock or unlock doors. Here they represent authority. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the kingdom of heaven

This refers to God's rule as king. The phrase "kingdom of heaven" is used only in the book of Matthew. If possible, use "heaven" in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# Whatever you shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven

Here "bind" is a metaphor meaning to forbid something, and "loose" is a metaphor meaning to allow something. Also, "in heaven" is a metonym that represents God himself. Alternate translation: "God in heaven will approve whatever you forbid or allow on earth" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
