Jesus continues to tell his disciples the cost of following him.

## will not taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom ##

"will see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom before they die"

## will not taste death ##

"will not experience death" or" will not die"

## the Son of Man coming in his kingdom ##

"until they see me coming in my kingdom"  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
