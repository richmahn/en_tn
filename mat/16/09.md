* **Do you not yet perceive nor remember the five loaves for the five thousand and how many baskets you gathered up? Nor the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many baskets you took up?** - Jesus is scolding them. AT: "You should have understood and remembered the 5 loaves for the 5000 and how many baskets you gathered up! You should also have remembered the 7 loaves for the 4,000 and how many baskets you took up!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
