This begins an encounter between Jesus and the religious leaders.

## heaven...heaven ##

The Jewish leaders were asking for a sign from God (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]]), but Jesus told them to look at the sky they could see. Use the same word for both where God lives and the sky only if the readers will understand the different meanings.

## When it is evening ##

the time of day when the sun is setting

## fair weather ##

clear and calm, pleasant

## heaven is red ##

the sky is bright and clear with a red sunset.
