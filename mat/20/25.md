# Connecting Statement:

Jesus finishes teaching his disciples about authority and serving others.

# called them

"called the twelve disciples"

# the rulers of the Gentiles subjugate them

"the Gentile kings forcefully rule over their people"

# their important men

"the important men among the Gentiles"

# exercise authority over them

"have control over the people"

# the Son of Man ... his life

Jesus is speaking about himself in the third person. If necessary, you can translate this in the first person. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
