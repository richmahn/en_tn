# Connecting Statement:

Jesus continues telling a parable. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])

# Again he went out

"Again the landowner went out"

# the sixth hour and again the ninth hour

The sixth hour is around noon. The ninth hour is around three in the afternoon. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])

# did the same

This means the landowner went to the marketplace and hired workers.
