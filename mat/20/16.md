# So the last will be first, and the first last

Here "first" and "last" refer to people's status or importance. Jesus is contrasting people's status now with their status in the kingdom of heaven. See how you translated a similar statement in [Matthew 19:30](../19/30.md). AT: "So those who seem to be unimportant now will be the most important, and those who seem to be the most important now will be the least important" 

# So the last will be first

Here the parable has ended and Jesus is speaking. AT: "Then Jesus said, 'So the last will be first'"
