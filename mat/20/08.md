# Connecting Statement:

Jesus continues telling a parable. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])

# beginning from the last to the first

You can make clear the understood information. Alternate translation: "beginning with the workers who started working last, then the workers who started working earlier, and finally the workers who started working first" or "first paying the workers I hired last, then paying the workers I hired earlier in the day, and finally paying the workers I hired first"
