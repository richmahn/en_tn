# Connecting Statement:

Jesus concludes his parable about a landowner who hires workers. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])

# Do I not have the right to do as I want with what belongs to me?

The landowner uses a question to correct the workers who were complaining. AT: "I can do what I want with my own possessions." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Or are you envious because I am generous?

The landowner uses a question to rebuke the workers who were complaining. AT: "Do not be jealous when I am generous to other people." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# So the last will be first, and the first last

Here "first" and "last" refer to people's status or importance. Jesus is contrasting people's status now with their status in the kingdom of heaven. See how you translated a similar statement in [Matthew 19:30](../19/29.md). AT: "So those who seem to be unimportant now will be the most important, and those who seem to be the most important now will be the least important" 

# So the last will be first

Here the parable has ended and Jesus is speaking. AT: "Then Jesus said, 'So the last will be first'"
