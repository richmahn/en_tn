Jesus continues his parable about a landowner paying his workers.

## Is it not legitimate for me to do what I wish with my own possessions? ##

AT: "I can do what I want with my own possessions." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## legitimate ##

"lawful" or "fair" or "right"

## Or is your eye evil because I am good? ##

"You should not be unhappy because I do a good thing for people who have not earned it."
