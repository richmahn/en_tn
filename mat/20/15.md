# Or are you envious because I am generous?

The landowner uses a question to rebuke the workers who were complaining. AT: "Do not be jealous when I am generous to other people." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# So the last will be first, and the first last

Jesus is comparing this age to the next age. Those who are important now, God will consider them unimportant when he establishes his rule on earth. Those who seem unimportant now, God will consider them important when he establishes his rule. See how you translated a similar statement in [Matthew 19:30](../19/29.md).
