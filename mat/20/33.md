# that our eyes may be opened

The men speak of becoming able to see as if there eyes were to be opened. Because of Jesus' previous question, we understand that they were expressing their desire. AT: "we want you to open our eyes" or "we want to be able to see" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
