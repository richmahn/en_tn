# Connecting Statement:

Jesus foretells his death and resurrection a third time as he and his disciples travel to Jerusalem.

# going up to Jerusalem

Jerusalem was on top of a hill, so people had to travel up to get there.

# Son of Man ... him ... he

Jesus is referring to himself in the third person. If necessary, you can translate these in the first person. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
