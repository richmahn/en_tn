# As they went

This refers to the disciples and Jesus.

# followed him

"followed Jesus"

# There were two blind men sitting

This is sometimes translated as "Behold, there were two blind men sitting." The writer is alerting us to a new people in the story. Your language may have a way of doing this.

# When they heard

"When the two blind men heard"

# was passing by

"was walking by them"

# Son of David

Jesus was not David's literal son, so this may be translated as "Descendant of King David." However, "Son of David" is also a title for the Messiah, and the men were probably calling Jesus by this title.
