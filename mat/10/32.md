# Connecting Statement:

Jesus continues to instruct his disciples about the reasons why they should not be afraid of the persecution that they might experience.

# everyone who confesses me ... I will also confess before my Father

"whoever confesses me ... I will also confess before my Father" or "if anyone confesses me ... I will also confess him before my Father"

# confesses me before men

"tells others that he is my disciple" or "acknowledges before other people that he is loyal to me"

# I will also confess before my Father who is in heaven

You can make explicit the information that is understood. Alternate translation: "I will also acknowledge before my Father who is in heaven that that person belongs to me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# my Father who is in heaven

"my heavenly Father"

# Father

This is an important title for God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
