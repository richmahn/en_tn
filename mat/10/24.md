# Connecting Statement:

# A disciple is not greater than his teacher, nor a servant above his master

Jesus is using a proverb to teach his disciples a general truth. Jesus is emphasizing that the disciples should not expect people to treat them any better than the people treat Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-proverbs]])

# A disciple is not greater than his teacher

"A disciple is always less important than his teacher" or "A teacher is always more important than his disciple"

# nor a servant above his master

"and a servant is always less important than his master" or "and a master is always more important than his servant"
