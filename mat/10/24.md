## translationNotes

* Jesus continues to tell his apostles about the persecution they will endure as they work for him; this began in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:10:16]].
* **A disciple is not greater than his teacher** - This is a statement of general truth, not a statement about any particular disciple and teacher. A disciple "is not more important" than his teacher. This may be because he "does not know more" or "has no higher rank" or "is no better" than his teacher. Alternative translation: "A disciple is always less important than his teacher" or "A teacher is always more important than his disciple."
* **nor a servant above his master** - "and a servant is not above his master." This is a statement of general truth, not a statement about any particular master and slave. A servant is not "greater" or "more important" than his master. Alternative translation: "and a servant is always less important than his master" or "and a master is always more important than his servant."
* **servant** - "slave"
* **master** - "owner"
* **It is enough for the disciple that he should be like his teacher ** - "The disciple should be satisfied with being like his teacher."
* **be like his teacher ** - "know as much as his teacher knows" or "be the same as his teacher."
* **and the servant like his master** - "and the servant should be satisfied to be only as important as his master"
* **If they have called the master of the house Beelzebul, how much more them of his household ** - Jesus was being mistreated, so the disciples of Jesus should expect to be treated the same or worse (see UDB).
* **If they have called** - Alternative translation: "Since people have called."
* **the master of the house ** - Jesus is using "the master of the house" as a metaphor for himself. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **Beelzebul ** - This word from the original language can either be 1) transcribed directly as "Beelzebul" or 2) translated with its intended meaning of "Satan."
* **them of his household ** - Jesus is using "them of his household" as a metaphor for his disciples.
