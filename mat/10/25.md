# It is enough for the disciple that he should be like his teacher

"The disciple should be satisfied to become like his teacher"

# be like his teacher

If necessary, you can make explicit how the disciple becomes like the teacher. Alternate translation: "know as much as his teacher knows" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# the servant like his master

If necessary, you can make explicit how the servant becomes like the master. Alternate translation: "the servant should be satisfied to become only as important as his master" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# If they have called the master ... how much worse ... they call ... the members of his household

Again Jesus is emphasizing that since people have mistreated him, his disciples should expect people to treat them the same or worse.

# how much worse would be the names they call the members of his household

"the names that they call the members of his household will certainly be much worse" or "they will certainly call the members of his household much worse names"

# If they have called

"Since people have called"

# the master of the house

Jesus is using this as a metaphor for himself. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Beelzebul

This name can either be 1) transcribed directly as "Beelzebul" or 2) translated with its original, intended meaning of "Satan."

# his household

This is a metaphor for Jesus' disciples. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
