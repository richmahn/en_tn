## translationNotes

* Jesus continues to tell his apostles about the persecution they will endure as they work for him; this began in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:10:16]].
* **do not fear them** - The pronoun "them" refers to the people who mistreat followers of Jesus.
* **there is nothing concealed that will not be revealed, and nothing hidden that will not be known** - This parallelism can also be translated as "God will reveal the things that people hide." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]], [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
* **What I tell you in the darkness, say in the daylight, and what you hear softly in your ear, proclaim upon the housetops** - This parallelism can also be translated as "Tell people in the daylight what I tell you in the darkness, and proclaim upon the housetops what you hear softly in your ear."
* **What I tell you in the darkness** - "What I say to you secretly" (UDB) or "The things I am telling you privately" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **say in the daylight** - "say it openly" or "say it publicly" (see UDB) (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **what you hear softly in your ear** - "what I whisper to you."
* **proclaim upon the housetops** - "say it with a loud voice for all to hear." Housetops where Jesus lived were flat, and people far away would be able to hear anyone speaking with a loud voice.
