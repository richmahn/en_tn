# Connecting Statement:

Jesus continues to instruct his disciples about the persecution they will endure when they go out to preach.

# do not fear them

Here "them" refers to the people who mistreat followers of Jesus.

# there is nothing concealed that will not be revealed, and nothing hidden that will not be known

Both of these statements mean the same thing. Being concealed or hidden represents being kept secret, and being revealed represents being made known. Jesus is emphasizing that God will make all things known. This can be stated in active form. AT: "God will reveal the things that people hide" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
