Jesus continues to tell his apostles about the persecution they will endure as they work for him; this began in [Matthew 10:16](./16.md).

## do not fear them ##

The pronoun "them" refers to the people who mistreat followers of Jesus.

## there is nothing concealed that will not be revealed, and nothing hidden that will not be known ##

This parallelism can also be translated as "God will reveal the things that people hide." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]], [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## What I tell you in the darkness, say in the daylight, and what you hear softly in your ear, proclaim upon the housetops ##

This parallelism can also be translated as "Tell people in the daylight what I tell you in the darkness, and proclaim upon the housetops what you hear softly in your ear."

## What I tell you in the darkness ##

"What I say to you secretly" (UDB) or "The things I am telling you privately" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## say in the daylight ##

"say it openly" or "say it publicly" (see UDB) (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## what you hear softly in your ear ##

"what I whisper to you."

## proclaim upon the housetops ##

"say it with a loud voice for all to hear." Housetops where Jesus lived were flat, and people far away would be able to hear anyone speaking with a loud voice.
