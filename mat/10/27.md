# What I tell you in the darkness, say in the daylight, and what you hear softly in your ear, proclaim upon the housetops

Both of these statements mean the same thing. Jesus is emphasizing that the disciples should tell everyone what he tells the disciples in private. Alternate translation: "Tell people in the daylight what I tell you in the darkness, and proclaim upon the housetops what you hear softly in your ear" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# What I tell you in the darkness, say in the daylight

Here "darkness" is a metonym for "night" which is a metonym for "private." Here "daylight" is a metonym for "public." Alternate translation: "What I tell you privately at night, say in public in the day light" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# what you hear softly in your ear

This is a way of referring to whispering. Alternate translation: "what I whisper to you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# proclaim upon the housetops

Housetops where Jesus lived were flat, and people far away could hear anyone speaking with a loud voice. Here "housetops" refers to any place where all people can hear. Alternate translation: "speak loudly in a public place for all to hear" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
