This begins an account of Jesus' sending out his twelve apostles to do his work.

## called his twelve disciples together  ##

"summoned his twelve disciples"

## gave them authority ##

Be sure that the text clearly communicates that this authority was 1) to drive out unclean spirits and 2) to heal disease and sickness.

## drive them out  ##

"make the unclean spirits leave"

## all kinds of disease and all kinds of sickness  ##

"every disease and every sickness." The words "disease" and "sickness" are closely related but should be translated as two different words if possible. "Disease" is what causes a person to be sick. "Sickness" is the physical weakness or affliction that results from having a disease.
