# Connecting Statement:

This begins an account of Jesus sending out his twelve disciples to do his work.

# called his twelve disciples together

"summoned his 12 disciples" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])

# gave them authority

Be sure that the text clearly communicates that this authority was 1) to drive out unclean spirits and 2) to heal disease and sickness.

# to drive them out

"to make the unclean spirits leave"

# all kinds of disease and all kinds of sickness

"every disease and every sickness." The words "disease" and "sickness" are closely related but should be translated as two different words if possible. "Disease" is what causes a person to be sick. "Sickness" is the physical weakness or affliction that results from having a disease.
