# Connecting Statement:

Jesus continues to instruct his disciples about what they should do when they go to preach.

# you ... your

These are plural and refer to the twelve apostles. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# raise the dead,

"Raise" here is an idiom for "cause the dead to live again." AT: "cause the dead to live again" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# Freely you have received, freely give

There is information here that is not stated, but it is understood. AT: "I helped you and taught you God's truth for free. Therefore, you should not make other people pay for you to help them or to teach them God's truth" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# gold, silver, or copper

These are metals out of which coins were made. This list is a metonym for money, so if the metals are unknown in your area, translate the list as "money." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# purses

This means "belts" or "money belts," but it can refer to whatever might be used to carry money. A belt is a long strip of cloth or leather worn around the waist. It was often wide enough that it could be folded and used to carry money.

# traveling bag

This could either be any bag used to carry things on a journey, or a bag used by someone to collect food or money.

# an extra tunic

Use the same word you used for "tunic" in [Matthew 5:40](../05/40.md).

# laborer

"worker"

# his food

Here "food" refers to anything a person needs. AT: "what he needs" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
