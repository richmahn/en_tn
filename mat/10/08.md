# Connecting Statement:

Jesus continues to instruct his disciples about what they should do when they go to preach.

# you ... your

These are plural and refer to the twelve apostles. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# raise the dead

This is an idiom. Alternate translation: "cause the dead to live again" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# Freely you have received, freely give

Jesus did not state what the disciples had received or were to give. Some languages may require this information in the sentence. Here "freely" means that there was no payment. Alternate translation: "Freely you have received these things, freely give them to others" or "You received these things without paying, so give them to others without making them pay" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# Freely you have received, freely give

Here "received" is a metaphor that represents being made able to do things, and "give" is a metaphor that represents doing things for others. Alternate translation: "Freely you have received the ability to do these things, freely do them for others" or "Freely I have made you able to do these things, freely do them for others" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
