# as you go

Here "you" is plural and refers to the twelve apostles. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# The kingdom of heaven has come near

The phrase "kingdom of heaven" refers to God ruling as king. This phrase is only in the book of Matthew. If possible, use the word "heaven" in your translation. See how you translated this in [Matthew 3:2](../03/02.md). Alternate translation: "Our God in heaven will soon show himself to be king" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
