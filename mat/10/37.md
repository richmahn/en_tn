# Connecting Statement:

Jesus continues to instruct his disciples about the reasons why they should not be afraid of the persecution that they might experience.

# He who loves ... is not worthy

Here "he" means any person in general. AT: "Those who love ... are not worthy" or "If you love ... you are not worthy" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])

# loves

The word for "love" here refers to "brotherly love" or "love from a friend." AT: "cares for" or "is devoted to" or "is fond of"

# worthy of me

"deserve to belong to me" or "worthy to be my disciple"

# He who finds his life will lose it. But he who loses ... will find it

Jesus uses a proverb to teach his disciples. This should be translated with as few words as possible. AT: "Those who find their lives will lose them. But those who lose their lives ... will find them" or "If you find your life you will lose it. But if you lose your life ... you will find it"  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-proverbs]])
