## translationNotes

* Jesus continues to tell his apostles about the persecution they will endure as they work for him; this began in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:10:16]].
* **When they deliver you up ** - "When people deliver you up." The "people" here are the same "people" as in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:10:16]].
* **deliver you up** - Translate this the way you translated "deliver you up" in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:10:16]].
* **you** - The pronouns "you" and "your" throughout this passage refers to the twelve apostles.
* **do not be anxious ** - "do not worry"
* **how or what you will speak ** - "how you are to speak or what you are to say." The two ideas may be combined: "what you are to say." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hendiadys]])
* **in that hour** - "at that time" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
* **the Spirit of your Father** - If necessary, this can be translated "the Spirit of God your heavenly Father" or a footnote added to the text to make clear that this refers to God the Holy Spirit and not to the spirit of an earthly father.
* **in you ** - "through you"
