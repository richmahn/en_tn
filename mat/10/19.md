# Connecting Statement:

Jesus continues to instruct his disciples about the persecution they will endure when they go out to preach.

# When they deliver you up

"When people give you over to the councils." The "people" here are the same "people" as in [Matthew 10:17](./16.md).

# you ... your

These are plural and refer to the twelve apostles. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# do not be anxious

"do not worry"

# how or what you will speak

"how you are to speak or what you are to say." The two ideas may be combined: "what you are to say" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])

# for what to say will be given to you

This can be stated in active form. AT: "for the Holy Spirit will tell you what to say" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# in that hour

Here "hour" means "right then." AT: "right then" or "at that time" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# the Spirit of your Father

If necessary, this can be translated as "the Spirit of God your heavenly Father" or a footnote can be added to make it clear that this refers to God the Holy Spirit and not to the spirit of an earthly father.

# Father

This is an important title for God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])

# in you

"through you"
