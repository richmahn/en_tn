Jesus continues to tell his apostles about the persecution they will endure as they work for him; this began in [Matthew 10:16](./16.md).

## When they deliver you up  ##

"When people deliver you up." The "people" here are the same "people" as in [Matthew 10:16](./16.md).

## deliver you up ##

Translate this the way you translated "deliver you up" in [Matthew 10:16](./16.md).

## you ##

The pronouns "you" and "your" throughout this passage refers to the twelve apostles.

## do not be anxious  ##

"do not worry"

## how or what you will speak  ##

"how you are to speak or what you are to say." The two ideas may be combined: "what you are to say." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])

## in that hour ##

"at that time" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## the Spirit of your Father ##

If necessary, this can be translated "the Spirit of God your heavenly Father" or a footnote added to the text to make clear that this refers to God the Holy Spirit and not to the spirit of an earthly father.

## in you  ##

"through you"
