# Connecting Statement:

Jesus finishes instructing his disciples about what they should do and expect when they go to preach.

# Whoever gives

"Anyone who gives"

# one of these little ones

"one of these lowly ones" or "the least important of these." The phrase "one of these" here refers to one of Jesus' disciples.

# because he is a disciple

"because he is my disciple." Here "he" does not refer to the one giving but to the unimportant one.

# truly I say to you

"I tell you the truth." This phrase adds emphasis to what Jesus says next.

# he will ... his reward

Here "he" and "his" refer to the one who is giving.

# in no way lose

"God will not deny him." This has nothing to do with having a possession taken away. It can be stated in positive form. AT: "God will certainly give him"
