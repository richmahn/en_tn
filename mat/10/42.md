Jesus finishes explaining to his apostles that he will reward people who help them as they go.

## Whoever gives  ##

"Anyone who gives."

## one of these unimportant ones, even a cup of cold water to drink, because he is a disciple  ##

<b>one of these unimportant ones, even a cup of cold water to drink, because he is a disciple <b>- This can also be translated "one of these little ones a cup of cold water because he is a disciple of mine" or "one of the least of my disciples even a drink of cold water."

## he will in no way lose his reward ##

"that person will certainly receive his reward" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])

## lose ##

"be denied." This has nothing to do with having a possession taken away.
