## translationNotes

* Jesus finishes explaining to his apostles that he will reward people who help them as they go.
* **Whoever gives ** - "Anyone who gives."
* **one of these unimportant ones, even a cup of cold water to drink, because he is a disciple ** - This can also be translated "one of these little ones a cup of cold water because he is a disciple of mine" or "one of the least of my disciples even a drink of cold water."
* **he will in no way lose his reward** - "that person will certainly receive his reward" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
* **lose** - "be denied." This has nothing to do with having a possession taken away.
