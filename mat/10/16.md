# Connecting Statement:

Jesus continues to instruct his disciples. Here he begins to tell them about the persecution they will endure when they go out to preach.

# See, I send

The word "See" here adds emphasis to what follows. AT: "Look, I send" or "Listen,  send" or "Pay attention to what I am about to tell you. I send"

# I send you out

Jesus is sending them out for a particular purpose.

# as sheep in the midst of wolves

Sheep are defenseless animals that wolves often attack. Jesus is stating that people may harm the disciples. AT: "as sheep among people who are like dangerous wolves" or "as sheep among people who act the way dangerous animals act" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# be as wise as serpents and harmless as doves

Jesus is telling the disciples they must be cautious and harmless among the people. If comparing the disciples to serpents or doves is confusing, it might be better not to state the similes. AT: "act with understanding and caution, as well as with innocence and virtue" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
