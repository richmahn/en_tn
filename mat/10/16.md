Jesus begins to tell his twelve apostles about the persecution they will endure as they work for him.

## Behold ##

The word “behold” here adds emphasis to what follows. Alternative translation: “Look” or “Listen” or “Pay attention to what I am about to tell you” (see UDB).

## I send you out  ##

Jesus is sending them out for a particular purpose.

## as sheep in the midst of wolves  ##

Jesus compares the disciples he is sending out to defenseless animals going to where wild animals are likely to attack them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

## as sheep ##

defenseless (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

## in the midst of wolves ##

You can specify the simile as "among people who are like dangerous wolves" or "among people who act the way dangerous animals act," or state the point of similarity, "among people who will attack you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## be as wise as serpents and harmless as doves  ##

It might be better not to state the similes: "act with understanding and caution, as well as with innocence and virtue." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

## Be on your guard against people, for they will deliver you up ##

"Beware, because people will deliver you up."

## Be on your guard against ##

"Watch out for" or "Be alert for" or "Be very careful about" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

## deliver you up to ##

This is the word for what Judas did to Jesus (see UDB). Alternative translation: "betray you to" or "give you up to" or "have you arrested and tried by."

## councils  ##

The meaning here is local religious leaders or elders who together keep peace in the community. Alternative translation: "courts."

## whip you ##

"beat you with a whip"

## you will be brought ##

"they will bring you" or "they will drag you." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## for my sake ##

"because you belong to me" (UDB) or "because you follow me"

## to them and to the Gentiles ##

The pronoun "them" refers either to the "governors and kings" or to the Jewish accusers (10:17).
