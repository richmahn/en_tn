# Connecting Statement:

Jesus continues to instruct his disciples about what they should do when they go to preach.

# As for those who do not receive you or listen

"If no people in that house or city will receive you or listen"

# you ... your

This is plural and refers to the twelve apostles. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# listen to your words

Here "words" refers to what the disciples say. AT: "listen to your message" or "listen to what you have to say" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# city

You should translate this the same way you did in [Matthew 10:11](./11.md).

# shake off the dust from your feet

"shake the dust off your feet as you leave." This is a sign that God has rejected the people of that house or city. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])

# Truly I say to you

"I tell you the truth." This phrase adds emphasis to what Jesus says next.

# it shall be more tolerable

"the suffering shall be less"

# the land of Sodom and Gomorrah

This refers to the people who lived in Sodom and Gomorrah. AT: "the people who lived in the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# that city

This refers to the people in the city that does not receive the apostles or listen to their message. AT: "the people of the city that does not receive you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
