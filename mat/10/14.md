This continues the account of Jesus sending out his twelve apostles to do his work that began in [Matthew 10:1](./01.md).

## As for those who do not receive you or listen ##

"If no people in that town will receive you or listen"

## youâ€¦your  ##

the twelve apostles

## listen to your words  ##

"listen to your message" (UDB) or "listen to what you have to say"

## city ##

You should translate this the same way you did in [Matthew 10:11](./11.md).

## shake off the dust from your feet  ##

"shake the dust of that house or city off your feet." This is a sign that God had rejected the people of that house or city (see UDB).

## It shall be more tolerable ##

"The suffering shall be less"

## the land of Sodom and Gomorrah  ##

"the people who lived in the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah," whom God destroyed with fire sent from heaven (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## that city ##

the people in the city that does not receive the apostles or listen to their message (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
