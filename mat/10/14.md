# Connecting Statement:

Jesus continues to instruct his disciples about what they should do when they go to preach.

# As for those who do not receive you or listen

"If no people in that house or city will receive you or listen"

# you ... your

This is plural and refers to the twelve apostles. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# listen to your words

Here "words" refers to what the disciples say. Alternate translation: "listen to your message" or "listen to what you have to say" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# city

You should translate this the same way you did in [Matthew 10:11](../10/11.md).

# shake off the dust from your feet

"shake the dust off your feet as you leave." This is a sign that God has rejected the people of that house or city. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
