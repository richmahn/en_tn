# Are not two sparrows sold for a small coin?

Jesus states this proverb as a question to teach his disciples. Alternate translation: "Think about the sparrows. They have so little value that you can buy two of them for only one small coin." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-proverbs]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# sparrows

These are very small, seed-eating birds. Alternate translation: "small birds" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

# a small coin

This is often translated as the least valuable coin available in your country. It refers to a copper coin worth about one-sixteenth of a day's wage for a laborer. Alternate translation: "very little money"

# not one of them falls to the ground without your Father's knowledge

This can be stated in a positive form. Alternate translation: "your Father knows when even one sparrow dies and falls to the ground" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])

# Father

This is an important title for God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
