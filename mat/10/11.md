# Connecting Statement:

Jesus continues to instruct his disciples about what they should do when they go out to preach.

# Whatever city or village you enter

"Whenever you enter a city or village" or "When you go into any city or village"

# city ... village

"large village ... small village" or "large town ... small town." See how you translated this in [Matthew 9:35](../09/35.md).

# you

This is plural and refers to the twelve apostles. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# worthy

A "worthy" person is a person who is willing to welcome the disciples.

# stay there until you leave

The full meaning of the statement can be made explicit. Alternate translation: "stay in that person's house until you leave the town or village" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
