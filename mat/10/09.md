# your

This refers to the twelve apostles and so is plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# gold, silver, or copper

These are metals out of which coins were made. This list is a metonym for money, so if the metals are unknown in your area, translate the list as "money." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# purses

This means "belts" or "money belts," but it can refer to whatever might be used to carry money. A belt is a long strip of cloth or leather worn around the waist. It was often wide enough that it could be folded and used to carry money.
