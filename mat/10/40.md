Jesus begins to explain to his apostles that he will reward people who help them as they go.

## He who  ##

This can also be translated “Whoever” or “Anyone who” or “The one who” (see UDB).

## welcomes  ##

This is the same word as "receive" in [Matthew 10:14](./14.md) and means "receives as a guest."

## you ##

The pronoun "you" refers to the twelve apostles to whom Jesus is speaking.

## welcomes him who sent me ##

"welcomes God the Father who sent me"
