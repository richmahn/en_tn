# General Information:

Here Jesus also begins to give reasons why his disciples should not be afraid of the persecution they might experience.

# Connecting Statement:

Jesus continues to instruct his disciples about the persecution they will endure when they go to preach.

# Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but are unable to kill the soul

This is not distinguishing between people who cannot kill the soul and people who can kill the soul. No person can kill the soul. Alternate translation: "Do not be afraid of people. They can kill the body, but they cannot kill the soul" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish]])

# kill the body

This means to cause physical death. If these words are awkward, they can be translated as "kill you" or "kill other people."

# body

the part of a person that can be touched, as opposed to the soul or spirit

# kill the soul

This means to harm people after they have physically died.

# soul

the part of a person that cannot be touched and that lives on after the physical body dies

# fear him who is able

You can add "because" to clarify why people should fear God. Alternate translation: "fear God because he is able" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-connectingwords]])
