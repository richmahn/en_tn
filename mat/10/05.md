This continues the account of Jesus' sending out his twelve apostles to do his work.

## These twelve Jesus sent out ##

"Jesus sent out these twelve men" or "It was these twelve men whom Jesus sent out"

## sent out ##

Jesus sent them out for a particular purpose. "Sent out" is the verbal form of the noun "apostles" that is used in [Matthew 10:1](./01.md).

## he instructed them  ##

"he told them what they needed to do." This could be translated "he commanded them."

## lost sheep of the house of Israel ##

This is a metaphor comparing the entire nation of Israel to sheep who have strayed away from their shepherd (UDB). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## house of Israel ##

This expression refers to the nation of Israel. It may be translated as “people of Israel” or "descendants of Israel." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## And as you go  ##

The pronoun "you" refers to the twelve apostles.

## The kingdom of heaven has drawn near ##

You should translate this the same way you translated the same idea in [Matthew 3:1](../03/01.md).
