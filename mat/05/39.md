# But I say

Jesus agrees with God and his word, but he does not agree with the way the religious leaders have applied God's word. The "I" is emphatic. This indicates that what Jesus says is equally important to the original commands from God. Try to translate this phrase in a way that shows that emphasis.

# one who is evil

"an evil person" or "someone who harms you"

# strikes ... your right cheek

To strike the side of a man's face was an insult in Jesus' culture. As with the eye and the hand, the right cheek is the more important one, and striking that cheek was a terrible insult.

# strikes

hits with the back of an open hand

# turn to him the other also

"let him hit your other cheek also"
