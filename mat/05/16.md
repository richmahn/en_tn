# Let your light shine before people

This means a disciple of Jesus should live in such a way that others can learn about God's truth. AT: "Let your lives be like a light that shines before people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# your Father who is in heaven

It is best to translate "Father" with the same word your language would naturally use to refer to a human father.
