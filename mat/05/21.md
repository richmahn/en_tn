Jesus continues to teach his disciples. This event began in [Matthew 5:1](./01.md).
Jesus is talking to a group of people about what might happen to them as individuals. "You have heard" and "I say to you" are spoken to the group using plurals. "You will not kill" is singular, but you may need to translate it as plural.

## But I say ##

The "I" is emphatic. This indicates that what Jesus says is equally important to the original commands from God. Try to translate this phrase in a way that shows that emphasis.

## kill ... kills ##

This word refers to murder, not to all forms of killing.

## brother ##

This refers to a fellow believer, not to a literal brother or a neighbor.

## worthless person ... fool ##

These are insults for people who cannot think correctly. "Worthless person" is close to "brainless," where "fool" adds the idea of disobedience to God.

## council ##

This was likely a local council, not the main Sanhedrin in Jerusalem.
