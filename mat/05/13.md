# Connecting Statement:

Jesus begins to teach about how his disciples are like salt and light.

# You are the salt of the earth

Possible meanings are 1) just as salt makes food good, disciples of Jesus influence the people of the world so that they will be good. Alternate translation: "You are like salt for the people of the world" or 2) just as salt preserves food, disciples of Jesus keep people from becoming totally corrupt. Alternate translation: "As salt is for food, you are for the world" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# if the salt has lost its taste

Possible meanings are 1) "if the salt has lost its power to do things that salt does" or 2) "if the salt has lost its flavor." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# how can it be made salty again?

"how can it be made useful again?" Jesus uses a question to teach the disciples. Alternate translation: "there is no way for it to become useful again." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# except to be thrown out and trampled under people's feet

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "except for people to throw it out into the road and walk on it" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
