# the poor in spirit

This means someone who is humble. Alternate translation: "those who know they need God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# for theirs is the kingdom of heaven

Here "kingdom of heaven" refers to God's rule as king. This phrase is only in the book of Matthew. If possible, keep "heaven" in your translation. Alternate translation: "for God in heaven will be their king" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
