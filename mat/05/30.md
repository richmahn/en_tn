# If your right hand causes

In this metonymy, the hand stands for the actions of the whole person. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# right hand

This means the most important hand, as opposed to the left hand. You may need to translate "right" as "better" or "stronger." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# cut it off

This is an exaggerated command for a person to do whatever he needs to do to stop sinning. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
