"giving your gift" or "bringing your gift"

## and there remember ##

"and when you are standing at the altar and you remember"

## your brother has anything against you ##

"another person can recall some harm or damage caused by you"

## first be reconciled with your brother ##

"make peace with your brother before you offer your gift" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
