# Connecting Statement:

Jesus continues to teach about how he has come to fulfill the Old Testament law. Here he begins to speak about loving enemies.

# General Information:

Jesus is talking to a group of people about what might happen to them as individuals. Only "you will love ... and hate your enemy" are singular, but you may have to translate them as plurals. All other instances of "you," as well as the commands "love" and "pray," are plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# You have heard that it was said

Jesus agrees with God and his word. But, he does not agree with the way the religious leaders had applied God's word. This can be stated in active form. See how you translated this in [Matthew 5:33](./33.md). AT: "Your religious leaders have told you that God said" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# neighbor

The word "neighbor" here refers to members of the same community or people group whom one usually desires to or ought to treat kindly. It does not refer simply to people who live nearby. You may have to translate it as plural.

# But I say

The "I" is emphatic. This indicates that what Jesus says is equally important to the original commands from God. Try to translate this phrase in a way that shows that emphasis. See how you translated this in [Matthew 5:22](./21.md).

# you may be sons of your Father

It is best to translate "sons" with the same word your language would naturally use to refer to human sons or children.

# Father

This is an important title for God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
