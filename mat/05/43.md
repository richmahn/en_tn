## translationNotes

* Jesus continues to teach his disciples. This event began in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:05:01]].
* Jesus is talking to a group of people about what might happen to them as individuals. Only "you will love ... and hate your enemy" are singular, but you may have to translate them as plurals. All other instances of "you," as well as the commands "love" and "pray," are plural.
* **You have heard that it was said** - Translate this the way you translated it in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:05:33]].
* The word "neighbor" here refers to members of the same community or people group whom one usually desires to or ought to treat kindly. It does not refer simply to people who live nearby. You may have to translate it as plural.
* **But I say to you ** - Translate this the same way you translated it in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:05:31]].
* **you may be sons of your Father** - "you may have the character of your Father" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
