# Whoever

"Anyone who." The context implies that he is speaking about a Roman soldier. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# one mile

This is one thousand paces, which is the distance a Roman soldier could legally force someone to carry something for him. If "mile" is confusing, it can be translated as "one kilometer" or "a distance."

# with him

This refers to the one who compels you to go.

# go with him two

"go the mile he forces you to go, and then go another mile." If "mile" is confusing, you can translate it as "two kilometers" or "twice as far."
