## translationNotes

* Jesus continues to teach his disciples. This event began in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:05:01]].
* Jesus is talking to a group of people about what might happen to them as individuals. The instances of "you" in "will you swear" and "you cannot" are singular, but you may have to translate them as plurals. "Your" in "your speech" is plural.
* In [[:en:bible:notes:mat:05:33]] Jesus has told his hearers that God's throne, footstool, and earthly home are not theirs to swear by. Here he says that even their own heads are not theirs to swear by.
* **swear** - Translate this with the same word you used in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:05:33]].
* **let your speech be, 'Yes, yes,' or 'No, no.'** - "if you mean 'yes,' say 'yes,' and if you mean 'no,' say 'no.'"
