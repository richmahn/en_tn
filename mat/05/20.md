# For I say to you

This adds emphasis to what Jesus says next.

# you ... your ... you

These are plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# that unless your righteousness exceeds ... Pharisees, you will in no way enter

This can be stated in a positive form. Alternate translation: "that your righteousness must exceed ... Pharisees in order to enter" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
