# General Information:

Jesus is talking to a group of people about what they as individuals should and should not do. The "you" is plural in "you have heard" and "I say to you." The "you" in "whoever strikes you" and the understood "you" in "turn to him" are both singular, but in some languages they may need to be plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# Connecting Statement:

Jesus continues to teach about how he has come to fulfill the Old Testament law. Here he begins to speak about retaliating against an enemy.

# that it was said

This can be stated in active form. See how you translated this in [Matthew 5:27](./27.md). Alternate translation: "that God God said" or "that Moses said" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth

The law of Moses allowed a person to harm a person in the same way he had harmed him, but he could not harm him worse.
