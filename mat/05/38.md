## translationNotes

* Jesus continues to teach his disciples. This event began in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:05:01]].
* Jesus is talking to a group of people about what might happen to them as individuals.
* **You have heard that it was said** - Translate this the way you translated it in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:05:33]].
* **You have heard** - The "you" is singular..
* **eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth** - The people were allowed to do to others what was done to them, but only to the extent of the harm done.
* **But I say to you** - Translate this the same way you translated it in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:05:31]].
* **one who is evil** - "an evil person" or "someone who harms you" (UDB)
* **whoever strikes you on your right cheek, turn** - All of these are plural.
* **strikes ... your right cheek** - To strike the side of a man's was an insult in Jesus' culture. As with the eye and the hand ([[:en:bible:notes:mat:05:29]]), the "right" cheek is metaphorically the more important of the two, and striking that cheek was the worst possible insult. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]].)
* **strikes** - The verb specifies that the strike is made with the back of an open hand.
* **turn to him the other also** - "let him hit your other cheek also."
