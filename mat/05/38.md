Jesus continues to teach his disciples. This event began in [Matthew 5:1](./01.md).
Jesus is talking to a group of people about what might happen to them as individuals.

## You have heard that it was said ##

Translate this the way you translated it in [Matthew 5:33](./33.md).

## You have heard ##

The "you" is singular..

## eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth ##

The people were allowed to do to others what was done to them, but only to the extent of the harm done.

## But I say to you ##

Translate this the same way you translated it in [Matthew 5:31](./31.md).

## one who is evil ##

"an evil person" or "someone who harms you" (UDB)

## whoever strikes you on your right cheek, turn ##

All of these are plural.

## strikes ... your right cheek ##

To strike the side of a man's was an insult in Jesus' culture. As with the eye and the hand ([Matthew 5:29](./29.md)), the "right" cheek is metaphorically the more important of the two, and striking that cheek was the worst possible insult. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]].)

## strikes ##

The verb specifies that the strike is made with the back of an open hand.

## turn to him the other also ##

"let him hit your other cheek also."
