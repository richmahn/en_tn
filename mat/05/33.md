## translationNotes

* Jesus continues to teach his disciples. This event began in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:05:01]].
* Jesus is talking to a group of people about what might happen to them as individuals. The "you" in "you have heard" and "I say to you" are plural. The "you" in "you will not swear" and "you will carry" are singular.
* **you have heard that it was said** - "your religious leaders have said to you, 'God said to those in ancient times, "You will not swear."'" Jesus uses the passive here to make it plain that it is not God or God's word that he disagrees with. Rather, he is telling his hearers not to use what does not belong to them to try to make people believe their words.
* **it was said** - Translate this the way you did in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:05:31]].
* **swear … oaths** - This can mean 1) tell God and people that you will do what God requires you to do (see UDB) or 2) tell people that God knows that what you are saying about something you have seen is true.
* **But I say to you ** - <b>But I say to you <b>- Translate this the same way you translated it in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:05:31]].
* **swear not … by heaven … the throne of God … by the earth … the footstool for his feet … by Jerusalem … the city of the great King** - This metaphor from Isaiah [[:en:bible:notes:isa:66:01]] and Psalm [[:en:bible:notes:psa:148:001]] is of God as "the great King." Just as none of Jesus' hearers would think of treating an earthly king's beautiful throne, or even his lowly footstool or the city where he lives, as his own to make his own words strong, so they should not use heaven or earth or Jerusalem to back up their words. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]].)
* **swear not at all** - If your language has a plural form for commands, use it here. "You will not swear a false oath" (verse 33) allows the hearer to swear but forbids false oaths. "Swear not at all" here forbids all oaths.
* **swear not** - Translate this the same way you translated it in verse 33.
