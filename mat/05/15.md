Jesus continues to teach his disciples. This event began in [Matthew 5:1](./01.md).

## Neither do people light a lamp ##

"People do not light a lamp."

## lamp ##

This is a small bowl with a wick and olive oil for fuel. The important thing is that it gave light.

## put it under a basket ##

"place the lamp under a basket." This is saying it is foolish to create light only to hide it so people do not see the light of the lamp.
