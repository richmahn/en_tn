Jesus continues to teach his disciples. This event began in [Matthew 5:1](./01.md).

## the peacemakers ##

These are the people who help others to have peace with one another.

## sons of God ##

These are God's own children. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## those who have been persecuted ##

Alternative translation: "those people whom others treat unfairly."

## for righteousness' sake ##

"because they do what God wants them to do"

## theirs is the kingdom of heaven ##

"God allows them to live in the kingdom of heaven." They do not own the kingdom of heaven; rather, God gives them the right to live in his presence.
