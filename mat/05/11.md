Jesus continues to teach his disciples. This event began in [Matthew 5:1](./01.md).

## against you falsely for my sake ##

"when it is not true about you but because you follow me" or "without your doing anything to deserve it except believing in me"

## Rejoice and be very glad ##

"Rejoice" and "be very glad" mean almost the same thing. Jesus wanted his hearers not merely to rejoice but to do even more than rejoice if possible. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
