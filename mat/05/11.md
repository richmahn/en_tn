# Connecting Statement:

Jesus finishes describing the characteristics of people who are blessed.

# Blessed are you

The word "you" is plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# say all kinds of evil things against you falsely

"say all kinds of evil lies about you" or "say bad things about you that are not true"

# for my sake

"because you follow me" or because you believe in me"

# Rejoice and be very glad

"Rejoice" and "be very glad" mean almost the same thing. Jesus wanted his hearers not merely to rejoice but to do even more than rejoice if possible. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
