## translationNotes

* Jesus continues to teach his disciples. This event began in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:05:01]].
* **against you falsely for my sake** - "when it is not true about you but because you follow me" or "without your doing anything to deserve it except believing in me"
* **Rejoice and be very glad** - "Rejoice" and "be very glad" mean almost the same thing. Jesus wanted his hearers not merely to rejoice but to do even more than rejoice if possible. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hendiadys]])
