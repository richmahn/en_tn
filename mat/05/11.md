# Connecting Statement:

Jesus finishes describing the characteristics of people who are blessed.

# Blessed are you

The word "you" is plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# say all kinds of evil things against you falsely

"say all kinds of evil lies about you" or "say bad things about you that are not true"

# for my sake

"because you follow me" or because you believe in me"
