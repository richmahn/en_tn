# If your

Jesus is talking to a group of people about what they as individuals should or should not do. All instances of "you" and "your" are singular, but in some langugaes they may need to be plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# If your right eye causes you to stumble

Here "eye" refers to what a person sees. And, "stumble" is a metaphor for "sin." Alternate translation: "if what you see causes you to stumble" or "if you want to sin because of what you see" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# right eye

This means the most important eye, as opposed to the left eye. You may need to translate "right" as "better" or "stronger." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# pluck it out

This is an exaggerated command for a person to do whatever he needs to do to stop sinning. It means "forcefully remove it" or "destroy it." If the right eye is not specifically mentioned, you may need to translate this "destroy your eyes." If eyes have been mentioned, you may need to translate this "destroy them." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# throw it away from you

"get rid of it"

# one of your body parts should perish

"you should lose one part of your body"

# than that your whole body should be thrown into hell

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "than for God to throw your whole body into hell" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
