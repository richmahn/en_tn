# But I say

Jesus agrees with God and his word, but he does not agree with the way the religious leaders have applied God's word. The "I" is emphatic. This indicates that what Jesus says is equally important to the original commands from God. Try to translate this phrase in a way that shows that emphasis.

# brother

This refers to a fellow believer, not to a literal brother or a neighbor.

# worthless person ... fool

These are insults for people who cannot think correctly. "Worthless person" is close to "brainless," where "fool" adds the idea of disobedience to God.

# council

This was likely a local council, not the main Sanhedrin in Jerusalem.
