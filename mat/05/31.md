Jesus continues to teach his disciples. This event began in [Matthew 5:1](./01.md).

## It was ... said ##

God is the one who "said" (see UDB). Jesus uses the passive here to make it plain that it is not God or God's word that he disagrees with. Rather, he is saying that a divorce is just only if it occurs for the right reason. A divorce can be unjust even if the man obeys the command to give a written notice. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]].)

## sends his wife away ##

This is a euphemism for divorce. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])

## let him give ##

This is a command: "he must give."

## But I say to you ##

Jesus is indicating that he is about to say something different from what "was also said." The emphasis is on "I" because he is claiming that he is more important the one who "said."

## makes her an adulteress ##

It is the man who divorces the woman improperly who "causes her to commit adultery" (use the same words for "commit adultery that you used in [Matthew 5:27](./27.md)). In many cultures it would be normal for her to remarry, but if the divorce is improper, such a remarriage is adultery (see UDB).
