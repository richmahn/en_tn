# Connecting Statement:

Jesus continues to teach about how he has come to fulfill the Old Testament law. Here he begins to speak about divorce.

# It was also said

This can be stated in active form. AT: "God also said" or "Moses also said" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# sends his wife away

This is a euphemism for divorce. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])

# let him give

"he must give"

# But I say

Jesus agrees with God and his word, but he does not agree with the way the religious leaders have applied God's word. The "I" is emphatic. This indicates that what Jesus says is equally important to the original commands from God. Try to translate this phrase in a way that shows that emphasis. See how you translated this in [Matthew 5:22](./21.md).

# makes her an adulteress

It is the man who divorces the woman improperly who "causes her to commit adultery." In many cultures it would be normal for her to remarry, but if the divorce is improper, such a remarriage is adultery.

# her after she has been divorced

This can be stated in active form. AT: "her after her husband has divorced her" or "the divorced woman" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
