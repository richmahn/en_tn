# You are the light of the world

This means Jesus' followers bring the message of God's truth to all the people who do not know God. Alternate translation: "You are like a light for the people of the world" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# A city set on a hill cannot be hidden

At night when it is dark, people can see the city lights shining. This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "During the night, no one can hide the lights that shine from a city on a hill" or "Everyone sees the lights of a city on a hill" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
