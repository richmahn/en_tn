# General Information:

Jesus is talking to a group of people about what they as individuals should and should not do. The "you" is plural in "you have heard" and "I say to you." The understood "you" is singular in "Do not commit adultery," but in some languages it may need to be plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# Connecting Statement:

Jesus continues to teach about how he has come to fulfill the Old Testament law. Here he begins to speak about adultery and lust.

# that it was said

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "that God said" or "that Moses said" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# commit

This word means to act out or do something.
