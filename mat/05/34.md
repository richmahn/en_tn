# But I say

Jesus agrees with God and his word, but he does not agree with the way the religious leaders have applied God's word. The "I" is emphatic. This indicates that what Jesus says is equally important to the original commands from God. Try to translate this phrase in a way that shows that emphasis. See how you translated this in [Matthew 5:22](../05/22.md).

# swear not at all

"Do not swear at all" or "Do not swear by anything"

# it is the throne of God

Because God reigns from heaven, Jesus speaks of heaven as if it were a throne. Alternate translation: "it is from here that God rules" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
