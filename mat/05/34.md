# But I say

Jesus agrees with God and his word, but he does not agree with the way the religious leaders have applied God's word. The "I" is emphatic. This indicates that what Jesus says is equally important to the original commands from God. Try to translate this phrase in a way that shows that emphasis. See how you translated this in [Matthew 5:22](./22.md).

# swear not at all ... city of the great King

Here Jesus means that when people make a promise or when they say that something is true, they must not swear by anything. Some people were teaching that if a person swears by God that he will do something, then he must do it, but if he swears by something else, such as by heaven or earth, then it is less offensive if he does not do what he swore to do. Jesus says that swearing by heaven or earth or Jerusalem is just as serious as swearing by God because those things all belong to God.

# swear not at all

"Do not swear at all" or "Do not swear by anything"

# it is the throne of God

Because God reigns from heaven, Jesus speaks of heaven as if it were a throne. AT: "it is from here that God rules" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
