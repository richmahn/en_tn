# Every tree that does not produce good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire

Jesus continues to use fruit trees as a metaphor to refer to false prophets. Here, he only states what will happen to the bad trees. It is implied that the same thing will happen to the false prophets. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# is cut down and thrown into the fire

This can be stated in active form. AT: "people cut down and burn" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
