# stone ... fish ... snake

These nouns should be translated literally.

# Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a snake?

Jesus asks another question to teach the people. It is understood that Jesus is still referring to a man and his son. Alternate translation: "And there is not one person among you, if his son asks for a fish, will give him a snake."
