## translationNotes

* Jesus continues to teach his disciples. This event began in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:05:01]].
* Jesus is talking to a group of people about what might happen to them as individuals. All instances of “you” and “your” are plural.
* **ask ... seek ... knock** - These are three metaphors for persistent prayer. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]].) If your language has a form for continuing to do things over time (see UDB), use it here.
* **ask** - request things from God (see UDB)
* **seek** - "expect" (UDB) or "search for"
* **knock** - To <b>knock</b> on a door was a polite way to request that the person inside the house or room open the door. If knocking on a door is impolite, use the word that describes how people politely ask for doors to be opened or translate it "tell God you want him to open the door."
* **Or .... Or** - Jesus is about to say what he has just said in different words. These may be omitted (UDB).
* **what man among you is there** - This rhetorical question means "none of you would." (See: UDB, [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **a loaf of bread ... stone ... fish ... snake** - These should be translated literally.
* **a loaf of bread** - "some food"
