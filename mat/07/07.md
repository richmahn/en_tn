# General Information:

Jesus is talking to a group of people about what they as individuals should or should not do. The instances of "you" and "your" are all plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# Ask ... Seek ... Knock

These are metaphors for praying to God. The verb form shows that we are to keep praying until he answers. If your language has a form for continuing to do something over and over, use it here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Ask

request things from someone, in this case God

# it will be given to you

This can be stated in active form. AT: "God will give you what you need" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# Seek

look for someone, in this case God

# Knock

To knock on a door was a polite way to request that the person inside the house or room open the door. If knocking on a door is impolite or not done in your culture, use the word that describes how people politely ask for doors to be opened. AT: "Tell God you want him to open the door"

# it will be opened to you

This can be stated in active form. AT: "God will open it for you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
