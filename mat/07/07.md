Jesus continues to teach his disciples. This event began in [Matthew 5:1](../05/01.md).
Jesus is talking to a group of people about what might happen to them as individuals. All instances of “you” and “your” are plural.

## ask ... seek ... knock ##

These are three metaphors for persistent prayer. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]].) If your language has a form for continuing to do things over time (see UDB), use it here.

## ask ##

request things from God (see UDB)

## seek ##

"expect" (UDB) or "search for"

## knock ##

To <b>knock</b> on a door was a polite way to request that the person inside the house or room open the door. If knocking on a door is impolite, use the word that describes how people politely ask for doors to be opened or translate it "tell God you want him to open the door."

## Or .... Or ##

Jesus is about to say what he has just said in different words. These may be omitted (UDB).

## what man among you is there ##

This rhetorical question means "none of you would." (See: UDB, [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## a loaf of bread ... stone ... fish ... snake ##

These should be translated literally.

## a loaf of bread ##

"some food"
