# whatever things you want people to do to you

"whatever way you want others to act toward you"

# for this is the law and the prophets

Here "law" and "prophets" refer to what Moses and the prophets wrote. Alternate translation: "for this is what Moses and the prophets teach in the scriptures" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
