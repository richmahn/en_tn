## translationNotes

* Jesus continues to teach his disciples. This event began in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:05:01]].
* **whoever does the will of my Father** - "whoever does what my Father desires"
* **we** - This does not include Jesus. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]])
* **in that day** - Jesus said only "that day" because he knew that his hearers would understand that he was referring to the day of judgment. You should include this fact (as in the UDB) only if your readers would not understand that Jesus' hearers knew which day Jesus was talking about.
