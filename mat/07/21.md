# will enter into the kingdom of heaven

Here "kingdom of heaven" refers to God's rule as king. The phrase "kingdom of heaven" is used only in the book of Matthew. If possible, keep "heaven" in your translation. Alternate translation: "will live with God in heaven when he shows himself to be king" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# those who do the will of my Father who is in heaven
