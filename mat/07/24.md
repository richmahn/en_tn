Jesus continues to teach his disciples. This event began in [Matthew 5:1](../05/01.md).

## Therefore ##

"For that reason"

## like a wise man who built his house upon a rock ##

Jesus compares those who obey his words to a person who builds his house where nothing can harm it. Note that though the rain, wind, and high water reach the house, it does not fall down. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

## rock ##

This is the bedrock below the topsoil and clay, not a large stone or boulder above the ground.
