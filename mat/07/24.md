# Therefore

"For that reason"

# my words

Here "words" refers to what Jesus says. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# like a wise man who built his house upon a rock

Jesus compares those who obey his words to a person who builds his house where nothing can harm it. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# rock

This is the bedrock below the topsoil and clay, not a large stone or boulder above the ground.

# it was built

This can be stated in active form. AT: "he built it" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
