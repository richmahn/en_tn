## translationNotes

* Jesus continues to teach his disciples. This event began in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:05:01]].
* **like a foolish man who built his house upon the sand** - Jesus continues the simile that he began in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:07:24]]. He compares those who do not obey his words to foolish house builders. Only a fool would build a house on a sandy place where rain, floods, and wind can sweep the sand away. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
* **fell** - Use the general word that describes what happens when a house falls down.
* **and great was its fall** - The rain, floods, and wind completely destroyed the house.
