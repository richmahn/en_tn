# Connecting Statement:

This is the end of Jesus' Sermon on the Mount, which began in [Matthew 5:3](../05/01.md).

# like a foolish man who built his house upon the sand

Jesus continues the simile from the previous verse. He compares those who do not obey his words to foolish house-builders. Only a fool would build a house on a sandy place where rain, floods, and wind can sweep the sand away. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
