# Every tree that does not produce good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire

Jesus continues to use fruit trees as a metaphor to refer to false prophets. Here, he only states what will happen to the bad trees. It is implied that the same thing will happen to the false prophets. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# is cut down and thrown into the fire

This can be stated in active form. AT: "a person will cut it down and burn it" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# you will recognize them by their fruits

The word "their" can refer to either the prophets or the trees. This metaphor implies that the fruit of trees and the deeds of prophets both reveal whether they are good or bad. If possible, translate this in a way so that it can refer to both trees and prophets. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
