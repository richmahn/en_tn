# General Information:

This image of walking through a wide gate to destruction or a narrow gate to life represents how people live and the results of how they live.
When you translate, use appropriate words for "wide" and "broad" that are as different as possible from "narrow" in order to emphasize the differences between the two sets of gates and ways.

# Enter through the narrow gate ... few who find it

This is an image of people traveling on a road and going through a gate into a kingdom. One kingdom is easy to enter; the other is hard to enter. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Enter through the narrow gate

You may need to move this to the end of verse 14: "Therefore, enter through the narrow gate."

# the gate ... the way

Possible meanings are 1) "the way" refers to the road that leads to the gate of a kingdom, or 2) the "the gate" and "the way" both refer to the entrance to the kingdom.

# to destruction ... to life

These abstract nouns can be translated with verbs. AT: "to the place where people die ... to the place where people live" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
