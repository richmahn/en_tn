## translationNotes

* Jesus continues to teach his disciples. This event began in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:05:01]].
* Jesus is talking to a group of people about what might happen to them as individuals. The instances of “you” and “your” are all plural.
* **dogs ... hogs ... trample ... turn and tear** - It is probably the hogs who would "trample" and the dogs who would "turn and tear" (see UDB).
* **dogs ... hogs** - These animals were considered dirty and God told the Israelites not to eat them. They are metaphors for wicked people who do not value holy things (see: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]). It would be best to translate these words literally.
* **pearls** - These are similar to round, valuable stones or beads. They are a metaphor for the knowledge of God (see UDB) or precious things in general.
