# General Information:

Jesus is talking to a group of people about what they as individuals should and should not do. The instances of "you" and the commands are plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# Connecting Statement:

Jesus continues to teach his disciples in his Sermon on the Mount, which began in [Matthew 5:3](../05/03.md).

# Do not judge

It is implied here that "judge" has the strong meaning of "condemn harshly" or "declare guilty." Alternate translation: "Do not condemn people harshly" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# you will not be judged

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "God will not condemn you harshly" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
