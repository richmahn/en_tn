Jesus continues to teach his disciples. This event began in [Matthew 5:1](../05/01.md).
Jesus is talking to a group of people about what might happen to them as individuals. The instances of “you” and “your” are all singular, but you may need to translate them as plurals.

## why do you look ... How can you say ##

Jesus is challenging them to look at their own faults or sins first. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## tiny piece of straw ... log ##

These are metaphors for a person's least important and most important faults. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## brother ##

This refers to a fellow believer, not to a literal brother or a neighbor.

## eye ##

This is a metaphor for life.

## tiny piece of straw ##

"speck" (UDB) or "splinter" or "bit of dust." Use a word for the smallest thing that commonly falls into people's eyes.

## log ##

The largest part of a tree that has been cut down, a piece of wood far too large to literally go into a person's eye. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
