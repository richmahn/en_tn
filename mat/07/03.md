## translationNotes

* Jesus continues to teach his disciples. This event began in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:05:01]].
* Jesus is talking to a group of people about what might happen to them as individuals. The instances of “you” and “your” are all singular, but you may need to translate them as plurals.
* **why do you look ... How can you say** - Jesus is challenging them to look at their own faults or sins first. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **tiny piece of straw ... log** - These are metaphors for a person's least important and most important faults. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **brother** - This refers to a fellow believer, not to a literal brother or a neighbor.
* **eye** - This is a metaphor for life.
* **tiny piece of straw** - "speck" (UDB) or "splinter" or "bit of dust." Use a word for the smallest thing that commonly falls into people's eyes.
* **log** - The largest part of a tree that has been cut down, a piece of wood far too large to literally go into a person's eye. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
