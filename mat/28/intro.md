# Matthew 28 General Notes #

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### "Make disciples" #####
The last two verses ([Matthew 28:19-20](./18.md)) are commonly known as the Great Commission because they contain a very important command that all Christians must obey. To "make disciples" is to go to people, to share the good news of Jesus with them, and to tell and show them how to live as Christians.

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### An angel of the Lord #####
Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John all wrote about angels in white clothing with the women at Jesus' tomb. Two of the authors called them men, but that is only because the angels looked human. Two of the authors wrote about two angels, but the other two authors wrote about only one of them. It is best to translate each of these passages as it appears in the ULB without trying to make the passages all say exactly the same thing. (See: [Matthew 28:1-2](../../mat/28/01.md), [Mark 16:5](../../mrk/16/05.md) and [Luke 24:4](../../luk/24/04.md) and [John 20:12](../../jhn/20/11.md))
