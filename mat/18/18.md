# Truly I say to you

"I tell you the truth." This adds emphasis to what Jesus says next.

# you

All occurrences of this word are plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# whatever things you bind on earth will be bound in heaven; and whatever you release on earth will be released in heaven

Here "bind" is a metaphor meaning to forbid something, and "release" is a metaphor meaning to allow something. Also, "in heaven" is a metonym that represents God himself. See how you translated similar phrases in [Matthew 16:19](../16/19.md). AT: "God in heaven will approve whatever you forbid or allow on earth" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# I say to you

This adds emphasis to what Jesus says next.
