# Truly I say to you

"I tell you the truth." This adds emphasis to what Jesus says next.

# unless you turn ... children, you will in no way enter

This can be stated in positive form. AT: "you must change ... children in order to enter" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])

# become like little children

Jesus uses a simile to teach the disciples that they should not be concerned with who is most important. They should be concerned with becoming humble like a child. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# enter the kingdom of heaven

The phrase "kingdom of heaven" refers to God's rule as king. This phrase is used only in the book of Matthew. If possible, keep "heaven" in your translation. AT: "enter God's kingdom" or "belong to our God in heaven when he establishes his rule on earth" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
