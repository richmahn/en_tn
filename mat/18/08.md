# If your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away from you

Jesus exaggerates here to emphasize that people must do anything necessary to remove from their lives what causes them to sin. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# your ... you

All occurrences of these words are singular. Jesus is speaking to all people in general. It may be more natural for your language to translate with a plural "you." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# into life

"into eternal life"

# than to be thrown into the eternal fire having two hands or two feet

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "than to have both hands and feet when God throws you into the eternal fire" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
