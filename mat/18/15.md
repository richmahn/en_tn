# Connecting Statement:

Jesus begins to teach his disciples about forgiveness and reconciliation.

# your brother

This refers to a fellow believer in God, not a physical brother.

# you will have gained your brother

"you will have made your relationship with your fellow believer good again"

# so that by the mouth of two or three witnesses every word might be verified

Here "mouth" and "word" refer to what a person says. This can be stated in active form. AT: "so that two or three witnesses may verify that what you say about your fellow believer is true" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# by the mouth of two or three witnesses every word might be verified

Jesus is referring to one of the laws that Moses gave the people. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
