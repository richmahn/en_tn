# Connecting Statement:

Jesus continues to use a little child to teach the disciples and warns against the terrible consequences of causing children to sin.

# to the world

Here "world" refers to people. AT: "to the people of the world" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# times of stumbling ... those times come ... the person through whom those times come

Here "stumbling" is a metaphor for sin. AT: "things that cause people to sin ... things come that cause people to sin ... any person who causes others to sin" (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor)

# If your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away from you

Jesus exaggerates here to emphasize that a person must do anything necessary to remove from their lives what causes them to sin. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# your ... you

All occurrences of these words are singular. Jesus is speaking to all people in general. It may be more natural for your language to translate with a plural "you." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# into life

"into eternal life"

# than to be thrown into the eternal fire having two hands or two feet

This can be stated in active form. AT: "than to have both hands and feet when God throws you into the eternal fire" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
