# Connecting Statement:

Jesus continues teaching the disciples that they need to be humble like a child if they want to be important in God's kingdom. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# is the greatest

"is the most important" or "will be the most important"

# in the kingdom of heaven

The phrase "kingdom of heaven" refers to God's rule as king. This phrase is used only in the book of Matthew. If possible, keep "heaven" in your translation. Alternate translation: "in God's kingdom" or "when our God in heaven establishes his rule on earth" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
