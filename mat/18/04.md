## whoever humbles himself like this little child ##

"whoever humbles himself in the same manner this little child is humble" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

## a great millstone should be hung about his neck, and that he should be sunk into the depths of the sea ##

"if they were to put a millstone around his neck and throw him into the deep sea" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## millstone ##

a large, heavy stone shaped like a circle used for grinding wheat grain into flour. AT: "a heavy stone."
