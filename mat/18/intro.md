# Matthew 18 General Notes #

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### What should you do if "your brother sins against you"? #####

In this chapter, Jesus teaches that it is important for his followers to end conflicts among themselves. He teaches that the local group of believers should be ready to help this to happen in a way that honors God. 

The church is also responsible for encouraging believers to repent if they sin. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/repent]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])
