# Matthew 18 General Notes

#### Special concepts in this chapter

##### What should Jesus' followers do when other followers sin against them?

Jesus taught that his followers must treat each other well and not be angry with each other. They should forgive anyone who is sorry for his sin, even if he has committed the same sin before. If he is not sorry for his sin, Jesus' followers should speak with him alone or in a small group. If he is still not sorry after that, then Jesus' followers can treat him as guilty.
