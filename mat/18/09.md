# If your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and throw it away from you

The command to destroy the eye, perhaps the most important part of the body, is probably an exaggeration for his hearers doing anything necessary to remove from their lives anything they consider important causes them to sin. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# causes you to stumble

Here "stumble" is a metaphor for sin. AT: "causes you to sin" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# your ... you

All occurrences of these words are singular. Jesus is speaking to all people in general. It may be more natural for your language to translate with a plural "you." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# into life

"into eternal life"

# than to be thrown into the eternal fire having both eyes

This can be stated in active form. AT: "than to have both eyes when God throws you into the eternal fire" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
