# You serpents, you offspring of vipers

Serpents are snakes, and vipers are poisonous snakes. They are dangerous and often symbols of evil. Alternate translation: "You are as evil as dangerous and poisonous snakes" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# offspring of vipers

Here "offspring" means "having the characteristic of." See how you translated a similar phrase in [Matthew 3:7](../03/07.md).

# how will you escape the judgment of hell?

Jesus uses this question as a rebuke. Alternate translation: "there is no way for you to escape the judgment of hell!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
