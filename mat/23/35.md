# upon you will come all the righteous blood that has been shed on the earth

The phrase "upon you will come" is an idiom that means to receive punishment. To shed blood is a metonym meaning to kill people, so "righteous blood that has been shed on the earth" represents righteous people who have been killed. AT: "God will punish you for the murders of all the righteous people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# from the blood ... to the blood

Here the word "blood" represents a person being killed. AT: "from the murder ... to the murder" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# Abel ... Zechariah

Abel was the first righteous victim of murder, and Zechariah, who was murdered by Jews in the temple, was probably thought to be the last. These two men represent all the righteous people who have been murdered. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])

# Zechariah

This Zechariah was not the father of John the Baptist.

# whom you killed

Jesus does not mean the people to whom he is speaking actually killed Zechariah. He means their ancestors did.
