# Woe to you ... hypocrites!

"How terrible it will be for you ... hypocrites!" See how you translated this in [Matthew 11:21](../11/21.md).

# mint and dill and cumin

These are various leaves and seeds people used to make food taste good. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

# you have left undone

"you have not obeyed"

# the weightier matters

"the more important matters"

# But these you ought to have done

"You ought to have obeyed these more important laws"

# and not to have left the other undone

This can be stated in positive form. Alternate translation: "while also obeying the less important laws" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
