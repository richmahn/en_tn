Jesus continues to speak against the religious leaders because of their hypocrisy.

## Woe to you ##

See how you translated this in [Matthew 23:13](./13.md).

## mint, dill, and cumin  ##

leaves and seeds used to make food taste good (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

## You blind guides ##

These people are not physically blind. Jesus is comparing spiritual blindness to physical blindness. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## you who strain out a gnat but swallow a camel ##

Being careful to follow the less important laws and ignoring the more important laws is as foolish as being careful not to swallow the smallest unclean animal but eating the meat of the largest unclean animal either purposely or unknowingly. AT: “you are as foolish as a person who strains out a gnat that falls into his drink but swallows a camel.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

## strain out a gnat ##

drink through cloth that will keep the gnat from going into the mouth

## gnat ##
