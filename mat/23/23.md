# Woe to you

"How terrible it will be for you!" See how you translated this in [Matthew 11:21](../11/20.md).

# mint and dill and cumin

These are various leaves and seeds people used to make food taste good. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

# you have left undone

"you have not obeyed"

# the weightier matters

"the more important matters"

# But these you ought to have done

"You ought to have obeyed these more important laws"

# and not to have left the other undone

This can be stated in positive form. AT: "while also obeying the less important laws" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])

# You blind guides

Jesus uses this metaphor to describe the Pharisees. Jesus means that the Pharisees do not understand God's commands or how to please him. Therefore, they cannot teach others how to please God. See how you translated this metaphor in [Matthew 15:14](../15/12.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# you who strain out a gnat but swallow a camel

Being careful to follow the less important laws and ignoring the more important laws is as foolish as being careful not to swallow the smallest unclean animal but eating the meat of the largest unclean animal. AT: "you are as foolish as a person who strains out a gnat that falls into his drink but swallows a camel" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# strain out a gnat

This means to pour a liquid through a cloth to remove a gnat from a drink.

# gnat

a small flying insect
