# blind guides ... blind fools

The Jewish leaders were spiritually blind. Although they thought of themselves as teachers, they were unable to understand God's truth. See how you translated "blind guides" in [Matthew 15:14](../15/14.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Which is greater, the gold or the temple that makes the gold holy?

Jesus uses this question to rebuke the Pharisees because they treated the gold as if it were more important than the temple. AT: "The temple that has dedicated the gold to God is more important than the gold!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# the temple that makes the gold holy

"the temple that makes the gold belong to God alone"
