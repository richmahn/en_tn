# blind guides ... blind fools

The Jewish leaders were spiritually blind. Although they thought of themselves as teachers, they were unable to understand God's truth. See how you translated "blind guides" in [Matthew 15:14](../15/12.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# by the temple, it is nothing

"by the temple does not have to keep his oath"

# is bound to his oath

"is tied to his oath." Being required to do what one has said he would do in an oath is spoken of as if he is tied to the oath. AT: "must do what he promised to do" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Which is greater, the gold or the temple that makes the gold holy?

Jesus uses this question to rebuke the Pharisees because they treated the gold as if it were more important than the temple. AT: "The temple that has dedicated the gold to God is more important than the gold!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# the temple that makes the gold holy

"the temple that makes the gold belong to God alone"
