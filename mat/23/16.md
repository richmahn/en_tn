# blind guides ... blind fools

The Jewish leaders were spiritually blind. Although they thought of themselves as teachers, they were unable to understand God's truth. See how you translated "blind guides" in [Matthew 15:14](../15/14.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# by the temple, it is nothing

"by the temple does not have to keep his oath"

# is bound to his oath

"is tied to his oath." The phrase "bound to his oath" is a metaphor for being required to do what one has said he would do in an oath. AT: "must do what he promised to do" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
