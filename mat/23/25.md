## translationNotes

* Jesus continues to speak against the religious leaders because of their hypocrisy.
* **Woe to you** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:mat:23:13]].
* **For you clean the outside of the cup and of the plate** - The "scribes" and "Pharisees" appear "pure on the outside" to others. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **inside they are full of extortion and excess** - "they take what belongs to others by force so they can have much more than they need"
* **You blind Pharisee** - The Pharisees do not understand the truth. They are not physically blind. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **clean first the inside of the cup and of the plate, so that the outside may become clean also** - If their hearts are right with God, then their lives will show that as well. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
