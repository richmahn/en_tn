# Woe to you

"How terrible it will be for you!" See how you translated this in [Matthew 11:21](../11/20.md).

# For you clean the outside of the cup and of the plate, but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence

This is a metaphor that means the scribes and Pharisees appear pure on the outside to others, but on the inside they are wicked. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# they are full of greed and self-indulgence

"they want what others have, and they act in the interest of the self"

# You blind Pharisee

The Pharisees were spiritually blind. Although they thought of themselves as teachers, they were unable to understand God's truth. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Clean first the inside of the cup and of the plate, so that the outside may become clean also

This is a metaphor that means that if they would become pure in their inner being, then the result is that they would be pure on the outside as well. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
