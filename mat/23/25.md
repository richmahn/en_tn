Jesus continues to speak against the religious leaders because of their hypocrisy.

## Woe to you ##

See how you translated this in [Matthew 23:13](./13.md).

## For you clean the outside of the cup and of the plate ##

The "scribes" and "Pharisees" appear "pure on the outside" to others. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## inside they are full of extortion and excess ##

"they take what belongs to others by force so they can have much more than they need"

## You blind Pharisee ##

The Pharisees do not understand the truth. They are not physically blind. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## clean first the inside of the cup and of the plate, so that the outside may become clean also ##

If their hearts are right with God, then their lives will show that as well. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
