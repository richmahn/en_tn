# Woe to you ... hypocrites!

"How terrible it will be for you ... hypocrites!" See how you translated this in [Matthew 11:21](../11/21.md).

# For you clean the outside of the cup and of the plate, but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence

This is a metaphor that means the scribes and Pharisees appear pure on the outside to others, but on the inside they are wicked. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# they are full of greed and self-indulgence

"they want what others have, and they act in the interest of the self"
