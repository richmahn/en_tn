Jesus begins to speak against the religious leaders because of their hypocrisy.

## you do not enter it  ##

"you do not allow God to rule over you"

## devour widows' houses ##

"steal everything from women who have no men to protect them"

## son of hell ##

"person who belongs in hell" or "person who should go to hell" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
