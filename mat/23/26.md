The Pharisees were spiritually blind. Although they thought of themselves as teachers, they were unable to understand God's truth. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Clean first the inside of the cup and of the plate, so that the outside may become clean also

This is a metaphor that means that if they would become pure in their inner being, then the result is that they would be pure on the outside as well. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
