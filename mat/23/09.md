# call no man on earth your father

Jesus is using hyperbole to tell his hearers that they must not allow even the most important people to be more important to them than God is. Alternate translation: "do not call any man on earth your father" or "do not say that any man on earth is your father" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]]) 

# you have only one Father

"Father" here is an important title for God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
