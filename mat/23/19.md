# blind people

The Jewish leaders were spiritually blind. Although they thought of themselves as teachers, they were unable to understand God's truth. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Which is greater, the gift or the altar that makes the gift holy?

Jesus uses this question to rebuke the Pharisees for treating the gift as if it were more important than the altar. AT: "The altar that makes the gift holy is greater than the gift!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# the altar that makes the gift holy

"the altar that makes the gift special to God"
