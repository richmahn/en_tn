# I say to you

This adds emphasis to what Jesus says next.

# Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord

Here "in the name" means "in the power" or "as a representative." See how you translated this in [Matthew 21:9](../21/09.md). Alternate translation: "He who comes in the power of the Lord is blessed" or "He who comes as the representative of the Lord will be blessed" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
