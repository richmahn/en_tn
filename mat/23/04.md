Jesus continues to warn his followers not to be like the religious leaders.

## they bind heavy burdens that are difficult to carry  ##

"They place on you many rules that are difficult to follow." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## they themselves will not move a finger ##

"they will not give the least amount of help" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## phylacteries ##
