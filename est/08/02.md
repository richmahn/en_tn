# signet ring

This ring had the king's name or mark on it. When he put a wax seal on important papers, he would press the mark onto the seal. If a paper had this mark on its seal, people would know that what was written on the paper was written with the king's authority and had to be obeyed. See how you translated this in [Esther 3:10](../03/10.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
