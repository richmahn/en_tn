# Memukan

Translate his name as in [Esther 1:14](./13.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# all the officials and all the people ... all the provinces ... all women

These are exaggerations to emphasize the damage that the queen's refusal caused. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# provinces

A "province" is a large area into which some countries are divided for the purposes of government. See how you translated this in [Esther 1:1](./01.md).

# There will be much contempt and anger

"They will be angry with their husbands and treat them with contempt"
