# A gallows fifty cubits tall

You may convert "fifty cubits" to a modern measure. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Esther 5:14](../05/14.md). Alternate translation: "A gallows twenty-three meters high" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bdistance]])
