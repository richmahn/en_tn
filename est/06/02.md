# Bigthana and Teresh

These are the names of two men. See how your translated their names in [Esther 2:21](../02/21.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# It was found recorded there

Here "found" is an metaphor for learning. Both "found" and "recorded" can be expressed in active form. Alternate translation: "They found that the writers had recorded there" or "They learned that the writers had written" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
