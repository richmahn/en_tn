# What was done to give honor

This can be expressed in active form. Alternate translation: "What did I do to give honor" or "What did we do to give honor" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# Nothing was done for him

This can be expressed in active form. However it may be good to find a way that does not give the impression that servants were accusing the king. Alternate translation: "No one did anything for Mordecai" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
