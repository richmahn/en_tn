# Bigthana and Teresh

These are the names of two men. See how your translated their names in [Esther 2:21](../02/19.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# It was found recorded there

Here "found" is an metaphor for learning. Both "found" and "recorded" can be expressed in active form. AT: "They found that the writers had recorded there" or "They learned that the writers had written" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# What was done to give honor

This can be expressed in active form. AT: "What did I do to give honor" or "What did we do to give honor" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# Nothing was done for him

This can be expressed in active form. However it may be good to find a way that does not give the impression that servants were accusing the king. AT: "No one did anything for Mordecai" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
