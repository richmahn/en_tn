The Book of Esther ends by explaining why the Jews started celebrating the festival of Purim. The name "Purim" comes from the word "pur." It means "lots" or "dice." Haman, the enemy of Jews, threw dice to determine when to attack and destroy the Jews. The Jews celebrated Purim to remember how God rescued the people from being destroyed.

## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts ##

#### What was the Persian Empire? ####

The Persian Empire consisted of many kingdoms and regions that King Cyrus the Great conquered and ruled over. When he conquered Babylonia in 539 B.C., he came into control of the Jews whom the Babylonians had exiled. 

#### Why were there Jews in Babylonia when the Persians conquered it? ####

The people of Judah had been conquered and taken into exile by the Babylonians in 586 B.C. These Jews and their descendants were still in Babylon when the Persians conquered it. 

#### What was meant by "the laws of the Medes and Persians"? ####

The phrase "the laws of the Medes and Persians" is found in Esther 1:19 and Daniel 6:12. It referred to laws and decrees that could not be changed or removed once they were issued.  In the book of Esther, the king made a decree that the people could attack the Jews. Later he regretted that decision but he was not able to reverse the decree. 

The term "Medes" refers to an ethnic group who had formed their own nation, but who were taken over by the Persians.

## Part 3: Important Translation Issues ##

#### What different levels of language are in the Book of Esther? ####

The Book of Esther presents people talking to each other in many different situations. There is the polite and stately language of the Persian court and the language of royal decrees. There is also the language of friends and close relatives who are talking to each other. There is even the language that one uses in speaking to oneself. Translators should use all the ways provided by their own languages in order to represent these different kinds of situations in a way that their readers will identify and understand.
