# He had been taken away ... king of Babylonia carried away

This background information explains how Mordecai came to live in Susa. This can be stated in active form. AT: "Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylonia carried him and other exiles away along with Jehoiachin, king of Judah" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# He had been taken away from Jerusalem

The Hebrew text leaves unclear who is being spoken of here. It is perhaps Kish, who seems to have been the great-grandfather of Mordecai. If it was Mordecai himself, then he would be extremely old at the time of the events concerning Esther. Many modern versions leave this matter unclear. A few versions, including the UDB, choose to assume that it was Mordecai who had been taken away from Jerusalem.

# Jehoiachin, king of Judah
