Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers, or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 1:4-11, which is the poetic part of the quotation.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Farming imagery #####
Scripture frequently uses the imagery of farming in reference to spiritual matters. The statement "You have sown much seed, but bring in little harvest" indicates that they had done a lot but have very little to show for it.
