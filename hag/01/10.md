# the heavens withhold the dew from you

The dew that appears at night is spoken of as if it formed in the sky and fell like rain. The sky is spoken of as if it were a person who refused to give a present or a parent who refused to feed his child. Alternate translation: "the sky does not allow the dew to fall" or "no dew forms" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
