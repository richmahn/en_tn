Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers, or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 2:3-9, 21-23, which is the poetic part of the quotation.

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter ####

##### Unclean #####
Haggai uses an extended metaphor in this chapter related to ritual cleanliness. While the Jews were not unclean by nature as the Gentiles were, their actions made them unclean.
