# Haggai ... Zerubbabel

These are names of men. See how you translated this in [Haggai 1:1](../01/01.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# I will shake the heavens and the earth

The words "I will shake the earth" could be translated as "I will cause an earthquake." Yahweh speaks of the heavens as if they also were solid objects that he could shake. See how these ideas are translated in [Haggai 2:6](./06.md).(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# shake

Use the verb you usually use for pushing trees back and forth to get fruit or other objects to fall from them. See how you translated this in [Haggai 2:6](./06.md).

# the heavens and the earth

This is a merism for "the whole universe" or "everything that exists." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])

# I will ... destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the nations

You may need to make explicit that "the nations" are Israel's enemies. Alternate translation: "I will make it so the kingdoms of the nations that are Israel's enemies are no longer strong" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
