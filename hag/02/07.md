# I will ... shake the heavens ... the earth ... the sea ... the dry land ... every nation

The words "I will shake the earth" could be translated as "I will cause an earthquake," and that earthquake would shake "the sea" as well as "the dry land," a merism for the entire earth. Yahweh speaks of the heavens and every nation as if they also were solid objects that he could shake. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])

# I will fill this house with glory

Yahweh speaks of glory as if it were a solid or liquid that could be put into a container, the temple. Possible meanings are 1) the temple will become very beautiful. AT: "I will make this house very beautiful" or 2) the "precious things" that "every nation will bring" include much silver and gold and other forms of wealth. AT: "I will have people bring many beautiful things into this house" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
