# I will shake every nation

The metaphor that begins with the words "I will ... shake the heavens" in verse 6 ends here. Yahweh speaks of every nation as if they also were solid objects that he could shake. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])

# I will fill this house with glory

Yahweh speaks of glory as if it were a solid or liquid that could be put into a container, the temple. Possible meanings are 1) the temple will become very beautiful. Alternate translation: "I will make this house very beautiful" or 2) the "precious things" that "every nation will bring" include much silver and gold and other forms of wealth. Alternate translation: "I will have people bring many beautiful things into this house" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
