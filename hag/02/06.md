# I will ... shake the heavens ... the earth ... the sea ... the dry land ... every nation

The words "I will shake the earth" could be translated as "I will cause an earthquake," and that earthquake would shake "the sea" as well as "the dry land," a merism for the entire earth. Yahweh speaks of the heavens and every nation as if they also were solid objects that he could shake. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])

# shake

Use the verb you usually use for pushing trees back and forth to get fruit or other objects to fall from them.
