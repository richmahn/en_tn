#### What is the Book of Haggai about? ####

The purpose of Haggai was to encourage the returning exiles to construct a second temple in Jerusalem. His short prophetic ministry lasted only a few months, but his words of encouragement were so effective that the work was quickly completed. The people's disobedience was the reason for economic hardship and crop failures. Obedience to the law of Yahweh could solve these problems. Also, he accused the Levites of failing in their service to Yahweh. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]])

The Lord tells the people to "consider your ways" several times in this book. This is a call to a renewed relationship with Yahweh; it probably seeks a renewal of the covenant. The people responded positively to this command. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/covenant]])
