James continues his rebuke towards the Rich Jews who think they are believers but are not acting as true believers.

## Look ##

The word “look” here adds emphasis to what follows. This could be translated as "Think about this."

## the pay of the laborers…cries out ##

Here, "the pay" is referred to as a person who cries out. This could be translated as "the laborers…cry out." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

## the pay of the laborers...cries out! ##

Alternate translation: "you have not paid the laborer who harvested your fields and they cry out for their pay" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-order]])

## And the cries of the reapers have reached the ears of the Lord of Armies. ##

This can be translated as "And the Lord of Armies have heard the cries of the reapers" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

##  the ears of the Lord of Armies ##

James use the phrase "the ears" to refer to the Lord. This can be translated as "The Almighty Lord has heard the cries of the reapers." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

## You have lived in luxury on the earth and indulged yourselves ##

"You have more money and possessions than anyone could ever need."

## You have fattened your hearts for a day of slaughter ##

This compares the rich person's greed and desire for more things to a cow that eats until it is fat enough to be killed for food. This could be translated as: "Your greed has only prepared you for harsh eternal judgment." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## the righteous man ##

"the one who does what is right"

## does not resist you ##

"does not oppose you"
