# So confess your sins

Admit to other believers things you did wrong so that you can be forgiven.

# to one another

"to each other"

# so that you may be healed

This can be stated in active form. AT: "so that God may heal you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# The prayer of a righteous person is very strong in its working

Prayer is presented as if it were an object that was strong or powerful. AT: "When the person who obeys God prays, God will do great things" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
