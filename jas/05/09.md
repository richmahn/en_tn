# Do not complain, brothers ... you

James is writing to all the scattered Jewish believers.

# against one another

"about each other"

# you will be not judged

This can be stated in the active. AT: "Christ will not judge you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# See, the judge

"Pay attention, because what I am about to say is both true and important: the judge"

# the judge is standing at the door

James compares Jesus, the judge, to a person about to walk through a door to emphasize how soon Jesus will return to judge the world. AT: "the judge is coming soon" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
