# Do not complain, brothers ... you

James is writing to all the scattered Jewish believers.

# against one another

"about each other"

# you will be not judged

This can be stated in the active. AT: "Christ will not judge you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# See, the judge

"Pay attention, because what I am about to say is both true and important: the judge"

# the judge is standing at the door

James compares Jesus, the judge, to a person about to walk through a door to emphasize how soon Jesus will return to judge the world. AT: "the judge is coming soon" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the suffering and patience of the prophets, those who spoke in the name of the Lord

"how the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord suffered persecution with patience"

# spoke in the name of the Lord

"Name" here is a metonym for the person of the Lord. AT: "by the authority of the Lord" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonomy]]) "spoke for the Lord to the people"

# See, we regard

"Pay attention, because what I am about to say is both true and important: we regard"

# those who endured

"those who continued obeying God even through hardship"
