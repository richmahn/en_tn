## translationNotes

* **you who are rich -** - </b>  This is not the rich group of believers as in 1:10. Here, James is talking to rich people who do not honor God. This can be made explicit: "you who are rich and do not honor God." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
* **the miseries coming upon you** - When this is coming upon the rich people can be made explict: "the terrible things coming to you when God judges everyone."
* **Your riches have rotted and your clothes are moth-eaten. Your gold and your silver have become worthless** - James does not mean these riches and clothes are already ruined physically.  He is showing they have no spiritual value in the present and they will certainly only last for a little while. This could be translated as "all the things you thought were valuable and made you important are worthless and will only last for a little while."
* **and their corrosion will testify against you** - Here, "will testify against your" describes these ruined treasures as a person who goes before a judge and accuses a person of breaking the law.  This could be translated as "and when God judges you all of your ruined treasures will be like a person accusing you." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
* **and consume your flesh like fire** - Here, the ruined treasures are compared to a fire that destroys everything. Also, "fire" is a metaphor that refers to God's punishment. This could be translated as "and they will be the reason God punishes you." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]] and [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **hoarded your treasure** - "you have kept all these treasures to yourself and would not share with others"
* **in the last days** - This is a metonym that refers to the time right before God comes to judge all people. This could be translated as "when God is about to judge you" (UDB) (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
