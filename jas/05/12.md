# Above all, my brothers,

"This is important, may brothers:" or "Especially, my brothers,"

# my brothers

This refers to all believers including women. Alternate translation: "my fellow believers" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])

# do not swear

To "swear" is to say that you will do something, or that something is true, and to be held accountable by a higher authority. Alternate translation: "do not make an oath" or "do not make a vow"

# either by heaven or by the earth

The words "heaven" and "earth" refer to the spiritual or human authorities that are in heaven and earth. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# let your "Yes" mean "Yes" and your "No" mean "No,"

"do what you say you will do, or say that something is true, without making an oath"

# so you do not fall under judgment

Being condemned is spoken of as if one had fallen, crushed by the weight of something heavy. Alternate translation: "so God will not punish you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
