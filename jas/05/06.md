# You have condemned ... the righteous person

This is probably not "condemned" in the legal sense of a judge passing a sentence of death on a criminal. Instead, it probably refers to the wicked and powerful people who decide to mistreat the poor until they die.

# the righteous person. He does not

"the people who do what is right. They do not." Here "the righteous person" refers to righteous people in general and not to a specific person. AT: "righteous people. They do not" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])

# resist you

"oppose you"
