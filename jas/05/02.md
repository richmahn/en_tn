# Your riches have rotted, and your clothes have become moth-eaten.

Earthly riches do not last nor do they have any eternal value. James speaks of these events as if they had already happened. Alternate translation: "Your riches will rot, and your clothes will be eaten by moths." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture]])

# riches ... clothes

These things are mentioned as examples of things that are valuable to wealthy people.
