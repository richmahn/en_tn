#### Who wrote the Book of James? ####

The author identifies himself as James. This was probably James, the half-brother of Jesus. James was a leader in the early church and was part of the Jerusalem council. The Apostle Paul also called him a "pillar" of the church. 

This is not the same man as James the apostle. James the apostle was killed before this letter was written.

#### What is the Book of James about? ####

James said he was writing to the "twelve tribes in the dispersion" (1:1). Some scholars think that James was writing to Jewish Christians. Some scholars think that James was writing to all Christians in general. This letter is known as one of the "General Epistles" since it was not written to a specific church or individual.

The letter of James quickly shifts from one topic to another. There are strong pleas and warnings with many figures of speech taken from nature. James also writes a lot about how rich believers should treat poor people.

Also, many parts of this letter are similar to what Jesus wrote in the Sermon on the Mount (Mat 5-7). 

#### How should the title of this book be translated? ####

Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, "James." Or they may choose a clearer title, such as "A Letter from James" or "The Letter James Wrote." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts ##

#### Does James contradict Paul? ####

Paul taught in Romans that Christians are justified by faith and not by works. However, James seems to teach that Christians are justified by works. This can be confusing. But a better understanding of what Paul and James taught shows that they are not contradicting one another. Both of them believed that a person needs faith in order to be justified. And they both believed that true faith will cause a person to do good works. Paul and James taught about these things in different ways because they were speaking to different audiences who needed to know different things about justification.

## Part 3: Important Translation Issues ##

#### How should the translator signal transitions between topics in the Book of James? ####

The letter quickly changes topics. And sometimes James does not tell the readers that he is about to change topics. It is acceptable to allow the verses to appear disconnected from each other. It may make sense to set the passages apart by starting a new line or putting a space between topics. 

#### What are the major issues in the text of the Book of James? ####

The following are the most significant textual issues in the Book of James:

* "Do you want to know, foolish man, that faith without works is useless?" (2:20). The ULB, UDB, and modern versions have this reading. Some older versions have, "Do you want to know, foolish man, that faith without works is dead?"
