#### Who wrote the Book of James? ####

The author identifies himself as James. This was probably James, the half-brother of Jesus. James was a leader in the early church and was part of the Jerusalem council. The Apostle Paul also called him a "pillar" of the church. 

This is not the same man as James the apostle. James the apostle was killed before this letter was written.

#### What is the Book of James about? ####

James said he was writing to the "twelve tribes in the dispersion" (1:1). Some scholars think that James was writing to Jewish Christians. Some scholars think that James was writing to all Christians in general. This letter is known as one of the "General Epistles" since it was not written to a specific church or individual.

The letter of James quickly shifts from one topic to another. There are strong pleas and warnings with many figures of speech taken from nature. James also writes a lot about how rich believers should treat poor people.

Also, many parts of this letter are similar to what Jesus wrote in the Sermon on the Mount (Mat 5-7). 

#### How should the title of this book be translated? ####

Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, "James." Or they may choose a clearer title, such as "A Letter from James" or "The Letter James Wrote." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts ##

#### Does James contradict Paul? ####

Paul teaches in Romans that Christians are justified by faith and not by works. However, James seems to teach that Christians are justified by works. There is no contradiction. One possible solution to this issue involves understanding that the word "justification" is used in two different way. Paul teaches that Christians are declared righteous in reference to God while James teaches that man is declared to be righteous in relation to other people by his actions. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/justify]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/works]])

Another difficulty involves whether faith without works is "dead" or "useless." What James probably means is that, while good deeds cannot take the place of faith in Christ, faith in Christ always produces good deeds.

## Part 3: Important Translation Issues ##

#### How should the translator signal transitions between topics in the Book of James? ####

The letter quickly shifts from one topic to another. The transitions are rarely smooth. It is acceptable to allow the verses to appear disconnected from each other. It may make sense to set the passages apart by starting a new line or putting a space between topics. 

#### What are the major issues in the text of the Book of James? ####

The following are the most significant textual issues in the Book of James:

* "Do you want to know, foolish man, how it is that faith without works is useless?" (2:20). The ULB, UDB, and modern versions have this reading. Some older versions have, "Do you want to know, foolish man, how it is that faith without works is dead?"
