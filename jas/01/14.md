## translationNotes

* **Each person is tempted by his own evil desires** - The desires to do evil are inside each person.
* **which entice and drag him** - "which evil desires trap and lead him."
* **after sinful desires conceive, sin is born, and after sin is full grown it results in death. ** - "evil desires," "sin," and "death" are given human attributes. Here, "evil desires" are being described as a female lover who leads a man away to have sex. "Sin" is their baby. "Death" is when the baby becomes a full grown man. This also compares how evil desires give pleasure at first but that pleasure turns into sin in the person and eventually leads to both physical and spiritual death. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]] and [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **Do not be deceived** - "Do not let anyone deceive you" or "stop deceiving yourselves" (UDB)
