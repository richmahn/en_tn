# each person is tempted by his own desire

A person's desire is spoken of as if it were someone else who was tempting him to sin. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# which drags him away and entices him

Evil desire continues to be spoken of as if it were a person who could drag away someone else. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# entices

attracts, persuades someone to do evil

# Then after the desire conceives, it gives birth to sin, and after the sin is full grown, it gives birth to death

Desire continues to be spoken of as a person, this time clearly as a woman who becomes pregnant with a child. The child is identified as sin. Sin is another female baby that grows up, becomes pregnant, and gives birth to death. This chain of metaphors is a picture of someone who ends up dying both spiritually and physically because of his evil desires and his sin. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Do not be deceived

"Do not let anyone deceive you" or "Stop deceiving yourselves"
