# its beauty perishes

A flower no longer being beautiful is spoken of as if its beauty dies. AT: "and it is no longer beautiful" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the rich man will fade away in the middle of his journey

Here the flower simile is probably continued. As flowers do not die suddenly but instead fade away over a short time, so also the rich people may not die suddenly but instead take a little time to disappear. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# in the middle of his journey

A rich man's activities in daily life are spoken of as if they are a journey that he is making. This metaphor implies that he is giving no thought to his coming death, and that it will takes him by surprise. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
