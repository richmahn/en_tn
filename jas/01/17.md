# Every good gift and every perfect gift

These two phrases mean basically the same thing. James uses them to emphasize that anything good that a person has comes from God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# the Father of lights

God, the creator of all the lights in the sky (sun, moon, and stars), is said to be their "Father." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# With him there is no changing or shadow because of turning

This expression pictures God as an unchanging light, like the sun, moon, planets, and stars in the sky. This is in contrast to shadows here on earth that constantly change. Alternate translation: "God does not change. He is as as constant as the sun, moon, and stars in the sky, rather than like shadows which appear and disappear on earth" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
