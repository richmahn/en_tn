# the testing of your faith produces endurance

The expressions "the testing," "your faith," and "endurance" are nouns that stand for actions. God does the testing, that is, he finds out how much the believers trust and obey him. Believers ("you") believe in him and endure suffering. AT: "when you suffer hardships, God is finding out how much you trust him. As a result, you will become able to endure even more hardships" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
