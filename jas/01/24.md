# then goes away and immediately forgets what he was like

It is implied that though he may see that he needs to do something, such as wash his face or fix his hair, he walks away and forgets to do it. This what a person who does not obey God's word is like. Alternate translation: "then goes away and immediately forgets to do what he saw he needed to do" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]] and  [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
