# in faith, doubting nothing

This can be stated in the positive. Alternate translation: "with complete certainty that God will answer" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])

# For anyone who doubts is like a wave in the sea that is driven by the wind and tossed around

Anyone who doubts that God will help him is said to be like the water in the ocean or in a large lake, which keeps moving in different directions. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
