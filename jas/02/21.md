## Was not Abraham our patriarch justified ##

This rhetorical question is used to rebut the foolish man's arguments from James [James 2:18](./18.md) who refuses to believe that faith and works go together. You could translate it as "Abraham our patriarch was certainly justified."(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## You see that faith ##

the word "you" is singular referring to the hypothetical man. Yet James is addressing his whole audience through this one person.

## you see that faith ##

The word "see" is a metonym. It can be translated as "understand." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]]).

## by works his faith achieved its purpose ##

"his actions made his faith complete"

## The scripture was fulfilled ##

This is a passive which can be translated as "This fulfilled the scripture." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## it was credited to him as righteousness  ##

<b>it was credited to him as righteousness <b>- "God regarded his faith as righteousness."

## You see that by works ##

<b>You see that by works</b>  James is back to addressing his audience directly by using the plural form of "you".

## by works a man is justified ##

"actions and faith justify a person"
