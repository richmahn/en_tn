# General Information:

Since these are Jewish believers, they know the story of Abraham, about whom God had told them long ago in his word.

# Was not Abraham our father justified ... on the altar?

This rhetorical question is used to rebut the foolish man's arguments from [James 2:18](./18.md), who refuses to believe that faith and works go together. AT: "Abraham our father was certainly justified ... on the altar." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# justified by works

James speaks of works as if they were objects that one can own. AT: "justified by doing good deeds" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# father

Here "father" is used in the sense of "ancestor."
