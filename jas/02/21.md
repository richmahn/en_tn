## translationNotes

* **Was not Abraham our patriarch justified** - This rhetorical question is used to rebut the foolish man's arguments from James [[:en:bible:notes:jas:02:18]] who refuses to believe that faith and works go together. You could translate it as "Abraham our patriarch was certainly justified."(See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **You see that faith** - the word "you" is singular referring to the hypothetical man. Yet James is addressing his whole audience through this one person.
* **you see that faith** - The word "see" is a metonym. It can be translated as "understand." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]]).
* **by works his faith achieved its purpose** - "his actions made his faith complete"
* **The scripture was fulfilled** - This is a passive which can be translated as "This fulfilled the scripture." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
* **it was credited to him as righteousness ** - <b>it was credited to him as righteousness <b>- "God regarded his faith as righteousness."
* **You see that by works** - <b>You see that by works</b>  James is back to addressing his audience directly by using the plural form of "you".
* **by works a man is justified** - "actions and faith justify a person"
