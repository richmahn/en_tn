# You see

The word "you" is singular, referring to the hypothetical man. James is addressing his whole audience as if they were one person.

# You see

The word "see" is a metonym. AT: "You understand" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# faith worked with his works, and that by works his faith was fully developed

James speaks as if "faith" and "works" are things that can work together and help each other. AT: "because Abraham believed God, he did what God commanded. And because Abraham did what God commanded, he believed God completely"

# You see

James again addresses his audience directly by using the plural form of "you."
