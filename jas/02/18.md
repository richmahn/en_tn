## translationNotes

* **Yet someone will say** - James describes a hypothetical situation where someone objects to his teaching in 2:14-17. James names this person "foolish man" in verse 20. The purpose of this hypothetical discussion is to correct his audience's understanding of faith and works. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
* **"You have faith, and I have works.** - James is describing a likely objection someone may have to his teaching. AT: "it is acceptable if one person has faith and another person does good deeds."
* **Show me your faith** - the word "me" refers to James
* **the demons also...tremble ** - "shake with fear"
* **Do you even want to know, O foolish man, that faith without works is useless?** - This is a rhetorical question used to scold the person who will not listen to James. AT: "You fool! You do not even want to listen to me prove that faith without works is useless." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
