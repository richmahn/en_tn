## Yet someone will say ##

James describes a hypothetical situation where someone objects to his teaching in 2:14-17. James names this person "foolish man" in verse 20. The purpose of this hypothetical discussion is to correct his audience's understanding of faith and works. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])

## "You have faith, and I have works. ##

James is describing a likely objection someone may have to his teaching. It can be translated as "it is acceptable if one person has faith and another person does good deeds."

## Show me your faith ##

the word "me" refers to James

## the demons also...tremble  ##

<b>the demons also...tremble <b>- "shake with fear"

## Do you even want to know, O foolish man, that faith without works is useless? ##

<b>Do you even want to know, O foolish man, that faith without works is useless?</b>  This is a rhetorical question used to scold the person who will not listen to James. You could translate it as "You fool! You do not even want to listen to me prove that faith without works is useless." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
