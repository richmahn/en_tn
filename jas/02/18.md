# Yet someone may say

James describes a hypothetical situation where someone objects to his teaching. James seeks to correct his audience's understanding of faith and works. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])

# "You have faith, and I have works." Show me your faith without works, and I will show you my faith by my works

James is describing how someone may argue against his teaching and how he would respond. This can be restated to remove the abstract nouns "faith" and "works." AT: "'It is acceptable that you believe God and that I do what God commands.' Prove to me that you can believe God and not do what he commands, and I will prove to you that I believe God by doing what he commands" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
