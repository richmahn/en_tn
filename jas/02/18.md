# Yet someone may say

James describes a hypothetical situation where someone objects to his teaching. James seeks to correct his audience's understanding of faith and works. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])

# "You have faith, and I have works." Show me your faith without works, and I will show you my faith by my works

James is describing how someone may argue against his teaching and how he would respond. This can be restated to remove the abstract nouns "faith" and "works." AT: "'It is acceptable that you believe God and that I do what God commands.' Prove to me that you can believe God and not do what he commands, and I will prove to you that I believe God by doing what he commands" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# the demons believe that, and they tremble

"the demons also believe, but they shake with fear." James contrasts the demons with those who claim to believe and not do good deeds. James states that the demons are wiser because they fear God while the others do not.

# Do you want to know, foolish man, that faith without works is useless?

James uses this question to introduce the next part of his teaching. AT: "Listen to me, foolish man, and I will show that faith without works is useless." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# that faith without works is useless

This can be restated to remove the abstract nouns "faith" and "works." AT: "that if you do not do what God commands, then it is useless for you to say that you believe in God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
