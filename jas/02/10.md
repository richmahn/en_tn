# For whoever obeys

"For anyone who obeys"

# except that he stumbles ... the whole law

Stumbling is falling down while one is trying to walk. Disobeying one point of the law is spoken of as if it were stumbling while walking. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# in just a single way

because of disobedience to just one requirement of the law

# For the one who said

This refers to God, who gave the law to Moses.

# Do not commit

To "commit" is to do an action.

# If you ... but if you ... you have

Here "you" means "each one of you." Although James was writing to many Jewish believers, in this case, he used the singular form as if he was writing to each person individually. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
