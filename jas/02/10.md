# For whoever obeys

"For anyone who obeys"

# except that he stumbles ... the whole law

Stumbling is falling down while one is trying to walk. Disobeying one point of the law is spoken of as if it were stumbling while walking. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# in just a single way

because of disobedience to just one requirement of the law
