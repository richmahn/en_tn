# you fulfill

The word "you" refers to the Jewish believers. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# fulfill the royal law

"obey God's law." The law is "royal" becuase God, the true king, is the one who gave it to people.

# You shall love your neighbor as yourself

James is quoting from the book of Leviticus.

# your neighbor

"all people" or "everyone"

# you do well

"you are doing well" or "you are doing what is right"
