# In the same way also ... justified by works

James says that what was true of Abraham was also true of Rahab. Both were justified by works.

# was not Rahab the prostitute justified by works ... another road?

James is using this rhetorical question to instruct his audience. AT: "it was what Rahab the prostitute did that justified her ... another road." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# Rahab the prostitute

James expected his audience to know the Old Testament story about the woman Rahab.

# justified by works

James speaks of works as something to possess. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# messengers

people who bring news from another place

# sent them away by another road

"then helped them escape and leave the city"

# For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, even so faith apart from works is dead

James is speaking of faith without works as if it were a dead body without the spirit. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
