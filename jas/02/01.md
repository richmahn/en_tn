# Connecting Statement:

James continues to tell the scattered Jewish believers how to live by loving one another and reminds them not to favor rich people over poor brothers.

# My brothers

James considers his audience to be Jewish believers. Alternate translation: "My fellow believers" or "My brothers and sisters in Christ"

# hold to faith in our Lord Jesus Christ

Believing in Jesus Christ is spoken of as if it were an object that one could hold onto. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# our Lord Jesus Christ

The word "our" includes James and his fellow believers. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-inclusive]])

# favoritism toward certain people

the desire to help some people more than others
