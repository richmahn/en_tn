# Do you want to know, foolish man, that faith without works is useless?

James uses this question to introduce the next part of his teaching. Alternate translation: "Listen to me, foolish man, and I will show that faith without works is useless." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# that faith without works is useless

This can be restated to remove the abstract nouns "faith" and "works." Alternate translation: "that if you do not do what God commands, then it is useless for you to say that you believe in God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
