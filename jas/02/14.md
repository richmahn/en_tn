# Connecting Statement:

James encourages the scattered believers to show their faith before others, just as Abraham showed others his faith by his works.

# What good is it, my brothers, if someone says he has faith, but he has no works?

James is using a rhetorical question to teach his audience. Alternate translation: "It is no good at all, fellow believers, if someone says he has faith, but he has no works." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# if someone says he has faith, but he has no works

The can be restated to remove the abstract nouns "faith" and "works." Alternate translation: "if someone says he believes in God but he does not do what God commands" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# Can that faith save him?

James is using a rhetorical question to teach his audience. This can be restated to remove the abstract noun "faith." Alternate translation: "That faith cannot save him." or "If a person does not do what God commands, then just saying he believes in God will not save him." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# save him

"spare him from God's judgment"
