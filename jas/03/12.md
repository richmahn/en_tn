# Does a fig tree, my brothers, make olives?

James uses another rhetorical question to remind the believers about what happens in nature. Alternate translation: "Brothers, you know that a fig tree cannot grow olives." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# my brothers

"my fellow believers"

# Or a grapevine, figs?

The word "make" is understood from the previous phrase. James uses another rhetorical question to remind the believers about what happens in nature. Alternate translation: "Or does a grapevine make figs?" or "And a grapevine cannot grow figs." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
