# Notice also that ships ... are steered by a very small rudder

A ship is like a truck that floats on water. A rudder is a flat piece of wood or metal at the back of the ship, used to control where it goes. The word "rudder" could also be translated as "tool."

# are driven by strong winds,

This can be stated in active form. AT: "strong winds push them, they" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# are steered by a very small rudder to wherever the pilot desires

"have a small tool that a person can use to control where the ship goes"
