# For where there are jealousy and ambition, there is confusion and every evil practice

This can be restated to remove the abstract nouns "jealousy," "ambition," and "confusion." Alternate translation: "For when people are jealous and selfish, this causes them to act in disorderly and evil ways" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# there is confusion

"there is disorder" or "there is chaos"

# every evil practice

"every kind of sinful behavior" or "every kind of wicked deed"
