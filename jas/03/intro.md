# James 03 General Notes #

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter ####

##### Metaphors #####
The author uses many different metaphors to convict his readers and to encourage them to display godliness by the way they speak. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/godly]])

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### Implicit information #####
What a person says can reveal his spiritual state. This is because his speech can be heard by other people. If a person is unable to control his actions when he is seen by others, he will not be able to control his actions when no one is looking. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/spirit]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
