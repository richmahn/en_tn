## translationNotes

* **Who among you is wise and understanding? Let that person** - James uses this rhetorical question to teach his audience about proper behavior. Also, "wise and understanding" is a doublet. This could be translated as "The person who thinks he is wise should." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
* **demonstrate a good life** - "show good behavior" or "show it"
* **by his works in the humility that comes from wisdom** - "with his good deeds and humility that comes from having true wisdom"
* **have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your heart** - "heart" refers to emotions or thoughts. Alternative translation: "will not share with others and you always put yourself first." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
* **do not boast and lie against the truth** - "do not lie about it and act like your are wise."
