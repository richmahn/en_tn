# Not many of you

James is making a generalized statement. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])

# my brothers

"my fellow believers"

# we who teach will be judged more strictly

This passage speaks of stricter judgment that will come from God on those who teach others about him. Alternate translation: "God will judge us who teach more severely because we know his word better than some people whom we have taught" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# we who teach

James includes himself and other teachers, but not the readers, so the word "we" is exclusive. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
