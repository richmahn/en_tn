# James 04 General Notes

#### Special concepts in this chapter

##### Adultery

Writers in the Bible often speak of adultery as a metaphor for people who say they love God but do things that God hates. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/godly]])

##### Law

James probably uses this word in [James 4:11](../../jas/04/11.md) to refer to "the royal law" ([James 2:8](../../jas/02/08.md)).

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter

##### Rhetorical Questions

James asks many questions because he wants his readers to think about how they are living. He wants to correct and teach them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter

##### Humble

This word probably usually refers to people who are not proud. James uses the word here to refer to people who are not proud and who also trust in Jesus and obey him.
