# James 04 General Notes #

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Adultery #####
Adultery is a common metaphor in Scripture. It is always used negatively and indicates a child of God is acting in an ungodly manner. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/ungodly]])

##### Law #####
It is unclear whether this is a reference to the law of Moses. It is probably a reference to the "law" of God in general. This is the general standard of righteousness based on the character of God. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]])

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter ####

##### Rhetorical Questions #####
James uses many rhetorical questions to teach his readers. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### "The humble" #####
This is probably not a reference to those who act humbly, but a reference to those who humble themselves and trust in Jesus for their salvation. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/salvation]])
