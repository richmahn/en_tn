# Humble yourselves before the Lord

"Be humble toward God." Actions done with God in mind are often spoken of as being done in his physical presence. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# he will lift you up

James indicates that God will honor the humble person by saying God will pick that person up off the ground physically from where that person had prostrated himself in humility. Alternate translation: "he will honor you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
