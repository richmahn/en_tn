##  we will live ##

the word "We" does not directly refer James or his Audience but as an example of how Jame's audience should behave.

## we will do this or that ##

This could be translated as "do what we have planned to do."

## to him who knows ##

James is not addressing anyone directly by the word "him", but to anyone who is to do good but does not.
