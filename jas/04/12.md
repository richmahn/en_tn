# Only one is the lawgiver and judge

This refers to God. "God is the only one who gives laws and judges people"

# Who are you, you who judge your neighbor?

This is a rhetorical question James uses to scold his audience. This can be expressed as a statement. AT: "You are just a human and cannot judge another human." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
