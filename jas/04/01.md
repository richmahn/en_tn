# General Information:

In this section, the words "yourselves," "your," and "you" are plural and refer to the believers to whom James writes.

# Connecting Statement:

James rebukes these believers for their worldliness and their lack of humility. He again urges them to watch how they speak to and about each other.

# Where do quarrels and disputes among you come from?

The abstract nouns "quarrels" and "disputes" mean basically the same thing and can be translated with verbs. Alternate translation: "Why do you quarrel and dispute among yourselves?" or "Why do you fight among yourselves?" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# Do they not come from your desires that fight among your members?

James uses this question to rebuke his audience. This can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: "They come from your evil desires for things, desires that fight among your members." or "They come from your desires for evil things, desires that fight among your members." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Do they not come from your desires that fight among your members?

James speaks of desires as they were enemies who waged war against the believers. In reality, of course, it is the people who have these desires who fight among themselves. Alternate translation: "They come from your desires for evil things, by which you end up harming each other" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# among your members

Possible meanings are 1) there is fighting among the local believers, or 2) the fighting, that is, the conflict, is inside each believer.
