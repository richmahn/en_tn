# General Information:

The words "you" and "your" in this section refer to the believers to whom James writes.

# speak against

"speak badly about" or "oppose"

# brothers

James speaks of the believers as if they are biological brothers. The term here includes women as well as men. AT: "fellow believers" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])

# but a judge

"but you are acting like the person who gives the law"

# Only one is the lawgiver and judge

This refers to God. "God is the only one who gives laws and judges people"

# Who are you, you who judge your neighbor?

This is a rhetorical question James uses to scold his audience. This can be expressed as a statement. AT: "You are just a human and cannot judge another human." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
