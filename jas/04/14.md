# Who knows what will happen tomorrow, and what is your life?

James uses these questions to correct his audience and to teach these believers that physical life is not that important. They can be expressed as statements. Alternate translation: "No one knows what will happen tomorrow, and your life does not last very long!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# For you are a mist that appears for a little while and then disappears

James speaks of people as if they were a mist that appears and then quickly goes away. Alternate translation: "You live for only a short amount of time, and then you die" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
