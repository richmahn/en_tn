2TI	front	intro	s7fk			0		# Introduction to 2 Timothy<br><br>## Part 1: General Introduction<br><br>### Outline of the book of 2 Timothy<br><br>1. Paul greets Timothy and encourages him to endure hardship as he serves God (1:1-2:13).<br>2. Paul gives general instructions to Timothy (2:14–26).<br>3. Paul warns Timothy about future events and instructs him about how to carry out his service to God (3:1-4:8).<br>4. Paul makes personal remarks (4:9-22).<br><br>### Who wrote the book of 2 Timothy?<br><br>Paul wrote 2 Timothy. He was from the city of Tarsus. He had been known as Saul in his early life. Before becoming a Christian, Paul was a Pharisee. He persecuted Christians. After he became a Christian, he traveled several times throughout the Roman Empire telling people about Jesus.<br><br>This book is the second letter Paul wrote to Timothy. Timothy was his disciple and close friend. Paul wrote this letter while in prison in Rome. Paul would die soon after writing this letter.<br><br>### What is the book of 2 Timothy about?<br><br>Paul had left Timothy in the city of Ephesus to help the believers there. Paul wrote this letter to instruct Timothy about various matters. The topics he addressed include warnings about false teachers and advice about enduring difficult situations. This letter also shows how Paul was training Timothy to be a leader among the churches.<br><br>### How should the title of this book be translated?<br><br>Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “2 Timothy” or “Second Timothy.” Or they may choose a different title, such as “Paul’s Second Letter to Timothy” or “The Second Letter to Timothy.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])<br><br>## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts<br><br>### What is the soldier imagery in 2 Timothy?<br><br>As Paul waited in prison, knowing he would die soon, he spoke of being a soldier of Jesus Christ. Soldiers have to obey to their leaders. In the same way, Christians have to obey Jesus. As “soldiers” of Christ, believers are to obey his commands, even if they die as a result.<br><br>### What does it mean that God inspired Scripture?<br><br>God is the true author of Scripture. He inspired the human authors who wrote the books. That means God in some way caused the people to write what they wrote. This is why the Bible is also referred to as God’s word. This implies several things about it. First, everything that the Bible teaches is free from error and can be trusted. Second, God will always preserve his Scripture for every generation of people. Third, God’s word should be translated into all the world’s languages.<br><br>## Part 3: Important Translation Issues<br><br>### Singular and plural “you”<br><br>In this book, the word “I” refers to Paul. Here the word “you” is almost always singular and refers to Timothy. The exception to this is 4:22. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])<br><br>### Inclusive and exclusive “we” and “us”<br><br>In this book, “we” and “us” include the writer, Paul, the recipient, Timothy, and all believers. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])<br><br>### What did Paul mean by the expressions “in Christ,” “in the Lord,” etc.?<br><br>Paul meant to express the idea of a very close union between Christ and the believers. Please see the introduction to the book of Romans for more details about this kind of expression.<br><br>### What are the major textual issues in the text of the book of 2 Timothy?<br><br>For the following verses, the oldest Greek manuscripts differ from later Greek manuscripts. Modern translations may also differ depending on the Greek manuscript that they translate from. The ULT text translates the Greek from the oldest manuscripts, and puts the differences from later manuscripts in a footnote. If a translation of the Bible already exists in the general region, translators should consider following the decision in that translation. If not, translators are advised to follow the oldest Greek manuscripts as reflected in the ULT text.<br><br>* “Because of this, I was appointed a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher” (1:11). Some later manuscripts read, “Because of this, I was appointed a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher to the Gentiles.”<br>* “Warn them before God” (2:14). Some later manuscripts read, “Warn them before the Lord.”<br><br>(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
2TI	1	intro	p5lf			0		# 2 Timothy 01 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Paul formally introduces this letter in verses 1-2. Writers often began letters in this way in the ancient Near East.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Spiritual children<br><br>Paul discipled Timothy as a Christian and a church leader. Paul may also have led him to believe in Christ. Therefore, Paul calls Timothy “beloved child.” So even though Paul was not Timothy’s father, Paul speaks of his relationship with Timothy as that of a father and son in a spiritual sense. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Persecution<br><br>Paul was in prison when he wrote this letter. Paul encourages Timothy to be willing to suffer for the gospel.

The two people involved are Jesus and Paul, but it is not clear which one is holding the **deposit**. So this could mean one of two things.

Alternate translation: “trusting in Christ Jesus and loving others because you belong to him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2TI	1	13	b2ld		ἐν πίστει καὶ ἀγάπῃ τῇ ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ	1	in the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus	Here, **love** could mean one of two things (or both). (1) The love that Timothy should show others. Alternate translation: “trusting in Christ Jesus and loving others because you belong to him” (2) The love that Timothy should show to God. Alternate translation: “trusting in Christ Jesus and loving him”
2TI	1	13	ix6w	figs-metaphor	ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ	1		Paul speaks figuratively of **faith and love** as if they were objects inside of **Christ Jesus**. This refers to the faith and love that Jesus enables us to have when we belong to him. See how you translated this in 1:9. Alternate translation: “ours through our relationship to Christ Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2TI	1	14	i5g5	figs-explicit	τὴν καλὴν παραθήκην φύλαξον	1	Guard the good deposit	Here, **the good deposit** refers to the gospel message that God has entrusted to Timothy to share with his people. Alternate translation: “the good message entrusted to you for God’s people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2TI	1	14	cb5q	figs-explicit	τὴν καλὴν παραθήκην φύλαξον	1	guard	Timothy needs to be alert to protect the gospel message because people will oppose him and try to distort what he says and teaches, turning it into a different message. Alternate translation: “protect the good deposit against those who will try to distort it” or “Because people will try to distort the gospel message, guard it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2TI	1	14	a3v2		διὰ Πνεύματος Ἁγίου	1	through the Holy Spirit	Here, **through** means “by means of” or “by the power of.” Alternate translation: “by means of the Holy Spirit” or “with the help of the Holy Spirit”
2TI	1	15	p018	figs-hyperbole	πάντες οἱ ἐν τῇ Ἀσίᾳ	1	all who are in Asia	The word **all** could mean one of two things. (1) Paul could have used the word **all** to mean “many, but not all” in the strict sense, since Timothy and Onesiphorus did not turn away from him. So this would be an example of hyperbole. (2) Paul could have used the word **all** to refer to the men who came to Rome with him from Asia Minor. Alternate translation: “all who came with me from Asia” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
2TI	1	15	p019	translate-names	Ἀσίᾳ	1	Asia	This is the name of a Roman province, Asia Minor, which had its capital at Ephesus, which is where Timothy was living at the time of this letter. It is now a region in modern-day Turkey. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
2TI	1	15	p6f4	figs-metaphor	ἀπεστράφησάν με	1	turned away from me	This is a metaphor that means they left Paul and stopped helping him. Alternate translation: “have deserted me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2TI	1	15	p020	figs-explicit	ἀπεστράφησάν με	1	turned away from me	Paul assumes that Timothy would know that the reason that the believers from Asia had abandoned him was because the authorities had put him in prison. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “have deserted me because I am in prison” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2TI	1	15	x6cc	translate-names	Φύγελος	1	Phygelus	This is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
2TI	1	15	p021	translate-names	Ἑρμογένης	1	Hermogenes	This is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
2TI	1	16	e6hl	translate-names	Ὀνησιφόρου	1	Onesiphorus	This is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
2TI	1	16	izk9	translate-blessing	δῴη ἔλεος ὁ Κύριος τῷ Ὀνησιφόρου οἴκῳ	1		Paul is asking God to bless the family of Onesiphorus. You can express this as either a blessing or a prayer, in whichever way is more natural in your language. Alternate translation: “I pray that the Lord will be kind to the family of Onesiphorus” or “May the Lord bless the family of Onesiphorus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-blessing]])
2TI	1	16	zz44	figs-metonymy	τῷ Ὀνησιφόρου οἴκῳ	1	to the household of Onesiphorus	The word **household** refers to **Onesiphorus** and to all the people in his family, possibly even his servants. Alternate translation: “to Onesiphorus and everyone who lives with him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
2TI	1	16	td1q	figs-metonymy	τὴν ἅλυσίν μου οὐκ ἐπησχύνθη	1	not ashamed of my chain	The word **chain** refers to being in prison. Onesiphorus was not ashamed that Paul was in prison but came to visit him frequently. Alternate translation: “was not ashamed of my imprisonment” or “was not ashamed of my being in prison” or “was not ashamed of me, even though I was in prison” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
2TI	1	17	xfg1	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	ἀλλὰ	1		Here, **but** indicates a contrast between the previous verse and this verse. Instead of being ashamed that Paul was in prison, Onesiphorus searched for Paul and found him there. Use whatever form is most natural in your language to show this contrast. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
2TI	1	17	p022	translate-names	Ῥώμῃ	1	Rome	This is the name of a city, the capital of the Roman Empire. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
2TI	1	18	p3di	translate-blessing	δῴη αὐτῷ ὁ Κύριος, εὑρεῖν ἔλεος παρὰ Κυρίου	1	May the Lord grant to him to find mercy from the Lord	Paul is again asking for the Lord to **grant mercy** to Onesiphorus. You can express this as either a blessing or a prayer, in whichever way is more natural in your language. See how you translated this in [1:16](../01/16.md). Alternate translation: “I pray that the Lord will be merciful to Onesiphorus” or “May the Lord have mercy on Onesiphorus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-blessing]])
2TI	1	18	x0eo	grammar-connect-logic-result	(δῴη αὐτῷ ὁ Κύριος, εὑρεῖν ἔλεος παρὰ Κυρίου ἐν ἐκείνῃ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ), καὶ ὅσα ἐν Ἐφέσῳ διηκόνησεν, βέλτιον σὺ γινώσκεις	1		If it would be clearer in your language, you could reverse the order of these sentences, since the second sentence gives the reason for the action that the first sentence describes. See the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
2TI	1	18	r54t	writing-pronouns	δῴη αὐτῷ ὁ Κύριος, εὑρεῖν ἔλεος παρὰ Κυρίου	1		If it is clearer in your language, you can use the name “Onesiphorus” instead of the pronoun **him** to make it clear who is receiving mercy. Alternative translation: “May Onesiphorus receive mercy from the Lord” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
2TI	1	18	x2dk	figs-metaphor	εὑρεῖν ἔλεος παρὰ Κυρίου	1	to find mercy from the Lord	Paul speaks of **mercy** as if it were an object that could be found. Paul is expressing his desire that God show **mercy** to Onesiphorus on the day of judgment. Alternate translation: “to receive mercy from the Lord” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2TI	1	18	f3ep	figs-explicit	ἐν ἐκείνῃ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ	1	in that day	The expression **that day** refers to the day when God will judge all people; at that time they will receive mercy from the Lord, as Paul mentions, or wrath. Alternate translation: “on the day of judgment” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2TI	1	18	p024	translate-names	Ἐφέσῳ	1	Ephesus	This is the name of a city, the place where Timothy, the recipient of the letter, is located. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
2TI	1	18	p025	figs-explicit	ὅσα ἐν Ἐφέσῳ διηκόνησεν, βέλτιον σὺ γινώσκεις	1	he served me, you know very well	Paul is reminding Timothy that Onesiphorus helped him earlier, in Ephesus. So, Paul is asking the Lord to bless Onesiphorus because he helped Paul several times. Alternate translation: “you know well how much he also helped me earlier when I was in Ephesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2TI	2	intro	k3zn			0		# 2 Timothy 02 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>In verses 11b-13, Paul may be quoting a poem or hymn. To show the reader that this may be a quotation, in your translation you may choose to set these verses farther to the right than the other verses in the chapter.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### We will reign with him<br>Faithful Christians will reign with Christ in the future. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faithful]])<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Analogies<br>In this chapter, Paul makes several analogies to teach about living as a Christian. He uses analogies of soldiers, athletes, and farmers. Later in the chapter, he uses the analogy of different kinds of containers in a house.
2TI	2	1	bll5	figs-metaphor	τέκνον μου	1	my child	Here, **child** is a term of great love and approval. Timothy is not Paul’s biological child. It is also likely that Paul introduced Timothy to Christ, and so this is why Paul considered him like his own child. Alternate translation: “who are like my child” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2TI	2	1	p026	figs-activepassive	ἐνδυναμοῦ	1	be strengthened	You could say this with an active form, and you could say who would do the action. Alternate translation: “let God make you strong” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2TI	2	1	e6ex	figs-abstractnouns	ἐν τῇ χάριτι τῇ ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ	1	in the grace that is in Christ Jesus	Paul wants Timothy to experience the strength that God provides through his **grace** or kindness. Believers experience God’s grace through knowing Jesus Christ. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **grace** with an adjective. Alternate translation: “as you allow Christ Jesus to kindly empower you through your relationship to him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2TI	2	2	ig9v	figs-explicit	διὰ πολλῶν μαρτύρων	1	in the presence of many witnesses	Paul is referring to teaching in a public setting with others present. The implication is that those others could testify as to what he taught. Alternate translation: “in the presence of people who can testify to what I said” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2TI	2	2	kv1m	figs-metaphor	ταῦτα παράθου πιστοῖς ἀνθρώποις	1	entrust these things to faithful men	Paul speaks of his instructions to Timothy as if they were objects that Timothy could give to other people and trust them to use correctly. Alternate translation: “commit them” or “teach them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2TI	2	2	p027	figs-gendernotations	ἀνθρώποις	1	men	Here, the term **men** has a generic sense that may include women. Alternate translation: “people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
2TI	2	3	yc1j	figs-explicit	συνκακοπάθησον	1	suffer together	The term **together** could mean one of two things. (1) It could mean for Timothy to suffer together with Paul. Alternate translation: “suffer together with me” (2) It could mean for Timothy to suffer together with all Christians who suffer. Alternate translation: “suffer together with all believers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2TI	2	3	juu2	figs-metaphor	ὡς καλὸς στρατιώτης Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	as a good soldier of Jesus Christ	Paul compares suffering for Christ Jesus to the suffering that a good soldier endures. Alternate translation: “as if you were a soldier and Jesus Christ were your commander” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2TI	2	4	a4x7	figs-metaphor	οὐδεὶς στρατευόμενος ἐμπλέκεται ταῖς τοῦ βίου πραγματίαις	1	No one serving as a soldier gets entangled in the affairs of life	To help Timothy understand something important about following Jesus, Paul introduces the metaphor of a soldier who has to decide between pleasing his leader or pleasing those outside the army. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this. Alternate translation: “consider that no dedicated soldier allows the affairs of life to distract him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2TI	2	4	p7n5	figs-metaphor	ἐμπλέκεται ταῖς τοῦ βίου πραγματίαις	1	gets entangled in the affairs of life	Paul speaks of being involved in other matters as if they were a net that trapped people and kept them from being able to move freely. Alternate translation: “allows the affairs of life to distract him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2TI	2	4	p028	figs-activepassive	ἐμπλέκεται ταῖς τοῦ βίου πραγματίαις	1	gets entangled in the affairs of life	If your language does not use passive verbal forms, you can use an active form to express this same idea. Alternate translation: “allows the affairs of life to distract him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2TI	2	4	p029	figs-explicit	τοῦ βίου	1	the affairs of life	By **life**, Paul means, in the context of this metaphor, “civilian life.” The implication is that Timothy and all believers should not allow competing concerns to keep them from serving Christ. Alternate translation: “of everyday life” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2TI	2	4	d2lg		τῷ στρατολογήσαντι	1	the one who enlisted him	Alternate translation: “his leader” or “the one who commands him”
2TI	2	5	d483	figs-metaphor	ἐὰν…ἀθλῇ τις, οὐ στεφανοῦται, ἐὰν μὴ νομίμως ἀθλήσῃ	1	if anyone competes, he is not crowned if he has not competed lawfully	To help Timothy understand something important about following Jesus, Paul introduces the metaphor of an athlete who has to decide between competing lawfully or not lawfully. The athlete will only receive the crown given to the winner if he competes lawfully. By making this comparison with an athlete competing in games, Paul is implicitly telling Timothy that Christ will not reward him unless he serves him **lawfully**, that is, unless he obeys him. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this directly. Alternate translation: “consider that the officials only crown an athlete as the winner if he competes according to the rules” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2TI	2	5	p031	figs-hypo	ἐὰν…ἀθλῇ τις, οὐ στεφανοῦται, ἐὰν μὴ νομίμως ἀθλήσῃ	1	if anyone competes, he is not crowned if he has not competed lawfully	Paul is also using a hypothetical situation to teach Timothy. Alternate translation: “suppose an athlete did not compete by the rules. Then he would not be crowned” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
2TI	2	5	p032		ἐὰν…ἀθλῇ τις	1	if anyone competes	Here, **competes** refers to competing in an athletic event. Alternate translation: “if an athlete competes in an event”
2TI	2	5	xbn6	figs-doublenegatives	οὐ στεφανοῦται, ἐὰν μὴ νομίμως ἀθλήσῃ	1	he is not crowned if he has not competed lawfully	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this double negative as a positive statement. Alternate translation: “the officials will only crown him if he competes by the rules” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
2TI	2	5	p033	figs-activepassive	οὐ στεφανοῦται	1	he is not crowned	If your language does not use passive verbal forms, you can use an active form to express this same idea. Alternate translation: “the officials will not crown him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2TI	2	5	p034	figs-explicit	οὐ στεφανοῦται	1	he is not crowned	Paul assumes that Timothy will know that in this culture crowning indicated the winner of a competition. Alternate translation: “the officials will not crown him as the winner” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2TI	2	5	lea8	translate-unknown	οὐ στεφανοῦται	1	he is not crowned	In Paul’s time, when athletes won competitions, they were crowned with wreaths made from the leaves of plants. You can express this idea in your translation by referring to the comparable custom in your own culture, or by using a general expression. Alternate translation: “the officials will not give him an award” or “the officials will not declare him to be the winner” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
2TI	2	5	reg6	figs-explicit	μὴ νομίμως ἀθλήσῃ	1	he has competed lawfully	Paul is referring to the rules that governed a competition. The athletes had to obey the rules or they would be removed from the competition and not have an opportunity to win. If it would be clearer in your language, you can mention these rules. Alternate translation: “he does not compete according to the rules” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2TI	2	6	wz35	figs-metaphor	τὸν κοπιῶντα γεωργὸν δεῖ πρῶτον τῶν καρπῶν μεταλαμβάνειν	1	The hardworking farmer ought to be first to receive of the crops	To help Timothy understand something important about following Jesus, Paul introduces the metaphor of a farmer who has to decide between working hard or not working hard. The farmer will receive a share of the harvest if he is working hard. By making this comparison, Paul is encouraging Timothy to work hard in his service to Christ so that God will reward him. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this directly. Alternate translation: “Consider that a farmer who works hard should receive a share of the crops before anyone else” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2TI	2	6	p035	figs-explicit	πρῶτον τῶν καρπῶν μεταλαμβάνειν	1	first to receive of the crops	In this illustration, it seems that the hardworking farmer is working with other farmers who will all receive a part of the crop after the harvest. But since this farmer works harder than the others, he should receive before the others. It is implied that receiving first is best, possibly because the quality of the crop is better. Alternate translation: “receive the best share of the crops” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2TI	2	7	bdk9	figs-explicit	νόει ὃ λέγω, δώσει γάρ σοι ὁ Κύριος σύνεσιν	1	Think about what I am saying, for the Lord will give you understanding	Paul gave Timothy three metaphors in verses 3-6, but he did not completely explain their implications. He expected Timothy to figure out, with God’s help, the lesson of these metaphors for Christ’s servants. For that reason, if you want to include an explanation of the meaning of the metaphors, we recommend that you state the meaning in a footnote rather than in the Bible text. Alternate translation: “you will have to think carefully about what I have just told you to understand it completely, but you can depend on God to help you to do that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2TI	2	7	p036	figs-metonymy	ὃ λέγω	1	what I am saying	Paul refers to what he has just written in his letter with the verb **saying** to express the idea of communicating. Alternate translation: “what I have just told you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
2TI	2	7	a22q	figs-explicit	ἐν πᾶσιν	1	in everything	Here, **in everything** refers to everything related to the three metaphors that Paul has written just before this. Alternate translation: “about everything that I have just said” or “about all that I said” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2TI	2	8	mh1k	figs-metaphor	ἐκ σπέρματος Δαυείδ	1	from the seed of David	The phrase **from the seed of** refers figuratively to Jesus being descended from King David. Alternate translation: “who is a descendant of David” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2TI	2	8	p037	translate-names	Δαυείδ	1	David	This is the name of a man, a great king of Israel. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
2TI	2	8	wt31	figs-idiom	ἐγηγερμένον ἐκ νεκρῶν	1	raised from the dead	The expression **raise from the dead** is an idiom for causing someone who has died to become alive again. Alternate translation: “whom God caused to live again” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
2TI	2	8	p038	figs-activepassive	ἐγηγερμένον ἐκ νεκρῶν	1	raised from the dead	If your language does not use passive verbal forms, you can use an active form to express this same idea. Alternate translation: “whom God raised from the dead” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2TI	2	8	s4vh	figs-possession	κατὰ τὸ εὐαγγέλιόν μου	1	according to my gospel	The term **my** conveys the idea that it is the gospel associated with Paul because he preaches it. Alternate translation: “according to the gospel message that I preach” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
2TI	2	9	t2ax	figs-metonymy	μέχρι δεσμῶν	1	unto chains	Paul uses the expression **unto chains** figuratively to express how far his suffering has gone: from being beaten, to being arrested, to being in chains in prison. Alternate translation: “to the point of being imprisoned” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
2TI	2	9	p039	figs-simile	ὡς κακοῦργος	1	like a criminal	Paul compares his situation to the shameful one that a person would be in who had actually committed a crime. Alternate translation: “as if I were a criminal” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
2TI	2	9	pc6t	figs-metaphor	ὁ λόγος τοῦ Θεοῦ οὐ δέδεται	1	the word of God is not bound	Here, **bound** means being held in chains as a prisoner, referring to Paul’s condition. Paul contrasts himself, an actual prisoner, with God’s message, which can never be held prisoner. Alternate translation: “nothing is holding back the message from God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2TI	2	9	p040	figs-activepassive	ὁ λόγος τοῦ Θεοῦ οὐ δέδεται	1	the word of God is not bound	If your language does not use passive verbal forms, you can use an active form to express this idea. Alternate translation: “nothing is holding back the message from God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2TI	2	9	p041	figs-metonymy	ὁ λόγος τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	the word of God	Paul uses the term **word** figuratively to describe the message from God that he and others are communicating with words. Alternate translation: “the message from God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
2TI	2	10	p042	figs-hyperbole	πάντα ὑπομένω	1	I endure all things	Here the term **all** is a generalization that likely refers to the sufferings that Paul describes in the previous verse. Alternate translation: “I endure all of these sufferings” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
2TI	2	10	aa1x	figs-nominaladj	διὰ τοὺς ἐκλεκτούς	1	for the chosen	The term **chosen** is an adjective that functions as a noun here and refers to a group of people. If your language would not use an adjective in that way, you can translate this term with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “for the people whom God has chosen” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
2TI	2	10	j2bk		αὐτοὶ σωτηρίας τύχωσιν τῆς ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ	1	obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus	The phrase **obtain the salvation** could also be expressed with Christ Jesus, who grants salvation, as the subject. Alternate translation: “Christ Jesus may grant them salvation”
2TI	2	10	p043	figs-abstractnouns	αὐτοὶ σωτηρίας τύχωσιν τῆς ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ	1	obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus	If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **salvation** with a verb. Alternate translation: “Christ Jesus may save them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2TI	2	10	el68	figs-abstractnouns	μετὰ δόξης αἰωνίου	1	with eternal glory	The abstract noun **glory** refers to the wonderful condition that people will experience when they are in the presence of God. It comes from God himself and he shares it with those who are saved by Jesus Christ, and this condition is **eternal**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **glory** with an adjective. Alternate translation: “and know how glorious it is to be with God forever” or “and experience God’s wonderful presence forever” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2TI	2	11	nr7u		πιστὸς ὁ λόγος	1	This word is trustworthy	In this context, the term **word** refers to the statement of doctrine that follows. See how you translated this phrase in [1 Timothy 1:15](../../1ti/01/15.md) Alternate translation: “this statement is dependable”
2TI	2	11	p044		πιστὸς ὁ λόγος	1	This word is trustworthy	You could represent the meaning of the adjective **trustworthy** with an active verb, if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “you can trust this statement”
2TI	2	11	p045	figs-quotemarks	πιστὸς ὁ λόγος	1	This word is trustworthy	Paul uses this phrase to introduce a direct quotation. The words that follow in the rest of this verse and in [2:12](../02/12.md) and [2:13](../02/13.md) are a poem or hymn that expresses the message that Paul says is trustworthy. It may be helpful to your readers if you indicate this by marking these words as a direct quotation or by setting them farther to the right, as the General Notes at the beginning of this chapter suggest. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
2TI	2	11	g6e4	writing-poetry	εἰ γὰρ συναπεθάνομεν, καὶ συνζήσομεν	1	For if we died with him, we will also live with him	This is the beginning of a poem or hymn that Paul is probably quoting. If your language has a way of indicating that this is poetry, such as by setting individual phrases on separate lines, you could use it here and in [2:12](../02/12.md) and [2:13](../02/13.md). If not, you could translate this material as regular prose rather than as poetry. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry]])
2TI	2	11	in38	figs-metaphor	εἰ…συναπεθάνομεν	1	if we died with him	Paul is speaking figuratively since he and Timothy and other believers who should trust this statement have not actually died. This could mean one of two things. (1) Paul could be referring to the way that believers accept Jesus’ death for their sins when they trust him for salvation. This means that they have figuratively “died” to their old life of sin. Alternate translation: “if we have ended our old way of life by accepting Jesus’ death for us” (2) Paul could be referring to the way that people who believe in Jesus may suffer for him, possibly to the point of dying for him. Alternate translation: “if we are prepared to die for Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2TI	2	11	p046		καὶ συνζήσομεν	1	we will also live with him	Although Paul is referring to dying with Christ in a figurative sense, **live** is probably not figurative, but refers to one of two things. (1) **live** refers to life after physical death. This seems most likely given Paul’s mention of “eternal glory” in the previous verse and “we will reign with him” in the next. Alternate translation: “then God will raise us from the dead to live with Jesus” (2) **live** refers to how believers will act in this life before physical death. Alternate translation: “we will not pursue our own desires, instead we will do what Jesus wants us to do”
2TI	2	12	p048		εἰ ἀρνησόμεθα	1	if we deny him	Paul uses the term **deny** to refer to the action of believers saying that they do not know Jesus Christ during this present life. It is presented as the opposite of **endure**, so it refers to someone who gives in to persecution and denies being a follower of Jesus. Alternate translation: “if we say now that we do not know him”
2TI	2	12	p049		κἀκεῖνος ἀρνήσεται ἡμᾶς	1	he also will deny us	In this second usage of the word **deny**, Paul is referring to the action of Jesus Christ on the day of final judgment. On that day, Jesus will either receive a faithful believer or reject those who are not true followers. Those who deny that they are followers of Jesus while on earth are not true followers. Alternate translation: “he will reject us on the day of judgment”
2TI	2	13	ke4w		εἰ ἀπιστοῦμεν	1	if we are unfaithful	Paul uses the word **unfaithful** to express the condition of believers who do not continue to obey Jesus, but rather disobey him. Alternate translation: “if we disobey Jesus” or “if we do not do what Jesus wants us to do”
2TI	2	13	p050	figs-explicit	ἐκεῖνος πιστὸς μένει	1	he remains faithful	This could mean one of two things. Alternate translation: (1) “he remains faithful to us” (2) “he remains true to himself” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2TI	2	13	ihd4		ἀρνήσασθαι…ἑαυτὸν οὐ δύναται	1	he is not able to deny himself	Paul states that Jesus is not able to **deny himself**, meaning that Jesus is not able to go against his character and will remain true to what he said he would do. Paul may have one or both of the following ideas in mind. (1) Jesus’ character includes being the Savior who can forgive our unfaithfulness when we repent of it, as Peter experienced (John 21:15-19). This favors the interpretation of the previous phrase as “he remains faithful to us.” (2) Jesus’ character also includes being the holy God who judges people for their sin when they do not repent. This favors the interpretation of the previous phrase as “he remains true to himself.” Alternate translation: “he must always act according to his character”
2TI	2	14	u661		ὑπομίμνῃσκε	1	remind them	The word **them**, which is implicit in the Greek verb, probably refers to the people that Timothy has responsibility over. Alternate translation: “remind the people there”
2TI	2	14	p051	figs-metaphor	ἐνώπιον τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	before God	Paul uses the expression **before God**, which means “in front of God,” to mean “where God can see.” Seeing, in turn, figuratively means attention and judgment. Alternate translation: “as God is watching” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2TI	2	14	r5lq	figs-explicit	ἐνώπιον τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	before God	The implication is that Paul is telling Timothy to tell the believers, when he gives them this command, that God will be watching what they do. Alternate translation: “with God as their witness” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2TI	2	14	g6p7	figs-metaphor	μὴ λογομαχεῖν	1	not to battle about words	Paul uses the term **battle** figuratively to describe arguments. This could mean one of two things. (1) The believers are not to argue about unimportant things such as the words that someone uses to present the gospel message. That only distracts people from talking about important things, such as the gospel message itself. Alternate translation: “not to fight about small things like words” (2) The believers are not to argue about what words mean. Again, this causes disunity among the believers for no good reason. Alternate translation: “not to fight about the meanings of words” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2TI	2	14	rke6		ἐπ’ οὐδὲν χρήσιμον	1	it is useful for nothing	Paul adds that battling about words has no benefit for those involved. Alternate translation: “it does not benefit anyone”
2TI	2	14	ywty	figs-abstractnouns	ἐπὶ καταστροφῇ τῶν ἀκουόντων	1		If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **destruction** with a verbal phrase. Alternate translation: “it destroys those who hear” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2TI	2	14	x7gx	figs-metonymy	ἐπὶ καταστροφῇ τῶν ἀκουόντων	1		Here, **destruction** refers not to physical harm, but to the spiritual harm that is done to believers who hear their teachers foolishly arguing about unimportant things. This teaches the believers that being seen as right about small things is more important than love and unity, and can cause them to have wrong ideas about the faith or to stop following Jesus altogether. Alternate translation: “and can make those who hear it want to stop following Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
2TI	2	15	m3vy		σπούδασον σεαυτὸν, δόκιμον παραστῆσαι τῷ Θεῷ	1	to present yourself approved to God, a worker not ashamed	Alternate translation: “do your best to please God”
2TI	2	15	rj6y	figs-metaphor	ἐργάτην	1	a worker	Paul says figuratively that Timothy will be a skilled workman if he correctly teaches God’s word. Alternate translation: “like a craftsman” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2TI	2	15	xgz9	figs-metaphor	ὀρθοτομοῦντα τὸν λόγον τῆς ἀληθείας	1	cutting the word of truth straight	Paul refers figuratively to **the word of truth** as if it were a path that someone was cutting through difficult terrain. When such a path is **straight**, travelers can follow it directly to their destination. By contrast, the useless discussions that Paul describes in [2:14](../02/14.md) and [2:16](../02/16.md) would be needless detours in terms of this same metaphor. Alternate translation: “show people how to follow the Scriptures directly” or “teach the Scriptures correctly so that people can follow them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2TI	2	15	p052	figs-metonymy	τὸν λόγον τῆς ἀληθείας	1	the word of truth	Paul uses the term **word** figuratively to refer to something that is expressed in words. This could mean one of two things. (1) It could refer to the message that Timothy is to teach. Alternate translation: “the true message” (2) It could refer to the Scriptures. Alternate translation: “the true things that God has said in the Scriptures” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
2TI	2	15	p053	figs-abstractnouns	τὸν λόγον τῆς ἀληθείας	1	the word of truth	If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **truth** with an adjective. Alternate translation: “the true message” or “the true things that God has said in the Scriptures” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2TI	2	16	e27q	figs-metaphor	ἐπὶ πλεῖον…προκόψουσιν ἀσεβείας	1	for they will advance into greater ungodliness	Paul speaks of these discussions figuratively as if they could physically progress in a certain direction, and he speaks of godlessness as that direction. Paul is figuratively describing the effect that these discussions have on people. Alternate translation: “because they cause people to become more and more ungodly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2TI	2	17	i73t	figs-simile	ὁ λόγος αὐτῶν ὡς γάγγραινα νομὴν ἕξει	1	their word will have a spreading like gangrene	This is a simile. It means that something will spread from person to person and harm the faith of all those who hear it. The thing that will spread is either: (1) the habit of having useless and godless discussions, or (2) the things that the people were saying in these empty discussions, or both. Alternate translation: “these empty discussions will spread quickly and cause destruction like an infectious disease” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
2TI	2	17	p054	figs-metonymy	ὁ λόγος αὐτῶν	1	their word	Paul uses the term **word** figuratively to refer to something that is expressed in words. Alternate translation: “these discussions” or “what people who take part in these discussions say” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
2TI	2	17	p055	translate-unknown	ὡς γάγγραινα	1	like gangrene	**Gangrene** is type of tissue death caused by infection or lack of blood circulation. It quickly spreads in a person’s body and can lead to death. If your readers would not know what **gangrene** is, you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “like an infectious disease” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
2TI	2	17	p056	writing-pronouns	ὧν ἐστιν Ὑμέναιος, καὶ Φίλητος	1	among whom are Hymenaeus and Philetus	Paul gives Timothy the names of two men who are examples of ungodliness and foolish talk. To make the relationship between these names and the preceding **their word** clear in your language, you may have to make this explicit. Alternate translation: “Hymeneus and Philetus are such people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
2TI	2	17	x2k6	translate-names	Ὑμέναιος, καὶ Φίλητος	1	Hymenaeus and Philetus	These are names of men. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
2TI	2	18	fi9z	figs-metaphor	οἵτινες περὶ τὴν ἀλήθειαν ἠστόχησαν	1	who have missed the mark regarding the truth	Paul uses this expression to speak figuratively of faith in Christ as if it were a target at which people should aim. Those who have **missed the mark** do not believe or teach what is true. Alternate translation: “who are teaching things that are not true” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2TI	2	18	p057	figs-abstractnouns	οἵτινες περὶ τὴν ἀλήθειαν ἠστόχησαν	1	who have missed the mark regarding the truth	If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **truth** with an adjective. Alternate translation: “who teach things that are not true” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2TI	2	18	pu22	figs-abstractnouns	ἀνάστασιν ἤδη γεγονέναι	1	the resurrection has already happened	If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **resurrection** with an equivalent expression. Alternative translation: “God has already raised the dead” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2TI	2	18	ura5	figs-metaphor	ἀνατρέπουσιν τήν τινων πίστιν	1	who are destroying the faith of some	Paul refers to **faith** as though it were an object that could be destroyed. Alternate translation: “they are causing some people to stop believing” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2TI	2	19	ir1z	figs-metaphor	ὁ…στερεὸς θεμέλιος τοῦ Θεοῦ ἕστηκεν	1	the firm foundation of God stands	Paul uses the image of the foundation of a building to explain that even though a false and destructive message has been destroying the faith of some people, God has nevertheless given people who want to continue to follow him a true message, which figuratively provides for them a safe and secure “place to stand.” Alternate translation: “God has provided a secure basis for people to continue to believe in him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2TI	2	19	p058	figs-metonymy	ἔχων τὴν σφραγῖδα ταύτην	1	having this seal	Paul speaks figuratively of the inscription on this foundation as if it were a **seal**, since seals on the outside of documents often bore inscriptions describing their contents. Alternate translation: “having this inscription” or “which can be described in this way” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
2TI	2	19	p059	figs-quotemarks	ἔχων τὴν σφραγῖδα ταύτην	1	having this seal	Paul uses this phrase to introduce two direct quotations. The statements that follow in the rest of this verse describe two aspects of the basis that God has provided for people to continue to believe in him. It may be helpful to your readers if you indicate this by marking these statements as quotations. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
2TI	2	19	nd7t	figs-idiom	ὁ ὀνομάζων τὸ ὄνομα Κυρίου	1	who names the name of the Lord	The expression **names the name of the Lord** is an idiom that refers to saying the name of the Lord in order to declare that one belongs to him. Alternate translation: “who says he believes in the Lord” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
2TI	2	19	y3bc	figs-abstractnouns	ἀποστήτω ἀπὸ ἀδικίας	1	must abstain from unrighteousness	If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **unrighteousness** with an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “must stop doing evil things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2TI	2	20	p060	figs-metaphor	ἐν μεγάλῃ δὲ οἰκίᾳ, οὐκ ἔστιν μόνον σκεύη χρυσᾶ καὶ ἀργυρᾶ, ἀλλὰ καὶ ξύλινα καὶ ὀστράκινα	1	Now in a great house, there are not only gold and silver containers, but also wood and clay	To help Timothy understand something important about following Jesus, Paul introduces the metaphor that compares the containers that are in the home of a wealthy person with people in the church. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that this is a metaphor or illustration. Alternate translation: “Consider this illustration: in the home of a wealthy person, there are containers made of gold and silver, and there are also containers made of wood and clay” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2TI	2	20	p061	figs-ellipsis	ἀλλὰ καὶ ξύλινα καὶ ὀστράκινα	1	but also wood and clay	Paul leaves out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages in order to be complete. Alternate translation: “and there are also containers made of wood and clay” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
2TI	2	20	j75l		σκεύη	1	containers	The word **container** is a general term for items used to hold other things, such as grain, food, drink, or refuse. If your language does not have a general word, you can use a specific word such as “bowl” or “pot.”
2TI	2	20	mt5e	figs-abstractnouns	ἃ μὲν εἰς τιμὴν, ἃ δὲ εἰς ἀτιμίαν	1	both some for honor and some for dishonor	If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the ideas behind the abstract nouns **honor** and **dishonor** with equivalent phrases. Alternate translation: “he uses the former at events to honor people and he uses the latter to do things that no one wants to see” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2TI	2	21	jm3p	figs-metaphor	ἐκκαθάρῃ ἑαυτὸν ἀπὸ τούτων	1	has cleansed himself from these	Here, Paul continues the metaphor that compares people in the church to containers in a great house that have different uses. Paul speaks figuratively of a person washing himself clean as though he had been a pot full of something bad. By this he means that the person has given up certain associations or activities. This could mean one of two things. (1) The word **these** could refer to the false teachers who are destroying the faith of some people. Alternate translation: “has disassociated himself from these false teachers” (2) The word **these** could refer to the activities of quarreling and false teaching that Paul has warned Timothy about. Alternate translation: “has stopped doing these ungodly actions” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2TI	2	21	g79f	figs-metaphor	ἔσται σκεῦος εἰς τιμήν	1	he will be a container for honor	Paul speaks figuratively of a person who has given up these associations or activities as if he were a particular kind of container.

2TI	2	21	p062	figs-explicit	ἔσται σκεῦος εἰς τιμήν	1	he will be a container for honor	The implication is that God will be able to give important assignments to a person who is free from wrong associations or activities. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “he will be someone to whom God can give important assignments” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2TI	2	21	mh63		ἔσται σκεῦος εἰς τιμήν, ἡγιασμένον εὔχρηστον τῷ Δεσπότῃ, εἰς πᾶν ἔργον ἀγαθὸν ἡτοιμασμένον	1	having been sanctified, useful to the Master, having been prepared for every good work	These four phrases could relate in one of two ways. (1) The ones beginning with **having been** give the reason for the phrase before them. Alternate translation: “he will be a container for honor because he has been sanctified, and he will be useful to the Master because he has been prepared for every good work” or (2) All four phrases could simply be describing the person. Alternate translation: “he will be a container for honor, someone who is sanctified, useful to the Master, and ready for every good work”
2TI	2	21	p063	figs-activepassive	ἡγιασμένον	1	having been sanctified	If your language does not use passive verbal forms, you can use an active form to express this same idea, and you can say who did the action.

2TI	2	21	nl5d	figs-metaphor	ἡγιασμένον	1	having been sanctified	If this phrase is continuing the metaphor of objects in a house, then Paul is referring to a person who is free from wrong associations or activities as if he were a precious object whose owner keeps it in a special place. Whether this phrase is continuing the metaphor or not, it still expresses the idea of being “dedicated” for a special purpose. Alternate translation: “whom God has set apart for a special purpose” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2TI	2	21	p064	figs-metaphor	εὔχρηστον τῷ Δεσπότῃ	1	useful to the Master	In the context of the metaphor of the house, Paul speaks of God figuratively as the head of the household. Alternate translation: “useful to God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2TI	2	21	p065	figs-activepassive	εἰς πᾶν ἔργον ἀγαθὸν ἡτοιμασμένον	1	having been prepared for every good work	If your language does not use passive verbal forms, you can use an active form to express this same idea. Alternate translation: “who has gotten himself ready to do any good work” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

He speaks of these positive things as if Timothy should run towards them because they will do him good. Alternate translation: “be eager to do what is right, to believe in God, to love God and others, and to live in peace with people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2TI	2	22	p067	figs-abstractnouns	δικαιοσύνην, πίστιν, ἀγάπην, εἰρήνην	1	righteousness, faith, love, and peace	If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the ideas behind the abstract nouns **righteousness**, **faith**, **love**, and **peace** with equivalent expressions. Alternate translation: “do what is right, believe in God, love other people, and live peacefully with other people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2TI	2	22	hg99		μετὰ τῶν ἐπικαλουμένων τὸν Κύριον ἐκ καθαρᾶς καρδίας	1	with those who call on the Lord from a clean heart	This likely means that Paul wants Timothy to pursue these positive things together with others who are sincere in their faith. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could put this phrase at the beginning of Paul’s command to Timothy, as in the UST, before **pursue**. Alternate translation: “together with those who worship the Lord with sincere intentions”
2TI	2	22	gl3q	figs-idiom	τῶν ἐπικαλουμένων τὸν Κύριον	1	those who call on the Lord	The expression **call on the Lord** is an idiom that means to trust and worship the Lord. Alternate translation: “those who worship the Lord” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

2TI	2	23	tmf7	figs-metonymy	τὰς…μωρὰς καὶ ἀπαιδεύτους ζητήσεις παραιτοῦ	1	avoid foolish and ignorant questions	Paul refers to certain kinds of discussions figuratively by association with the kind of questions that people might ask that would lead to these discussions or by association with the kind of people that would ask these questions. Alternate translation: “do not become involved in foolish and ignorant discussions” or “do not allow people to involve you in discussions that they start because they are foolish and ignorant” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
2TI	2	23	p069	figs-doublet	μωρὰς καὶ ἀπαιδεύτους ζητήσεις	1	foolish and ignorant questions	Paul may be using the words **foolish** and **ignorant** together to emphasize a single idea. Alternate translation: “very stupid questions” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

2TI	2	24	p072	figs-metaphor	οὐ δεῖ μάχεσθαι	1	must not battle	Paul uses the term **battle** figuratively to describe arguments. Alternate translation: “must not argue” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

2TI	3	intro	k2cr			0		# 2 Timothy 03 General Notes<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>Many scholars understand the **last days** to mean the entire time from when Jesus first came to when he will return, which includes Paul’s time. If so, then what Paul teaches in this chapter about being persecuted applies to all believers. But some scholars understand the **last days** to mean a time in the future just before Jesus returns. If that is the meaning, then Paul is prophesying in verses 1-9 and 13 about those days. If possible, translators should be careful not to let how they understand this issue affect how they translate these verses. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lastday]])
2TI	3	1	g65r	figs-idiom	ἐν ἐσχάταις ἡμέραις	1	in the last days	Paul is using the term **days** figuratively to refer to a particular time. Alternate translation: “during the period of time before the end” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

The Bible does not record their names, but according to Jewish tradition their names were Jannes and Jambres. These men wanted to show that Pharaoh did not have to listen to Moses or obey Yahweh.

2TI	3	9	mv4j	figs-hyperbole	ἡ…ἄνοια αὐτῶν ἔκδηλος ἔσται πᾶσιν	1	their foolishness will be obvious to all	The word **all** is a generalization.

In other words, Paul is saying that God and Jesus Christ are commanding Timothy through Paul.<br><br>### Crown<br><br>Scripture uses the image of a crown to represent different things. In this chapter, Paul describes Christ as awarding a crown to believers as a metaphor for the reward that Christ will give them for having lived rightly on this earth.
