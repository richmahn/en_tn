front:intro	sa9c				0	# Introduction to the Gospel of Matthew\n\n## Part 1: General Introduction\n\n### Outline of the book of Matthew\n\n1. The birth of Jesus Christ and the beginning of his ministry (1:1-4:25)\n1. Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount (5:1-7:28)\n1. Jesus illustrates the kingdom of God through acts of healing (8:1-9:34)\n1. Jesus teaches about mission and the kingdom (9:35-10:42)\n1. Jesus teaches about the gospel of the kingdom of God. Opposition to Jesus begins. (11:1-12:50)\n1. Jesus tells parables about the kingdom of God (13:1-52)\n1. Further opposition to Jesus and misunderstanding of the kingdom of God (13:53-17:57)\n1. Jesus teaches about life in the kingdom of God (18:1-35)\n1. Jesus ministers in Judea (19:1-22:46)\n1. Jesus teaches about the final judgment and salvation (23:1-25:46)\n1. The crucifixion of Jesus, his death and resurrection (26:1-28:19)\n\n### What is the book of Matthew about?\n\nThe Gospel of Matthew is one of four books in the New Testament that describe some of the life of Jesus Christ. The authors of the Gospels wrote about different aspects of who Jesus was and what he did. Matthew showed that Jesus was the Messiah, and God would save Israel through him. Matthew often explained that Jesus fulfilled the Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah. This may indicate that he expected most of his first readers to be Jewish. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/christ]])\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nTranslators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “The Gospel of Matthew,” or “The Gospel according to Matthew.” Or they may choose a title that may be clearer, such as, “The Good News about Jesus that Matthew wrote.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])\n\n### Who wrote the book of Matthew?\n\nThe book does not give the name of the author. However, since early Christian times, most Christians have thought that the author was the Apostle Matthew.\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### What is the “kingdom of heaven?”\n\nMatthew spoke of the “kingdom of heaven” in the same way that other Gospel writers spoke of the kingdom of God. The kingdom of heaven represents God ruling over all people and all creation everywhere. Those whom God accepts into his kingdom will be blessed. They will live with God forever.\n\n### What were the teaching methods of Jesus?\n\nThe people regarded Jesus as a rabbi. A rabbi is a teacher of God’s law. Jesus taught in ways similar those of other religious teachers in Israel. He had students who followed him wherever he went. These students were called disciples. He often told parables. Parables are stories that teach moral lessons. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/disciple]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/parable]])\n\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\n\n### What are the Synoptic Gospels?\n\nThe Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke are called the Synoptic Gospels because they have many similar passages. The word “synoptic” means to “see together.”\n\nThe texts are considered “parallel” when they are the same or almost the same among two or three gospels. When translating parallel passages, translators should use the same wording and make them as similar as possible.\n\n### Why does Jesus refer to himself as the “Son of Man”?\n\nIn the gospels, Jesus calls himself the “Son of Man.” It is a reference to Daniel 7:13-14. In that passage there is a person described as a “son of man.” That means the person was someone who looked like a human being. God gave authority to the son of man to rule over the nations forever. All the people will worship him forever.\n\nJews of Jesus’ time did not use “Son of Man” as a title for anyone. Therefore, Jesus used it for himself to help them understand who he truly was. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sonofman]])\n\nTranslating the title “Son of Man” can be difficult in many languages. Readers may misunderstand a literal translation. Translators can consider alternatives, such as “The Human One.” It may also be helpful to include a footnote to explain the title.\n\n### What are the major issues in the text of the book of Matthew?\n\nThe following verses are found in older versions of the Bible but are not included in most modern versions:\n* “Bless those who curse you; do good to those who hate you” (5:44)\n* “For yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen” (6:13)\n* “But this kind of demon does not go out except with prayer and fasting” (17:21)\n* “For the Son of Man came to save that which was lost” (18:11)\n* “Many are called, but few are chosen” (20:16)\n* “Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you devour widows’ houses, while you make a show of long prayers. You will therefore receive greater condemnation.” (23:14)\n\nTranslators are advised not to include these passages. However, if in the translators’ region, there are older versions of the Bible that include one or more of these passages, the translators may include them. If they are included, they should be put inside square brackets ([]) to indicate that they were probably not original to Matthew’s Gospel. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
1:intro	y7kk				0	# Matthew 1 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n1. The birth of Jesus Christ and the beginning of his ministry (1:1-4:25)\n      * The genealogy of Jesus (1:1–17)\n      * Jesus’ parents and birth (1:18–25)\n\nSome translations set a quotation from the Old Testament farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text. The ULT does this in [1:23](../01/23.md) with the quote from [Isaiah 7:14](../isa/07/14.md).\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Genealogy\n\nA genealogy is a list that records a person’s ancestors or descendants. Genealogies were important to the Jewish people because family lineage is how they decided how someone functioned in society. For instance, if someone was a descendant of Aaron, they were able to become priests. Similarly, if someone was a descendant of King David, they were able to become a king. This genealogy shows that Jesus was clearly a descendant of King David, and therefore, was able to become king.\n\n### The word “fathered”\n\nWhen Matthew uses the word “fathered,” he only means that the older man was an ancestor of the younger man. In most cases, the older man is the direct father of the younger man. However, sometimes the older man is a grandfather (for example, Josiah is the grandfather of Jechoniah) or a more distant ancestor (for example, Joram is the great-great-grandfather of Ozias). If possible, use a word that indicates that the older man is the ancestor of the younger man without stating that the older man is the father of the younger man. If you need to be more specific, the UST provides one way to do so.\n\n### Three groups of 14\n\nMatthew concludes the genealogy by dividing it up three groups of 14 generations. He divides the groups by using two key events in Israel’s history: David starting his dynasty and the Babylonians capturing Jerusalem. In order to count 14 generations from Abraham until David, both Abraham and David need to be included. To count 14 generations from David until the Babylonian deportation, David needs to be excluded but Jechoniah needs to be included. To count 14 generations from the Babylonian deportation until the Christ, both Jechoniah and Christ need to be included. The ULT and UST divide the section into paragraphs based on the divisions. Consider how you might show these divisions in your translation.\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Stating that Mary became pregnant\n\nIn [1:18](../01/18.md), [1:20](../01/20.md), and [1:23](../01/23.md), Matthew refers to a woman becoming pregnant, but he excludes the involvement of a man in the process. He uses the phrases “to have in the womb” and “having been conceived in her” to avoid referring to the male role in conception. In your translation, you should not identify the Holy Spirit as the one who performed the normal male role, since the Holy Spirit did not have sex with Mary. Instead, the Holy Spirit performed a miracle. So, use a form that does not refer to the male role in conception or a form that denies that a man was involved.\n\n### Translating names\n\nIn the genealogy, Matthew uses specific Greek spellings of names. These spellings do not always match the Hebrew spellings of the names that you can read in the Old Testament. The ULT and UST spell out how these names sound as Matthew wrote them in Greek. In contrast, some translations spell out these names as they appear in the Old Testament. Consider spelling these names as do other translations that your readers might be familiar with. Otherwise, consider whether your team wishes to spell names in the same way throughout the Bible or whether you will spell them differently in different places. If you do spell them differently in different places, you may need to include footnotes that provide other spellings.
1:1	n4xw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	βίβλος γενέσεως	1	Here, the phrase **book of the genealogy** could refer to: (1) just the list of Jesus’ ancestors that follows in [1:2–17](../01/02.md). Alternate translation: “The book of the ancestry” (2) the list of Jesus’ ancestors as well as information about his birth and childhood (see [1:2–2:23](../01/02.md)). Alternate translation: “The book of the ancestors and birth”

1:1	nlc8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	βίβλος	1	Here, **book** represents a written record. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your language or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “The written record” or “The list”
1:1	vpg1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	υἱοῦ Δαυεὶδ, υἱοῦ Ἀβραάμ	1	Here, Matthew is speaking of a male descendant as if he were a **son**.

1:1	zw1t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	υἱοῦ Ἀβραάμ	1	Here Matthew could mean: (1) that David is a **son of Abraham**. Alternate translation: “who was a son of Abraham” (2) that Jesus is a **son of Abraham**. Alternate translation: “and also son of Abraham”
1:2	cyc6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ἀβραὰμ ἐγέννησεν τὸν Ἰσαάκ, Ἰσαὰκ δὲ ἐγέννησεν τὸν Ἰακώβ, Ἰακὼβ δὲ ἐγέννησεν τὸν Ἰούδαν καὶ τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς αὐτοῦ	1	Here Matthew begins a list of Jesus’ ancestors. Consider how people normally list ancestors in your language. Use the same wording throughout the whole list ([1:2–16](../01/02.md)). Possible formats are: (1) “Abraham’s son was Isaac, and Isaac’s son was Jacob, and Jacob’s sons were Judah and his brothers” (2) “Isaac’s father was Abraham, and Jacob’s father was Isaac, and Judah’s father was Jacob” (3) “Abraham fathered Isaac, who fathered Jacob, who fathered Judah and his brothers”

1:6	msbw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐκ τῆς τοῦ Οὐρίου	1	**Uriah** was one of the leaders of the Israelite army, a leader whom **David** trusted. However, David saw Uriah’s wife, named Bathsheba, and wanted her for himself. He had Uriah killed and took Uriah’s wife for himself. You can read about this story in [2 Samual 11:1–27](../2sa/11/01.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could include some extra information if your readers would not know this story. Alternate translation: “by Bathsheba the wife of Uriah, whom he had killed”
1:7	nc4v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Σολομὼν δὲ ἐγέννησεν τὸν Ῥοβοάμ, Ῥοβοὰμ δὲ ἐγέννησεν τὸν Ἀβιά, Ἀβιὰ δὲ ἐγέννησεν τὸν Ἀσάφ	1	This is a continuation of the list of Jesus’ ancestors that began in [1:2](../01/02.md). Use the same format as you used in the previous verses.

1:8-9	ei0o		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	Ἰωρὰμ δὲ ἐγέννησεν τὸν Ὀζείαν, Ὀζείας δὲ ἐγέννησεν τὸν Ἰωαθάμ	1	In these two verses, Matthew lists **Joram**, **Ozias**, and **Jotham**. In the list of kings in 1 Chronicles 3, however, there are four names between **Joram** and **Jotham** (see  [1 Chronicles 3:11–12](../1co/03/11.md)), not one. So, Matthew has not mentioned three of these kings, and the word translated **fathered** only requires the older person to be an ancestor of the younger person, who could be a son, grandson, great-grandson, or even great-great-grandson. It is unclear exactly where in the list Matthew leaves out the three kings. He could be using the name **Ozias**: (1) to refer to the king that 1 Chronicles names “Azariah.” In this case, **Ozias** is the great-great-grandson of **Joram** and the father of **Jotham**. Alternate translation: “and Joram was the great-great-grandfather of Ozias, and Ozias fathered Jotham” (2) to refer to the king that 1 Chronicles names “Ahaziah.” In this case, **Ozias** is the son of **Joram** and the great-great-grandfather of **Jotham**. Alternate translation: “and Joram fathered Ozias, and Ozias was the great-great-grandfather of Jotham”
1:9	m35z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ὀζείας δὲ ἐγέννησεν τὸν Ἰωαθάμ, Ἰωαθὰμ δὲ ἐγέννησεν τὸν Ἀχάζ, Ἀχὰζ δὲ ἐγέννησεν τὸν Ἑζεκίαν	1	This is a continuation of the list of Jesus’ ancestors that began in [1:2](../01/02.md). Use the same format as you used in the previous verses.
1:9	lj7z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ὀζείας	1	Many translations spell **Ozias** as “Uzziah.” Consider how translations with which your readers might be familiar spell this name. Alternate translation: “Uzziah”
1:10	zgmk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ἑζεκίας δὲ ἐγέννησεν τὸν Μανασσῆ, Μανασσῆς δὲ ἐγέννησεν τὸν Ἀμώς, Ἀμὼς δὲ ἐγέννησεν τὸν Ἰωσίαν	1	This is a continuation of the list of Jesus’ ancestors that began in [1:2](../01/02.md). Use the same format as you used in the previous verses.
1:10	odm9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	τὸν Ἀμώς, Ἀμὼς	1	Many translations spell **Amos** as “Amon.” Consider how translations with which your readers might be familiar spell this name. Alternate translation: “Amon … Amon”
1:11	t8ob		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ἰωσίας δὲ ἐγέννησεν τὸν Ἰεχονίαν καὶ τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς αὐτοῦ	1	This is a continuation of the list of Jesus’ ancestors that began in [1:2](../01/02.md). Use the same format as you used in the previous verses.
1:11	c2bh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	Ἰωσίας & ἐγέννησεν τὸν Ἰεχονίαν	1	In [1 Chronicles 3:15–16](../1ch/03/15.md), **Josiah** is listed as the father of Jehoiakim, who is the father of **Jechoniah**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could clarify that **Josiah** was the grandfather of **Jechoniah**. Alternate translation: “Josiah fathered the father of Jechoniah”
1:11	vzs3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship	τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς αὐτοῦ	1	If you must specify whether these **brothers** were older or younger, it is more likely that they were younger brothers. Alternate translation: “his younger brothers”
1:11	v2im		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐπὶ τῆς μετοικεσίας Βαβυλῶνος	1	Here Matthew refers to how the Babylonians conquered Jerusalem and took most of the people away to the country of Babylon. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that makes this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “when the Babylonians captured Jerusalem and took many people away”
1:12	y7cx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	μετὰ & τὴν μετοικεσίαν Βαβυλῶνος	1	Here Matthew refers to the same event that he referred to in [1:11](../01/11.md). Express the idea in the same way you did there. Alternate translation: “after the Babylonians captured Jerusalem and took many people away”
1:12	ua1g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ἰεχονίας ἐγέννησεν τὸν Σαλαθιήλ, Σαλαθιὴλ δὲ ἐγέννησεν τὸν Ζοροβαβέλ	1	This is a continuation of the list of Jesus’ ancestors that began in [1:2](../01/02.md). Use the same format as you used in the previous verses.
1:12	ya86		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	τὸν Σαλαθιήλ, Σαλαθιὴλ	1	Many translations spell **Salathiel** as “Shealtiel.” Consider how translations with which your readers might be familiar spell this name. Alternate translation: “Shealtiel … Shealtiel”
1:12	qqo6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	Σαλαθιὴλ & ἐγέννησεν τὸν Ζοροβαβέλ	1	In [1 Chronicles 3:19](../1co/03/19.md), a brother of **Salathiel** named Pedaiah is listed as the father of **Zerubbabel**. However, early Greek translations of [1 Chronicles 3:19](../1co/03/19.md) list **Salathiel** as the father of **Zerubabbel**. Matthew most likely used a Bible like these early Greek translations, so he probably intended his readers to think of **Salathiel** as the father of **Zerubbabel** and not as his uncle. If it would be helpful in your language, you could include some of this information in a footnote. 
1:13	dcab		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ζοροβαβὲλ δὲ ἐγέννησεν τὸν Ἀβιούδ, Ἀβιοὺδ δὲ ἐγέννησεν τὸν Ἐλιακείμ, Ἐλιακεὶμ δὲ ἐγέννησεν τὸν Ἀζώρ	1	This is a continuation of the list of Jesus’ ancestors that began in [1:2](../01/02.md). Use the same format as you used in the previous verses.

1:16	wdbo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Μαρίας	1	The word **Mary** is the name of a woman.
1:16	b3bm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐξ ἧς ἐγεννήθη Ἰησοῦς	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “who gave birth to Jesus”\n
1:16	ovf4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish	ὁ λεγόμενος Χριστός	1	Here, the phrase **the one called Christ** distinguishes this **Jesus** from any other people named Jesus.

Alternate translation: “the Jesus called Christ” or “specifically the one who is called Christ”
1:16	z2rg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ὁ λεγόμενος Χριστός	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who did the action, you could use an indefinite subject. Alternate translation: “whom people call Christ”
1:17	vdhv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀπὸ Ἀβραὰμ ἕως Δαυεὶδ γενεαὶ δεκατέσσαρες, καὶ ἀπὸ Δαυεὶδ ἕως τῆς μετοικεσίας Βαβυλῶνος γενεαὶ δεκατέσσαρες, καὶ ἀπὸ τῆς μετοικεσίας Βαβυλῶνος ἕως τοῦ Χριστοῦ γενεαὶ δεκατέσσαρες	1	In order to count 14 generations **from Abraham until David**, both Abraham and David need to be included. To count 14 generations **from David until the Babylonian deportation**, David needs to be excluded but Jechoniah needs to be included. To count 14 generations **from the Babylonian deportation until the Christ**, both Jechoniah and Jesus need to be included. Consider how you might express the calculations so that they match with the list. Alternate translation: “from Abraham up to and including David were 14 generations, and after David and until the Babylonian deportation were 14 generations, and starting with the Babylonian deportation and counting up to and including the Christ were 14 generations”
1:17	z5xw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τῆς μετοικεσίας Βαβυλῶνος	-1	Here Matthew refers to the same event that he referred to in [1:11–12](../01/11.md). Express the idea in the same way you did in those verses. Alternate translation: “the Babylonians captured Jerusalem and took many people away … when that happened”
1:18	gnl6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1	Here, the word **Now** introduces a new section in this book that focuses on **the birth of Jesus Christ**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a new section, or you could leave **Now** untranslated. Alternate translation: “Next,”
1:18	cqt1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	μνηστευθείσης & τῷ Ἰωσήφ	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who did the action, it is clear from the context that it was her parents. Alternate translation: “whose parents promised to Joseph that she would marry him”
1:18	xvk1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	πρὶν & συνελθεῖν αὐτοὺς	1	Matthew is referring in a polite way to having sex by using the phrase **came together**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a polite way of referring to this in your language, or you could state this plainly. Alternate translation: “before they consummated the marriage” or “before they had sex”
1:18	in4a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	εὑρέθη ἐν γαστρὶ ἔχουσα	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “was having in the womb” or “realized that she was having in the womb”
1:18	q6y8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐν γαστρὶ ἔχουσα	1	Here, the phrase **having in the womb** refers to being pregnant. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “to be with child” or “to be pregnant”
1:18	a71d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐκ Πνεύματος Ἁγίου	1	The phrase **from the Holy Spirit** indicates that Mary did not become pregnant in the usual way, that is, by having sex with a man.

1:19	h941		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1	Here, the word **Now** introduces the next major event in the story.

1:19	yufg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	Ἰωσὴφ & ὁ ἀνὴρ αὐτῆς	1	Matthew implies that Joseph did not know that the baby came from the Holy Spirit. Joseph thought that Mary had become pregnant after having sex with another man, which is why he wanted **to divorce her**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could clarify that Joseph did not know that the Holy Spirit had caused Mary to be pregnant. Alternate translation: “Joseph her husband thought that she had been unfaithful, so”
1:19	pu3p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὁ ἀνὴρ αὐτῆς & ἀπολῦσαι αὐτήν	1	As the previous verse shows (see [1:18](../01/18.md)), Mary and Joseph were not yet married. In their culture, however, being “engaged” was a promise to marry, so Matthew can refer to **Joseph** as Mary’s **husband**. He can also refer to breaking the engagement as divorce. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use clarify that Matthew is referring to an engaged man breaking the engagement. Alternate translation: “her fiancé … to break the engagement with her”

Alternate translation: “the one having been conceived in Mary is from the Holy Spirit, so you should not fear to take her as your wife”
1:20	va5e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τὸ & ἐν αὐτῇ γεννηθὲν ἐκ Πνεύματός ἐστιν Ἁγίου	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

1:21	ifq8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense	καλέσεις	1	Here the angel gives a command using the future tense.

1:22	e8ld		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	λέγοντος	1	In Matthew’s culture, **saying** was a normal way to introduce a quotation from an important text, in this case, the Old Testament book written by Isaiah the prophet (see [Isaiah 7:14](../isa/07/14.md)).

1:23	wlft		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	ἰδοὺ	1	Here, the word **Behold** draws the attention of the audience and asks them to listen carefully.

1:23	c6yk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἡ παρθένος	1	Although the word translated **virgin** occasionally refers to any young woman, whether she has had sex or not, the word normally refers to a young woman who has not had sex. This is what Matthew means here, so you should use a word or phrase that refers to a woman who is old enough to get married but who has not yet had sex. Alternate translation: “the marriageable woman who has not had sex”
1:23	nlp1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐν γαστρὶ ἕξει	1	Here, the phrase **have in her womb** refers to a woman being pregnant.

See how you translated the euphemism for having sex in [1:18](../01/18.md). Alternate translation: “he did not consummate the marriage with her” or “he did not sleep with her”
1:25	v3xe		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	οὐκ ἐγίνωσκεν & ἐκάλεσεν & αὐτοῦ	1	Here, both times the pronoun **he** occurs, it refers to Joseph.

2:intro	dz1c				0	# Matthew 2 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n1. The birth of Jesus Christ and the beginning of his ministry (1:1-4:25)\n      * The visit of the learned men (2:1–12)\n      * Joseph, Mary, and Jesus escape to Egypt (2:13–15)\n      * Herod kills the baby boys in Bethlehem (2:16–18)\n      * Joseph, Mary, and Jesus settle in Nazareth (2:19–23)\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in verses 6 and 18, which are quotations from the Old Testament.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### “Learned men”\n\nIn this chapter, Matthew tells about how “learned men” from countries to the east of Judea visited Jesus in order to worship him. These were educated men who studied dreams and stars in the sky to try to learn about what was happening and what would happen in the future. Matthew does not present them as if they are evil. Consider how you might naturally refer to this kind of educated man. The ULT provides a general translation (“learned men”), and the UST illustrates how to use a descriptive phrase (“scholars who studied the stars”). \n\n### The star\n\nThe learned men journey to Jerusalem because they see a specific star. Matthew further describes how this star moved in the sky until it was directly above where Jesus was living. It is not clear exactly what this star was. Scholars have suggested that it was one of the planets, a shooting star, a comet, or a bright angel. If possible, use a word or phrase that refers generally to a natural source of light in the sky. If you need to be more specific, could use a word or phrase that refers to stars, especially the kinds of stars that move or appear to move in the sky. \n\n### The journeys of Joseph, Mary, and Jesus\n\nIn this chapter, Matthew narrates several journeys that Joseph, Mary, and Jesus took. At first, they are in Bethlehem, which is a city near the capital city of Judea, Jerusalem. After the learned men visit, God warns Joseph to journey to Egypt, a country to the southwest of Judea, in order to escape from Herod, the king of Judea. After Herod dies, God tells Joseph that he can take his family back to Israel. However, he does not take his family back to Judea, because Herod’s son is now reigning in Herod’s place. Instead, he and his family travel to Nazareth, a city in the region of Galilee, which is north of Judea. When Matthew uses movement words, make sure that your translation fits with these journeys. 
2:1	sdst		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	δὲ	1	Here, the word **Now** introduces the next major event in the story.

2:2	zj7c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	αὐτοῦ τὸν ἀστέρα	1	Here, the learned men are using the possessive form to describe a **star** that marks or identifies the **King of the Jews**.

2:2	n3a2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐν τῇ ἀνατολῇ	1	Here, the phrase **in the east** could refer to: (1) when the star appeared above the horizon. Alternate translation: “when it rose” (2) where the star appeared in the sky. Alternate translation: “as it rose in the east”

2:2	v248		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	προσκυνῆσαι	1	The phrase **to worship** can be used for how one behaves before God, but it can also be used for how one behaves before a king. Matthew uses this phrase because the learned men considered Jesus to be a king, but Matthew considers Jesus to be God. So, both meanings of the phrase **to worship** are included here. If possible, use a form that could be used for how one acts before both kings and God. If you must make a distinction, it is recommended that you use a form that refers to worshiping God. Alternate translation: “to bow before” or “to kneel before him to honor”

2:3	mc1r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	πᾶσα	1	Matthew says **all** here as a generalization for emphasis. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different way to express the emphasis. Alternate translation: “most of” or “the majority of”

If you use the following alternate translation, you will need to delete the comma at the end of the previous verse and only use one quotation mark at the end of this verse.

3:intro	a6h3				0	# Matthew 3 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n1. The birth of Jesus Christ and the beginning of his ministry (1:1-4:25)\n      * The ministry of John the Baptist (3:1–12)\n      * John baptizes Jesus (3:13–17)\n\nSome translations set quotations from the Old Testament farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text. The ULT does this with the quotation from the Old Testament in verse 3.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### John the Baptist\n\nIn this chapter, Matthew introduces John the Baptist, who preached in the wilderness. Matthew describes his clothing and his food in ways that resemble the prophet Elijah. John preaches a message that called for repentance. He prepared the way for Jesus to begin his ministry.\n\n### Baptism\n\nThe word “baptism” refers to a ritual washing, usually with water. John’s baptism is similar to Christian baptism, but it does not mean exactly the same thing (see [Acts 18:24–26](../act/18/24.md)). John says that his baptism is “for repentance” (see [3:11](../03/11.md)). Most likely, it symbolized the removal of the sins that people were repenting of and the beginning of a new way of living. However, even Jesus received this baptism despite the fact that he did not need to repent of any sins. In this case, the baptism may symbolize complete dedication to God. Consider how you might refer to this kind of ritual washing in your language.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Fruit tree metaphor\n\nIn [3:8](../03/08.md) and [3:10](../03/10.md), John speaks of people as if they were fruit trees. He says that people need to produce “good fruit,” just like fruit trees should. However, every fruit tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and burned. In the same way, people who do not do what is right will be judged and punished. If possible, preserve this metaphor or express it in simile form.\n\n### Wheat harvest metaphor\n\nIn [3:12](../03/12.md), John speaks of people as if they were parts of wheat plants. People who obey God are like the edible part of the wheat plant, the grain. People who disobey God are like the inedible parts of the wheat plant, the stalk and husk. Just as a farmer separates the grain from the stalks and the husks, so God will separate people into those who obey him and those who do not. Then, just as the farmer stores the grain and burns the stalks and husks, so God will save those who obey him and punish those who do not. If possible, preserve this metaphor or express it in simile form.
3:1	xp3z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	δὲ	1	Here, the word **Now** introduces the next major event in the story.

3:1	yoaf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐν & ταῖς ἡμέραις ἐκείναις	1	Here, Matthew uses the term **days** to refer to a particular period of time.

3:1	tmu9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ταῖς ἡμέραις ἐκείναις	1	Here, the phrase **those days** refers to the period of time before Jesus began his public ministry. During this time, Jesus lived in Nazareth with his family. Matthew is not referring to the period of time in which Joseph, Mary, and Jesus traveled back from Egypt to Galilee. If it would be helpful in your language, you could refer more explicitly to the time period in which Jesus lived in Nazareth. Alternate translation: “the days when Jesus lived in Nazareth” or “the days before Jesus began his ministry”
3:1	ifa0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	παραγίνεται Ἰωάννης ὁ Βαπτιστὴς	1	This phrase introduces a new character into the story. If your language has an expression of its own that serves this purpose, you could use it here. Alternate translation: “there is a man named John the Baptist” or “a man called John the Baptist appears”
3:1	bcdv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense	παραγίνεται	1	To call attention to a development in the story, Matthew uses the present tense in past narration. If it would not be natural to do that in your language, you could use the past tense in your translation. Alternate translation: “came”
3:2	nc62		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	λέγων	1	Consider natural ways of introducing direct quotations in your language. Alternate translation: “and he said”

Alternate translation: “The kingdom of the heavens is near, so repent”
3:2	hvx8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἤγγικεν	1	Here Matthew uses this phrase in the sense of **near** in time. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “is about to begin” or “is about to happen”
3:3	et5g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	γάρ	1	Here, the word **For** introduces a further explanation of what Matthew has said about John the Baptist. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces an explanation, or you could leave **For** untranslated. Alternate translation: “In fact,” or “Now”
3:3	fl4v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ὁ ῥηθεὶς	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “the one about whom the Lord spoke”
3:3	qt02		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	λέγοντος	1	In Matthew’s culture, **saying** was a normal way to introduce a quotation from an important text, in this case, the Old Testament book written by Isaiah the prophet (see [Isaiah 40:3](../isa/40/03.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase that indicates that Matthew is quoting from an important text. Alternate translation: “who wrote in the book of Isaiah” or “who declared”
3:3	s62r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	φωνὴ	1	Isaiah is using **voice** to represent the person who is speaking.

If you do, you will need to delete the single quotation mark at the end of this quotation. Alternate translation: “the wilderness that people must make ready the way of the Lord, that they must make his paths straight”\n
3:3	n7lh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	ἑτοιμάσατε τὴν ὁδὸν Κυρίου; εὐθείας ποιεῖτε τὰς τρίβους αὐτοῦ	1	These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if it would be helpful to your readers, you could connect the phrases with a connecting word in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional.

Otherwise, you can use a phrase that would express the meaning. Alternate translation: “tool for winnowing grain” or “tool for tossing seeds”
3:12	r2ua		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τὴν ἅλωνα αὐτοῦ	1	The **threshing floor** was the place where harvested wheat was processed to separate the grain from the chaff.

4:intro	hgw2				0	# Matthew 4 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n1. The birth of Jesus Christ and the beginning of his ministry (1:1-4:25)\n      * The devil tempts Jesus (4:1–11)\n      * Jesus begins his public ministry (4:12–17)\n      * Jesus calls four of his disciples (4:18–22)\n      * Summary of Jesus’ early ministry (4:23–25)\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in [4:15–16](../04/15.md), which are words from the Old Testament.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### The Devil\n\nThe devil, also named Satan, is an evil spiritual being. In this chapter, he tempts Jesus to disobey God. He even quotes the Bible to try to convince Jesus to disobey. Consider how you might naturally refer to a powerful and evil spiritual being. \n\n### Temptation\n\nIn [4:1–11](../04/01.md), Matthew tells the story of how Jesus was tempted by the devil. The devil tried to convince Jesus to do things that would be disobedient. Jesus already knew how he was supposed to live his life and how he was supposed to die on the cross. The devil tempted Jesus to act in a different way. In response, Jesus quotes the Bible and does not do what the devil tempts him to do. \n\n### Fishermen\n\nFour of Jesus’ first disciples (Peter, Andrew, James, and John) were fishermen. In their culture, fishermen usually stood on the shore or in a boat and threw a net into the water. The edges of the net had weights on it, so the net sank into the water and trapped any fish beneath it. Then, fishermen would put on a rope to close the net and haul it to shore or onto the boat. If people in your culture do not fish or do not fish in that way, consider how much information you need to provide to help your readers understand the story. 
4:1	k51m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	τότε	1	Here, the word **Then** introduces the next major event in the story. It does not indicate how soon this event happened after the events that Matthew has already narrated.

The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words.

4:11	b0p5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense	ἀφίησιν	1	To call attention to a development in the story, Matthew uses the present tense in past narration. If it would not be natural to do that in your language, you could use the past tense in your translation. Alternate translation: “left”
4:11	ko5d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	ἰδοὺ	1	Here, the word **behold** draws the attention of the audience and asks them to listen carefully.

Alternate translation: “picture this” or “suddenly”

Alternate translation: “the king had arrested John”
4:13	pph4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καταλιπὼν τὴν Ναζαρὰ	1	Here Matthew implies that when Jesus “withdrew into Galilee,” he first went to the city of **Nazareth**.

4:13	fgsd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	ἐλθὼν κατῴκησεν εἰς Καφαρναοὺμ	1	It may be more natural in your language to say where Jesus went before saying where he **lived**. If so, you could move **in Capernaum** so that it goes with **having come**. Alternate translation: “having come to Capernaum, he lived there”
4:13	knjg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὴν παραθαλασσίαν	1	Here Matthew is referring to **the sea** of Galilee. The town of **Capernaum** was at the edge of this sea.

4:14	bifn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	λέγοντος	1	In Matthew’s culture, **saying** was a normal way to introduce a quotation from an important text, in this case, the Old Testament book written by **Isaiah the prophet** (see [Isaiah 9:1–2](../isa/09/01.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase that indicates that Matthew is quoting from an important text. Alternate translation: “who wrote in the book of Isaiah” or “who declared”

Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including all three descriptions in your translation rather than combining them. However, if it would be helpful to your readers, you could connect the phrases with a word or phrase that indicates that these lines are all descriptions of one place. Alternate translation: “The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, which is the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, which is Galilee of the Gentiles”
4:15	se2r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὁδὸν θαλάσσης	1	The phrase **the way of the sea** could refer to: (1) areas near **the sea** of Galilee. Alternate translation: “the areas around the Sea of Galilee” (2) a road that ended at the Mediterranean **sea**. Alternate translation: “the road that goes to the Mediterranean sea”
4:15	d8ut		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πέραν τοῦ Ἰορδάνου	1	Here Isaiah could be referring to: (1) areas to the west of the Jordan River.

4:15	uv17		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	Γαλιλαία τῶν ἐθνῶν	1	Here, Isaiah is using the possessive form to describe **Galilee** as a place where **Gentiles** live. If this is not clear in your language, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: “Galilee, home of Gentiles”
4:16	fsl6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	ὁ λαὸς ὁ καθήμενος ἐν σκοτίᾳ φῶς εἶδεν μέγα, καὶ τοῖς καθημένοις ἐν χώρᾳ καὶ σκιᾷ θανάτου, φῶς ἀνέτειλεν αὐτοῖς	1	These two clauses mean basically the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if it would be helpful to your readers, you could connect the phrases with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional.

5:intro	awz8				0	# Matthew 5 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n2. Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount (5:1-7:28)\n      * The Beatitudes (5:1–12)\n      * Salt and light (5:13–16)\n      * The law and righteousness (5:17–20)\n      * Moses’ law and Jesus’ commands (5:21–48)\n        * Murder and anger (5:21–26)\n        * Adultery and divorce (5:27–32)\n        * Oaths and promises (5:33–37)\n        * Punishment and retaliation (5:38–42)\n        * Loving everyone (5:43–48)\n\nMany people call the words in Matthew 5–7 the Sermon on the Mount. This is one long lesson that Jesus taught. Bibles divide this lesson into three chapters, but this can sometimes confuse the reader. If your translation divides the text into sections, be sure that the reader understands that the whole sermon is one large section.\n\nMatthew 5:3–10, known as the Beatitudes or Blessings, has been set farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text. This way of placing the words on the page highlights the poetic form of this section.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### The “Beatitudes”\n\nIn [5:3–12](../05/03.md), Jesus speaks nine blessings, or “Beatitudes.” He uses poetic form, repetition, and contrasting statements. Use forms in your language that people would recognize as poetry. See the notes on these verses for translation options.\n\n### “You have heard that it was said”\n\nWhen Jesus quotes commands that his audience would be familiar with, he uses a phrase like “you have heard that it was said.” Usually when he uses this phrase, he is quoting or summarizing commands directly from the Old Testament law. However, in [5:43](../05/43.md), he quotes a command from the Old Testament (“love your neighbor”) and then includes what some people would add to that command (“hate your enemy”). You may need to clarify that only the clause “love your neighbor” is from the Old Testament law. See the notes on each verse for information about what commands Jesus is quoting or summarizing. \n\n### Jesus and the law\n\nThroughout this chapter, Jesus quotes commands that his audience would be familiar with. Then, he introduces his response to these commands with a phrase like “but I say to you.” In each case, Jesus is not contradicting or annulling the commands from God that he quotes. Instead, Jesus is correcting misunderstandings about what these commands mean. He wants his disciples to apply the commands properly. Use a form that indicates that Jesus is clarifying the commands, not contradicting them. \n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Salt metaphor\n\nIn [5:13](../05/13.md), Jesus describes his disciples as if they were salt that seasons the world. He means that, just as salt preserves food and makes it taste better, so his disciples help save people in the world and make the world a better place. If possible, preserve the metaphor or express the idea in simile form. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n### Light metaphor\n\nIn [5:14–16](../05/14.md), Jesus describes his disciples as if they were lamp that gives light. He means specifically that their good deeds are like light that shines on other people, which allows these people to learn what is true and to praise God. If possible, preserve the metaphor or express the idea in simile form. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n### Hyperbole\n\nIn [5:29–30](../05/29.md), Jesus commands his disciples to cut off body parts that cause them to sin. He uses this extreme example of resisting sin in order to show his disciples how serious sin really is. He does not mean that believers should always cut off body parts when they sin. Jesus intends his commands to be shocking, however, so you should preserve the extreme language. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that indicates that Jesus’ commands are extreme language.\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Singular and plural forms of “you”\n\nIn this chapter, Jesus is talking to a large crowd of his followers. Throughout the chapter, Jesus switches between using you in the singular and you in the plural while he is talking to the same people. When he uses the singular, he is speaking about specific situations that each person in the crowd might experience. When he uses the plural, he is speaking generally to the crowd as a whole. You should assume that Jesus is using plural forms of “you” unless a note specifies that the forms are singular. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]] and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-crowd]])

In modern measurements, this is about 4,860 feet or 1,480 meters. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express this in terms of modern measurements, either in the text or a footnote. It is not important to the meaning of the passage be precise about the distance, so you could use round numbers. Alternate translation: “1,500 meters” or “one kilometer” or “5,000 feet”
5:41	zv6i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ὕπαγε μετ’ αὐτοῦ δύο	1	Jesus is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete. If it would be helpful in your language, you could supply these words from the context. Alternate translation: “go with him two miles”
5:41	s4kl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	αὐτοῦ	1	Although the term **him** is masculine, Jesus is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a phrase that makes this clear. Alternate translation: “him or her”
5:42	i90h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τῷ αἰτοῦντί σε, δός	1	Here Jesus does not specify what the person is **asking** for or what should be given. He does this to include many things that a person might ask for. If it would be helpful in your language, you could include a generic or general object. Alternate translation: “Give to the one asking you for anything” or “When a person asks you for anything, give it to him or her”
5:42	qkit		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd	σε, δός & σοῦ & μὴ ἀποστραφῇς	1	Even though Jesus is speaking to many disciples, he is addressing an individual situation, so **you** is singular throughout this verse. But if the singular form would not be natural in your language for someone who was speaking to a group of people, you could use the plural form of **you** in your translation.
5:42	h6j9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	μὴ ἀποστραφῇς	1	Here Jesus speaks of refusing to help someone as if it were turning away from that person.

5:42	znk7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	δανίσασθαι	1	Here, the word **borrow** usually indicates borrowing money. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “to borrow money”
5:43	fp6x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐρρέθη	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “God commanded” or “Moses said”
5:43	cyz3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	ἐρρέθη	1	Here Jesus quotes from the Old Testament scriptures. The words **Love your neighbor** are from [Leviticus 19:18](../lev/19/18.md). The words **hate your enemy** are what some people would say in addition to the quotation from the Old Testament. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could format these words in a different way and include this information in a footnote. Alternate translation: “people often quote the law by saying”\n
5:43	ufba		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	ἀγαπήσεις τὸν πλησίον σου, καὶ μισήσεις τὸν ἐχθρόν σου	1	Since the author of the quotation is addressing each specific person who is part of God’s people, the command here is singular. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that makes this clear. Alternate translation: “Each of you, love your neighbor and hate your enemy”
5:43	itz8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	τὸν πλησίον σου & τὸν ἐχθρόν σου	1	The words **neighbor** and **enemy** represent neighbors and enemies in general, not one particular neighbor or enemy. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a more natural expression. Alternate translation: “each of your neighbors … each of your enemies”
5:43	tqj3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τὸν πλησίον σου	1	Here Jesus refers to any member of one’s community or group as a **neighbor**. He is not referring just to people who live nearby. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “your countrymen” or “everyone who belongs to your group”
5:44	tudc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	δὲ	1	Here, the word **But** introduces a contrast with what Jesus said in the previous verse ([5:43](../05/43.md)). Jesus is not contradicting what God said about loving neighbors, but he is contradicting what some people say about hating enemies. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces this kind of contrast. Alternate translation: “However,” or “Yet”
5:44	vq8l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐγὼ & λέγω ὑμῖν	1	Jesus uses the clause **I say to you** to emphasize what he is about to say and to contrast it with what he quoted in the previous verse ([5:43](../05/43.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the emphatic contrast in another way. Alternate translation: “listen to this:” or “here is what you need to know:”
5:44	ogqi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	ἐχθροὺς ὑμῶν, καὶ προσεύχεσθε	1	Many ancient manuscripts only include these two commands in this verse. The ULT follows that reading. Other ancient manuscripts include the commands “bless the ones cursing you, do good to the ones hating you” between the words **enemies** and **and**. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of the ULT.\n
5:45	ir75		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	ὅπως	1	The connecting words **so that** introduce a goal or purpose relationship. The purpose for loving enemies and praying for persecutors (see [5:44](../05/44.md)) is to **be sons of your Father**. Use a connector in your language that makes it clear that this is the purpose. Alternate translation: “in order that”
5:45	my3d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	υἱοὶ τοῦ Πατρὸς ὑμῶν	1	Jesus speaks of his disciples as if God were their physical **Father**. He means that they have a father-son relationship with God, which indicates that they act or behave like God. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “spiritual sons of your spiritual Father” or “like God, whom you can call your Father”
5:45	jzu9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	Πατρὸς ὑμῶν	1	**Father** is an important title for the first person in the Trinity. He is the **Father** also of Jesus. 
5:45	syjz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐν οὐρανοῖς	1	Here, the phrase **in the heavens** identifies the location in which God **the Father** is specially present and from which he rules. If it would be helpful in your language, you make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “who is in the heavens”
5:45	sxvq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ὅτι	1	Here, the word **For** introduces a reason why those who treat their enemies well will **be sons** of their **Father**.

Alternate translation: “You will be his sons because” or “That is because”
5:45	hwxb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	πονηροὺς καὶ ἀγαθοὺς & δικαίους καὶ ἀδίκους	1	In the first clause, Jesus mentions the wicked person first, but in the second clause he mentions the wicked person second. This structure sounded good in his culture. If your language would not use this structure, you could consistently refer to either the wicked or the good person first. Alternate translation: “the good and the evil … the just and the unjust” or “the evil and the good … the unjust and the just”
5:45	qj7n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	πονηροὺς καὶ ἀγαθοὺς & δικαίους καὶ ἀδίκους	1	Jesus is using the adjectives **evil**, **good**, **just**, and **unjust** as nouns to mean people who are characterized by these qualities. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate these words with equivalent phrases. Alternate translation: “evil people and good people … just people and unjust people”
5:46	qjwb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	Here, the word **For** introduces further support for Jesus’ command to love enemies. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces support for a claim, or you could leave **For** untranslated. Alternate translation: “You should love your enemies because” or “You should do what I am saying since”
5:46	se4k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τίνα μισθὸν ἔχετε?	1	Jesus uses this question to show that people who only love others who love them will not receive any **reward**. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “you have no reward.” or “there is no reward for you!”
5:46	cb77		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	οὐχὶ καὶ οἱ τελῶναι τὸ αὐτὸ ποιοῦσιν?	1	Jesus uses this question to show that even **tax collectors**, who were often considered to be unloving people, love people who love them.

Alternate translation: “Even the tax collectors do the same.” or “Even tax collectors do that very thing!”
5:47	qpvk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς ὑμῶν	1	Jesus is using the term **brothers** to mean people who share the same faith. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “fellow disciples” or “other believers”
5:47	ebw3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς	1	Although the term **brothers** is masculine, Jesus is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If you retain the metaphor in your translation, and if it would be helpful in your language, you could say “brothers and sisters” to indicate this.
5:47	ba6e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τί περισσὸν ποιεῖτε?	1	Jesus uses this question to show that people who **greet** only their **brothers** do not do anything **more**. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “you do nothing more.” or “you have not done anything more!”
5:47	ah5w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	περισσὸν	1	Here Jesus implies that they are not doing anything **more** than people who do not know God do. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “more than anyone else” or “more than people who do not know God”
5:47	cjkf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	οὐχὶ καὶ οἱ ἐθνικοὶ τὸ αὐτὸ ποιοῦσιν?	1	Jesus uses this question to show that even **Gentiles**, who do not know God, greet their friends. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “Even the Gentiles do the same thing.” or “Even Gentiles do that very thing!”
5:48	x9xh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	οὖν	1	Here, the word **Therefore** introduces the conclusion to what Jesus has been telling his disciples about how to live. He could be concluding everything he said in [5:21–47](../05/21.md), or he could concluding only what he said in [5:43–47](../05/43.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a conclusion. Alternate translation: “So then” or “In summary”
5:48	l6pa		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	Πατὴρ ὑμῶν ὁ οὐράνιος	1	This is a figurative expression. God is not the **Father** of humans in the same actual way that he is the Father of Jesus. Even so, it would probably be best to translate **Father** with the same word that your language would naturally use to refer to a human father. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that this means God. Alternate translation: “God your heavenly Father”
6:intro	jrj2				0	# Matthew 6 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n2. Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount (5:1-7:28)\n      * Giving alms (6:1–4)\n      * Praying to God (6:5–15)\n      * Fasting (6:16–18)\n      * Storing up treasure (6:19–21)\n      * The eye and the body (6:22–23)\n      * Two masters (6:24)\n      * Being anxious (6:25–34)\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the prayer in [6:9–13](../06/09.md).\n\nJesus spoke about many different subjects in this sermon, so you may wish to help the reader by putting an empty line into the text whenever Jesus changed the subject.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Giving alms\n\nGiving alms was an important practice for religious people in Jesus’ culture. To give alms, a person would offer money or possessions to other people who were poor or in need. Sometimes they would give the money or possessions directly to poor people. Other times, they would give it to the priests, who would give to poor people. Make sure that your translation refers to this kind of practice.\n\n### “The Lord’s Prayer”\n\nIn [6:9–13](../06/09.md), Jesus speaks a prayer that he wants his disciples to imitate when they pray. The prayer is very poetic, and it is sometimes called “the Lord’s Prayer.” Many churches use this prayer during their meetings, and the form that churches use is often not the same form that Matthew wrote down. If churches already use a form of this prayer in your language, you could use the same words. However, you should follow the form of the prayer as Mathew wrote it down, and you should not include any extra lines or pieces of the prayer beyond what Matthew included. \n\n### Fasting\n\nIn [6:16–18](../06/16.md), Jesus gives instructions related to fasting. Just as with giving alms, fasting was an important practice for religious people in Jesus’ culture. Fasting usually required avoiding all food and drink, but some kinds of fasting only required avoiding certain kinds of food. Also, some fasts were public (that is, many people fasted on these set days) and some fasts were private (that is, individuals would choose to fast for certain reasons). Many fasts lasted part of a day or a full day. Jesus does not condemn fasting; instead, he gives instructions for how to behave while fasting. Make sure that your translation refers to these kinds of practices.\n\n### Storing up treasures\n\nIn [6:19–21](../06/19.md), Jesus speaks about storing up treasures either on earth or in heaven. He is speaking not only of possessions or money but also of anything that one considers to be valuable. Jesus points out that valuable things in heaven cannot be ruined like valuable things on earth can. Also, he states that a person’s “heart” is where they store their treasures. If possible, use a word for “treasure” that can refer to money, possessions, and any other valuable things. \n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### The lamp and light metaphor in [6:22–23](../06/22.md)\n\nIn these verses, Jesus speaks about eyes as if they were lamps for the body. This figure of speech has two pieces to it. First, Jesus speaks of how bodies work using the metaphor of lamps and light. Second, Jesus speaks of Christian living using the metaphor of how bodies work. It is important to consider both of these pieces as you translate these verses.\n\nFirst, Jesus speaks of how bodies work using the metaphor of lamps and light. There are two major options for understanding what Jesus means when he refers to an eye as the lamp of the body. First, in Matthew’s culture, some people thought that eyes worked by sending out a form of light that would shine on what they saw. In this case, eyes are like lamps because they have light inside them that shines out. So, the whole body is light or dark inside based on whether the eyes shine properly. Second, the eyes could be like windows that let light into the body. Since they let light into a place, they are like lamps. So, the whole body is light or dark inside based on whether the eyes let light in. Consider how you might best express one of these meanings while maintaining the light and dark language, which is very important for understanding the figure of speech. \n\nSecond, Jesus speaks of Christian life using the metaphor of how bodies work. Scholars debate what Jesus means when he talks about a “healthy eye” and “light” in contrast to an “evil eye” and “darkness.” He might mean devotion to God in contrast to evil desires. He might mean generosity in contrast to greed and selfishness. He might mean paying attention to what he is saying in contrast to ignoring his instructions. Since Jesus most likely intended this figure of speech to be like a riddle or puzzle, you should retain the body metaphor. If necessary, you could indicate that this is a figure of speech without stating exactly what it means. \n\n### Rhetorical questions\n\nIn [6:25–28](../06/25.md) and [6:30](../06/30.md), Jesus uses rhetorical questions. He asks these questions to include the disciples in what he is arguing, not because he is looking for information. If your language does not use questions in this way, you could include answers to the questions or you could express them as statements or exclamations. See the notes on these verses for translation options. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Singular and plural forms of “you”\n\nIn this chapter, Jesus is talking to a large crowd of his followers. Throughout the chapter, Jesus switches between using “you” in the singular and “you” in the plural while he is talking to the same people. When he uses the singular, he is speaking about specific situations that each person in the crowd might experience. When he uses the plural, he is speaking generally to the crowd as a whole. You should assume that Jesus is using plural forms of “you” unless a note specifies that the forms are singular. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])

6:2	g834		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	μὴ σαλπίσῃς ἔμπροσθέν σου	1	Here Jesus could be referring to: (1) how people actually had someone with a **trumpet** announce that they were giving **alms**.

6:3	t3s1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous	ποιοῦντος ἐλεημοσύνην	1	Here, the phrase **giving alms** identifies the situation in which people should follow this command.

But if the singular form would not be natural in your language for someone who was speaking to a group of people, you could use the plural forms of **you** and **your** in your translation.
6:6	dqv4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τὸ ταμεῖόν σου	1	The **inner chamber** was a small, private room in a house. It could be a bedroom or a storage room.

Alternate translation: “your private area” or “your own room”
6:6	kkn7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	τῷ Πατρί σου & ὁ Πατήρ σου	1	This is a figurative expression.

6:7	t9p1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	προσευχόμενοι δὲ	1	Here, the word **Now** introduces Jesus’ next teaching about **praying**.

6:8	h0ll		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	οὖν	1	Here, the word **Therefore** introduces a conclusion based on what Jesus implied in the previous verse. He implied that repeating words does not cause God to listen, and so (**Therefore**) his disciples should not act like the “Gentiles,” who repeats words when they pray. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces this kind of conclusion, or you could leave **Therefore** untranslated. Alternate translation: “Since they are not heard because of their repetitions” or “Because they are wrong about that”

6:9	knx7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἁγιασθήτω τὸ ὄνομά σου	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

6:11	kevh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	δὸς ἡμῖν	1	This is an imperative, but it should be translated as a polite request rather than as a command. It may be helpful to add an expression such as “please” to make this clear. Alternate translation: “We ask that you give us”

6:34	bqny		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀρκετὸν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἡ κακία αὐτῆς	1	Here Jesus means that much **evil** happens each day, so people should not add to their troubles by worrying about anything that might happen the next day.

7:intro	bz7e				0	# Matthew 7 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nJesus spoke about many different subjects in this sermon, so you may wish to help the reader by putting an empty line into the text whenever Jesus changed the subject.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Matthew 5-7\n\nMany people call the words in Matthew 5-7 the Sermon on the Mount. This is one long lesson that Jesus taught. Bibles divide this lesson into three chapters, but this can sometimes confuse the reader. If your translation divides the text into sections, be sure that the reader understands that the whole sermon is one large section.\n\n### “By their fruits you will know them”\n\nFruit is a common image in the Scriptures. It is used to describe the results of either good or bad actions. In this chapter, good fruit is the result of living as God commands. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/fruit]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### You singular and you plural\n\nIn this chapter, as in the past two chapters, Jesus is talking to a large crowd of his followers. Throughout the chapter, Jesus switches between using you in the singular and you in the plural. In both instances he is talking to the same people. When he is using the singular, he is referring to all of the individuals in the crowd, but is still referring to the crowd as a whole. Your language may require you to use a plural here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
7:1	xk6w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	μὴ κρίνετε	1	Here Jesus uses the word **judge** to refer to unofficial and improper judging. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this explicit. Alternate translation: “Do not harshly judge” or “Do not condemn”

7:2	ifm3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐν ᾧ & κρίματι κρίνετε	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **judgment**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “in the manner that you judge”
7:2	kj24		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	κριθήσεσθε	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

7:2	bq9z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	καὶ	1	Here, the word **and** introduces a more general statement in proverb form.

7:2	wmxo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-proverbs	ἐν ᾧ μέτρῳ μετρεῖτε, μετρηθήσεται ὑμῖν	1	Here, Jesus uses or invents a proverb in order to teach that people eventually experience for themselves how they have treated other people.

7:2	c006		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐν ᾧ μέτρῳ μετρεῖτε	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **measure**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “in the manner that you measure”
7:2	wgh2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	μετρηθήσεται ὑμῖν	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “you should not look at the speck of wood in the eye of your brother when you do not notice log in your eye.” or “do not look at the speck of wood in the eye of your brother while at the same time not noticing the log in your eye!”
7:3	hzb4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd	βλέπεις & σου & τῷ σῷ ὀφθαλμῷ & οὐ κατανοεῖς	1	Even though Jesus is speaking to many disciples, he is addressing an individual situation, so **you** and **your** are singular throughout this verse. But if the singular form would not be natural in your language for someone who was speaking to a group of people, you could use the plural forms of **you** and **your** in your translation.
7:3	ctb3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor	βλέπεις τὸ κάρφος τὸ ἐν τῷ ὀφθαλμῷ τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ σου, τὴν δὲ ἐν τῷ σῷ ὀφθαλμῷ δοκὸν οὐ κατανοεῖς	1	Here Jesus refers to small faults and mistakes as if they were a **speck of wood** in a person’s **eye**. He speaks of large faults and mistakes as if they were a **log** in a person’s **eye**.

Alternate translation: “do you focus on your brother’s small fault, which is like a speck of wood in his eye, but you do not notice your own large fault, which is like a log in your eye” or “do you look at the small mistakes your brother makes, but you do not notice your own large mistakes”
7:3	hqnr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τὸ κάρφος	1	A **speck of wood** is a tiny piece of wood or plant matter.

7:3	d2qc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ σου	1	Jesus is using the term **brother** to mean a person who shares the same faith. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “of your fellow disciple”
7:3	mo6n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ σου	1	Although the term **brother** is masculine, Jesus is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If you retain the metaphor in your translation, and if it would be helpful in your language, you could say “brother or sister” to indicate this.
7:3	xdcg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	τὴν & δοκὸν	1	A **log** could not literally go into a person’s **eye**. Jesus is using an extreme example to emphasize his point and make it memorable. If it would be helpful in your language, you could refer to the largest object that could fall into a person’s eye.

7:3	q1z4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τὴν & δοκὸν	1	A **log** is a long, large piece of wood.

Alternate translation: “You should not say to your brother, ‘Let me take out the speck of wood from your eye,’ while behold, the log is in your eye.” or “Do not say to your brother, ‘Let me take out the speck of wood from your eye,’ while behold, the log is in your eye!”

7:5	kwqu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd	ὑποκριτά & ἔκβαλε & σοῦ & διαβλέψεις & σου	1	Even though Jesus is speaking to many disciples, he is addressing an individual situation, so **you** and **your** are singular throughout this verse. But if the singular form would not be natural in your language for someone who was speaking to a group of people, you could use the plural forms of **you** and **your** in your translation.
7:5	psgh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor	ἔκβαλε πρῶτον ἐκ τοῦ ὀφθαλμοῦ σοῦ τὴν δοκόν, καὶ τότε διαβλέψεις ἐκβαλεῖν τὸ κάρφος ἐκ τοῦ ὀφθαλμοῦ τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ σου	1	Here Jesus continues to refer to small faults and mistakes as if they were a **speck of wood** in a person’s eye and to large faults and mistakes as if they were a **log** in a person’s eye.

This was a poetic form in his culture. If your readers would not recognize this as poetry and misunderstand which animals Jesus is speaking about in the last two clauses, you could rearrange the clauses.

He could be speaking of the gospel as **the holy** and **pearls** and of people who reject the gospel as **dogs** and **pigs**.

You should express the idea in a way that allows for these and other interpretations. If it is necessary for you to indicate that Jesus is using a figure of speech here, you could introduce the verse with a form that usually introduces a saying or proverb. Alternate translation: “Think about what this means for your life: You should neither give the holy to the dogs, nor should you throw your pearls in front of the pigs.

If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “There is not a man from among you, of whom his son will ask for bread, and he will give him a stone.” or “No man among you, of whom his son will ask for bread, will give him a stone!”
7:9	fscs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo	ἢ τίς ἐστιν ἐξ ὑμῶν ἄνθρωπος, ὃν αἰτήσει ὁ υἱὸς αὐτοῦ ἄρτον, μὴ λίθον ἐπιδώσει αὐτῷ?	1	Here Jesus uses an imaginary situation to help explain how parents give good things, not bad things, to their children. Use a natural method in your language for introducing an imaginary situation. Alternate translation: “Or imagine a man from among you. When his son asks him for bread, he will not give a stone, will he”
7:9	n5s1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	τίς ἐστιν ἐξ ὑμῶν ἄνθρωπος, ὃν αἰτήσει ὁ υἱὸς αὐτοῦ ἄρτον, μὴ λίθον ἐπιδώσει αὐτῷ	1	Although Jesus uses the example of a **man** and **his son**, he does not mean that this example applies only to fathers and sons. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that includes all parents and children. Alternate translation: “what parents are there from among you, of whom their child will ask for bread—they will not give their child a stone, will they”
7:10	z9xu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	ἢ	1	Here, the word **Or** introduces another similar example.

If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “And there is not one person among you, if his son asks for a fish, will give him a snake.”
7:10	kgak		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo	ἢ καὶ ἰχθὺν αἰτήσει, μὴ ὄφιν ἐπιδώσει αὐτῷ	1	Here Jesus uses an imaginary situation to help explain how parents give good things, not bad things, to their children.

7:10	mf6n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	καὶ ἰχθὺν αἰτήσει, μὴ ὄφιν ἐπιδώσει αὐτῷ	1	Although Jesus continues to use the example of a father and his son, he does not mean that this example applies only to fathers and sons. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that includes all parents and children. Alternate translation: “the child will also ask for a fish—the parents will not give the child a snake, will they”
7:10	tz8z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὄφιν	1	In this culture, people did not eat snakes. So Jesus is saying that a father would not give a son something the son could not eat if the son asked for something that he could eat. If people do eat snakes in your culture, you could use the name of something that they do not eat, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “something he cannot eat”
7:11	n1vh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἰ	1	Jesus speaks as if this were a hypothetical situation, but he means that it is true. If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, and if your readers might think that what Jesus is saying is uncertain, then you could translate his words as an affirmative statement. Alternate translation: “since”
7:11	n98d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	πονηροὶ ὄντες	1	Here, the phrase **being evil** states something that is unexpected for people who **know how to give good gifts**.

7:11	z8zr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ὁ Πατὴρ ὑμῶν	1	This is a figurative expression. God is not the **Father** of humans in the same actual way that he is the Father of Jesus. Even so, it would probably be best to translate **Father** with the same word that your language would naturally use to refer to a human father. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that this means God. Alternate translation: “your Father, God,”\n
7:11	t3p4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὁ ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς	1	Here, the phrase in the heavens identifies the location in which God the Father is specially present and from which he rules.

Alternate translation: “you should do to men all things in the way that you desire them to do to you”
7:12	g8c7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	οἱ ἄνθρωποι	1	Although the term **men** is masculine, Jesus is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a phrase that makes this clear. Alternate translation: “people” or “men and women”
7:12	cywd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γάρ	1	Here, the word **For** introduces a reason for the command that Jesus has just given. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a reason or basis for a command, or you could leave **For** untranslated. Alternate translation: “since” or “which you should do because”
7:12	y4f6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οὗτος & ἐστιν ὁ νόμος καὶ οἱ προφῆται	1	Here, the clause **this is the Law and the Prophets** means that Jesus’ command summarizes what **the Law and the Prophets** require. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “this is what the Law and Prophets require” or “this is a summary of the Law and the Prophets”
7:12	wivn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	ὁ νόμος καὶ οἱ προφῆται	1	The word **Law** is the name for one part of the Hebrew Scriptures, and the word **Prophets** is the name for another part of the Hebrew Scriptures. Show this in your translation in the way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “all the Scriptures, both the Law and the Prophets”
7:12	b1x2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	οἱ προφῆται	1	Here, the word **Prophets** represents what the prophets said and wrote. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your language or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the writings of the prophets”
7:13-14	f47a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge	εἰσέλθατε διὰ τῆς στενῆς πύλης; ὅτι πλατεῖα ἡ πύλη καὶ εὐρύχωρος ἡ ὁδὸς ἡ ἀπάγουσα εἰς τὴν ἀπώλειαν, καὶ πολλοί εἰσιν οἱ εἰσερχόμενοι δι’ αὐτῆς; & ὅτι στενὴ ἡ πύλη καὶ τεθλιμμένη ἡ ὁδὸς ἡ ἀπάγουσα εἰς τὴν ζωήν, καὶ ὀλίγοι εἰσὶν οἱ εὑρίσκοντες αὐτήν.	1	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could combine [7:13](../07/13.md) and [7:14](../07/14.md) into a verse bridge, as UST does, in order to keep the information about the **narrow gate** together. Alternate translation: “Enter through the narrow gate. For the gate {is} narrow and the way has been made narrow that is leading to life, and there are few finding it. But wide {is} the gate and broad {is} the road that is leading to destruction, and there are many entering through it”
7:13	dgr2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor	εἰσέλθατε διὰ τῆς στενῆς πύλης; ὅτι πλατεῖα ἡ πύλη καὶ εὐρύχωρος ἡ ὁδὸς ἡ ἀπάγουσα εἰς τὴν ἀπώλειαν, καὶ πολλοί εἰσιν οἱ εἰσερχόμενοι δι’ αὐτῆς	1	Here Jesus speaks of how people live as if they were walking on a **road** and of what happens when they die as if it were entering through a **gate**. When a **gate** is **narrow**, that means that it is difficult to go through and that not many people go through it. When a **gate** is **wide** and a **road** is **broad**, that means that they are easy to travel on or go through and that many people travel on or through them. Since these are important images that Jesus uses in the following verse as well, you should preserve the figure of speech or express the idea in simile form. Alternate translation: “You should live like a traveler who enters through a narrow gate. Many people live like travelers who enter through a wide gate and travel on a broad road, but this path leads to destruction”
7:13	g4be		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ὅτι	1	Here, the word **For** introduces a reason why people should enter through the **narrow gate**.

7:13	zv24		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	εἰς τὴν ἀπώλειαν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **destruction**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “to being destroyed” or “to God destroying you”
7:13	mulg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	πολλοί	1	Jesus is using the adjective **many** as a noun to mean many people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “many travelers”
7:14	aj95		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	 ὅτι στενὴ ἡ πύλη καὶ τεθλιμμένη ἡ ὁδὸς	1	Many ancient manuscripts read **For the gate is narrow and the road has been made narrow**. The ULT follows that reading. Other ancient manuscripts read “How narrow is the gate and having been made narrow the road.” If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of the ULT.
7:14	mvfv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ὅτι	1	Here, the word **For** introduces another reason why people should enter through the narrow **gate**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a reason for a command, or you could leave **For** untranslated. Alternate translation: “Enter through the narrow gate because”
7:14	krug		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor	στενὴ ἡ πύλη καὶ τεθλιμμένη ἡ ὁδὸς ἡ ἀπάγουσα εἰς τὴν ζωήν, καὶ ὀλίγοι εἰσὶν οἱ εὑρίσκοντες αὐτήν	1	Here Jesus continues to speak of how people live as if they were walking on a **way** and of what happens when they die as if it were entering through a **gate**. When a **gate** is **narrow** and **way** has been made **narrow**, that means that they are difficult to go through and that not many people go through them. Express the idea as you did in [7:13](../07/13.md). Alternate translation: “only a few people live like travelers who find the narrow gate and travel on the road that has been made narrow, and this road leads to life”
7:14	jish		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τεθλιμμένη ἡ ὁδὸς	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who did the action, it is clear from the context that it was God. Alternate translation: “the road is narrow” or “God has made the road narrow”
7:14	byw6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὴν ζωήν	1	Here Jesus implies that **life** is eternal or undying life. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “true life” or “eternal life”
7:14	wlr9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	εἰς τὴν ζωήν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **life**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “to being able to live”
7:14	gdji		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	ὀλίγοι	1	Jesus is using the adjective **few** as a noun to mean few people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “few travelers”

By the **false prophets** wearing **sheep’s clothing**, he means that the **false prophets** pretend to be part of God’s people. However, Jesus says that **inwardly** they are **ravenous wolves**. He means that they hurt and take advantage of God’s people, which is acting just like **wolves** that eat **sheep**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in simile form or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “who pretend to be part of your group, as if they were dressed in sheep’s clothing. However, inwardly they want to harm you, as if they were ravenous wolves”
7:15	bwag		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐν ἐνδύμασι προβάτων	1	Here, the phrase **sheep’s clothing** refers to disguising oneself to look like a sheep. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “disguising themselves as sheep” or “pretending to be sheep”
7:15	t21q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	λύκοι ἅρπαγες	1	When **wolves** are **ravenous**, they want to capture and eat other animals, such as **sheep**.

Just as thorny plants do not produce **fruits**, so evil people who do not trust God do not do what is right. Jesus uses this metaphor for several verses, so you should preserve the figure of speech or use simile form. Alternate translation: “You will know who people are by what they do, just as you know what plants are by their fruits. They do not gather grapes from a thornbush or figs from thistles, do they? Similarly, evil people do not do what is right, do they”
7:16	jvxv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἀπὸ τῶν καρπῶν αὐτῶν ἐπιγνώσεσθε αὐτούς	1	The pronouns **their** and **them** refer to any people, but particularly people like the “false prophets” Jesus mentioned in the previous verse. If this is not clear for your readers, you could refer directly to the false prophets or to any people who claim to be believers. Alternate translation: “You will recognize the false prophets by their fruits” or “You will recognize anyone who claims to believe by his or her fruits”
7:16	nve4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	μήτι συλλέγουσιν ἀπὸ ἀκανθῶν σταφυλὰς, ἢ ἀπὸ τριβόλων σῦκα?	1	Jesus is using the question form to to show that **grapes** do not come from **a thornbush** and **figs** do not come from **thistles**.

7:16	gy7s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	μήτι συλλέγουσιν	1	The pronoun **they** refers to people in general. If this is not clear for your readers, you could use a form that refers to any person or group of people. Alternate translation: “People do not gather … do they”
7:16	d7ac		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	ἀπὸ ἀκανθῶν σταφυλὰς, ἢ ἀπὸ τριβόλων σῦκα	1	These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could combine the two phrases. Alternate translation: “grapes or figs from thorny plants” or “fruits from scrub plants”
7:16	vqnd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τριβόλων	1	Here, the word **thistles** refers generally to plants that have points or spikes on their stems or leaves. These plants do not produce fruit. If your readers would not be familiar with this type of plant, you could use the name of something similar in your area or you could use a more general term. Alternate translation: “spiky plants”

Just as a **good tree** produces **good fruits**, so people who follow God do what is right. Just as a **bad tree** produces **bad fruits**, so people who do not follow God do what is wrong. Jesus uses this metaphor for several verses, so you should preserve the figure of speech or use simile form. Alternate translation: “In the same way, every good tree produces good fruits, but the bad tree produces bad fruits. Similarly, believers do what is right, but unbelievers do what is wrong”
7:17	vy6i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	τὸ & σαπρὸν δένδρον & ποιεῖ	1	The phrase **the bad tree** represents bad trees in general, not one particular bad tree. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: “bad trees produce”

Express the idea as you did in the previous verse [7:17](../07/17.md). Alternate translation: “A good tree is not able to produce bad fruits, nor a bad tree to produce good fruits.

If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “you think that it is certainly easier to say ‘your sins are forgiven’ than to say ‘get up and walk’”

9:6	n5sf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you	εἰδῆτε & σου & σου	1	Here, the **you** is plural and is addressed to the scribes, but both instances of **your** are singular and addressed to the paralytic.

This proverb draws a figurative comparison. Just as sick people need to see a doctor to be healed, so sinners need to see Jesus in order to be forgiven and restored. But since Jesus explains the comparison in the next verse, you do not need to explain it here. Rather, you can translate the proverb itself in a way that will be meaningful in your language and culture.

9:12	uhc5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony	οἱ ἰσχύοντες	1	Those who **have sickness** are equated with those who are wanting to be saved by Jesus. The **healthy** are equated with those who do not think they need Jesus. Jesus does not actually think those who do not want him are spiritually sound, but rather, that they are needy. He says this because those people think they are healthy in their own eyes and do not need Jesus. If it would be helpful in your language, consider expressing the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Those who suppose themselves to be healthy do not need a doctor. It is those who know that they are sick who need a doctor”.

In this proverb, Jesus is the **bridegroom**, and his disciples are the **sons of the bridal chamber**. You can translate the proverb itself in a way that it will be recognized as a proverb and be meaningful in your language and culture. If it would be helpful in your language, you can state it explicitly. Alternate translation: “Just as the sons of the bridal chamber are not able to mourn while the bridegroom is still with them, so my disciples are not able to fast while I am still with them”

If this patch has not yet been washed, it will shrink and tear the piece of clothing, making the hole worse than it was to begin with.

10:intro	m5iu				0	# Matthew 10 General Notes\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### The sending of the 12 disciples\n\nMany verses in this chapter describe how Jesus sent the 12 disciples out. He sent them to tell his message about the kingdom of heaven. They were to tell his message only in Israel and not to share it with the Gentiles.\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### The 12 disciples\n\nThe following are the lists of the 12 disciples:\n\nIn Matthew:\n\nSimon (Peter), Andrew, James son of Zebedee, John son of Zebedee, Philip, Bartholomew, Thomas, Matthew, James son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot.\n\nIn Mark:\n\nSimon (Peter), Andrew, James the son of Zebedee and John the son of Zebedee (to whom he gave the name Boanerges, that is, sons of thunder), Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot.\n\nIn Luke:\n\nSimon (Peter), Andrew, James, John, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Simon (who was called the Zealot), Judas the son of James, and Judas Iscariot.\n\nThaddaeus is probably the same person as Jude, the son of James.\n\n### “The kingdom of heaven has come near”\n\nNo one knows for sure whether the “kingdom of heaven” was present or still coming when John spoke these words. English translations often use the phrase “at hand,” but these words can be difficult to translate. Other versions use the phrases “is coming near” and “has come near.”

11:intro	puf4				0	# Matthew 11 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nSome translations set quotations from the Old Testament farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text. The ULT does this with the quoted material in 11:10.\n\nSome scholars believe that [Matthew 11:20](../mat/11/20.md) begins a new stage in the ministry of Christ because of Israel’s rejection of him.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Hidden revelation\n\nAfter [Matthew 11:20](../mat/11/20.md), Jesus begins to reveal information about himself and about the plans of God the Father, while hiding this information from those who reject him ([Matthew 11:25](../mat/11/25.md)).\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### “The kingdom of heaven is near”\n\nNo one knows for sure whether the “kingdom of heaven” was present or still coming when John spoke these words. English translations often use The phrase **at hand**, but these words can be difficult to translate. Other versions use the phrases “is coming near” and “has come near.”
11:1	z2y7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	καὶ ἐγένετο	1	# General Information:\n\n**And it happened** is the beginning of a new part of the story where Matthew tells of how Jesus responded to disciples of John the Baptist.

12:intro	y7z6				0	# Matthew 12 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 12:18-21, which are words from the Old Testament.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### The Sabbath\n\nThis chapter has much to say about how God’s people are to honor the Sabbath. Jesus said that the rules that the Pharisees made up did not help people obey the Sabbath the way God wanted them to. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sabbath]])\n\n### “Blasphemy against the Spirit”\n\nNo one knows for sure what actions people perform or what words they say when they commit this sin. However, they probably insult the Holy Spirit and his work. Part of the Holy Spirit’s work is to make people understand that they are sinners and that they need to have God forgive them. Therefore, anyone who does not try to stop sinning is probably committing blasphemy against the Spirit. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/blasphemy]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/holyspirit]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Brothers and sisters\n\nMost people call those who have the same parents “brother” and “sister” and think of them as some of the most important people in their lives. Many people also call those with the same grandparents “brother” and “sister.” In this chapter Jesus says that the most important people to him are those who obey his Father in heaven. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/brother]])

If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way.

12:5	dqe9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὸ Σάββατον βεβηλοῦσιν	1	The priests were said to **profane the Sabbath** because they had to fulfill their priestly duties on the Sabbath.

13:intro	s3lu				0	# Matthew 13 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 13:14-15, which are words from the Old Testament.\n\nThis chapter begins a new section. It contains some of Jesus’ parables about the kingdom of heaven.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Metonymy\n\nJesus often says the word **heaven** when he wants his hearers to think of God, who lives in heaven ([13:11](../mat/13/11.md)).\n\n### Implicit information\n\nSpeakers usually do not say things that they think their hearers already understand. When Matthew wrote that Jesus “sat beside the sea” ([Matthew 13:1](../mat/13/01.md)), he probably expected his hearers to know that Jesus was about to teach the people. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])\n\n### Metaphor\n\nSpeakers often use examples of things that we can see or touch to communicate abstract ideas. Jesus spoke of birds eating newly sown seed to describe how Satan keeps people from understanding Jesus’ message ([13:19](../mat/13/19.md)).\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Passive voice\n\nMany sentences in this chapter tell that something happened to a  person without indicating who caused the thing to happen. For example, “they were scorched” ([13:6](../mat/13/06.md)). You may have to translate the sentence so that it tells the reader who performed the action. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])\n\n### Parables\n\nThe parables are short stories that Jesus told so that people would easily understand the lesson he was trying to teach them. He also told the stories so that those who did not want to believe in him would not understand the truth ([13:11-13](./11.md)).

15:intro	i9a5				0	# Matthew 15 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 15:8-9, which are words from the Old Testament.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### The “traditions of the elders”\n\nThe “traditions of the elders” were oral laws that the Jewish religious leaders developed because they wanted to make sure that everyone obeyed the law of Moses. However, they often worked harder to obey these rules than to obey the law of Moses itself. Jesus rebuked the religious leaders for this, and they became angry as a result. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]])\n\n### Jews and Gentiles\n\nThe Jews of Jesus’ time thought that only Jews could please God by the way they lived. Jesus healed a Canaanite Gentile woman’s daughter to show his followers that he would accept both Jews and Gentiles as his people.\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Sheep\n\nThe Bible often speaks of people as if they were sheep because sheep require someone to take care of them. This is because they do not see well and they often go to where predatory animals can easily kill and eat them . (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

(See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Metaphor\n\nJesus told his people to obey his commands. He did this by telling them to “follow” him. It is as if he were walking on a path and they were walking after him. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Background information\n\nMatthew continues his account from chapter 15 in verses 1-20. The account stops in verse 21 so that Matthew can tell the reader that Jesus told his disciples again and again that people would kill him after he arrived in Jerusalem. Then the account continues in verses 22-27 with what happened the first time Jesus told the disciples that he would die.\n\n### Paradox\n\nA paradox is a true statement that appears to describe something impossible. Jesus uses a paradox when he says, “Whoever wants to save his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it” ([Matthew 16:25](../mat/16/25.md)).

17:intro	yb4k				0	# Matthew 17 General Notes\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Elijah\n\nThe Old Testament prophet Malachi lived many years before Jesus was born. Malachi had said that before the Messiah came a prophet named Elijah would return. Jesus explained that Malachi had been talking about John the Baptist. Jesus said this because John the Baptist had done what Malachi had said that Elijah would do. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/christ]])\n\n### “transfigured”\n\nScripture often speaks of God’s glory as a great, brilliant light. When people see this light, they are afraid. Matthew says in this chapter that Jesus’ body shone with this glorious light so that his followers could see that Jesus truly was God’s Son. At the same time, God told them that Jesus was his Son. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/glory]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/fear]])

21:intro	ni1x				0	# Matthew 21 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 21:5,16 and 42, which is quoted from the Old Testament.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### The donkey and the colt\n\nJesus rode into Jerusalem on an animal. In this way he was like a king who came into a city after he had won an important battle. Also, the kings of Israel in the Old Testament rode on a donkeys. Other kings rode on horses. So Jesus was showing that he was the king of Israel and that he was not like other kings.\n\nMatthew, Mark, Luke, and John all wrote about this event. Matthew and Mark wrote that the disciples brought Jesus a donkey. John wrote that Jesus found a donkey. Luke wrote that they brought him a colt. Only Matthew wrote that there was both a donkey had a colt. No one knows for sure whether Jesus rode the donkey or the colt. It is best to translate each of these accounts as it appears in the ULT without trying to make them all say exactly the same thing. (See: [Matthew 21:1-7](../mat/21/01.md) and [Mark 11:1-7](../mrk/11/01.md) and [Luke 19:29-36](../luk/19/29.md) and [John 12:14-15](../jhn/12/14.md))\n\n### Hosanna\n\nThis is what the people shouted to welcome Jesus into Jerusalem. This word meant “Save us,” but people used it to praise God.\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### “The kingdom of God will be taken away from you”\n\nNo one knows for sure what this phrase means. No one knows if Jesus meant that God would someday give the kingdom back or not.

This is a metaphor that means the religious leaders, like builders, will reject Jesus, but God will make him the most important in his kingdom, like the cornerstone in a building. Since this is a quotation from Scripture, we recommend that you translate the words directly rather than providing a non-figurative explanation of them, even if your language does not customarily use such figures of speech. If you want to explain the meaning of the metaphor, we recommend that you do that in a footnote rather than in the Bible text.

22:intro	k5ze				0	# Matthew 22 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in verse 44, which is quoted from the Old Testament.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Wedding Feast\n\nIn the parable of the wedding feast ([Matthew 22:1-14](../22/01.md)), Jesus taught that when God offers to save a person, that person needs to accept the offer. Jesus spoke of life with God as a feast that a king prepared for his son who had just gotten married. In addition, Jesus emphasized that not everyone whom God invites will properly prepare himself to come to the feast. God will throw such people out from the feast.\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### Implicit information\n\nSpeakers usually do not say things that they think their hearers already understand. When the king in the parable says, “My oxen and fattened calves have been killed” ([Matthew 22:4](../mat/22/04.md)), he assumes that the hearers will understand that those who had killed the animals had also cooked them.\n\n### Paradox\n\nA paradox is a statement that describes two things that seemingly cannot both be true at the same time. To the Jews, ancestors were greater than their descendants. But in one psalm David calls one of his descendants “Lord.” Jesus tells the Jewish leaders that this is a paradox, asking, “If David then calls the Christ ‘Lord,’ how is he David’s son?” ([22:45](../22/45.md)).

23:intro	m99i				0	# Matthew 23 General Notes\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Hypocrites\n\nJesus calls the Pharisees “hypocrites” many times in verses13–29. He carefully explains why he calls them that. The Pharisees made rules that no one could actually obey, and then they persuaded the ordinary people that they were guilty because they could not obey those rules. Also, the Pharisees obeyed their own rules instead of obeying God’s original commands in the law of Moses.\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### Name-calling\n\nIn most cultures, it is wrong to insult people. The Pharisees took many of the words in this chapter as insults. Jesus called them “hypocrites,” “blind guides,” “fools,” and “serpents.” But Jesus used these words not as insults but as warnings that God would surely punish the Pharisees because they were doing wrong.\n\n### Paradox\n\nA paradox is a statement that describes two things that seemingly cannot both be true at the same time. Jesus uses a paradox when he says, “He who is greatest among you will be your servant” ([23:11-12](../23/11.md)).

He means that they are making people try to obey many difficult laws. If it would be helpful for your readers, you could express the meaning as a comparison. Alternate translation: “They make you obey many difficult laws as if they were binding up heavy loads and putting them on your shoulders.

24:intro	h2a2				0	# Matthew 24 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nIn this chapter, Jesus begins to prophesy about the future from that time until he returns as king of everything. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]])\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### “The end of the age”\n\nIn this chapter, Jesus gives an answer to his disciples when they ask how they will know when he will come again. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-apocalyptic]])\n\n### The example of Noah\n\nIn the time of Noah, God sent a great flood to punish people for their sins. He warned them many times about this coming flood, but it actually began suddenly. In this chapter, Jesus draws a comparison between that flood and the last days. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])\n\n## Important translation issues in this chapter\n\n### “Let”\n\nThe ULT uses this word to begin several commands of Jesus, such as “let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains” (24:16), “let him who is on the housetop not go down to take anything out of his house” (24:17), and “let him who is in the field not return to take his cloak” (24:18). There are many different ways to form a command. Translators may select the most natural ways in their own languages.\n\n### “The one”\n\nSeveral times in this chapter, Jesus speaks of “the one” who does a certain thing. (Matthew himself uses that phrase in verse 15.) This phrase does not refer to a specific person. It refers to anyone who performs the action that it names. Express this in the way that would be most natural in your language. For example, in verse 13, Jesus says that “the one having endured to the end, he will be saved.” You might say that “whoever endures to the end will be saved.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])
24:1	ke79		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἀπὸ τοῦ ἱεροῦ	1	Here, **temple** is referring to the courtyard around the temple. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that in your translation. Alternate translation: “from the courtyard of the temple”
24:2	mh5y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	οὐ βλέπετε ταῦτα πάντα	1	Jesus is using the question form to challenge his disciples.

Alternate translation: “Since many will come in my name saying, ‘I am the Christ,’ and will lead many astray, you ought to be careful not to be led astray”
24:5	w7i0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	πολλοὶ γὰρ ἐλεύσονται ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματί μου λέγοντες, ἐγώ εἰμι ὁ Χριστός; καὶ πολλοὺς πλανήσουσιν	1	If the direct quotation inside a direct quotation would be confusing in your language, you could translate the second direct quotation as an indirect quotation.

24:5	lq71		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματί μου	1	Here, Jesus uses the word **name** to mean identity.

24:40	gt4l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	εἷς παραλαμβάνεται, καὶ εἷς ἀφίεται	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who will do the action, Jesus implies that God will do it. Alternate translation: “God will take one, and he will leave the other”
24:41	eail		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	μία παραλαμβάνεται, καὶ μία ἀφίεται	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

24:43	ak6a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables	ἐκεῖνο δὲ γινώσκετε,	1	To help his disciples understand his message, Jesus tells a story. He explains its meaning in the next verse.

24:43	ki5s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ποίᾳ φυλακῇ	1	Here, **watch of night** is an idiom that means a certain time during the night, referring to how some would take turns keeping “watch” for a certain length of time to protect others who were asleep. If this phrase does not have that meaning in your language, use an idiom from your language that does have this meaning or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “at what time during the night”

24:44	gd17		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	ὁ Υἱὸς τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου	1	Jesus is speaking about himself in the third person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this in the first person. Alternate translation: “I, the Son of Man,
24:44	tub2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables	διὰ τοῦτο καὶ, ὑμεῖς γίνεσθε ἕτοιμοι	1	Here, Jesus is explaining the meaning of his parable. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “In the same way that the owner of the house prepares in case a thief comes, so you should also be ready”
24:44	ess8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ᾗ & ὥρᾳ	1	Jesus is using the term **hour** to refer to a specific time. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “at a time”

If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “Certainly a faithful servant is the one whom his master appoints over his house in order to give them food at the proper time!”
24:45	d462		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὃν κατέστησεν ὁ κύριος ἐπὶ τῆς οἰκετείας αὐτοῦ	1	In this phrase, it is assumed that the **the master** leaves the house over which he appoints his servant.

24:50	bz5k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	ἐν ἡμέρᾳ ᾗ οὐ προσδοκᾷ, καὶ ἐν ὥρᾳ ᾗ οὐ γινώσκει	1	The phrases **on a day that he does not expect** and **at an hour that he does not know** mean the same thing. Jesus is using repetition to emphasize the idea that the phrases express. It may be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if the meaning might be unclear, you could connect the phrases with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: “on a day that he does not expect, yes, at an hour that he does not know”
24:50	ss9h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐν ἡμέρᾳ ᾗ οὐ προσδοκᾷ, καὶ ἐν ὥρᾳ ᾗ οὐ γινώσκει	1	Jesus is using the terms **day** and **hour** to refer to a specific time.

24:51	jj2z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	διχοτομήσει αὐτὸν	1	Here, **cut him in pieces** is an idiom that means to punish someone severely.

25:intro	qe8a				0	# Matthew 25 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nThis chapter continues the teaching of the previous chapter.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### The parable of the ten virgins\n\nJesus told the parable of the ten virgins in [25:1–13](../25/01.md) to tell his followers to be ready for him to return. His hearers could understand the parable because they knew Jewish wedding customs. When the Jews arranged marriages, they would plan for the wedding to take place weeks or months later. At the appointed time, the bridegroom would go to his bride’s house and she would be waiting for him there. The wedding ceremony would take place, and then the man and his bride would travel to his home, where there would be a feast. In this parable, the bridegroom represents Jesus, the five foolish virgins represent false believers in Jesus who do not prepare for Jesus’ return, and the five wise virgins represent true Christians who are ready for Jesus to come back at the end of the world. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])\n\n### The parable of the talents\n\nJesus told the parable of the talents in [25:14–30](../25/14.md) to teach that true Christians use the blessings that God gives them in order to live fruitful lives that glorify him. Jesus’ hearers could understand the parable because they knew about investing money and the relationship between masters and slaves. In this parable, the master represents Jesus, the “talents” (a form of money) represent blessings from God, the two good slaves represent true Christians who faithfully use the blessings that God gives them, and the wicked slave represents false believers in Jesus. \n\nA talent  was a unit of weight that, when used for precious metals, was also a unit of money. One talent weighed nearly 30 kilograms or over 60 pounds. One silver talent was the equivalent of over 16 years’ wages for a laborer. You could try to express this amount in terms of current monetary values, but that might cause your Bible translation to become outdated and inaccurate, since those values can change over time. So instead you might state something more general or give the equivalent in wages. See the suggestions at each occurrence of the word “talent” in this chapter. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]] and rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney]])
25:1	em28		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τότε	1	Here, **Then** refers to the time in the future when Jesus will return to the world. He called this time “the coming of the Son of Man” in [24:37](../24/37.md) and the “day your Lord is coming” in [24:42](../24/42.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “At the time I return to the world”
25:1	zfdl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables	ὁμοιωθήσεται ἡ Βασιλεία τῶν Οὐρανῶν δέκα παρθένοις	1	In [25:1–13](../25/01.md), Jesus is explaining about **the kingdom of the heavens** by telling a brief story that provides an illustration. See the discussion of this parable in the General Notes for this chapter.
25:1	pg5i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἡ Βασιλεία τῶν Οὐρανῶν	1	See how you translated this phrase in [3:2](../03/02.md).
25:1	uhj1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	λαμπάδας	1	The **lamps** in this story are small containers that produce light by burning oil that is absorbed by a wick. Someone had to trim the wick and supply enough oil to keep the wick burning in order for the lamp to continue producing light. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “lamps that burn oil to produce light”
25:1	jfsw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐξῆλθον εἰς ὑπάντησιν τοῦ νυμφίου	1	Here, **meeting of the bridegroom** refers to the Jewish wedding practice of the bride and bridesmaids waiting for the bridegroom to come and get his bride and take her to the wedding feast. The fact that they took **lamps** also implies that they **went out** during the night. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “went out during the night to wait for the bridegroom to come and take his bride to the wedding feast”
25:2	c8nf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	πέντε & ἐξ αὐτῶν	1	Here, **them** refers to the “virgins” mentioned in the previous verse. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “five of the virgins”
25:2	ena4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	πέντε φρόνιμοι	1	Jesus is leaving out a word that a clause would need in many languages to be complete. If it would be helpful in your language, you could supply this word from the previous clause. Alternate translation: “five were wise”
25:3	b37a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	μεθ’ ἑαυτῶν ἔλαιον	1	Jesus’ hearers would have understood that the **oil** was used to keep the **lamps** lit. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “oil with themselves to keep their lamps lit”
25:5	qf4b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἐνύσταξαν πᾶσαι 	1	Here, **they** refers to the ten virgins mentioned in [25:1](../25/01.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “all ten virgins became sleepy”
25:5	pvh4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential	ἐνύσταξαν πᾶσαι καὶ ἐκάθευδον	1	The word **and** indicates that the event in the previous phrase happened before the event in the next phrase.

25:6	ufp2			κραυγὴ γέγονεν	1	Alternate translation: “someone cried”
25:6	o62h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	The person speaking uses the term **Behold** here to get the ten virgins to focus their attention on what he is about to say. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Listen”
25:6	py59		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	κραυγὴ γέγονεν, ἰδοὺ, ὁ νυμφίος! ἐξέρχεσθε εἰς ἀπάντησιν	1	If your language would not use a direct quotation inside of a direct quotation, you could translate the second direct quotation as an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: “someone cried that they should pay attention, the bridegroom was coming, and they should go out to the meeting”
25:7	knmn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἠγέρθησαν	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “awoke”
25:7	ni6u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ἐκόσμησαν τὰς λαμπάδας ἑαυτῶν	1	The oil **lamps** people used at that time produced light from a burning wick. That wick had to be **trimmed** in order for it to keep burning properly. If this would be unfamiliar to your readers, you could use a general expression for preparing a lamp. Alternate translation: “adjusted their lamps so they would burn brightly”
25:8	cp7f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	ταῖς φρονίμοις εἶπον, δότε ἡμῖν ἐκ τοῦ ἐλαίου ὑμῶν, ὅτι αἱ λαμπάδες ἡμῶν σβέννυνται	1	If your language would not use a direct quotation inside of a direct quotation, you could translate the second direct quotation as an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: “said to the wise ones that they should give them from their oil, because their lamps were going out”
25:8	i1r7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	αἱ λαμπάδες ἡμῶν σβέννυνται	1	Here, **going out** refers to the **lamps** running out of oil so that the fire in them would stop burning. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the fire in our lamps is about to burn out”
25:9	ybzj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	λέγουσαι, μήποτε οὐ μὴ ἀρκέσῃ ἡμῖν καὶ ὑμῖν; πορεύεσθε μᾶλλον πρὸς τοὺς πωλοῦντας, καὶ ἀγοράσατε ἑαυταῖς	1	If your language would not use a direct quotation inside of a direct quotation, you could translate the second direct quotation as an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: “said that there would certainly not be enough for themselves and the foolish ones, so the foolish ones should go instead to the ones selling and buy for themselves”
25:9	j6z8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	μήποτε οὐ μὴ ἀρκέσῃ ἡμῖν καὶ ὑμῖν; πορεύεσθε μᾶλλον πρὸς τοὺς πωλοῦντας, καὶ ἀγοράσατε ἑαυταῖς	1	It is implied that **the wise ones** are referring to oil. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “There will certainly not be enough oil for us and you. Go instead to the ones selling oil and buy some oil for yourselves”
25:9	gr5b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	μήποτε οὐ μὴ ἀρκέσῃ ἡμῖν καὶ ὑμῖν	1	By answering in this way, **the wise ones** imply that they will not give any oil to the foolish virgins. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “We will not give you any oil! There will certainly not be enough oil for us and you.”
25:9	qwkx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	οὐ μὴ	1	The phrase **certainly not** translates two negative words in Greek. The wise virgins use them together to emphasize that they do not have enough oil to share with the foolish virgins. If your language can use two negatives together for emphasis without them cancelling each other to create a positive meaning, it would be appropriate to use that construction here.
25:9	s43k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἡμῖν	1	Here, **us** refers to the wise virgins, so **us** would be exclusive. Your language may require you to mark this form.

25:10	jej8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ἀγοράσαι	1	Jesus is leaving out a word that a clause would need in many languages to be complete. If it would be helpful in your language, you could supply the missing word from the context. Alternate translation: “to buy more oil”

25:11	ys4h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture	ἔρχονται 	1	To call attention to a development in the story, Jesus uses the present tense in past narration. If it would not be natural to do that in your language, you could use the past tense in your translation. Alternate translation: “came”
25:11	gbdp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	λέγουσαι, κύριε, κύριε, ἄνοιξον ἡμῖν!	1	If your language would not use a direct quotation inside of a direct quotation, you could translate the second direct quotation as an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: “saying that the master should open for them”
25:11	ouya		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	ἄνοιξον ἡμῖν	1	Here, **open** is an imperative, but since the **virgins** cannot command the **master** to do this, you could translate this phrase as polite request. Alternate translation: “please open for us”
25:11	e5pz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἄνοιξον ἡμῖν	1	Here **the other virgins** are implying that they want the door opened for them so they can enter the wedding feast.

25:12	h4a8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οὐκ οἶδα ὑμᾶς	1	By answering in this way, the bridegroom implies that he will not open the door for the foolish virgins. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “I will not open the door for you because I do not know you”

25:14	fmb3			τὰ ὑπάρχοντα αὐτοῦ	1	Alternate translation: “his property” or “his wealth”
25:15	i81u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney	πέντε τάλαντα	1	See the discussion of the talent as a unit of money in the General Notes to this chapter to decide how to represent these numbers of **talents** in your translation.

25:15	vyj2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ᾧ δὲ δύο, ᾧ δὲ ἕν, ἑκάστῳ	1	Jesus is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete. If it would be helpful in your language, you could supply these words from the previous clause. It may be helpful to break the sentence here. Alternate translation: “and to one slave he gave two talents, and to one slave he gave one talent. He gave to each”
25:15	d87u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἑκάστῳ κατὰ τὴν ἰδίαν δύναμιν	1	Here, **his** refers to each slave. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “to each of them according to each one’s own ability”
25:16	qkr2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney	τὰ πέντε τάλαντα & ἄλλα πέντε τάλαντα	1	See how you translated **talents** in the previous verse to decide how to translate it here and in the rest of the parable. Alternate translation: “the amount equal to 80 years’ wages … an equal amount”

25:19	uejo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture	ἔρχεται & καὶ συναίρει	1	To call attention to a development in the story, Jesus uses the present tense in past narration.

26:intro	mtq8				0	# Matthew 26 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in [26:31](../26/31.md), which is quoted from the Old Testament.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Sheep\n\nSheep are a common image used in Scripture to refer to the people of Israel. In [26:31](../26/31.md), however, Jesus uses the words “the sheep” to refer to his disciples and to say that they would run away when he was arrested.\n\n### Passover\n\nThe Passover festival was when the Jews celebrated the day God killed the firstborn sons of the Egyptians but “passed over” the Israelites and let them live.\n\n### The meaning of the “body” and “blood” of Jesus\n\n[26:26–28](./26.md) describes Jesus’ last meal with his followers. During this meal, Jesus said of the bread, “This is my body,” and of the wine, “This is my blood of the covenant, that is being poured out for many.” As Jesus instructed, Christian churches around the world re-enact this meal regularly, calling it “the Lord’s Supper,” the “Eucharist”, or “Holy Communion.” But they have different understandings of what Jesus meant by these sayings. Some churches believe that Jesus was speaking figuratively and that he meant that the bread and wine represented his body and blood. Other churches believe that he was speaking literally and that the actual body and blood of Jesus are really present in the bread and wine of this ceremony. Translators should be careful not to let how they understand this issue affect how they translate this passage.\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### Judas’ kiss for Jesus\n\n[26:49](../mat/26/49.md) describes how Judas kissed Jesus so the soldiers would know whom to arrest. In this culture, when men greeted other men who were family or friends, they would **kiss** them on one cheek or on both cheeks. If your readers would find it embarrassing if you said that one man would kiss another man, you could explain the purpose of the gesture, or you could translate the expression in a more general way. You might say, for example, that Judas “kissed Jesus on the cheek as a greeting” or that Judas “gave Jesus a friendly greeting.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])\n\n### “I am able to destroy the temple of God”\n\nTwo men accused Jesus of saying that he could destroy the temple in Jerusalem and then rebuild it “in three days” ([26:61](../26/61.md)). They were accusing him of insulting God by claiming that God had given him the authority to destroy the temple and the power to rebuild it. What Jesus actually said was that if the Jewish authorities were to destroy this temple, he would certainly raise it up in three days ([John 2:19](../jhn/02/19.md)).

27:intro	deu4				0	# Matthew 27 General Notes\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### “The curtain of the temple was split in two”\n\nThe curtain in the temple was an important symbol that showed that people needed to have someone speak to God for them. They could not speak to God directly, because all people are sinful and God hates sin. God split the curtain to show that Jesus’ people can now speak to God directly because Jesus has paid for their sins.\n\n### The tomb\n\nThe tomb in which Jesus was buried ([27:60](../27/60.md)) was the kind of tomb in which wealthy Jewish families buried their dead. It was an actual room cut into a rock. It had a flat place on one side where they could place the body after they had put oil and spices on it and wrapped it in cloth. Then they would roll a large rock in front of the tomb so no one could see inside or enter.\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### Sarcasm\n\nIn [27:28–29](../27/28.md) the soldiers were insulting Jesus when they put a “scarlet robe” on him, placed a “crown of thorns” on his head, said, “Hail, King of the Jews,” and knelt down in front of him. These actions were symbolic of things that people would do to honor a king, but the soldiers did not really believe that Jesus was a king. By pretending that they thought Jesus was a king, and by putting a “crown of thorns” on Jesus’ head instead of a regular crown, and by spitting on him and “striking him on his head” (See: [27:30](../27/30.md)) the soldiers showed that they did not believe that Jesus was the Son of God. (See: [[rc:///ta/man/translate/figs-irony]] and [[rc:///ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]]) and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/mock]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Golgotha\n\nThe word “Golgotha” is an Aramaic word. Matthew used Greek letters to express the sound of this Aramaic word so that his readers would know how it sounded, and then he told them it meant “Place of a Skull.” You may also use the letters of your language to express the sound of this Aramaic word. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate]])\n\n### Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?\n\nThis is an Aramaic phrase. Matthew used Greek letters to express the sound of this Aramaic phrase so that his readers would know how it sounded, and then he told them that it meant “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” You may also use the letters of your language to express the sounds of these Aramaic words. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate]])

27:22	uedb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	σταυρωθήτω	1	Here, the phrase **Let him be crucified** is an imperative, but since the crowd cannot command Pilate to do this, you could translate this phrase as an expression of what they want.

27:25	timm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἡμᾶς & ἡμῶν	1	Here, **us** and **our** refer to the Jewish people, so **us** and **our** would be exclusive. Your language may require you to mark these forms.

27:26	yb5y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἀπέλυσεν & παρέδωκεν ἵνα σταυρωθῇ	1	The first two occurrences of **he** refer to Pilate, but **him** and the third occurrence of **he** refer to **Jesus**.

27:26	n421		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	παρέδωκεν	1	Matthew is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete.

27:27	bn22		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὅλην τὴν σπεῖραν	1	Matthew assumes that his readers will know that a **cohort** was a unit of Roman soldiers. A **cohort** normally numbered around 600 men but could sometimes refer to as few as 200 men. Here, by saying **the whole cohort**, Matthew most likely means that all the soldiers from the **cohort** who were on duty at that time. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “the whole unit of soldiers” or “the whole unit of soldiers who were on duty there”

27:28	yf6s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	κοκκίνην	1	The word **scarlet** refers to a color. Since Mark records in [Mark 15:17](../mrk/15/17.md) that the color of this **robe** was “purple,” the color closely resembled both **scarlet** and “purple.” If your readers would be unfamiliar with these colors, you could use the closest equivalent color that they would be familiar with.

27:29	ksjn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	στέφανον ἐξ ἀκανθῶν	1	Matthew is using the possessive form to describe a **crown** that is made from branches with **thorns** on them.

These soldiers do not really believe that Jesus is a king, but rather, they have **knelt down** to mock him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could provide a brief explanation. See the discussion of this in the General Notes for this chapter. Alternate translation: “having knelt down as if honoring a king”
27:29	qf8j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony	ἐνέπαιξαν αὐτῷ λέγοντες, χαῖρε, ὁ Βασιλεῦ τῶν Ἰουδαίων	1	**Hail** was a common greeting, but the soldiers used this greeting in order to mock Jesus. They did not believe that Jesus was really the **King of the Jews**. They actually meant to communicate the opposite of the literal meaning of their words, as Matthew indicates when he says that **they mocked him**.

Alternate translation: “a place that people called Golgotha, which means”
27:33	lopg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate	Γολγοθᾶ	1	Here Matthew writes out the sounds of this Jewish Aramaic word using Greek letters. Since Matthew translates the meaning later in the verse, you may write out this word using the most similar sounds in your language. See the discussion of **Golgotha** in the General Notes for this chapter.
27:34	f11j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	πιεῖν οἶνον μετὰ χολῆς μεμιγμένον	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

Alternate translation: “bitter, pain-relieving medicine”
27:35	d4h6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	βάλλοντες κλῆρον	1	The term **lots** refers to objects with different markings on various sides that were used to decide randomly among several possibilities. They were tossed onto the ground to see which marked side would come up on top. If your readers would not be familiar with **lots**, you could use a general expression for gambling. Alternate translation: “by gambling”
27:35	u4dl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	βάλλοντες κλῆρον	1	Matthew implies that the soldiers were **casting lots** in order to determine who would take which pieces of Jesus’ clothing.

28:intro	psw9				0	# Matthew 28 General Notes\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### The tomb\n\nThe tomb in which Jesus was buried ([28:1](../28/01.md)) was the kind of tomb in which wealthy Jewish families buried their dead. It was an actual room cut into a rock. It had a flat place on one side where they could place the body after they had put oil and spices on it and wrapped it in cloth. Then they would roll a large rock in front of the tomb so no one could see inside or enter. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/tomb]])\n\n### “Make disciples”\n\nThe last two verses ([28:19–20](../28/19.md)) are commonly known as “The Great Commission” because they contain a very important command given to all Christians. Christians are to “make disciples” by going to people, sharing the gospel with them, and training them to live according to what Jesus commanded. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/disciple]])\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### An angel of the Lord\n\nMatthew, Mark, Luke, and John all wrote about angels in white clothing appearing to the women at Jesus’ tomb. Two of the authors called them men, but that is only because the angels looked like male humans. Two of the authors wrote about two angels, but the other two authors wrote about only one of them. It is best to translate each of these passages as it appears in the ULT without trying to make the passages all say exactly the same thing. (See: [Matthew 28:1–2](../mat/28/01.md) and [Mark 16:5](../mrk/16/05.md) and [Luke 24:4](../luk/24/04.md) and [John 20:12](../jhn/20/12.md))
