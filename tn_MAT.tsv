front:intro	sa9c				0	# Introduction to the Gospel of Matthew\n\n## Part 1: General Introduction\n\n### Outline of the book of Matthew\n\n1. The birth of Jesus Christ and the beginning of his ministry (1:1-4:25)\n1. Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount (5:1-7:28)\n1. Jesus illustrates the kingdom of God through acts of healing (8:1-9:34)\n1. Jesus teaches about mission and the kingdom (9:35-10:42)\n1. Jesus teaches about the gospel of the kingdom of God. Opposition to Jesus begins. (11:1-12:50)\n1. Jesus tells parables about the kingdom of God (13:1-52)\n1. Further opposition to Jesus and misunderstanding of the kingdom of God (13:53-17:57)\n1. Jesus teaches about life in the kingdom of God (18:1-35)\n1. Jesus ministers in Judea (19:1-22:46)\n1. Jesus teaches about the final judgment and salvation (23:1-25:46)\n1. The crucifixion of Jesus, his death and resurrection (26:1-28:19)\n\n### What is the book of Matthew about?\n\nThe Gospel of Matthew is one of four books in the New Testament that describe some of the life of Jesus Christ. The authors of the Gospels wrote about different aspects of who Jesus was and what he did. Matthew showed that Jesus was the Messiah, and God would save Israel through him. Matthew often explained that Jesus fulfilled the Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah. This may indicate that he expected most of his first readers to be Jewish. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/christ]])\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nTranslators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “The Gospel of Matthew,” or “The Gospel according to Matthew.” Or they may choose a title that may be clearer, such as, “The Good News about Jesus that Matthew wrote.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])\n\n### Who wrote the book of Matthew?\n\nThe book does not give the name of the author. However, since early Christian times, most Christians have thought that the author was the Apostle Matthew.\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### What is the “kingdom of heaven?”\n\nMatthew spoke of the “kingdom of heaven” in the same way that other Gospel writers spoke of the kingdom of God. The kingdom of heaven represents God ruling over all people and all creation everywhere. Those whom God accepts into his kingdom will be blessed. They will live with God forever.\n\n### What were the teaching methods of Jesus?\n\nThe people regarded Jesus as a rabbi. A rabbi is a teacher of God’s law. Jesus taught in ways similar those of other religious teachers in Israel. He had students who followed him wherever he went. These students were called disciples. He often told parables. Parables are stories that teach moral lessons. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/disciple]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/parable]])\n\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\n\n### What are the Synoptic Gospels?\n\nThe Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke are called the Synoptic Gospels because they have many similar passages. The word “synoptic” means to “see together.”\n\nThe texts are considered “parallel” when they are the same or almost the same among two or three gospels. When translating parallel passages, translators should use the same wording and make them as similar as possible.\n\n### Why does Jesus refer to himself as the “Son of Man”?\n\nIn the gospels, Jesus calls himself the “Son of Man.” It is a reference to Daniel 7:13-14. In that passage there is a person described as a “son of man.” That means the person was someone who looked like a human being. God gave authority to the son of man to rule over the nations forever. All the people will worship him forever.\n\nJews of Jesus’ time did not use “Son of Man” as a title for anyone. Therefore, Jesus used it for himself to help them understand who he truly was. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sonofman]])\n\nTranslating the title “Son of Man” can be difficult in many languages. Readers may misunderstand a literal translation. Translators can consider alternatives, such as “The Human One.” It may also be helpful to include a footnote to explain the title.\n\n### What are the major issues in the text of the book of Matthew?\n\nThe following verses are found in older versions of the Bible but are not included in most modern versions:\n* “Bless those who curse you; do good to those who hate you” (5:44)\n* “For yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen” (6:13)\n* “But this kind of demon does not go out except with prayer and fasting” (17:21)\n* “For the Son of Man came to save that which was lost” (18:11)\n* “Many are called, but few are chosen” (20:16)\n* “Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you devour widows’ houses, while you make a show of long prayers. You will therefore receive greater condemnation.” (23:14)\n\nTranslators are advised not to include these passages. However, if in the translators’ region, there are older versions of the Bible that include one or more of these passages, the translators may include them. If they are included, they should be put inside square brackets ([]) to indicate that they were probably not original to Matthew’s Gospel. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
1:intro	y7kk				0	# Matthew 1 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n### Indentation\n\nSome translations set a quotation from the Old Testament farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text. The ULT does this for the quoted material in 1:23.\n\n### Genealogy\n\nA genealogy is a list that records a person’s ancestors or descendants. Genealogies were important to the Jewish people because family lineage is how they decided how someone functioned in society. For instance, if someone was a descendant of Aaron, they were able to become priests. Similarly, if someone was a descendant of King David, they were able to become a king. This genealogy shows that Jesus was clearly a descendant of King David, and therefore, was able to become king.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Use of the passive voice\n\nMatthew uses the passive voice very purposefully in this chapter to indicate that Mary did not have a sexual relationship with anyone. She became pregnant with Jesus because the Holy Spirit performed a miracle. Many languages do not have a passive voice, so translators in those languages must find other ways to present the same truths. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

2:2	zj7c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	αὐτοῦ τὸν ἀστέρα	1	They were not saying that the baby was the owner of the **star**, but rather that this star was directing them to where the child was. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express that explicitly. Alternate translation: “the star that tells about him” or “the star that is associated with his birth” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:2	v248			προσκυνῆσαι	1	This could mean: (1) they intended to **worship** the baby as divine. (2) they wanted to honor him as a human king. If your language has a word that includes both meanings, you should consider using it here.

2:5	o460		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	οὕτως γὰρ γέγραπται διὰ τοῦ προφήτου	1	In Matthew’s culture, **for thus it has been written through the prophet** is a normal way to introduce a quotation from an important text, in this case, the Old Testament book written by Micah the prophet.

2:6	rihn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐκ σοῦ γὰρ ἐξελεύσεται ἡγούμενος	1	When Matthew says **for from you will come out a ruling one**, he is talking about from the people who live in Bethlehem.

Alternate translation: “for from your people a leader will come” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
2:6	tg5d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ὅστις ποιμανεῖ τὸν λαόν μου τὸν Ἰσραήλ	1	Micah speaks of this ruler as one **who will shepherd my people Israel**. This means he will lead and care for the people just like a shepherd cares for their animals. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture.

3:intro	a6h3				0	# Matthew 3 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nSome translations set quotations from the Old Testament farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text. The ULT does this with the quoted material in verse 3.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### John the Baptist\n\nIn this chapter, John the Baptist appears, preaching in the wilderness. He is portrayed by Matthew as resembling the Prophet Elijah in the way that he dresses and by what he eats. We know from other Gospels that John is Jesus’ cousin. John the Baptist comes before Jesus to make people ready for his coming.\n\n### “Kingdom of heaven”\n\n“The kingdom of Heaven” is synonymous with “kingdom of God” from the other three Gospels. It is a major concept in the Gospel of Matthew and is very rich in meaning. It includes the idea of eternal life in the presence of God, but it also includes the idea of what the earth will be like in the future when God rules everything, and the idea of life on earth right now, when and where God’s wishes are carried out fully. The unifying concept behind all of these ideas is that of people becoming the people over whom God rules. Wherever the expression “the kingdom of God” occurs, translation notes will suggest communicating this idea behind the abstract noun “kingdom.” UST models this approach consistently. (See: rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns)\n\n### “Bear fruit worthy of repentance”\n\nFruit is a common metaphor for doing good things that God desires you to do. That idea is similar to what we observe in nature, that if a fruit plant is healthy, it will bear a lot of good fruit, but if a fruit plant is unhealthy, it will bear bad fruit or no fruit.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Metonymy\n\nMatthew uses metonymy frequently in this chapter to express groups of people or things. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language to express these figures of speech.
3:1	xp3z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	δὲ	1	This is the beginning of a new part of the story where Matthew tells of the ministry of John the Baptist. Use the natural form in your language for introducing a new event. Alternate translation: “Some time while Jesus was still in Galilee” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
3:1	ifa0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	Ἰωάννης ὁ Βαπτιστὴς	1	This introduces **John** as a new character in the story. Use the natural form in your language for introducing a new character. The expression “the Baptist” identifies him as someone who baptized people in water after they were sorry for their sins. Since he is a new participant, if it would be helpful to your readers, you could call him something like “a man named John, who baptized people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
3:2	hvx8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἤγγικεν & ἡ Βασιλεία τῶν Οὐρανῶν	1	The phrase **the kingdom of the heavens** refers to God ruling as king. Here, **heavens** refers to the place from which God rules. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “our God in heaven will soon show himself to be king” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
3:3	fl4v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	οὗτος γάρ ἐστιν ὁ ῥηθεὶς διὰ Ἠσαΐου τοῦ προφήτου λέγοντος	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

3:3	yhe7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	ἑτοιμάσατε τὴν ὁδὸν Κυρίου; εὐθείας ποιεῖτε τὰς τρίβους αὐτοῦ	1	Here there is a direct quotation inside a direct quotation, as Matthew quotes Isaiah who quotes the messenger. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate the second direct quotation as an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: “telling people to make ready the way of the Lord and to make his paths straight” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
3:3	hxb6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	φωνὴ βοῶντος ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ	1	Consider natural ways of introducing direct quotations in your language. Alternate translation: “The voice of someone is heard crying out in the wilderness, saying:” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
3:3	s62r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	φωνὴ βοῶντος	1	Here, a voice refers to the messenger who uses his voice to cry out.

Alternate translation: “People will hear the messenger’s voice as he cries out” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
3:3	n7lh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	ἑτοιμάσατε τὴν ὁδὸν Κυρίου; εὐθείας ποιεῖτε τὰς τρίβους αὐτοῦ	1	**Make ready the way of the Lord** and **make his paths straight** mean almost the same thing. If it would be helpful in your language, you could combine the two. “Prepare to hear and obey the Lord’s message when he comes”. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
3:3	j99i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἑτοιμάσατε τὴν ὁδὸν Κυρίου	1	Isaiah uses a metaphor here of preparing paths or the way on which someone will travel. If someone prepares a path for another, they make the path walkable. If someone in high authority were coming, they would make sure the roads were clear from any hazards. So this metaphor means that the people should prepare themselves to receive the Lord’s message when he comes. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture or use plain speech. Alternate translation: “Prepare to hear and obey the Lord’s message when he comes” (See: rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor)

3:4	xgxk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ἀκρίδες	1	If your readers would not know what **locusts** are, you could include a description in a footnote or use a more general term. Alternate translation: “grasshoppers” or “insects” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

3:5	zys1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	Ἱεροσόλυμα, καὶ πᾶσα ἡ Ἰουδαία, καὶ πᾶσα ἡ περίχωρος	1	The word **all** is an exaggeration to emphasize that very many people went out. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your language that depicts many people. Alternate translation: “very many people from Jerusalem, Judea, and the region near the Jordan river” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
3:6	v5xn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐβαπτίζοντο & ὑπ’ αὐτοῦ	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

3:7	c4cl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τίς ὑπέδειξεν ὑμῖν φυγεῖν ἀπὸ τῆς μελλούσης ὀργῆς?	1	John uses a question to rebuke the Pharisees and Sadducees because they were asking him to baptize them so that God would not punish them, but they did not want to stop sinning. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “You cannot flee from God’s wrath like this.” or “Do not think that you can escape God’s wrath just because I baptize you.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
3:7	h7ac		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	φυγεῖν ἀπὸ τῆς μελλούσης ὀργῆς	1	The phrase **coming wrath** is being used to refer to God’s punishment.

If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your language that portrays this exaggeration. Alternate translation: “God could make children of Abraham even out of these rocks!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
3:9	eedc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τέκνα τῷ Ἀβραάμ	1	Here, the word **children** means “descendants.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture.

3:10	d4j5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἤδη δὲ ἡ ἀξίνη πρὸς τὴν ῥίζαν τῶν δένδρων κεῖται; πᾶν οὖν δένδρον μὴ ποιοῦν καρπὸν καλὸν ἐκκόπτεται καὶ εἰς πῦρ βάλλεται	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

3:12	b5m4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τὸ πτύον	1	A **winnowing fork** is a tool for tossing wheat into the air to separate the wheat grain from the chaff. The heavier grain falls back down, and the wind blows away the unwanted chaff. This tool is similar to a pitchfork. If you have a similar tool in your culture, you can use the word for it here. Otherwise, you can use a phrase that would express the meaning. Alternate translation: “tool for threshing grain” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
3:12	r2ua		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τὴν ἅλωνα αὐτοῦ	1	The **threshing floor** was the place where harvested wheat was processed to separate the valuable grain from the useless husks. To clear off the floor is to finish threshing all the grain.

Alternate translation: “his place where he separated the grain from the chaff” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
3:12	av8l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	συνάξει τὸν σῖτον αὐτοῦ εἰς τὴν ἀποθήκην & τὸ δὲ ἄχυρον κατακαύσει πυρὶ ἀσβέστῳ	1	John continues to speak, describing how the coming Messiah will judge people. The wheat is the part of the crop that is useful. It represents people who are obedient to God, who will be welcomed into his presence. The chaff is the husk that surrounds the grain. It is not useful for anything, so people burn it up. You could express this metaphor as a simile in your translation. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here, placing a period after “floor” and deleting the word “and.”. Alternate translation: “He will welcome those who are obedient to God, just as a farmer stores good grain in his barn. But he will punish those who are disobedient to God, just as a farmer burns up the useless chaff” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

5:intro	awz8				0	# Matthew 5 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nMany people call the words in Matthew 5-7 the Sermon on the Mount. This is one long lesson that Jesus taught. Bibles divide this lesson into three chapters, but this can sometimes confuse the reader. If your translation divides the text into sections, be sure that the reader understands that the whole sermon is one large section.\n\nMatthew 5:3-10, known as the Beatitudes or Blessings, has been set apart by being set farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text, with each line beginning with the word “blessed.” This way of placing the words on the page highlights the poetic form of this teaching.\n\nJesus spoke about many different subjects in this sermon, so you may wish to help the reader by putting an empty line into the text whenever Jesus changed the subject.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### “His disciples”\n\nIt is possible to refer to anyone who followed Jesus as a follower or disciple. Jesus selected 12 of his followers to become his closest disciples, “the twelve disciples” or “the Twelve.” They would later become known as the apostles.\n\n### Generic Noun Phrases\n\nIn this chapter, because Jesus is talking to a very large crowd, he often uses words such as “you”, “those”, “a person”, “someone” or other ways of speaking about people in general. He is not speaking about any particular person. This is a common practice when giving important universal teachers as Jesus is doing here. Express these phrases in a way that is natural in your language for speaking about people in general. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])\n\n### The Law\n\nMany times in this chapter, it sounds like Jesus contrasts what the law says with “but I say.” Jesus is not actually contrasting what he says with the law, but is just expanding on the meaning of the law for his listeners, to apply it to their lives. Make sure this is clear to your readers.\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### You singular and you plural\n\nIn this chapter, Jesus is talking to a large crowd of his followers. Throughout the chapter, Jesus switches between using you in the singular and you in the plural while he is talking to the same people. When he is using the singular, he is referring to all of the individuals in the crowd, but is still referring to the crowd as a whole. Your language may require you to use a plural form here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])

5:41	zv6i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ὕπαγε μετ’ αὐτοῦ δύο	1	Jesus is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete.

5:46	se4k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τίνα μισθὸν ἔχετε?	1	Jesus uses this question to teach the people that loving those who love them is not something special for which God will reward them.

6:intro	jrj2				0	# Matthew 6 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nMatthew 6 continues Jesus’ extended teaching known as “The Sermon on the Mount.”\n\nYou may wish to set apart the prayer in 6:9-11 by placing it farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text.\n\nJesus spoke about many different subjects in this sermon, so you may wish to help the reader by putting an empty line into the text whenever Jesus changed the subject.\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### You singular and you plural\n\nIn this chapter, as in the last chapter, Jesus is talking to a large crowd of his followers. Throughout the chapter, Jesus switches between using you in the singular and you in the plural. In both instances he is talking to the same people. When he is using the singular, he is referring to all of the individuals in the crowd, but is still referring to the crowd as a whole. Your language may require you to use a plural here.

7:intro	bz7e				0	# Matthew 7 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nJesus spoke about many different subjects in this sermon, so you may wish to help the reader by putting an empty line into the text whenever Jesus changed the subject.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Matthew 5-7\n\nMany people call the words in Matthew 5-7 the Sermon on the Mount. This is one long lesson that Jesus taught. Bibles divide this lesson into three chapters, but this can sometimes confuse the reader. If your translation divides the text into sections, be sure that the reader understands that the whole sermon is one large section.\n\n### “By their fruits you will know them”\n\nFruit is a common image in the Scriptures. It is used to describe the results of either good or bad actions. In this chapter, good fruit is the result of living as God commands. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/fruit]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### You singular and you plural\n\nIn this chapter, as in the past two chapters, Jesus is talking to a large crowd of his followers. Throughout the chapter, Jesus switches between using you in the singular and you in the plural. In both instances he is talking to the same people. When he is using the singular, he is referring to all of the individuals in the crowd, but is still referring to the crowd as a whole. Your language may require you to use a plural here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
7:1	xk6w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	μὴ κρίνετε	1	It is implied here that the word **judge** has a strong negative meaning.

Alternate translation: “Do not condemn people harshly” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:1	bk8y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	μὴ κριθῆτε	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

7:2	tbi8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	κρίνετε & μετρεῖτε	1	Here, Jesus leaves out that **you judge** and **you measure** is being done to other people.

7:2	wmxo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	καὶ ἐν ᾧ μέτρῳ μετρεῖτε, μετρηθήσεται ὑμῖν	1	To **measure** someone is to hold them up to a high standard. Here, Jesus is saying that they are holding others up by too high of a standard. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning in plain language. Alternative translation: “and with the standard of behavior that you expect of other people, God will expect of you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
7:2	c006		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐν ᾧ μέτρῳ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **measure**, you could express the same idea in another way.

This is a metaphor that refers to the less offensive sins of a fellow believer. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture.

7:3	d2qc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship	τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ σου	1	Here and in the next two verses, **brother** refers to other people who were also followers of Jesus.

7:3	xdcg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	τὴν & ἐν τῷ σῷ ὀφθαλμῷ δοκὸν οὐ κατανοεῖς	1	A **log** cannot fit into a person’s eye.

If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your language that shows this exaggeration. Alternate translation: “you do not see your own very offensive sins” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
7:4	k58h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	ἢ πῶς ἐρεῖς τῷ ἀδελφῷ σου, ἄφες ἐκβάλω τὸ κάρφος ἐκ τοῦ ὀφθαλμοῦ σου, καὶ ἰδοὺ, ἡ δοκὸς ἐν τῷ ὀφθαλμῷ σοῦ?	1	Jesus asks this question to challenge the people to pay attention to their own sins before they pay attention to another person’s sins. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “You should not say to your brother, ‘Let me take out the speck from your eye,’ while there is log in your own eye.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
7:6	wohg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	μὴ δῶτε τὸ ἅγιον τοῖς κυσίν, μηδὲ βάλητε τοὺς μαργαρίτας ὑμῶν ἔμπροσθεν τῶν χοίρων	1	Here, to **give the holy** and to **throw your pearls** means to share about God with people.

This proverb draws a figurative comparison. Just as sick people need to see a doctor to be healed, so sinners need to see Jesus in order to be forgiven and restored.

If this patch has not yet been washed, it will shrink and tear the piece of clothing, making the hole worse than it was to begin with.

10:intro	m5iu				0	# Matthew 10 General Notes\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### The sending of the 12 disciples\n\nMany verses in this chapter describe how Jesus sent the 12 disciples out. He sent them to tell his message about the kingdom of heaven. They were to tell his message only in Israel and not to share it with the Gentiles.\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### The 12 disciples\n\nThe following are the lists of the 12 disciples:\n\nIn Matthew:\n\nSimon (Peter), Andrew, James son of Zebedee, John son of Zebedee, Philip, Bartholomew, Thomas, Matthew, James son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot.\n\nIn Mark:\n\nSimon (Peter), Andrew, James the son of Zebedee and John the son of Zebedee (to whom he gave the name Boanerges, that is, sons of thunder), Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot.\n\nIn Luke:\n\nSimon (Peter), Andrew, James, John, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Simon (who was called the Zealot), Judas the son of James, and Judas Iscariot.\n\nThaddaeus is probably the same person as Jude, the son of James.\n\n### “The kingdom of heaven has come near”\n\nNo one knows for sure whether the “kingdom of heaven” was present or still coming when John spoke these words. English translations often use the phrase “at hand,” but these words can be difficult to translate. Other versions use the phrases “is coming near” and “has come near.”
10:1	nhp2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	καὶ	1	# Connecting Statement:\n\nThis verse begins the account of Jesus sending his disciples out to share his message with the people in the surrounding towns.

10:1	x1er		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἔδωκεν αὐτοῖς ἐξουσίαν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **authority**, you could express the same idea with a verbal form.

10:2	t59v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	δὲ	1	**Now** is used to add needed background information about the 12 apostles. Use the natural form in your language for expressing background information. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])

11:intro	puf4				0	# Matthew 11 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nSome translations set quotations from the Old Testament farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text. The ULT does this with the quoted material in 11:10.\n\nSome scholars believe that [Matthew 11:20](../mat/11/20.md) begins a new stage in the ministry of Christ because of Israel’s rejection of him.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Hidden revelation\n\nAfter [Matthew 11:20](../mat/11/20.md), Jesus begins to reveal information about himself and about the plans of God the Father, while hiding this information from those who reject him ([Matthew 11:25](../mat/11/25.md)).\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### “The kingdom of heaven is near”\n\nNo one knows for sure whether the “kingdom of heaven” was present or still coming when John spoke these words. English translations often use The phrase **at hand**, but these words can be difficult to translate. Other versions use the phrases “is coming near” and “has come near.”

11:29	q1ya		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor	ἄρατε τὸν ζυγόν μου ἐφ’ ὑμᾶς	1	Jesus continues the metaphor of burden that he began in the last verse. Jesus uses the image of a **yoke**, something which is put on large animals to carry or pull heavy burdens, to encourage his listeners to let him carry their burdens with them. If it would be helpful in your language to understand what **yoke** means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning in plain language. Alternative translation: “Share your burden with me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])
11:29	t1rh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	πραΰς εἰμι καὶ ταπεινὸς τῇ καρδίᾳ	1	Here, **gentle** and **humble in heart** mean basically the same thing.

Alternate translation: “When I help you, it will be like I am carrying most of the weight of the yoke and you are only carrying a little bit of the burden” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])
11:30	ynf1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	ὁ γὰρ ζυγός μου χρηστὸς καὶ τὸ φορτίον μου ἐλαφρόν ἐστιν	1	Both of these phrases mean the same thing.

12:intro	y7z6				0	# Matthew 12 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 12:18-21, which are words from the Old Testament.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### The Sabbath\n\nThis chapter has much to say about how God’s people are to honor the Sabbath. Jesus said that the rules that the Pharisees made up did not help people obey the Sabbath the way God wanted them to. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sabbath]])\n\n### “Blasphemy against the Spirit”\n\nNo one knows for sure what actions people perform or what words they say when they commit this sin. However, they probably insult the Holy Spirit and his work. Part of the Holy Spirit’s work is to make people understand that they are sinners and that they need to have God forgive them. Therefore, anyone who does not try to stop sinning is probably committing blasphemy against the Spirit. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/blasphemy]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/holyspirit]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Brothers and sisters\n\nMost people call those who have the same parents “brother” and “sister” and think of them as some of the most important people in their lives. Many people also call those with the same grandparents “brother” and “sister.” In this chapter Jesus says that the most important people to him are those who obey his Father in heaven. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/brother]])

12:1	tvt9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τῶν σπορίμων	1	A grainfield is a place where grain is grown and harvested. This grain is usually ground and made into bread.

12:1	y5vr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	στάχυας	1	The **heads** are the topmost part of the grain plant, which is a kind of tall grass. The heads hold the mature grain or seeds of the plant. The disciples were picking the **heads of grain** to eat the kernels, or seeds, in them. If it would be helpful in your language, think of a type of food from which you have to remove a shell or casing. Alternate translation: “picking the tops of grain and eating the seeds.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
12:2	swl7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ποιοῦσιν ὃ οὐκ ἔξεστιν ποιεῖν ἐν Σαββάτῳ	1	According to the law of Moses, people are not allowed to work on the Sabbath in order to focus on worshiping God.

If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “how he went into the God’s house and ate the bread of the presence, which they were not allowed to do. Only the priests were allowed to do this” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
12:4	blm5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τὸν οἶκον τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Jesus is describing the tabernacle as the house of God.

Alternatively, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the tabernacle” (See: rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor)
12:4	ue7l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τοὺς ἄρτους τῆς Προθέσεως	1	This refers to the 12 loaves of bread that were placed on a golden table in the tabernacle or temple building as a sacrifice to God during Old Testament times.

If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “Surely you have read in the law of Moses that on the Sabbaths the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath, but are innocent.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

Alternate translation: “But suppose you had understood what the phrase ‘I desire you to have mercy and not to sacrifice’ meant. Then you certainly would not have condemned my innocent disciples” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical]])
12:7	e1ju			ἔλεος θέλω καὶ οὐ θυσίαν	1	In the law of Moses, God did command the Israelites to offer sacrifices. This verse is saying that God would prefer the Israelites to have **mercy** rather than for them to have to offer a **sacrifice** for their sins. Make sure this is clear to your readers. Alternate translation: “I would rather that you would be merciful to others than for you to continually offer sacrifices for your wrongful deeds”
12:7	s23l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	τοὺς ἀναιτίους	1	Jesus is using the adjective **innocent** as a noun in order to describe his disciples.

It was probably bent almost into a fist, making it look smaller. State this in a way that would be understandable to your readers. Alternate translation: “his hand was shriveled” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
12:10	c1cc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	καὶ ἐπηρώτησαν αὐτὸν & ἵνα κατηγορήσωσιν αὐτοῦ	1	Here, Matthew is giving background information to help to reader understand why the Pharisees **questioned** Jesus.

13:intro	s3lu				0	# Matthew 13 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 13:14-15, which are words from the Old Testament.\n\nThis chapter begins a new section. It contains some of Jesus’ parables about the kingdom of heaven.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Metonymy\n\nJesus often says the word **heaven** when he wants his hearers to think of God, who lives in heaven ([13:11](../mat/13/11.md)).\n\n### Implicit information\n\nSpeakers usually do not say things that they think their hearers already understand. When Matthew wrote that Jesus “sat beside the sea” ([Matthew 13:1](../mat/13/01.md)), he probably expected his hearers to know that Jesus was about to teach the people. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])\n\n### Metaphor\n\nSpeakers often use examples of things that we can see or touch to communicate abstract ideas. Jesus spoke of birds eating newly sown seed to describe how Satan keeps people from understanding Jesus’ message ([13:19](../mat/13/19.md)).\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Passive voice\n\nMany sentences in this chapter tell that something happened to a  person without indicating who caused the thing to happen. For example, “they were scorched” ([13:6](../mat/13/06.md)). You may have to translate the sentence so that it tells the reader who performed the action. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])\n\n### Parables\n\nThe parables are short stories that Jesus told so that people would easily understand the lesson he was trying to teach them. He also told the stories so that those who did not want to believe in him would not understand the truth ([13:11-13](./11.md)).

13:2	d0v5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	πᾶς ὁ ὄχλος	1	The word crowd is a singular noun that refers to a group of people.

The seeds on the path did not get hidden from the birds, so they ate them. If it would be helpful in your language, you can state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “As he was scattering the seeds, some of them fell onto the path, where they were unprotected from scavengers” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
13:5,7-8	ql87		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ἄλλα	1	In these verses, the word **others** is referring to seeds that fell in different areas as the sower was planting. If it would be helpful in your language, see how it is modeled in the UST. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

13:7	vt8z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀνέβησαν αἱ ἄκανθαι καὶ ἀπέπνιξαν αὐτά	1	The phrase **the thorns grew up and choked them** might be confusing to some readers. What this means is that the weeds grew much faster than did the crops that the sower planted, and so the weeds did not allow the crops to grow. If it would be helpful in your language, you can state this explicitly with an example from your culture. Alternate translation: “the thorns grew much faster and overwhelmed the plants” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

If you must state who did the action, Jesus implies that “God” did it. Alternate translation: “God has given to you to understand mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens, but God has not given that understanding to those people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

14:intro	g5mc				0	# Matthew 14 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nVerses 1 and 2 continue the account from chapter 13. Verses 3-12 stop the account and speak of things that happened earlier, possibly soon after Satan tempted Jesus (see [4:12](../mat/04/12.md)). Verse 13 continues the account from verse 2. Be sure to have words in verses 3-12 that tell the reader that Matthew has stopped his account to give new information before he continues. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])\n\n## Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Passive voice\n\nMany sentences in this chapter tell that a person had something happen to him without saying who caused that thing to happen. For example, the writer does not tell who brought John’s head to Herodias’s daughter ([14:11](../mat/14/11.md)). You may have to translate the sentence so that it tells the reader who performed the action. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

15:intro	i9a5				0	# Matthew 15 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 15:8-9, which are words from the Old Testament.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### The “traditions of the elders”\n\nThe “traditions of the elders” were oral laws that the Jewish religious leaders developed because they wanted to make sure that everyone obeyed the law of Moses. However, they often worked harder to obey these rules than to obey the law of Moses itself. Jesus rebuked the religious leaders for this, and they became angry as a result. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]])\n\n### Jews and Gentiles\n\nThe Jews of Jesus’ time thought that only Jews could please God by the way they lived. Jesus healed a Canaanite Gentile woman’s daughter to show his followers that he would accept both Jews and Gentiles as his people.\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Sheep\n\nThe Bible often speaks of people as if they were sheep because sheep require someone to take care of them. This is because they do not see well and they often go to where predatory animals can easily kill and eat them . (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

16:intro	za2k				0	# Matthew 16 General Notes\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Yeast\n\nJesus spoke of the way people thought about God as if it were bread, and he spoke of what people taught about God as if it were the yeast that makes bread dough become larger and the baked bread taste good. He did not want his followers to listen to what the Pharisees and Sadducees taught. This was because if they did listen, they would not understand who God is and how he wants his people to live. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Metaphor\n\nJesus told his people to obey his commands. He did this by telling them to “follow” him. It is as if he were walking on a path and they were walking after him. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Background information\n\nMatthew continues his account from chapter 15 in verses 1-20. The account stops in verse 21 so that Matthew can tell the reader that Jesus told his disciples again and again that people would kill him after he arrived in Jerusalem. Then the account continues in verses 22-27 with what happened the first time Jesus told the disciples that he would die.\n\n### Paradox\n\nA paradox is a true statement that appears to describe something impossible. Jesus uses a paradox when he says, “Whoever wants to save his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it” ([Matthew 16:25](../mat/16/25.md)).

17:intro	yb4k				0	# Matthew 17 General Notes\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Elijah\n\nThe Old Testament prophet Malachi lived many years before Jesus was born. Malachi had said that before the Messiah came a prophet named Elijah would return. Jesus explained that Malachi had been talking about John the Baptist. Jesus said this because John the Baptist had done what Malachi had said that Elijah would do. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/christ]])\n\n### “transfigured”\n\nScripture often speaks of God’s glory as a great, brilliant light.

21:intro	ni1x				0	# Matthew 21 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 21:5,16 and 42, which are words from the Old Testament.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### The donkey and the colt\n\nJesus rode into Jerusalem on an animal. In this way he was like a king who came into a city after he had won an important battle. Also, the kings of Israel in the Old Testament rode on a donkeys. Other kings rode on horses. So Jesus was showing that he was the king of Israel and that he was not like other kings.\n\nMatthew, Mark, Luke, and John all wrote about this event. Matthew and Mark wrote that the disciples brought Jesus a donkey. John wrote that Jesus found a donkey. Luke wrote that they brought him a colt. Only Matthew wrote that there were both a donkey had a colt. No one knows for sure whether Jesus rode the donkey or the colt. It is best to translate each of these accounts as it appears in the ULT without trying to make them all say exactly the same thing. (See: [Matthew 21:1-7](../mat/21/01.md) and [Mark 11:1-7](../mrk/11/01.md) and [Luke 19:29-36](../luk/19/29.md) and [John 12:14-15](../jhn/12/14.md))\n\n### Hosanna\n\nThis is what the people shouted to welcome Jesus into Jerusalem. This word meant “Save us,” but people used it to praise God.\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### “The kingdom of God will be taken away from you”\n\nNo one knows for sure what this phrase means. No one knows if Jesus meant that God would someday give the kingdom back or not.

22:intro	k5ze				0	# Matthew 22 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in verse 44, which are words from the Old Testament.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Wedding Feast\n\nIn the parable of the wedding feast ([Matthew 22:1-14](./01.md)), Jesus taught that when God offers to save a person, that person needs to accept the offer. Jesus spoke of life with God as a feast that a king prepares for his son, who has just gotten married. In addition, Jesus emphasized that not everyone whom God invites will properly prepare themselves to come to the feast. God will throw these people out from the feast.\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### Implicit information\n\nSpeakers usually do not say things that they think their hearers already understand. When the king in the parable said, “My oxen and fattened calves have been killed” ([Matthew 22:4](../mat/22/04.md)), he assumed that the hearers would understand that those who had killed the animals had also cooked them.\n\n### Paradox\n\nA paradox is a true statement that appears to describe something impossible. To the Jews, the ancestors were the masters of the descendants, but in one psalm David calls one of his descendants “Lord.” Jesus tells the Jewish leaders that this is a paradox, saying, “If David then calls the Christ ‘Lord,’ how is he David’s son?” ([Matthew 22:45](../mat/22/45.md)).

23:intro	m99i				0	# Matthew 23 General Notes\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Hypocrites\n\nJesus calls the Pharisees hypocrites many times ([Matthew 23:13](../mat/23/13.md)) and carefully tells what he means by doing that. The Pharisees made rules that no one could actually obey, and then they persuaded the ordinary people that they were guilty because they could not obey the rules. Also, the Pharisees obeyed their own rules instead of obeying God’s original commands in the law of Moses.\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### Name calling\n\nIn most cultures, it is wrong to insult people. The Pharisees took many of the words in this chapter as insults. Jesus called them “hypocrites,” “blind guides,” “fools,” and “serpents” ([Matthew 23:16-17](./16.md)). Jesus uses these words say that God would surely punish them because they were doing wrong.\n\n### Paradox\n\nA paradox is a true statement that appears to describe something impossible. Jesus uses a paradox when he says, “He who is greatest among you will be your servant” ([Matthew 23:11-12](./11.md)).

(See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-apocalyptic]])\n\n### The example of Noah\n\nIn the time of Noah, God sent a great flood to punish people for their sins. He warned them many times about this coming flood, but it actually began suddenly. In this chapter, Jesus draws a comparison between that flood and the last days. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### “Let”\n\nThe ULT uses this word to begin several commands of Jesus, such as “let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains” (24:16), “let him who is on the housetop not go down to take anything out of his house” (24:17), and “let him who is in the field not return to take his cloak” (24:18).

26:intro	mtq8				0	# Matthew 26 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 26:31, which is words from the Old Testament.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Sheep\n\nSheep are a common image used in Scripture to refer to the people of Israel. In [Matthew 26:31](../mat/26/31.md), however, Jesus used the words “the sheep” to refer to his disciples and to say that they would run away when he was arrested.\n\n### Passover\n\nThe Passover festival was when the Jews would celebrate the day God killed the firstborn sons of the Egyptians but “passed over” the Israelites and let them live.\n\n### The eating of the body and blood\n\n[Matthew 26:26-28](./26.md) describes Jesus’ last meal with his followers. At this time, Jesus told them that what they were eating and drinking were his body and his blood. Nearly all Christian churches celebrate “the Lord’s Supper,” the “Eucharist”, or “Holy Communion” to remember this meal.\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### Judas’ kiss for Jesus\n\n[Matthew 26:49](../mat/26/49.md) describes how Judas kissed Jesus so the soldiers would know whom to arrest. The Jews would kiss each other when they greeted each other.\n\n### “I am able to destroy the temple of God”\n\nTwo men accused Jesus of saying that he could destroy the temple in Jerusalem and then rebuild it “in three days” ([Matthew 26:61](../mat/26/61.md)). They were accusing him of insulting God by claiming that God had given him the authority to destroy the temple and the power to rebuild it. What Jesus actually said was that if the Jewish authorities were to destroy this temple, he would certainly raise it up in three days ([John 2:19](../jhn/02/19.md)).

27:intro	deu4				0	# Matthew 27 General Notes\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### “Delivered him to Pilate the governor”\n\nThe Jewish leaders needed to get permission from Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor, before they could kill Jesus. This was because Roman law did not allow them to kill Jesus themselves. Pilate wanted to set Jesus free, but they wanted him to free a very bad prisoner named Barabbas.\n\n### The tomb\n\nThe tomb in which Jesus was buried ([Matthew 27:60](../mat/27/60.md)) was the kind of tomb in which wealthy Jewish families buried their dead. It was an actual room cut into a rock. It had a flat place on one side where they could place the body after they had put oil and spices on it and wrapped it in cloth. Then they would roll a large rock in front of the tomb so no one could see inside or enter.\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### Sarcasm\n\nThe soldiers said, “Hail, King of the Jews!” ([Matthew 27:29](../mat/27/29.md)) to mock Jesus. They did not think that he was the king of the Jews. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])

28:intro	psw9				0	# Matthew 28 General Notes\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### The tomb\n\nThe tomb in which Jesus was buried ([Matthew 28:1](../mat/28/01.md)) was the kind of tomb in which wealthy Jewish families buried their dead. It was an actual room cut into a rock. It had a flat place on one side where they could place the body after they had put oil and spices on it and wrapped it in cloth. Then they would roll a large rock in front of the tomb so no one could see inside or enter.\n\n### “Make disciples”\n\nThe last two verses ([Matthew 28:19-20](../mat/28/19.md)) are commonly known as “The Great Commission” because they contain a very important command given to all Christians. Christians are to “make disciples” by going to people, sharing the gospel with them and training them to live as Christians.\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### An angel of the Lord\n\nMatthew, Mark, Luke, and John all wrote about angels in white clothing with the women at Jesus’ tomb. Two of the authors called them men, but that is only because the angels looked human. Two of the authors wrote about two angels, but the other two authors wrote about only one of them. It is best to translate each of these passages as it appears in the ULT without trying to make the passages all say exactly the same thing. (See: [Matthew 28:1-2](../mat/28/01.md) and [Mark 16:5](../mrk/16/05.md) and [Luke 24:4](../luk/24/04.md) and [John 20:12](../jhn/20/12.md))
