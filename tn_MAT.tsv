front:intro	sa9c				0	# Introduction to the Gospel of Matthew\n\n## Part 1: General Introduction\n\n### Outline of the book of Matthew\n\n1. The birth of Jesus Christ and the beginning of his ministry (1:1-4:25)\n1. Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount (5:1-7:28)\n1. Jesus illustrates the kingdom of God through acts of healing (8:1-9:34)\n1. Jesus teaches about mission and the kingdom (9:35-10:42)\n1. Jesus teaches about the gospel of the kingdom of God. Opposition to Jesus begins. (11:1-12:50)\n1. Jesus tells parables about the kingdom of God (13:1-52)\n1. Further opposition to Jesus and misunderstanding of the kingdom of God (13:53-17:57)\n1. Jesus teaches about life in the kingdom of God (18:1-35)\n1. Jesus ministers in Judea (19:1-22:46)\n1. Jesus teaches about the final judgment and salvation (23:1-25:46)\n1. The crucifixion of Jesus, his death and resurrection (26:1-28:19)\n\n### What is the book of Matthew about?\n\nThe Gospel of Matthew is one of four books in the New Testament that describe some of the life of Jesus Christ. The authors of the Gospels wrote about different aspects of who Jesus was and what he did. Matthew showed that Jesus was the Messiah, and God would save Israel through him. Matthew often explained that Jesus fulfilled the Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah. This may indicate that he expected most of his first readers to be Jewish. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/christ]])\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nTranslators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “The Gospel of Matthew,” or “The Gospel according to Matthew.” Or they may choose a title that may be clearer, such as, “The Good News about Jesus that Matthew wrote.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])\n\n### Who wrote the book of Matthew?\n\nThe book does not give the name of the author. However, since early Christian times, most Christians have thought that the author was the Apostle Matthew.\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### What is the “kingdom of heaven?”\n\nMatthew spoke of the “kingdom of heaven” in the same way that other Gospel writers spoke of the kingdom of God. The kingdom of heaven represents God ruling over all people and all creation everywhere. Those whom God accepts into his kingdom will be blessed. They will live with God forever.\n\n### What were the teaching methods of Jesus?\n\nThe people regarded Jesus as a rabbi. A rabbi is a teacher of God’s law. Jesus taught in ways similar those of other religious teachers in Israel. He had students who followed him wherever he went. These students were called disciples. He often told parables. Parables are stories that teach moral lessons. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/disciple]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/parable]])\n\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\n\n### What are the Synoptic Gospels?\n\nThe Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke are called the Synoptic Gospels because they have many similar passages. The word “synoptic” means to “see together.”\n\nThe texts are considered “parallel” when they are the same or almost the same among two or three gospels. When translating parallel passages, translators should use the same wording and make them as similar as possible.\n\n### Why does Jesus refer to himself as the “Son of Man”?\n\nIn the gospels, Jesus calls himself the “Son of Man.” It is a reference to Daniel 7:13-14. In that passage there is a person described as a “son of man.” That means the person was someone who looked like a human being. God gave authority to the son of man to rule over the nations forever. All the people will worship him forever.\n\nJews of Jesus’ time did not use “Son of Man” as a title for anyone. Therefore, Jesus used it for himself to help them understand who he truly was. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sonofman]])\n\nTranslating the title “Son of Man” can be difficult in many languages. Readers may misunderstand a literal translation. Translators can consider alternatives, such as “The Human One.” It may also be helpful to include a footnote to explain the title.\n\n### What are the major issues in the text of the book of Matthew?\n\nThe following verses are found in older versions of the Bible but are not included in most modern versions:\n* “Bless those who curse you; do good to those who hate you” (5:44)\n* “For yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen” (6:13)\n* “But this kind of demon does not go out except with prayer and fasting” (17:21)\n* “For the Son of Man came to save that which was lost” (18:11)\n* “Many are called, but few are chosen” (20:16)\n* “Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you devour widows’ houses, while you make a show of long prayers. You will therefore receive greater condemnation.” (23:14)\n\nTranslators are advised not to include these passages. However, if in the translators’ region, there are older versions of the Bible that include one or more of these passages, the translators may include them. If they are included, they should be put inside square brackets ([]) to indicate that they were probably not original to Matthew’s Gospel. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
1:intro	y7kk				0	# Matthew 1 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n1. The birth of Jesus Christ and the beginning of his ministry (1:1-4:25)\n      * The genealogy of Jesus (1:1–17)\n      * Jesus’ parents and birth (1:18–25)\n\nSome translations set a quotation from the Old Testament farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text. The ULT does this in [1:23](../01/23.md) with the quote from [Isaiah 7:14](../isa/07/14.md).\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Genealogy\n\nA genealogy is a list that records a person’s ancestors or descendants. Genealogies were important to the Jewish people because family lineage is how they decided how someone functioned in society. For instance, if someone was a descendant of Aaron, they were able to become priests. Similarly, if someone was a descendant of King David, they were able to become a king. This genealogy shows that Jesus was clearly a descendant of King David, and therefore, was able to become king.\n\n### The word “fathered”\n\nWhen Matthew uses the word “fathered,” he only means that the older man was an ancestor of the younger man. In most cases, the older man is the direct father of the younger man. However, sometimes the older man is a grandfather (for example, Josiah is the grandfather of Jechoniah) or a more distant ancestor (for example, Joram is the great-great-grandfather of Ozias). If possible, use a word that indicates that the older man is the ancestor of the younger man without stating that the older man is the father of the younger man. If you need to be more specific, the UST provides one way to do so.\n\n### Three groups of 14\n\nMatthew concludes the genealogy by dividing it up three groups of 14 generations. He divides the groups by using two key events in Israel’s history: David starting his dynasty and the Babylonians capturing Jerusalem. In order to count 14 generations from Abraham until David, both Abraham and David need to be included. To count 14 generations from David until the Babylonian deportation, David needs to be excluded but Jechoniah needs to be included. To count 14 generations from the Babylonian deportation until the Christ, both Jechoniah and Christ need to be included. The ULT and UST divide the section into paragraphs based on the divisions. Consider how you might show these divisions in your translation.\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Stating that Mary became pregnant\n\nIn [1:18](../01/18.md), [1:20](../01/20.md), and [1:23](../01/23.md), Matthew refers to a woman becoming pregnant, but he excludes the involvement of a man in the process. He uses the phrases “to have in the womb” and “having been conceived in her” to avoid referring to the male role in conception. In your translation, you should not identify the Holy Spirit as the one who performed the normal male role, since the Holy Spirit did not have sex with Mary. Instead, the Holy Spirit performed a miracle. So, use a form that does not refer to the male role in conception or a form that denies that a man was involved.\n\n### Translating names\n\nIn the genealogy, Matthew uses specific Greek spellings of names. These spellings do not always match the Hebrew spellings of the names that you can read in the Old Testament. The ULT and UST spell out how these names sound as Matthew wrote them in Greek. In contrast, some translations spell out these names as they appear in the Old Testament. Consider spelling these names as do other translations that your readers might be familiar with. Otherwise, consider whether your team wishes to spell names in the same way throughout the Bible or whether you will spell them differently in different places. If you do spell them differently in different places, you may need to include footnotes that provide other spellings.
1:1	n4xw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	βίβλος γενέσεως	1	Here, the phrase **book of the genealogy** could refer to: (1) just the list of Jesus’ ancestors that follows in [1:2–17](../01/02.md). Alternate translation: “The book of the ancestry” (2) the list of Jesus’ ancestors as well as information about his birth and childhood (see [1:2–2:23](../01/02.md)). Alternate translation: “The book of the ancestors and birth”

1:1	nlc8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	βίβλος	1	Here, **book** represents a written record. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your language or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “The written record” or “The list”
1:1	vpg1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	υἱοῦ Δαυεὶδ, υἱοῦ Ἀβραάμ	1	Here, Matthew is speaking of a male descendant as if he were a **son**.

1:1	zw1t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	υἱοῦ Ἀβραάμ	1	Here Matthew could mean: (1) that David is a **son of Abraham**. Alternate translation: “who was a son of Abraham” (2) that Jesus is a **son of Abraham**. Alternate translation: “and also son of Abraham”
1:2	cyc6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ἀβραὰμ ἐγέννησεν τὸν Ἰσαάκ, Ἰσαὰκ δὲ ἐγέννησεν τὸν Ἰακώβ, Ἰακὼβ δὲ ἐγέννησεν τὸν Ἰούδαν καὶ τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς αὐτοῦ	1	Here Matthew begins a list of Jesus’ ancestors. Consider how people normally list ancestors in your language. Use the same wording throughout the whole list ([1:2–16](../01/02.md)). Possible formats are: (1) “Abraham’s son was Isaac, and Isaac’s son was Jacob, and Jacob’s sons were Judah and his brothers” (2) “Isaac’s father was Abraham, and Jacob’s father was Isaac, and Judah’s father was Jacob” (3) “Abraham fathered Isaac, who fathered Jacob, who fathered Judah and his brothers”

1:6	msbw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐκ τῆς τοῦ Οὐρίου	1	**Uriah** was one of the leaders of the Israelite army, a leader whom **David** trusted. However, David saw Uriah’s wife, named Bathsheba, and wanted her for himself. He had Uriah killed and took Uriah’s wife for himself. You can read about this story in [2 Samual 11:1–27](../2sa/11/01.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could include some extra information if your readers would not know this story. Alternate translation: “by Bathsheba the wife of Uriah, whom he had killed”
1:7	nc4v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Σολομὼν δὲ ἐγέννησεν τὸν Ῥοβοάμ, Ῥοβοὰμ δὲ ἐγέννησεν τὸν Ἀβιά, Ἀβιὰ δὲ ἐγέννησεν τὸν Ἀσάφ	1	This is a continuation of the list of Jesus’ ancestors that began in [1:2](../01/02.md). Use the same format as you used in the previous verses.

1:8-9	ei0o		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	Ἰωρὰμ δὲ ἐγέννησεν τὸν Ὀζείαν, Ὀζείας δὲ ἐγέννησεν τὸν Ἰωαθάμ	1	In these two verses, Matthew lists **Joram**, **Ozias**, and **Jotham**. In the list of kings in 1 Chronicles 3, however, there are four names between **Joram** and **Jotham** (see [1 Chronicles 3:11–12](../1co/03/11.md)), not one. So, Matthew has not mentioned three of these kings, and the word translated **fathered** only requires the older person to be an ancestor of the younger person, who could be a son, grandson, great-grandson, or even great-great-grandson. It is unclear exactly where in the list Matthew leaves out the three kings. He could be using the name **Ozias**: (1) to refer to the king that 1 Chronicles names “Azariah.” In this case, **Ozias** is the great-great-grandson of **Joram** and the father of **Jotham**. Alternate translation: “and Joram was the great-great-grandfather of Ozias, and Ozias fathered Jotham” (2) to refer to the king that 1 Chronicles names “Ahaziah.” In this case, **Ozias** is the son of **Joram** and the great-great-grandfather of **Jotham**. Alternate translation: “and Joram fathered Ozias, and Ozias was the great-great-grandfather of Jotham”
1:9	m35z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ὀζείας δὲ ἐγέννησεν τὸν Ἰωαθάμ, Ἰωαθὰμ δὲ ἐγέννησεν τὸν Ἀχάζ, Ἀχὰζ δὲ ἐγέννησεν τὸν Ἑζεκίαν	1	This is a continuation of the list of Jesus’ ancestors that began in [1:2](../01/02.md). Use the same format as you used in the previous verses.
1:9	lj7z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ὀζείας	1	Many translations spell **Ozias** as “Uzziah.” Consider how translations with which your readers might be familiar spell this name. Alternate translation: “Uzziah”
1:10	zgmk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ἑζεκίας δὲ ἐγέννησεν τὸν Μανασσῆ, Μανασσῆς δὲ ἐγέννησεν τὸν Ἀμώς, Ἀμὼς δὲ ἐγέννησεν τὸν Ἰωσίαν	1	This is a continuation of the list of Jesus’ ancestors that began in [1:2](../01/02.md). Use the same format as you used in the previous verses.
1:10	odm9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	τὸν Ἀμώς, Ἀμὼς	1	Many translations spell **Amos** as “Amon.” Consider how translations with which your readers might be familiar spell this name. Alternate translation: “Amon … Amon”

1:11	c2bh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	Ἰωσίας & ἐγέννησεν τὸν Ἰεχονίαν	1	In [1 Chronicles 3:15–16](../1ch/03/15.md), **Josiah** is listed as the father of Jehoiakim, who is the father of **Jechoniah**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could clarify that **Josiah** was the grandfather of **Jechoniah**. Alternate translation: “Josiah fathered the father of Jechoniah”
1:11	vzs3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship	τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς αὐτοῦ	1	If you must specify whether these **brothers** were older or younger, it is more likely that they were younger brothers. Alternate translation: “his younger brothers”
1:11	v2im		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐπὶ τῆς μετοικεσίας Βαβυλῶνος	1	Here Matthew refers to how the Babylonians conquered Jerusalem and took most of the people away to the country of Babylon. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that makes this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “when the Babylonians captured Jerusalem and took many people away”
1:12	y7cx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	μετὰ & τὴν μετοικεσίαν Βαβυλῶνος	1	Here Matthew refers to the same event that he referred to in [1:11](../01/11.md). Express the idea in the same way you did there. Alternate translation: “after the Babylonians captured Jerusalem and took many people away”
1:12	ua1g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ἰεχονίας ἐγέννησεν τὸν Σαλαθιήλ, Σαλαθιὴλ δὲ ἐγέννησεν τὸν Ζοροβαβέλ	1	This is a continuation of the list of Jesus’ ancestors that began in [1:2](../01/02.md). Use the same format as you used in the previous verses.
1:12	ya86		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	τὸν Σαλαθιήλ, Σαλαθιὴλ	1	Many translations spell **Salathiel** as “Shealtiel.” Consider how translations with which your readers might be familiar spell this name. Alternate translation: “Shealtiel … Shealtiel”
1:12	qqo6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	Σαλαθιὴλ & ἐγέννησεν τὸν Ζοροβαβέλ	1	In [1 Chronicles 3:19](../1co/03/19.md), a brother of **Salathiel** named Pedaiah is listed as the father of **Zerubbabel**. However, early Greek translations of [1 Chronicles 3:19](../1co/03/19.md) list **Salathiel** as the father of **Zerubabbel**. Matthew most likely used a Bible like these early Greek translations, so he probably intended his readers to think of **Salathiel** as the father of **Zerubbabel** and not as his uncle. If it would be helpful in your language, you could include some of this information in a footnote.
1:13	dcab		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ζοροβαβὲλ δὲ ἐγέννησεν τὸν Ἀβιούδ, Ἀβιοὺδ δὲ ἐγέννησεν τὸν Ἐλιακείμ, Ἐλιακεὶμ δὲ ἐγέννησεν τὸν Ἀζώρ	1	This is a continuation of the list of Jesus’ ancestors that began in [1:2](../01/02.md). Use the same format as you used in the previous verses.

1:16	wdbo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Μαρίας	1	The word **Mary** is the name of a woman.
1:16	b3bm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐξ ἧς ἐγεννήθη Ἰησοῦς	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “who gave birth to Jesus”\n
1:16	ovf4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish	ὁ λεγόμενος Χριστός	1	Here, the phrase **the one called Christ** distinguishes this **Jesus** from any other people named Jesus.

Alternate translation: “the Jesus called Christ” or “specifically the one who is called Christ”
1:16	z2rg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ὁ λεγόμενος Χριστός	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who did the action, you could use an indefinite subject. Alternate translation: “whom people call Christ”
1:17	vdhv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀπὸ Ἀβραὰμ ἕως Δαυεὶδ γενεαὶ δεκατέσσαρες, καὶ ἀπὸ Δαυεὶδ ἕως τῆς μετοικεσίας Βαβυλῶνος γενεαὶ δεκατέσσαρες, καὶ ἀπὸ τῆς μετοικεσίας Βαβυλῶνος ἕως τοῦ Χριστοῦ γενεαὶ δεκατέσσαρες	1	In order to count 14 generations **from Abraham until David**, both Abraham and David need to be included. To count 14 generations **from David until the Babylonian deportation**, David needs to be excluded but Jechoniah needs to be included. To count 14 generations **from the Babylonian deportation until the Christ**, both Jechoniah and Jesus need to be included. Consider how you might express the calculations so that they match with the list. Alternate translation: “from Abraham up to and including David were 14 generations, and after David and until the Babylonian deportation were 14 generations, and starting with the Babylonian deportation and counting up to and including the Christ were 14 generations”
1:17	z5xw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τῆς μετοικεσίας Βαβυλῶνος	-1	Here Matthew refers to the same event that he referred to in [1:11–12](../01/11.md).

1:18	gnl6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1	Here, the word **Now** introduces a new section in this book that focuses on **the birth of Jesus Christ**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a new section, or you could leave **Now** untranslated. Alternate translation: “Next,”
1:18	cqt1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	μνηστευθείσης & τῷ Ἰωσήφ	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who did the action, it is clear from the context that it was her parents. Alternate translation: “whose parents promised to Joseph that she would marry him”
1:18	xvk1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	πρὶν & συνελθεῖν αὐτοὺς	1	Matthew is referring in a polite way to having sex by using the phrase **came together**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a polite way of referring to this in your language, or you could state this plainly. Alternate translation: “before they consummated the marriage” or “before they had sex”
1:18	in4a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	εὑρέθη ἐν γαστρὶ ἔχουσα	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “was having in the womb” or “realized that she was having in the womb”

1:19	yufg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	Ἰωσὴφ & ὁ ἀνὴρ αὐτῆς	1	Matthew implies that Joseph did not know that the baby came from the Holy Spirit. Joseph thought that Mary had become pregnant after having sex with another man, which is why he wanted **to divorce her**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could clarify that Joseph did not know that the Holy Spirit had caused Mary to be pregnant. Alternate translation: “Joseph her husband thought that she had been unfaithful, so”
1:19	pu3p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὁ ἀνὴρ αὐτῆς & ἀπολῦσαι αὐτήν	1	As the previous verse shows (see [1:18](../01/18.md)), Mary and Joseph were not yet married. In their culture, however, being “engaged” was a promise to marry, so Matthew can refer to **Joseph** as Mary’s **husband**. He can also refer to breaking the engagement as divorce. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use clarify that Matthew is referring to an engaged man breaking the engagement.

Alternate translation: “the one having been conceived in Mary is from the Holy Spirit, so you should not fear to take her as your wife”
1:20	va5e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τὸ & ἐν αὐτῇ γεννηθὲν ἐκ Πνεύματός ἐστιν Ἁγίου	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

1:23	wlft		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	ἰδοὺ	1	Here, the word **Behold** draws the attention of the audience and asks them to listen carefully.

1:23	c6yk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἡ παρθένος	1	Although the word translated **virgin** occasionally refers to any young woman, whether she has had sex or not, the word normally refers to a young woman who has not had sex. This is what Matthew means here, so you should use a word or phrase that refers to a woman who is old enough to get married but who has not yet had sex. Alternate translation: “the marriageable woman who has not had sex”
1:23	nlp1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐν γαστρὶ ἕξει	1	Here, the phrase **have in her womb** refers to a woman being pregnant.

See how you translated the euphemism for having sex in [1:18](../01/18.md). Alternate translation: “he did not consummate the marriage with her” or “he did not sleep with her”
1:25	v3xe		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	οὐκ ἐγίνωσκεν & ἐκάλεσεν & αὐτοῦ	1	Here, both times the pronoun **he** occurs, it refers to Joseph.

2:intro	dz1c				0	# Matthew 2 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n1. The birth of Jesus Christ and the beginning of his ministry (1:1-4:25)\n      * The visit of the learned men (2:1–12)\n      * Joseph, Mary, and Jesus escape to Egypt (2:13–15)\n      * Herod kills the baby boys in Bethlehem (2:16–18)\n      * Joseph, Mary, and Jesus settle in Nazareth (2:19–23)\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in verses 6 and 18, which are quotations from the Old Testament.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### “Learned men”\n\nIn this chapter, Matthew tells about how “learned men” from countries to the east of Judea visited Jesus in order to worship him. These were educated men who studied dreams and stars in the sky to try to learn about what was happening and what would happen in the future. Matthew does not present them as if they are evil. Consider how you might naturally refer to this kind of educated man. The ULT provides a general translation (“learned men”), and the UST illustrates how to use a descriptive phrase (“scholars who studied the stars”).\n\n### The star\n\nThe learned men journey to Jerusalem because they see a specific star. Matthew further describes how this star moved in the sky until it was directly above where Jesus was living. It is not clear exactly what this star was. Scholars have suggested that it was one of the planets, a shooting star, a comet, or a bright angel. If possible, use a word or phrase that refers generally to a natural source of light in the sky. If you need to be more specific, could use a word or phrase that refers to stars, especially the kinds of stars that move or appear to move in the sky.\n\n### The journeys of Joseph, Mary, and Jesus\n\nIn this chapter, Matthew narrates several journeys that Joseph, Mary, and Jesus took. At first, they are in Bethlehem, which is a city near the capital city of Judea, Jerusalem. After the learned men visit, God warns Joseph to journey to Egypt, a country to the southwest of Judea, in order to escape from Herod, the king of Judea. After Herod dies, God tells Joseph that he can take his family back to Israel. However, he does not take his family back to Judea, because Herod’s son is now reigning in Herod’s place. Instead, he and his family travel to Nazareth, a city in the region of Galilee, which is north of Judea. When Matthew uses movement words, make sure that your translation fits with these journeys.
2:1	sdst		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	δὲ	1	Here, the word **Now** introduces the next major event in the story.

2:2	n3a2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐν τῇ ἀνατολῇ	1	Here, the phrase **in the east** could refer to: (1) when the star appeared above the horizon. Alternate translation: “when it rose” (2) where the star appeared in the sky. Alternate translation: “as it rose in the east”

2:2	v248		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	προσκυνῆσαι	1	The phrase **to worship** can be used for how one behaves before God, but it can also be used for how one behaves before a king. Matthew uses this phrase because the learned men considered Jesus to be a king, but Matthew considers Jesus to be God. So, both meanings of the phrase **to worship** are included here. If possible, use a form that could be used for how one acts before both kings and God. If you must make a distinction, it is recommended that you use a form that refers to worshiping God. Alternate translation: “to bow before” or “to kneel before him to honor”

2:3	mc1r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	πᾶσα	1	Matthew says **all** here as a generalization for emphasis. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different way to express the emphasis. Alternate translation: “most of” or “the majority of”

If you use the following alternate translation, you will need to delete the comma at the end of the previous verse and only use one quotation mark at the end of this verse.

3:intro	a6h3				0	# Matthew 3 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n1. The birth of Jesus Christ and the beginning of his ministry (1:1-4:25)\n      * The ministry of John the Baptist (3:1–12)\n      * John baptizes Jesus (3:13–17)\n\nSome translations set quotations from the Old Testament farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text. The ULT does this with the quotation from the Old Testament in verse 3.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### John the Baptist\n\nIn this chapter, Matthew introduces John the Baptist, who preached in the wilderness. Matthew describes his clothing and his food in ways that resemble the prophet Elijah. John preaches a message that called for repentance. He prepared the way for Jesus to begin his ministry.\n\n### Baptism\n\nThe word “baptism” refers to a ritual washing, usually with water. John’s baptism is similar to Christian baptism, but it does not mean exactly the same thing (see [Acts 18:24–26](../act/18/24.md)). John says that his baptism is “for repentance” (see [3:11](../03/11.md)). Most likely, it symbolized the removal of the sins that people were repenting of and the beginning of a new way of living. However, even Jesus received this baptism despite the fact that he did not need to repent of any sins. In this case, the baptism may symbolize complete dedication to God. Consider how you might refer to this kind of ritual washing in your language.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Fruit tree metaphor\n\nIn [3:8](../03/08.md) and [3:10](../03/10.md), John speaks of people as if they were fruit trees. He says that people need to produce “good fruit,” just like fruit trees should. However, every fruit tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and burned. In the same way, people who do not do what is right will be judged and punished. If possible, preserve this metaphor or express it in simile form.\n\n### Wheat harvest metaphor\n\nIn [3:12](../03/12.md), John speaks of people as if they were parts of wheat plants. People who obey God are like the edible part of the wheat plant, the grain. People who disobey God are like the inedible parts of the wheat plant, the stalk and husk. Just as a farmer separates the grain from the stalks and the husks, so God will separate people into those who obey him and those who do not. Then, just as the farmer stores the grain and burns the stalks and husks, so God will save those who obey him and punish those who do not. If possible, preserve this metaphor or express it in simile form.

3:1	yoaf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐν & ταῖς ἡμέραις ἐκείναις	1	Here, Matthew uses the term **days** to refer to a particular period of time.

3:1	tmu9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ταῖς ἡμέραις ἐκείναις	1	Here, the phrase **those days** refers to the period of time before Jesus began his public ministry. During this time, Jesus lived in Nazareth with his family. Matthew is not referring to the period of time in which Joseph, Mary, and Jesus traveled back from Egypt to Galilee. If it would be helpful in your language, you could refer more explicitly to the time period in which Jesus lived in Nazareth. Alternate translation: “the days when Jesus lived in Nazareth” or “the days before Jesus began his ministry”
3:1	ifa0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	παραγίνεται Ἰωάννης ὁ Βαπτιστὴς	1	This phrase introduces a new character into the story.

Alternate translation: “there is a man named John the Baptist” or “a man called John the Baptist appears”
3:1	bcdv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense	παραγίνεται	1	To call attention to a development in the story, Matthew uses the present tense in past narration. If it would not be natural to do that in your language, you could use the past tense in your translation. Alternate translation: “came”
3:2	nc62		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	λέγων	1	Consider natural ways of introducing direct quotations in your language. Alternate translation: “and he said”
3:2	u2pi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	μετανοεῖτε, ἤγγικεν γὰρ ἡ Βασιλεία τῶν Οὐρανῶν	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these clauses, since the second clause gives the reason for the command in the first clause. Alternate translation: “The kingdom of the heavens is near, so repent”
3:2	hvx8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἤγγικεν	1	Here Matthew uses this phrase in the sense of **near** in time. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “is about to begin” or “is about to happen”
3:3	et5g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	γάρ	1	Here, the word **For** introduces a further explanation of what Matthew has said about John the Baptist. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces an explanation, or you could leave **For** untranslated. Alternate translation: “In fact,” or “Now”
3:3	fl4v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ὁ ῥηθεὶς	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “the one about whom the Lord spoke”
3:3	qt02		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	λέγοντος	1	In Matthew’s culture, **saying** was a normal way to introduce a quotation from an important text, in this case, the Old Testament book written by Isaiah the prophet (see [Isaiah 40:3](../isa/40/03.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase that indicates that Matthew is quoting from an important text. Alternate translation: “who wrote in the book of Isaiah” or “who declared”
3:3	s62r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	φωνὴ βοῶντος	1	Isaiah is using **voice** to represent a person speaking.

If you do, you will need to delete the single quotation mark at the end of this quotation. Alternate translation: “the wilderness that people must make ready the way of the Lord, that they must make his paths straight”\n
3:3	n7lh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	ἑτοιμάσατε τὴν ὁδὸν Κυρίου; εὐθείας ποιεῖτε τὰς τρίβους αὐτοῦ	1	These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them.

Otherwise, you can use a phrase that would express the meaning. Alternate translation: “tool for winnowing grain” or “tool for tossing seeds”
3:12	r2ua		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τὴν ἅλωνα αὐτοῦ	1	The **threshing floor** was the place where harvested wheat was processed to separate the grain from the chaff.

3:17	m2wk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	φωνὴ	1	Matthew is using **voice** to represent the person who is speaking, which is God the Father.

4:intro	hgw2				0	# Matthew 4 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n1. The birth of Jesus Christ and the beginning of his ministry (1:1-4:25)\n      * The devil tempts Jesus (4:1–11)\n      * Jesus begins his public ministry (4:12–17)\n      * Jesus calls four of his disciples (4:18–22)\n      * Summary of Jesus’ early ministry (4:23–25)\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in [4:15–16](../04/15.md), which are words from the Old Testament.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### The Devil\n\nThe devil, also named Satan, is an evil spiritual being. In this chapter, he tempts Jesus to disobey God. He even quotes the Bible to try to convince Jesus to disobey. Consider how you might naturally refer to a powerful and evil spiritual being.\n\n### Temptation\n\nIn [4:1–11](../04/01.md), Matthew tells the story of how Jesus was tempted by the devil. The devil tried to convince Jesus to do things that would be disobedient. Jesus already knew how he was supposed to live his life and how he was supposed to die on the cross. The devil tempted Jesus to act in a different way. In response, Jesus quotes the Bible and does not do what the devil tempts him to do.\n\n### Fishermen\n\nFour of Jesus’ first disciples (Peter, Andrew, James, and John) were fishermen. In their culture, fishermen usually stood on the shore or in a boat and threw a net into the water. The edges of the net had weights on it, so the net sank into the water and trapped any fish beneath it. Then, fishermen would put on a rope to close the net and haul it to shore or onto the boat. If people in your culture do not fish or do not fish in that way, consider how much information you need to provide to help your readers understand the story.
4:1	k51m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	τότε	1	Here, the word **Then** introduces the next major event in the story.

The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them.

4:11	b0p5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense	ἀφίησιν	1	To call attention to a development in the story, Matthew uses the present tense in past narration. If it would not be natural to do that in your language, you could use the past tense in your translation. Alternate translation: “left”
4:11	ko5d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	ἰδοὺ	1	Here, the word **behold** draws the attention of the audience and asks them to listen carefully.

Alternate translation: “picture this” or “suddenly”

Alternate translation: “the king had arrested John”
4:13	pph4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καταλιπὼν τὴν Ναζαρὰ	1	Here Matthew implies that when Jesus “withdrew into Galilee,” he first went to the city of **Nazareth**.

4:13	fgsd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	ἐλθὼν κατῴκησεν εἰς Καφαρναοὺμ	1	It may be more natural in your language to say where Jesus went before saying where he **lived**. If so, you could move **in Capernaum** so that it goes with **having come**. Alternate translation: “having come to Capernaum, he lived there”
4:13	knjg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὴν παραθαλασσίαν	1	Here Matthew is referring to **the sea** of Galilee. The town of **Capernaum** was at the edge of this sea.

4:14	bifn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	λέγοντος	1	In Matthew’s culture, **saying** was a normal way to introduce a quotation from an important text, in this case, the Old Testament book written by **Isaiah the prophet** (see [Isaiah 9:1–2](../isa/09/01.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase that indicates that Matthew is quoting from an important text. Alternate translation: “who wrote in the book of Isaiah” or “who declared”

Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including all three descriptions in your translation rather than combining them. However, if it would be helpful to your readers, you could connect the phrases with a word or phrase that indicates that these lines are all descriptions of one place. Alternate translation: “The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, which is the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, which is Galilee of the Gentiles”
4:15	se2r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὁδὸν θαλάσσης	1	The phrase **the way of the sea** could refer to: (1) areas near **the sea** of Galilee. Alternate translation: “the areas around the Sea of Galilee” (2) a road that ended at the Mediterranean **sea**. Alternate translation: “the road that goes to the Mediterranean sea”
4:15	d8ut		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πέραν τοῦ Ἰορδάνου	1	Here Isaiah could be referring to: (1) areas to the west of the Jordan River.

4:15	uv17		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	Γαλιλαία τῶν ἐθνῶν	1	Here, Isaiah is using the possessive form to describe **Galilee** as a place where **Gentiles** live. If this is not clear in your language, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: “Galilee, home of Gentiles”
4:16	fsl6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	ὁ λαὸς ὁ καθήμενος ἐν σκοτίᾳ φῶς εἶδεν μέγα, καὶ τοῖς καθημένοις ἐν χώρᾳ καὶ σκιᾷ θανάτου, φῶς ἀνέτειλεν αὐτοῖς	1	These two clauses mean basically the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them.

5:intro	awz8				0	# Matthew 5 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n2. Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount (5:1-7:28)\n      * The Beatitudes (5:1–12)\n      * Salt and light (5:13–16)\n      * The law and righteousness (5:17–20)\n      * Moses’ law and Jesus’ commands (5:21–48)\n        * Murder and anger (5:21–26)\n        * Adultery and divorce (5:27–32)\n        * Oaths and promises (5:33–37)\n        * Punishment and retaliation (5:38–42)\n        * Loving everyone (5:43–48)\n\nMany people call the words in Matthew 5–7 the Sermon on the Mount. This is one long lesson that Jesus taught. Bibles divide this lesson into three chapters, but this can sometimes confuse the reader. If your translation divides the text into sections, be sure that the reader understands that the whole sermon is one large section.\n\nMatthew 5:3–10, known as the Beatitudes or Blessings, has been set farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text. This way of placing the words on the page highlights the poetic form of this section.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### The “Beatitudes”\n\nIn [5:3–12](../05/03.md), Jesus speaks nine blessings, or “Beatitudes.” He uses poetic form, repetition, and contrasting statements. Use forms in your language that people would recognize as poetry. See the notes on these verses for translation options.\n\n### “You have heard that it was said”\n\nWhen Jesus quotes commands that his audience would be familiar with, he uses a phrase like “you have heard that it was said.” Usually when he uses this phrase, he is quoting or summarizing commands directly from the Old Testament law. However, in [5:43](../05/43.md), he quotes a command from the Old Testament (“love your neighbor”) and then includes what some people would add to that command (“hate your enemy”). You may need to clarify that only the clause “love your neighbor” is from the Old Testament law. See the notes on each verse for information about what commands Jesus is quoting or summarizing.\n\n### Jesus and the law\n\nThroughout this chapter, Jesus quotes commands that his audience would be familiar with. Then, he introduces his response to these commands with a phrase like “but I say to you.” In each case, Jesus is not contradicting or annulling the commands from God that he quotes. Instead, Jesus is correcting misunderstandings about what these commands mean. He wants his disciples to apply the commands properly. Use a form that indicates that Jesus is clarifying the commands, not contradicting them.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Salt metaphor\n\nIn [5:13](../05/13.md), Jesus describes his disciples as if they were salt that seasons the world. He means that, just as salt preserves food and makes it taste better, so his disciples help save people in the world and make the world a better place. If possible, preserve the metaphor or express the idea in simile form. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n### Light metaphor\n\nIn [5:14–16](../05/14.md), Jesus describes his disciples as if they were lamp that gives light. He means specifically that their good deeds are like light that shines on other people, which allows these people to learn what is true and to praise God. If possible, preserve the metaphor or express the idea in simile form. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n### Hyperbole\n\nIn [5:29–30](../05/29.md), Jesus commands his disciples to cut off body parts that cause them to sin. He uses this extreme example of resisting sin in order to show his disciples how serious sin really is. He does not mean that believers should always cut off body parts when they sin. Jesus intends his commands to be shocking, however, so you should preserve the extreme language. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that indicates that Jesus’ commands are extreme language.\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Singular and plural forms of “you”\n\nIn this chapter, Jesus is talking to a large crowd of his followers. Throughout the chapter, Jesus switches between using you in the singular and you in the plural while he is talking to the same people. When he uses the singular, he is speaking about specific situations that each person in the crowd might experience. When he uses the plural, he is speaking generally to the crowd as a whole. You should assume that Jesus is using plural forms of “you” unless a note specifies that the forms are singular. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]] and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-crowd]])

5:41	i86s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-bdistance	μίλιον ἕν	1	Here, **one mile** refers to the Roman mile, which was 1,000 paces. In modern measurements, this is about 4,860 feet or 1,480 meters. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express this in terms of modern measurements, either in the text or a footnote. It is not important to the meaning of the passage be precise about the distance, so you could use round numbers. Alternate translation: “1,500 meters” or “one kilometer” or “5,000 feet”
5:41	zv6i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ὕπαγε μετ’ αὐτοῦ δύο	1	Jesus is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete. If it would be helpful in your language, you could supply these words from the context. Alternate translation: “go with him two miles”
5:41	s4kl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	αὐτοῦ	1	Although the term **him** is masculine, Jesus is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women.

5:42	i90h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τῷ αἰτοῦντί σε, δός	1	Here Jesus does not specify what the person is **asking** for or what should be given. He does this to include many things that a person might ask for. If it would be helpful in your language, you could include a generic or general object. Alternate translation: “Give to the one asking you for anything” or “When a person asks you for anything, give it to him or her”
5:42	qkit		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd	σε, δός & σοῦ & μὴ ἀποστραφῇς	1	Even though Jesus is speaking to many disciples, he is addressing an individual situation, so **you** is singular throughout this verse.

5:42	h6j9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	μὴ ἀποστραφῇς	1	Here Jesus speaks of refusing to help someone as if it were turning away from that person.

5:43	fp6x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐρρέθη	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “God commanded” or “Moses said”
5:43	cyz3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	ἐρρέθη	1	Here Jesus quotes from the Old Testament scriptures. The words **Love your neighbor** are from [Leviticus 19:18](../lev/19/18.md). The words **hate your enemy** are what some people would say in addition to the quotation from the Old Testament. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could format these words in a different way and include this information in a footnote. Alternate translation: “people often quote the law by saying”\n
5:43	ufba		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	ἀγαπήσεις τὸν πλησίον σου, καὶ μισήσεις τὸν ἐχθρόν σου	1	Since the author of the quotation is addressing each specific person who is part of God’s people, the command here is singular.

5:44	tudc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	δὲ	1	Here, the word **But** introduces a contrast with what Jesus said in the previous verse ([5:43](../05/43.md)). Jesus is not contradicting what God said about loving neighbors, but he is contradicting what some people say about hating enemies. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces this kind of contrast. Alternate translation: “However,” or “Yet”
5:44	vq8l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐγὼ & λέγω ὑμῖν	1	Jesus uses the clause **I say to you** to emphasize what he is about to say and to contrast it with what he quoted in the previous verse ([5:43](../05/43.md)).

Alternate translation: “in order that”
5:45	my3d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	υἱοὶ τοῦ Πατρὸς ὑμῶν	1	Jesus speaks of his disciples as if God were their physical **Father**.

5:45	jzu9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	Πατρὸς ὑμῶν	1	**Father** is an important title for the first person in the Trinity. He is the **Father** also of Jesus.

5:45	qj7n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	πονηροὺς καὶ ἀγαθοὺς & δικαίους καὶ ἀδίκους	1	Jesus is using the adjectives **evil**, **good**, **just**, and **unjust** as nouns to mean people who are characterized by these qualities.

5:46	qjwb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	Here, the word **For** introduces further support for Jesus’ command to love enemies.

5:46	se4k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τίνα μισθὸν ἔχετε?	1	Jesus uses this question to show that people who only love others who love them will not receive any **reward**.

5:47	qpvk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς ὑμῶν	1	Jesus is using the term **brothers** to mean people who share the same faith. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “fellow disciples” or “other believers”
5:47	ebw3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς	1	Although the term **brothers** is masculine, Jesus is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If you retain the metaphor in your translation, and if it would be helpful in your language, you could say “brothers and sisters” to indicate this.
5:47	ba6e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τί περισσὸν ποιεῖτε?	1	Jesus uses this question to show that people who **greet** only their **brothers** do not do anything **more**. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation.

5:47	ah5w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	περισσὸν	1	Here Jesus implies that they are not doing anything **more** than people who do not know God do.

Alternate translation: “Even the Gentiles do the same thing.” or “Even Gentiles do that very thing!”
5:48	x9xh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	οὖν	1	Here, the word **Therefore** introduces the conclusion to what Jesus has been telling his disciples about how to live. He could be concluding everything he said in [5:21–47](../05/21.md), or he could concluding only what he said in [5:43–47](../05/43.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a conclusion. Alternate translation: “So then” or “In summary”
5:48	l6pa		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	Πατὴρ ὑμῶν ὁ οὐράνιος	1	This is a figurative expression. God is not the **Father** of humans in the same actual way that he is the Father of Jesus.

If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that this means God. Alternate translation: “God your heavenly Father”
6:intro	jrj2				0	# Matthew 6 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n2. Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount (5:1-7:28)\n      * Giving alms (6:1–4)\n      * Praying to God (6:5–15)\n      * Fasting (6:16–18)\n      * Storing up treasure (6:19–21)\n      * The eye and the body (6:22–23)\n      * Two masters (6:24)\n      * Being anxious (6:25–34)\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the prayer in [6:9–13](../06/09.md).\n\nJesus spoke about many different subjects in this sermon, so you may wish to help the reader by putting an empty line into the text whenever Jesus changed the subject.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Giving alms\n\nGiving alms was an important practice for religious people in Jesus’ culture. To give alms, a person would offer money or possessions to other people who were poor or in need. Sometimes they would give the money or possessions directly to poor people. Other times, they would give it to the priests, who would give to poor people. Make sure that your translation refers to this kind of practice.\n\n### “The Lord’s Prayer”\n\nIn [6:9–13](../06/09.md), Jesus speaks a prayer that he wants his disciples to imitate when they pray. The prayer is very poetic, and it is sometimes called “the Lord’s Prayer.” Many churches use this prayer during their meetings, and the form that churches use is often not the same form that Matthew wrote down. If churches already use a form of this prayer in your language, you could use the same words. However, you should follow the form of the prayer as Mathew wrote it down, and you should not include any extra lines or pieces of the prayer beyond what Matthew included.\n\n### Fasting\n\nIn [6:16–18](../06/16.md), Jesus gives instructions related to fasting. Just as with giving alms, fasting was an important practice for religious people in Jesus’ culture. Fasting usually required avoiding all food and drink, but some kinds of fasting only required avoiding certain kinds of food. Also, some fasts were public (that is, many people fasted on these set days) and some fasts were private (that is, individuals would choose to fast for certain reasons). Many fasts lasted part of a day or a full day. Jesus does not condemn fasting; instead, he gives instructions for how to behave while fasting. Make sure that your translation refers to these kinds of practices.\n\n### Storing up treasures\n\nIn [6:19–21](../06/19.md), Jesus speaks about storing up treasures either on earth or in heaven. He is speaking not only of possessions or money but also of anything that one considers to be valuable. Jesus points out that valuable things in heaven cannot be ruined like valuable things on earth can. Also, he states that a person’s “heart” is where they store their treasures. If possible, use a word for “treasure” that can refer to money, possessions, and any other valuable things.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### The lamp and light metaphor in [6:22–23](../06/22.md)\n\nIn these verses, Jesus speaks about eyes as if they were lamps for the body. This figure of speech has two pieces to it. First, Jesus speaks of how bodies work using the metaphor of lamps and light. Second, Jesus speaks of Christian living using the metaphor of how bodies work. It is important to consider both of these pieces as you translate these verses.\n\nFirst, Jesus speaks of how bodies work using the metaphor of lamps and light. There are two major options for understanding what Jesus means when he refers to an eye as the lamp of the body. First, in Matthew’s culture, some people thought that eyes worked by sending out a form of light that would shine on what they saw. In this case, eyes are like lamps because they have light inside them that shines out. So, the whole body is light or dark inside based on whether the eyes shine properly. Second, the eyes could be like windows that let light into the body. Since they let light into a place, they are like lamps. So, the whole body is light or dark inside based on whether the eyes let light in. Consider how you might best express one of these meanings while maintaining the light and dark language, which is very important for understanding the figure of speech.\n\nSecond, Jesus speaks of Christian life using the metaphor of how bodies work. Scholars debate what Jesus means when he talks about a “healthy eye” and “light” in contrast to an “evil eye” and “darkness.” He might mean devotion to God in contrast to evil desires. He might mean generosity in contrast to greed and selfishness. He might mean paying attention to what he is saying in contrast to ignoring his instructions. Since Jesus most likely intended this figure of speech to be like a riddle or puzzle, you should retain the body metaphor. If necessary, you could indicate that this is a figure of speech without stating exactly what it means.\n\n### Rhetorical questions\n\nIn [6:25–28](../06/25.md) and [6:30](../06/30.md), Jesus uses rhetorical questions. He asks these questions to include the disciples in what he is arguing, not because he is looking for information. If your language does not use questions in this way, you could include answers to the questions or you could express them as statements or exclamations. See the notes on these verses for translation options. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Singular and plural forms of “you”\n\nIn this chapter, Jesus is talking to a large crowd of his followers. Throughout the chapter, Jesus switches between using “you” in the singular and “you” in the plural while he is talking to the same people. When he uses the singular, he is speaking about specific situations that each person in the crowd might experience. When he uses the plural, he is speaking generally to the crowd as a whole. You should assume that Jesus is using plural forms of “you” unless a note specifies that the forms are singular. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])

6:6	dqv4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τὸ ταμεῖόν σου	1	The **inner chamber** was a small, private room in a house. It could be a bedroom or a storage room.

6:8	h0ll		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	οὖν	1	Here, the word **Therefore** introduces a conclusion based on what Jesus implied in the previous verse.

If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces this kind of conclusion, or you could leave **Therefore** untranslated.

7:intro	bz7e				0	# Matthew 7 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n2. Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount (5:1-7:28)\n      * Making judgments (7:1–6)\n      * Asking and receiving (7:7–12)\n      * Narrow and wide gates (7:13–14)\n      * Obeying God is what matters (7:15–27)\n        * Fruits metaphor (7:15–20)\n        * Judgment day (7:21–23)\n        * House metaphor (7:24–27)\n      * The people are amazed (7:28–29)\n\nJesus spoke about many different subjects in this sermon, so you may wish to help the reader by putting an empty line into the text whenever Jesus changed the subject.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Judging\n\nIn [7:1–6](../07/01.md), Jesus warns his disciples about judging others. Most specifically, he warns them against mentioning or dealing with someone else’s fault or sin when they themselves have an even more significant fault or sin. Jesus does want his disciples to make choices and decisions about other people, as [7:6](../07/06.md) makes clear. That verse requires people to be careful what they do with holy and valuable things. However, the general message is to avoid making judgments about others, especially when one has one’s own faults and sins.\n\n### Words and deeds\n\nIn [7:15–27](../07/15.md), Jesus teaches about the importance of doing what is right, not just saying the right things. He says that his disciples can recognize false prophets by what they do, that he himself will honor and acknowledge his disciples based on what they do, and that only those who do what is right will survive difficult experiences.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### The speck of wood and the log\n\nIn [7:3–5](../07/03.md), Jesus refers to small faults and sins as if they were specks of wood in people’s eyes. He refers to larger faults and sins as if they were logs in people’s eyes. Jesus speaks in this way to contrast how significant these sins and faults are. He also speaks in this way to indicate that larger sins and faults make people spiritually unobservant, just as a log in someone’s eye makes that person unable to see. If possible preserve the metaphor or express the idea in simile form. (See:[[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n### Dogs and pigs\n\nIn [7:6](../07/06.md), Jesus speaks of how his disciples should behave as if they were interacting with holy things, pearls, dogs, and pigs. He could be speaking of the gospel as the holy and pearls. In this case, the dogs and pigs represent people who reject the gospel. Or, Jesus could be speaking of his disciples’ possessions and skills as the holy and pearls. In this case, the dogs and pigs represent worthless tasks and goals. Or, Jesus could be speaking of fellow disciples as the holy and pearls. In this case, the dogs and pigs represent unbelievers. Since Jesus speaks these words as a saying or proverb, you should avoid choosing one option. Instead, you should express the idea in a way that allows for all these and other interpretations. If if it would be helpful to your readers, you could use a form that you would normally use for a proverb or saying. See the notes on this verse for translation options. (See:[[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n### Gates and roads\n\nIn [7:13–14](../07/13.md), Jesus speaks of how people live as if they were traveling on a road or passing through a gate. He says that the gate and road that lead to eternal life are narrow and difficult, and only a few people travel that way. On the other hand, the gate and road that lead to destruction are wide and easy, and many people travel that way. He means that it is very easy to live in ways that will end in destruction, and it is hard to live in ways that will end in eternal life. If possible preserve the metaphor or express the idea in simile form. (See:[[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n### Trees and fruits\n\nIn [7:16–20](../07/16.md), Jesus speaks of people as if they were plants. Just as you can tell what kind of plant it is by what fruit the plant produces, so you can tell whether people are really Jesus’ disciples based on what they do. If possible preserve the metaphor or express the idea in simile form. (See:[[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n### Building houses\n\nIn [7:24–27](../07/24.md), Jesus compares obedient people to wise people who build their homes on a solid foundation. When bad things happen, they will be safe and secure, just like those homes will be safe and secure through storms and floods. In contrast, Jesus compares disobedient people to foolish people who build their homes on an insecure foundation. When bad things happen, they will be destroyed, just like those homes will collapse when storms and floods come. If possible preserve the metaphor or express the idea in simile form. (See:[[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Singular and plural forms of “you”\n\nIn this chapter, Jesus is talking to a large crowd of his followers. Throughout the chapter, Jesus switches between using “you” in the singular and “you” in the plural while he is talking to the same people. When he uses the singular, he is speaking about specific situations that each person in the crowd might experience. When he uses the plural, he is speaking generally to the crowd as a whole. You should assume that Jesus is using plural forms of “you” unless a note specifies that the forms are singular. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
7:1	xk6w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	μὴ κρίνετε	1	Here Jesus uses the word **judge** to refer to unofficial and improper judging. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this explicit. Alternate translation: “Do not harshly judge” or “Do not condemn”

7:2	bq9z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	καὶ	1	Here, the word **and** introduces a more general statement in proverb form.

7:2	wmxo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-proverbs	ἐν ᾧ μέτρῳ μετρεῖτε, μετρηθήσεται ὑμῖν	1	Here, Jesus uses or invents a proverb in order to teach that people eventually experience for themselves how they have treated other people.

7:2	wgh2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	μετρηθήσεται ὑμῖν	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

7:3	a3pp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1	Here, the word **Now** introduces the next topic. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces the next topic, or you could leave **Now** untranslated. Alternate translation: “Next,”

Alternate translation: “you should not look at the speck of wood in the eye of your brother when you do not notice log in your eye.” or “do not look at the speck of wood in the eye of your brother while at the same time not noticing the log in your eye!”
7:3	hzb4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd	βλέπεις & σου & τῷ σῷ ὀφθαλμῷ & οὐ κατανοεῖς	1	Even though Jesus is speaking to many disciples, he is addressing an individual situation, so **you** and **your** are singular throughout this verse. But if the singular form would not be natural in your language for someone who was speaking to a group of people, you could use the plural forms of **you** and **your** in your translation.
7:3	ctb3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor	βλέπεις τὸ κάρφος τὸ ἐν τῷ ὀφθαλμῷ τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ σου, τὴν δὲ ἐν τῷ σῷ ὀφθαλμῷ δοκὸν οὐ κατανοεῖς	1	Here Jesus refers to small faults and mistakes as if they were a **speck of wood** in a person’s **eye**. He speaks of large faults and mistakes as if they were a **log** in a person’s **eye**.

Alternate translation: “do you focus on your brother’s small fault, which is like a speck of wood in his eye, but you do not notice your own large fault, which is like a log in your eye” or “do you look at the small mistakes your brother makes, but you do not notice your own large mistakes”
7:3	hqnr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τὸ κάρφος	1	A **speck of wood** is a tiny piece of wood or plant matter.

7:3	d2qc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ σου	1	Jesus is using the term **brother** to mean a person who shares the same faith. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “of your fellow disciple”
7:3	mo6n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ σου	1	Although the term **brother** is masculine, Jesus is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If you retain the metaphor in your translation, and if it would be helpful in your language, you could say “brother or sister” to indicate this.
7:3	xdcg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	τὴν & δοκὸν	1	A **log** could not literally go into a person’s **eye**. Jesus is using an extreme example to emphasize his point and make it memorable. If it would be helpful in your language, you could refer to the largest object that could fall into a person’s eye. Alternate translation: “the large piece of wood”\n
7:3	q1z4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τὴν & δοκὸν	1	A **log** is a long, large piece of wood.

Alternate translation: “You should not say to your brother, ‘Let me take out the speck of wood from your eye,’ while behold, the log is in your eye.” or “Do not say to your brother, ‘Let me take out the speck of wood from your eye,’ while behold, the log is in your eye!”

This was a poetic form in his culture. If your readers would not recognize this as poetry and misunderstand which animals Jesus is speaking about in the last two clauses, you could rearrange the clauses. Alternate translation: “You should not give the holy to the dogs. Otherwise, having turned, they will tear you to pieces. Nor should you throw your pearls in front of the pigs. Otherwise they will trample them under their feet”

7:7	rt8g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	κρούετε	1	To **knock** means to hit a door a few times to let a person inside the house know you are standing outside. You could translate this expression with the way people in your culture show that they have arrived at a house. Alternate translation: “call out” or “cough” or “clap”
7:7	zu03		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	κρούετε καὶ ἀνοιγήσεται ὑμῖν	1	Here Jesus speaks of praying as if it were knocking on a door, and he speaks of God answering the prayer as if it were the door being opened.

Alternate translation: “ask for permission, and permission will be given to you” or “pray, and God will answer your prayer”
7:7	yz3q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἀνοιγήσεται ὑμῖν	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

7:8	ykrj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	Here, the word **For** introduces some reasons why the disciples should do what Jesus commanded in the previous verse. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a reason or basis for a claim, or you could leave **For** untranslated. Alternate translation: “Do those things since” or “That is because”
7:8	yva3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πᾶς & ὁ αἰτῶν λαμβάνει, καὶ ὁ ζητῶν εὑρίσκει	1	You may need to say what a person would be asking for and seeking. If so, express the idea as you did in [7:7](../07/07.md). Alternate translation: “everyone asking for a good thing receives it; and the one seeking a good thing finds it”
7:8	uvcu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τῷ κρούοντι	1	Express the idea of **knocking** as you did in [7:7](../07/07.md). Alternate translation: “to the one calling out” or “to the one coughing” or “to the one clapping”
7:8	vcdb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τῷ κρούοντι ἀνοιγήσεται	1	Here Jesus continues to speak of praying as if it were knocking on a door and of God answering the prayer as if it were the door being opened.

7:9	et6p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	ἢ	1	Here, the word **Or** introduces a contrasting alternative to what Jesus has said about how people who ask will receive. Jesus then uses the question form to show that this alternate is wrong. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a false alternative, or you could leave **Or** untranslated. Alternate translation: “Indeed,” or “As a matter of fact,”
7:9	p1if			ἢ τίς ἐστιν ἐξ ὑμῶν ἄνθρωπος, ὃν αἰτήσει ὁ υἱὸς αὐτοῦ ἄρτον, μὴ λίθον ἐπιδώσει αὐτῷ	1	Alternate translation: “Or what man is there from among you who will give his son a stone when he asks for bread”

If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “There is not a man from among you, of whom his son will ask for bread, and he will give him a stone.” or “No man among you, of whom his son will ask for bread, will give him a stone!”
7:9	fscs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo	ἢ τίς ἐστιν ἐξ ὑμῶν ἄνθρωπος, ὃν αἰτήσει ὁ υἱὸς αὐτοῦ ἄρτον, μὴ λίθον ἐπιδώσει αὐτῷ?	1	Here Jesus uses an imaginary situation to help explain how parents give good things, not bad things, to their children. Use a natural method in your language for introducing an imaginary situation. Alternate translation: “Or imagine a man from among you. When his son asks him for bread, he will not give a stone, will he”
7:9	n5s1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	τίς ἐστιν ἐξ ὑμῶν ἄνθρωπος, ὃν αἰτήσει ὁ υἱὸς αὐτοῦ ἄρτον, μὴ λίθον ἐπιδώσει αὐτῷ	1	Although Jesus uses the example of a **man** and **his son**, he does not mean that this example applies only to fathers and sons. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that includes all parents and children. Alternate translation: “what parents are there from among you, of whom their child will ask for bread—they will not give their child a stone, will they”
7:10	z9xu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	ἢ	1	Here, the word **Or** introduces another similar example.

If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “And there is not one person among you, if his son asks for a fish, will give him a snake.”
7:10	kgak		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo	ἢ καὶ ἰχθὺν αἰτήσει, μὴ ὄφιν ἐπιδώσει αὐτῷ	1	Here Jesus uses an imaginary situation to help explain how parents give good things, not bad things, to their children. Use a natural method in your language for introducing an imaginary situation. Alternate translation: “Or imagine that same man again. When his son asks him for a fish, he will not give him a snake, will he”
7:10	mf6n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	καὶ ἰχθὺν αἰτήσει, μὴ ὄφιν ἐπιδώσει αὐτῷ	1	Although Jesus continues to use the example of a father and his son, he does not mean that this example applies only to fathers and sons. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that includes all parents and children. Alternate translation: “the child will also ask for a fish—the parents will not give the child a snake, will they”
7:10	tz8z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὄφιν	1	In this culture, people did not eat snakes. So Jesus is saying that a father would not give a son something the son could not eat if the son asked for something that he could eat. If people do eat snakes in your culture, you could use the name of something that they do not eat, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “something he cannot eat”
7:11	n1vh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἰ	1	Jesus speaks as if this were a hypothetical situation, but he means that it is true. If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, and if your readers might think that what Jesus is saying is uncertain, then you could translate his words as an affirmative statement. Alternate translation: “since”
7:11	n98d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	πονηροὶ ὄντες	1	Here, the phrase **being evil** states something that is unexpected for people who **know how to give good gifts**.

7:11	z8zr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ὁ Πατὴρ ὑμῶν	1	This is a figurative expression. God is not the **Father** of humans in the same actual way that he is the Father of Jesus. Even so, it would probably be best to translate **Father** with the same word that your language would naturally use to refer to a human father. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that this means God. Alternate translation: “your Father, God,”\n
7:11	t3p4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὁ ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς	1	Here, the phrase in the heavens identifies the location in which God the Father is specially present and from which he rules.

Alternate translation: “you should do to men all things in the way that you desire them to do to you”
7:12	g8c7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	οἱ ἄνθρωποι	1	Although the term **men** is masculine, Jesus is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a phrase that makes this clear. Alternate translation: “people” or “men and women”
7:12	cywd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γάρ	1	Here, the word **For** introduces a reason for the command that Jesus has just given. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a reason or basis for a command, or you could leave **For** untranslated. Alternate translation: “since” or “which you should do because”
7:12	y4f6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οὗτος & ἐστιν ὁ νόμος καὶ οἱ προφῆται	1	Here, the clause **this is the Law and the Prophets** means that Jesus’ command summarizes what **the Law and the Prophets** require. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “this is what the Law and Prophets require” or “this is a summary of the Law and the Prophets”
7:12	wivn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	ὁ νόμος καὶ οἱ προφῆται	1	The word **Law** is the name for one part of the Hebrew Scriptures, and the word **Prophets** is the name for another part of the Hebrew Scriptures. Show this in your translation in the way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “all the Scriptures, both the Law and the Prophets”
7:12	b1x2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	οἱ προφῆται	1	Here, the word **Prophets** represents what the prophets said and wrote. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your language or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the writings of the prophets”
7:13-14	f47a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge	εἰσέλθατε διὰ τῆς στενῆς πύλης; ὅτι πλατεῖα ἡ πύλη καὶ εὐρύχωρος ἡ ὁδὸς ἡ ἀπάγουσα εἰς τὴν ἀπώλειαν, καὶ πολλοί εἰσιν οἱ εἰσερχόμενοι δι’ αὐτῆς; & ὅτι στενὴ ἡ πύλη καὶ τεθλιμμένη ἡ ὁδὸς ἡ ἀπάγουσα εἰς τὴν ζωήν, καὶ ὀλίγοι εἰσὶν οἱ εὑρίσκοντες αὐτήν.	1	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could combine [7:13](../07/13.md) and [7:14](../07/14.md) into a verse bridge, as UST does, in order to keep the information about the **narrow gate** together. Alternate translation: “Enter through the narrow gate. For the gate {is} narrow and the way has been made narrow that is leading to life, and there are few finding it. But wide {is} the gate and broad {is} the road that is leading to destruction, and there are many entering through it”
7:13	dgr2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor	εἰσέλθατε διὰ τῆς στενῆς πύλης; ὅτι πλατεῖα ἡ πύλη καὶ εὐρύχωρος ἡ ὁδὸς ἡ ἀπάγουσα εἰς τὴν ἀπώλειαν, καὶ πολλοί εἰσιν οἱ εἰσερχόμενοι δι’ αὐτῆς	1	Here Jesus speaks of how people live as if they were walking on a **road** and of what happens when they die as if it were entering through a **gate**. When a **gate** is **narrow**, that means that it is difficult to go through and that not many people go through it. When a **gate** is **wide** and a **road** is **broad**, that means that they are easy to travel on or go through and that many people travel on or through them. Since these are important images that Jesus uses in the following verse as well, you should preserve the figure of speech or express the idea in simile form. Alternate translation: “You should live like a traveler who enters through a narrow gate. Many people live like travelers who enter through a wide gate and travel on a broad road, but this path leads to destruction”
7:13	g4be		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ὅτι	1	Here, the word **For** introduces a reason why people should enter through the **narrow gate**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a reason for a command, or you could leave **For** untranslated. Alternate translation: “That is because”
7:13	zv24		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	εἰς τὴν ἀπώλειαν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **destruction**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “to being destroyed” or “to God destroying you”
7:13	mulg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	πολλοί	1	Jesus is using the adjective **many** as a noun to mean many people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “many travelers”
7:14	aj95		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	ὅτι στενὴ ἡ πύλη καὶ τεθλιμμένη ἡ ὁδὸς	1	Many ancient manuscripts read **For the gate is narrow and the road has been made narrow**. The ULT follows that reading. Other ancient manuscripts read “How narrow is the gate and having been made narrow the road.” If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of the ULT.
7:14	mvfv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ὅτι	1	Here, the word **For** introduces another reason why people should enter through the narrow **gate**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a reason for a command, or you could leave **For** untranslated. Alternate translation: “Enter through the narrow gate because”
7:14	krug		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor	στενὴ ἡ πύλη καὶ τεθλιμμένη ἡ ὁδὸς ἡ ἀπάγουσα εἰς τὴν ζωήν, καὶ ὀλίγοι εἰσὶν οἱ εὑρίσκοντες αὐτήν	1	Here Jesus continues to speak of how people live as if they were walking on a **way** and of what happens when they die as if it were entering through a **gate**. When a **gate** is **narrow** and **way** has been made **narrow**, that means that they are difficult to go through and that not many people go through them. Express the idea as you did in [7:13](../07/13.md). Alternate translation: “only a few people live like travelers who find the narrow gate and travel on the road that has been made narrow, and this road leads to life”
7:14	jish		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τεθλιμμένη ἡ ὁδὸς	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who did the action, it is clear from the context that it was God. Alternate translation: “the road is narrow” or “God has made the road narrow”
7:14	byw6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὴν ζωήν	1	Here Jesus implies that **life** is eternal or undying life. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “true life” or “eternal life”
7:14	wlr9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	εἰς τὴν ζωήν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **life**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “to being able to live”
7:14	gdji		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	ὀλίγοι	1	Jesus is using the adjective **few** as a noun to mean few people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “few travelers”

By the **false prophets** wearing **sheep’s clothing**, he means that the **false prophets** pretend to be part of God’s people. However, Jesus says that **inwardly** they are **ravenous wolves**. He means that they hurt and take advantage of God’s people, which is acting just like **wolves** that eat **sheep**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in simile form or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “who pretend to be part of your group, as if they were dressed in sheep’s clothing. However, inwardly they want to harm you, as if they were ravenous wolves”
7:15	bwag		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐν ἐνδύμασι προβάτων	1	Here, the phrase **sheep’s clothing** refers to disguising oneself to look like a sheep. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “disguising themselves as sheep” or “pretending to be sheep”
7:15	t21q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	λύκοι ἅρπαγες	1	When **wolves** are **ravenous**, they want to capture and eat other animals, such as **sheep**.

Just as thorny plants do not produce **fruits**, so evil people who do not trust God do not do what is right. Jesus uses this metaphor for several verses, so you should preserve the figure of speech or use simile form. Alternate translation: “You will know who people are by what they do, just as you know what plants are by their fruits. They do not gather grapes from a thornbush or figs from thistles, do they? Similarly, evil people do not do what is right, do they”
7:16	jvxv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἀπὸ τῶν καρπῶν αὐτῶν ἐπιγνώσεσθε αὐτούς	1	The pronouns **their** and **them** refer to any people, but particularly people like the “false prophets” Jesus mentioned in the previous verse. If this is not clear for your readers, you could refer directly to the false prophets or to any people who claim to be believers. Alternate translation: “You will recognize the false prophets by their fruits” or “You will recognize anyone who claims to believe by his or her fruits”
7:16	nve4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	μήτι συλλέγουσιν ἀπὸ ἀκανθῶν σταφυλὰς, ἢ ἀπὸ τριβόλων σῦκα?	1	Jesus is using the question form to to show that **grapes** do not come from **a thornbush** and **figs** do not come from **thistles**.

Alternate translation: “They do not gather grapes from a thornbush or figs from thistles.” or “No one gathers grapes from a thornbush or figs from thistles!”
7:16	gy7s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	μήτι συλλέγουσιν	1	The pronoun **they** refers to people in general. If this is not clear for your readers, you could use a form that refers to any person or group of people. Alternate translation: “People do not gather … do they”
7:16	d7ac		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	ἀπὸ ἀκανθῶν σταφυλὰς, ἢ ἀπὸ τριβόλων σῦκα	1	These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could combine the two phrases. Alternate translation: “grapes or figs from thorny plants” or “fruits from scrub plants”
7:16	vqnd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τριβόλων	1	Here, the word **thistles** refers generally to plants that have points or spikes on their stems or leaves. These plants do not produce fruit. If your readers would not be familiar with this type of plant, you could use the name of something similar in your area or you could use a more general term. Alternate translation: “spiky plants”
7:17	f5l3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor	οὕτως πᾶν δένδρον ἀγαθὸν καρποὺς καλοὺς ποιεῖ; τὸ δὲ σαπρὸν δένδρον καρποὺς πονηροὺς ποιεῖ	1	Here Jesus continues to speak of people as if they were plants that produced **fruits**. Just as a **good tree** produces **good fruits**, so people who follow God do what is right. Just as a **roten tree** produces **rotten fruits**, so people who do not follow God do what is wrong. Jesus uses this metaphor for several verses, so you should preserve the figure of speech or use simile form. Alternate translation: “In the same way, every good tree produces good fruits, but the rotten tree produces bad fruits. Similarly, believers do what is right, but unbelievers do what is wrong”
7:17	vy6i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	τὸ & σαπρὸν δένδρον & ποιεῖ	1	The phrase **the rotten tree** represents rotten trees in general, not one particular rotten tree. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: “rotten trees produce”
7:18	gey5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor	οὐ δύναται δένδρον ἀγαθὸν καρποὺς πονηροὺς ποιεῖν, οὐδὲ δένδρον σαπρὸν καρποὺς καλοὺς ποιεῖν	1	Here Jesus continues to speak of people as if they were plants that produced **fruits**. Express the idea as you did in the previous verse [7:17](../07/17.md). Alternate translation: “A good tree is not able to produce bad fruits, nor a rotten tree to produce good fruits. Similarly, believers do not do what is wrong, and unbelievers do not do what is right”
7:18	x849		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	οὐδὲ δένδρον σαπρὸν	1	Jesus is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You could supply these words from earlier in the sentence if it would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “nor is a rotten tree able”

Similarly, every person who does not do what is right is judged and punished”

If you need to say who did the action, you could use an indefinite subject. Alternate translation: “They cut down every tree not producing good fruit and throw it into a fire”
7:19	a5u1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	καρπὸν καλὸν	1	In this verse, the word **fruit** is singular in form, but it refers to many fruits as a group. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this plainly. Alternate translation: “good fruits”

8:intro	f33a				0	# Matthew 8 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n3. Jesus illustrates the kingdom of God through acts of healing (8:1–9:34)\n      * Healing a leper (8:1–4)\n      * Healing the centurion’s servant (8:5–13)\n      * Healing Peter’s mother-in-law and many others (8:14–17)\n      * The cost of following Jesus (8:18–22)\n      * Calming the storm (8:23–27)\n      * Casting demons out of two men (8:28–34)\n\n## Important Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Healings\n\nIn this chapter, Matthew narrates how Jesus heals a leper, the paralyzed servant of a centurion, Peter’s mother who had a fever, and many other people who were sick. In every case where Matthew describes what happened, Jesus speaks words, or he touches the sick person, or he does both. These stories show how powerful Jesus is. He does not need to use medicine or magic to heal people. Instead, he can just command the sickness to go away or simply touch the person.\n\n### Casting out demons\n\nMatthew clearly distinguishes sick people from people who are controlled by demons. Demons are evil spiritual beings who can control people. They usually use these people to hurt themselves or others. Matthew briefly mentions that Jesus drives demons out of people in [8:16](../08/16.md). At the end of the chapter, he includes a longer story about how Jesus drives demons out of two men ([8:28–34](../08/28.md)). The demons use the two men to speak, but they say what the demons want them to say. The demons know that Jesus is the Son of God, and they plead with Jesus not to punish them too much. Jesus agrees to do what they ask, but he is the one who is in charge. Again, the story shows how powerful Jesus is.\n\n### Feasting in the kingdom of heaven\n\nIn [8:11–12](../08/11.md), Jesus speaks about how many people will feast with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of the heavens. However, some people who are expected to be part of the feast will be cast outside and punished. It is likely that Jesus is referring to a feast that will eventually happen, so do not express the idea as if it were a metaphor.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Rhetorical Questions\n\nIn [8:26](../08/26.md) and [8:29](../08/29.md), characters in the story use rhetorical questions. They ask these questions to make strong points, not because they are looking for information. If your language does not use questions in this way, you could include answers to the questions or you could express them as statements or exclamations. See the notes on these verses for translation options. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Singular and plural forms of “you”\n\nMost of the forms of “you” in this chapter appear in dialogue between Jesus and other people. Because of this, most forms of “you” in this chapter are singular. You should assume forms of “you” are singular unless a note specifies that the form is plural. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
8:1	qb1d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	δὲ	1	Here, the word **Now** introduces the next major event in the story.

8:2	yhgp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	ἰδοὺ	1	Here, the word **behold** draws the attention of the audience and asks them to listen carefully.

8:2	yjn2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	με καθαρίσαι	1	The man talks about becoming **clean** ceremonially, but it is implicit that he has become unclean because of his leprosy, so he is primarily asking Jesus to heal him of this disease.

8:4	akk4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense	λέγει	1	To call attention to a development in the story, Matthew uses the present tense in past narration. If it would not be natural to do that in your language, you could use the past tense in your translation. Alternate translation: “said”
8:4	g1uf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	μηδενὶ εἴπῃς	1	The implication is that the man is not to tell anyone that Jesus healed him. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “you tell no one that you have been healed”

8:4	tq9l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	προσένεγκον τὸ δῶρον ὃ προσέταξεν Μωϋσῆς	1	Jesus assumes that the man will know that the law required a person who had been healed from a skin disease to **offer** a specific **gift**.

8:4	b0pz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	εἰς μαρτύριον αὐτοῖς	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **testimony**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “so that it testifies to them”

9:intro	tg41				0	# Matthew 9 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n3. Jesus illustrates the kingdom of God through acts of healing (8:1-9:34)\n      * Healing a paralytic (9:1–8)\n      * Calling Matthew and eating with sinners (9:9–13)\n      * Jesus brings something new (9:14–17)\n      * Healing a woman and resurrecting a girl (9:18–26)\n      * Healing two blind men (9:27–31)\n      * Casting a demon out of a mute man (9:32–34)\n4. Jesus teaches about mission and the kingdom (9:35-10:42)\n      * More laborers for the harvest (9:35–38)\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Healings\n\nIn this chapter, Matthew narrates how Jesus heals a paralyzed man, a woman with a disease that caused bleeding, two blind men, and many other people who were sick. In every case where Matthew describes what happened, Jesus speaks words, or he touches the sick person, or he does both. These stories show how powerful Jesus is. He does not need to use medicine or magic to heal people. Instead, he can just command the sickness to go away or simply touch the person.\n\n### Casting out demons\n\nMatthew clearly distinguishes sick people from people who are controlled by demons. Demons are evil spiritual beings who can control people. They usually use these people to hurt themselves or others. In [9:32–34](../09/32.md), Matthew briefly describes how Jesus drove out a demon who caused the man it controlled to be mute, that is, unable to speak. In response, both the crowds and the Pharisees realize that Jesus is powerful.\n\n### Resurrecting the dead\n\nIn [9:18–19](../09/18.md) and [9:23–26](../09/23.md), Matthew narrates how Jesus raised a girl from the dead. While Jesus describes her as only “sleeping,” he uses this word to indicate that the girl will “wake up” from being dead. The story clearly indicates that the girl had died and that Jesus raises her from the dead by touching her.\n\n### “Sinners”\n\nWhen Matthew uses the word “sinners,” he is describing a group of people whom many Jewish religious groups would have considered to be living in ways that were improper for those who were part of God’s people. Some of these people may have committed significant sins, while others may have disagreed with many of the Jewish religious groups about how Jews could properly behave. If possible, use a word or phrase that identifies people who are not living as many religious groups think that people should live. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### The short parables in [9:15–17](../09/15.md)\n\nIn these verses, Jesus gives three short parables that emphasize describe how certain things do not go well together. Fasting does not happen during a wedding celebration. An unshrunk piece of cloth does not make a good patch for an old garment. Old wineskins do not make a good container for fresh wine that still needs to ferment. Jesus tells these parables to illustrate how his ministry and preaching do not match well with how people had previously done things. In other words, Jesus wants people to expect what he does to be new, and this may require thinking and doing many new things. You should preserve these parables, since they are not direct metaphors. If necessary, you could introduce them in such a way that your readers recognize that they are parables or illustrations. See the notes on each verse for possible translation options. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])\n\n### The harvest metaphor\n\nIn [9:37–38](../09/37.md), Jesus speaks of people who will believe as if they were a harvest of grain, and he speaks of those who preach the gospel as the laborers who work to harvest the grain. Just as when there is a large harvest but only a few laborers, so there are many people who will believe, but only a few people who are preaching the gospel. If possible, preserve the metaphor or express the idea in simile form. See the notes on these verses for translation options. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Singular and plural forms of “you”\n\nMost of the forms of “you” in this chapter appear in dialogue between Jesus and other people. Because of this, most forms of “you” in this chapter are singular. You should assume forms of “you” are singular unless a note specifies that the form is plural. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
9:1	lje9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	διεπέρασεν	1	Here Matthew implies that Jesus **crossed over** the Sea of Galilee. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “he crossed over the lake”
9:1	s8n5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	διεπέρασεν	1	Here, the word **he** refers directly to Jesus, but Matthew implies that the disciples were with him.

9:1	mwx1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	ἦλθεν	1	In a context such as this, your language might say “went” instead of **came**. Alternate translation: “went”
9:1	qk74		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὴν ἰδίαν πόλιν	1	Here, the phrase **his own city** refers to the city in which Jesus was living, which was Capernaum. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “the city where he was living” or “Capernaum, his own city”
9:2	nycb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	ἰδοὺ	1	Here, the word **behold** draws the attention of the audience and asks them to listen carefully.

Alternate translation: “picture this” or “suddenly”
9:2	hkfe		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	προσέφερον & αὐτῶν	1	Here, the pronouns **they** and **their** refer to the people who brought the **paralytic** to Jesus. Matthew does not give us any more information about who they were. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that refers to specific people who are not named.

9:2	szd4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	παραλυτικὸν & τῷ παραλυτικῷ	1	The word **paralytic** describes people who are not able to use or control some or all of their arms and legs because of injury or sickness.

9:2	x8ao		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	κλίνης	1	A **mat** was a portable bed that could also be used to transport a person. If your readers would not be familiar with this type of bed, you could use the name of something similar in your area or you could use a more general term. Alternate translation: “a stretcher”
9:2	dwzz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἰδὼν & τὴν πίστιν αὐτῶν	1	Here Matthew implies that Jesus recognized that the friends of this paralyzed man strongly believed that he could heal him. Their actions proved that. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “having recognized that they were convinced that he could heal the paralytic”
9:2	ooj2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τὴν πίστιν αὐτῶν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **faith**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “how they trusted”
9:2	iu8l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τέκνον	1	Here Jesus calls the paralytic **Child** to indicate that he cares for him. The word also implies that the paralytic was younger than Jesus. The paralytic was not actually Jesus’ son. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form of address that an older person would use to show that they care for a younger person. Alternate translation: “My friend” or “Young one”
9:2	dhtx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	θάρσει	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **courage**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “be courageous”
9:2	iys2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἀφίενταί σου αἱ ἁμαρτίαι	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who does the action, it is clear from the context that it is Jesus. Alternate translation: “I forgive your sins”
9:3	ptno		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	ἰδού	1	Here, the word **behold** draws the attention of the audience and asks them to listen carefully. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express **behold** with a word or phrase that asks the audience to listen, or you could draw the audience’s attention in another way. Alternate translation: “picture this” or “immediately”
9:3	ck90		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐν ἑαυτοῖς	1	Here, the phrase **among themselves** could mean that: (1) the scribes **said** these words to themselves, not out loud. Alternate translation: “in themselves” or “to themselves” (2) the scribes **said** these words quietly to other scribes. Alternate translation: “to each other”
9:3	e6me		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	οὗτος	1	Here the scribes refer to Jesus by using the phrase **This one**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the reference more explicit. Alternate translation: “This man” or “This Jesus”
9:4	u643		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἰδὼν & τὰς ἐνθυμήσεις αὐτῶν	1	Here Matthew speaks as if Jesus could see people’s **thoughts**. He means that Jesus knew what they were thinking, even though they did not say it out loud. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “having known their thoughts” or “having perceived their thoughts”
9:4	n4yl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	ἵνα τί ἐνθυμεῖσθε πονηρὰ ἐν ταῖς καρδίαις ὑμῶν?	1	Jesus is using the question form to rebuke the scribes. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “You should not think evil in your hearts.” or “Do not think evil in your hearts!”
9:4	e936		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	ἐνθυμεῖσθε & ὑμῶν	1	Here, the words **you** and **you** are plural because Jesus is speaking to the scribes.
9:4	jpg1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	πονηρὰ	1	Jesus is using the adjective **evil** as a noun to mean evil thoughts. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “evil thoughts”
9:4	d499		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐν ταῖς καρδίαις ὑμῶν	1	In Matthew’s culture, **hearts** are the places where humans think and feel. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate **heart** by referring to the places where humans think and feel in your culture or by expressing the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “in your heads” or “in your minds”
9:5	hae2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	γάρ	1	Here, the word **For** introduces a reason why the scribes should not be thinking evil in their hearts ([9:4](../09/04.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a reason or basis for a claim, or you could leave **For** untranslated. Alternate translation: “In fact,” or “I say that because”
9:5	j716		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τί & ἐστιν εὐκοπώτερον εἰπεῖν, ἀφέωνται σου αἱ ἁμαρτίαι, ἢ εἰπεῖν, ἔγειρε καὶ περιπάτει?	1	Jesus is using the question form to show the scribes which of these things is easier to say. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. He could mean: (1) that saying **Your sins have been forgiven** is **easier** than saying **Get up and walk**. This is because it is easy to show that someone is lying when they try to heal a paralytic, but it is not easy to show that someone is lying when they claim to forgive sins. Alternate translation: “it is easier to say, ‘Your sins have been forgiven,’ than to say, ‘Get up and walk.’” (2) that both things are equally easy to say. Alternate translation: “saying ‘Your sins have been forgiven’ is just as easy as saying, ‘Get up and walk.’”

Alternate translation: “to say that a person’s sins have been forgiven to tell a person to get up and walk”
9:5	x05v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἀφέωνται σου αἱ ἁμαρτίαι	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

9:6	p3nh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	δὲ	1	Here, the word **But** introduces a slight contrast with the comparison in the previous verse. Jesus now shows that he will both forgive and heal the paralytic. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a slight contrast, or you could leave **But** untranslated. Alternate translation: “But now,” or “Leaving that aside,”
9:6	ahaf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	ἵνα & εἰδῆτε ὅτι ἐξουσίαν ἔχει ὁ Υἱὸς τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς ἀφιέναι ἁμαρτίας (τότε λέγει τῷ παραλυτικῷ), ἐγερθεὶς	1	Here, the phrase **in order that** introduces the purpose for which Jesus **says to the paralytic** the commands that he gives. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that provides the stated purpose for which a person performs an action. Alternate translation: “here is what I will do so that you might know that the Son of Man has authority on the earth to forgive sins.’ Then, he says to the paralytic, ‘Getting up”
9:6	n5sf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	εἰδῆτε & σου & σου	1	Here, the **you** is plural and is addressed to the scribes, but both instances of **your** are singular and are addressed to the paralytic.
9:6	td1z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	ἔχει ὁ Υἱὸς τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου	1	Here Jesus speaks about himself in the third person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use the first person. Alternate translation: “I, the Son of Man, have”
9:6	cc7u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὁ Υἱὸς τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου	1	The title **Son of Man** is equivalent to “Messiah.” Jesus uses the phrase to claim that role subtly and implicitly. You may want to translate this title directly into your language. On the other hand, if you think it would be helpful to your readers, you could state what it means. See how you translated the title in [8:20](../08/20.md). Alternate translation: “the Messiah”
9:6	k6rw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐξουσίαν ἔχει	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **authority**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “has been authorized”

Express the idea as you did in [9:37](../09/37.md). Alternate translation: “the Lord, who is like the person in charge of the harvest, to send out more people who will proclaim the good news. These people are like the laborers for the harvest.”
9:38	vz8y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τοῦ Κυρίου τοῦ θερισμοῦ	1	Here, Jesus is using the possessive form to describe God as the one who is **the Lord** who is in charge of **the harvest**.

10:intro	m5iu				0	# Matthew 10 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n4. Jesus teaches about mission and the kingdom (9:35–10:42)\n      * The 12 disciples (10:1–4)\n      * Instructions about behavior and travel (10:5–15)\n      * Teaching on persecution (10:16–39)\n        * Expecting persecution (10:16–23)\n        * Motivation to persevere (10:24–33)\n        * Purpose during persecution (10:34–39)\n      * How to treat fellow disciples (10:40–42)\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Jesus’ instructions on how to travel\n\nJesus instructs the disciples not to bring money, sandals, staff, or extra clothing with them when they travel and preach the good news. Instead, he wants the disciples to rely on the hospitality of people they visit. So, he instructs to find someone who is “worthy” to host them, and he tells them to stay at that person’s house until they leave the area. Make sure that your translation indicates that the disciples should not back money or extra clothing because they will be staying with people who welcome them and their message.\n\n### The coming of the Son of Man\n\nIn [10:23](../10/23.md), Jesus tells the disciples that they will not complete their work in the towns of Israel before “the Son of Man comes.” Jesus often uses the phrase “Son of Man” to refer to himself as an important representative of God. In this verse, it is not clear what it means for this important figure, Jesus himself, to “come.” Christians have understood this “coming” in several ways:\n\n1. it could describe Jesus’ second coming, but it seems like the disciples probably did finish their work in the towns of Israel before Jesus’ second coming.\n2. it could describe the time when the Romans destroyed Jerusalem, which was Jesus “coming” to judge and punish.\n3. it could describe Jesus’ ascension to be enthroned in heaven. In this case, “coming” refers going into heaven, not coming to earth.\n4. it could describe Jesus’ appearances to the disciples after his resurrection.\n\nSince Christians have understood this verse in at least these different ways, if possible your translation should allow for all these options. See the notes on [10:23](../10/23.md) for translation options.\n\n### Persecution and conflict\n\nThroughout this chapter, Jesus speaks about the persecutions and troubles his disciples will face, even from members of their own families. He motivates them to persevere during these persecutions and troubles in several ways. First, he reminds them that people persecute him, and so they will definitely persecute his disciples. That means that persecution is a sign that the disciples are following Jesus. Second, he encourages them that God knows and cares about them and their suffering. Third, he tells them that God will show them what to say when people are accusing them. In the end, Jesus wants to teach his disciples to expect persecution, how to think about it, and how to persevere during it.\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### The 12 disciples\n\nThe following are the lists of the 12 disciples in Matthew, Mark, and Luke:\n\nIn [Matthew 10:2–4](../mat/10/02.md):\n\nSimon (Peter), Andrew, James son of Zebedee, John son of Zebedee, Philip, Bartholomew, Thomas, Matthew, James son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot.\n\nIn [Mark 3:16–19](../mrk/03/16.md):\n\nSimon (Peter), James son of Zebedee, John son of Zebedee, Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot.\n\nIn [Luke 6:14–16](../luk/06/14.md):\n\nSimon (Peter), Andrew, James, John, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot, Judas son of James, and Judas Iscariot.\n\nThese lists do not always follow the same order or use the same names for the disciples. In that culture, people often had two or three names. For example, it is likely that that Thaddaeus was also named Judas or Jude. So, do not harmonize these lists by using the same sequence or names in each case. You should translate Matthew’s list as Matthew presents it.\n\n### Singular and plural forms of “you”\n\nIn this chapter, Jesus is giving instructions to the 12 disciples. Because of that, all forms of “you” in this chapter are plural. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
10:1	nhp2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	καὶ	1	Here, the word **And** introduces the next major event in the story.

10:1	xr7t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	τοὺς δώδεκα μαθητὰς αὐτοῦ	1	Since Matthew will list who these **12 disciples** are in the following verse, you do not need to explain in this verse who they are. However, you could clarify that these are the **12** closest or most important disciples. Matthew does not mean that Jesus only had 12 disciples. Alternate translation: “his 12 closest disciples” or “his 12 most important disciples”

10:1	tjq8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	πᾶσαν νόσον καὶ πᾶσαν μαλακίαν	1	The terms **every disease** and **every sickness** mean similar things. Matthew is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. See how you translated the similar phrase in [4:23](../04/23.md). Alternate translation: “every ailment” or “every sickness”
10:1	m9i1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	πᾶσαν νόσον καὶ πᾶσαν μαλακίαν	1	Matthew says **every** here as a generalization to emphasize how Jesus healed many different kinds of **disease** and **sickness**.

If you borrow the word, you could spell it the way it sounds in your language and then put the translation in a footnote. If you translate the word’s meaning, **Cananaios** could be: (1) a title that indicates that this man was part of the group of people who wanted to free the Jewish people from Roman rule.

In this construction, the second negative does not cancel the first to create a positive meaning. Instead, it gives greater emphasis to the negative.

If your language does not use two negatives in that way, you could translate with one strong negative, as the ULT does. Alternate translation: “by no means”
10:23	hqpp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	ἕως ἂν ἔλθῃ ὁ Υἱὸς τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου	1	Here, Christians disagree on what the clause **the Son of Man comes** refers to. It could describe Jesus’ second coming; the time when the Romans destroyed Jerusalem, which was Jesus coming to judge and punish; Jesus’ ascension to be enthroned in heaven; or Jesus’ appearances to the disciples after his resurrection; or several other events. If possible, express the idea here in such a way that all of these options are possible. Alternate translation: “before the Son of Man comes again” or “before the coming of the Son of Man”

Alternate translation: “the Messiah”

He applies this proverb to his disciples to show them that they should be content to be like Jesus.

10:25	a49b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	τῷ μαθητῇ & ὁ δοῦλος	1	The phrases **the disciple** and **the slave** represent any disciples or slave, not one particular disciple or slave.

10:25	zi4i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	καὶ ὁ δοῦλος	1	Jesus is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete.

He speaks of himself as **the master of the house** and his disciples as **the members of his household**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use simile form or include the meaning of the figure of speech. Alternate translation: “I am like the master of the house, and you are like the members of my household. If they called the master of the house Beelzebul, how much worse the members of his household” or “If they called me, the master of the house, Beelzebul, how much worse you, the members of the household”
10:25	pu5y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἰ	1	Jesus speaks as if this were a hypothetical situation, but he means that it is true. If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, and if your readers might think that what Jesus is saying is uncertain, then you could translate his words as an affirmative statement. Alternate translation: “Given that” or “Because”
10:25	sj3w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἐπεκάλεσαν	1	Here, the pronoun **they** refers to any person who called Jesus **Beelzebul**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to any person who does that. Alternate translation: “some people called” or “his enemies called”
10:25	y5md		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	πόσῳ μᾶλλον	1	Jesus is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You could supply these words from earlier in the sentence if it would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “how much worse names will they call”
10:25	mhjn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	αὐτοῦ	3	Since Jesus applies this proverb in such a way that he is the **master of the house**, the word **his** refers most specifically to Jesus. Jesus is not using the word generically here. Preserve the reference to a specific man. Alternate translation: “the master’s”
10:26	v8wb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	αὐτούς	1	Here, the pronoun **them** refers to the people mentioned in the previous verse who called the master of the house and his household names.

Translate this proverb in a way that will be recognized as a proverb and be meaningful in your language and culture. Jesus could be applying this proverb: (1) to things that people do in secret to hurt or harm his disciples, things that will be made known to everyone. Alternate translation: “everything that people conceal will be revealed, and everything that people hide will be made known” (2) to the gospel message, that was or is concealed but that will be made known to everyone.

The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could connect the clauses with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternatively, you could combine the two clauses into one. Alternate translation: “there is nothing concealed that will not be revealed; yes, there is nothing hidden that will not be made known” or “there is nothing hidden that will not be revealed”
10:26	xqs4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	οὐδὲν & ἐστιν κεκαλυμμένον ὃ οὐκ ἀποκαλυφθήσεται, καὶ κρυπτὸν ὃ οὐ γνωσθήσεται	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could use positive expressions to translate these double negatives that consist of the negative word **nothing**, which is implied in the second clause, and the negative particle **not**. Alternate translation: “everything that is concealed will be revealed, and everything that is hidden will be made known”
10:26	j86e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	οὐδὲν & ἐστιν κεκαλυμμένον ὃ οὐκ ἀποκαλυφθήσεται, καὶ κρυπτὸν ὃ οὐ γνωσθήσεται	1	If your language does not use these passive forms, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who does the action, Jesus could be implying: (1) that people do the concealing and hiding and God does the revealing and making known. This fits with the view that the proverb refers to how people persecute the disciples. Alternate translation: “there is nothing that people conceal that God will not reveal, and there is nothing that people hide that God will not make known” (2) that God does both the concealing and hiding and the revealing and making known. This fits with the view that the proverb refers to preaching the gospel. Alternate translation: “there is nothing that God has concealed that he will not reveal, and there is nothing that God has hidden that he will not make known”
10:27	fa1s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	ὃ λέγω ὑμῖν ἐν τῇ σκοτίᾳ, εἴπατε ἐν τῷ φωτί; καὶ ὃ εἰς τὸ οὖς ἀκούετε, κηρύξατε ἐπὶ τῶν δωμάτων	1	These two clauses mean basically the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could connect the clauses with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: “What I tell you in the darkness, say in the light. Again, what you hear in your ear, proclaim upon the housetops”
10:27	kw75		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐν τῇ σκοτίᾳ	1	Jesus uses the image of **darkness** to represent the idea of concealment or secrecy. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “secretly”
10:27	rw53		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τῇ σκοτίᾳ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **darkness**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “in a dark place”
10:27	kih1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐν τῷ φωτί	1	Jesus uses the image of **light** to represent the idea of no concealment or secrecy. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “openly”

If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent phrase or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “what is whispered to you” or “what I say privately to you”
10:27	v1b7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ἐπὶ τῶν δωμάτων	1	Houses in Israel had flat roofs that were reached by stairs or ladders, so people could easily go up and stand on top of them. If houses are different in your culture and you think your readers might wonder how people would get up onto housetops and stand there, you could translate this with a general expression. Alternate translation: “from a high place from which everyone will be able to hear”
10:28	l2uy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τῶν ἀποκτεννόντων	1	Here, the phrase **the ones** refers to humans in general. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “humans, the ones killing”
10:28	c4nu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὸ σῶμα, τὴν & ψυχὴν & καὶ ψυχὴν καὶ σῶμα	1	Here, Jesus uses the words **body** and **soul** to distinguish between the physical and non-physical parts of a person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use words that describe the physical and non-physical parts of a person, or you could use more general expressions. Alternate translation: “your physical parts … your non-physical parts … both your physical and non-physical parts”
10:28	pk7k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	δὲ	2	Matthew contrasts fear of people with with fear of God by using the phrase **But instead**. People are only able to kill our physical bodies, but God is ** the one being able** to destroy both our physical bodies and our spiritual souls. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a contrast. Alternate translation: “But rather”
10:28	x3y1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὸν δυνάμενον	1	Here, the phrase **the one** refers to God. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “God, who is able”
10:28	w5rq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	Γεέννῃ	1	Here Jesus uses the name **Gehenna** to refer to hell. The valley named **Gehenna** was outside the city of Jerusalem and was a place where people threw out and burned garbage. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a simile or state the meaning plainly. See how you translated this name in [5:22](../05/22.md). Alternate translation: “a place like the valley of Gehenna” or “hell, which is like Gehenna”
10:29	tm3s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	οὐχὶ δύο στρουθία ἀσσαρίου πωλεῖται? καὶ ἓν ἐξ αὐτῶν οὐ πεσεῖται ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν, ἄνευ τοῦ Πατρὸς ὑμῶν	1	Jesus applies what he says here about **sparrows** to his disciples in [10:31](../10/31.md). So, you do not need to include any implied information in this verse.
10:29	glbl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	οὐχὶ δύο στρουθία ἀσσαρίου πωλεῖται?	1	Jesus is using the question form to show the disciples how inexpensive **sparrows** are. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “Two sparrows are sold for an assarion.” or “You know that two sparrows are sold for an assarion!”
10:29	zayd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	οὐχὶ δύο στρουθία ἀσσαρίου πωλεῖται	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “Do people not sell two sparrows for an assarion”
10:29	q22l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	στρουθία	1	The word **sparrows** refers to small, seed-eating birds. If your readers would not know what sparrows are, you could use a general expression instead. Alternate translation: “small birds”
10:29	i399		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney	ἀσσαρίου	1	An **assarion** was a small copper coin equivalent to about half an hour’s wage. You could try to express this amount in terms of current monetary values, but that might cause your Bible translation to become outdated and inaccurate, since those values can change over time. So instead you might state something more general or give the equivalent in wages. Alternate translation: “for a small copper coin” or “for half an hour’s wage”
10:29	wxt4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	ἓν ἐξ αὐτῶν οὐ πεσεῖται ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν, ἄνευ τοῦ Πατρὸς ὑμῶν	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a positive expression to translate this double negative that consists of the negative particle **not** and the negative phrase **apart from**. Alternate translation: “each one of them falls to ground in the presence of your Father”
10:29	id3c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	πεσεῖται ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν	1	Here, the phrase **fall to the ground** refers politely to the sparrow dying. If it would be helpful in your language, you could a form that politely refers to an animal dying, or you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “will pass away” or “will perish”
10:29	us0e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἄνευ τοῦ Πατρὸς ὑμῶν	1	Here, the phrase **apart from your Father** could indicate that something happens: (1) without the Father’s knowledge. Alternate translation: “apart from the knowledge of your Father” (2) without the Father’s will. Alternate translation: “apart from the will of your Father” (3) without the Father’s care or interest. Alternate translation: “apart from the care of your Father”
10:29	fe8z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τοῦ Πατρὸς ὑμῶν	1	This is a figurative expression. God is not the **Father** of humans in the same actual way that he is the Father of Jesus. Even so, it would probably be best to translate **Father** with the same word that your language would naturally use to refer to a human father. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that this means God. Alternate translation: “God, who is your Father,”
10:30	s07o		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1	Here, the word **But** introduces a new but related idea. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different word or phrase that introduces a new but related idea, or you could leave **But** untranslated.

10:30	cih3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ὑμῶν & καὶ αἱ τρίχες τῆς κεφαλῆς πᾶσαι ἠριθμημέναι εἰσίν	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who does the action, it is clear from the context that it is God. Alternate translation: “God has counted even all the hairs on your head”
10:30	jjhh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	ὑμῶν & τῆς κεφαλῆς	1	Here, the word **head** is a singular noun that refers to the “heads” of many people. It may be more natural in your language to use a plural form. Alternate translation: “of your heads” or “of each of your heads”
10:30	xbp2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πᾶσαι ἠριθμημέναι εἰσίν	1	The word **numbered** can also refer to counting. Jesus is not necessarily saying that God has assigned a number to each individual hair on a person’s head. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “have all been counted”
10:31	cwym		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	μὴ & φοβεῖσθε; πολλῶν στρουθίων διαφέρετε ὑμεῖς	1	The implication is that if God is aware of and concerned for **sparrows**, which are of less value, then God is certainly aware of and concerned for people, who are of greater value. And so followers of Jesus do not need to be afraid, since God is watching over them. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “since you are more valuable than many sparrows, God is certainly even more aware of you and concerned for you, and so you do not need to fear”
10:31	ox7a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	στρουθίων	1	Translate this word as you did in [10:29](../10/29.md). Alternate translation: “small birds”
10:32	c1zj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	οὖν	1	Here, the word **Therefore** introduces a conclusion based on what Jesus has said about persecution and following him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a conclusion, or you could leave **Therefore** untranslated. Alternate translation: “In conclusion” or “In the end”
10:32	or3b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὁμολογήσει ἐν ἐμοὶ ἔμπροσθεν τῶν ἀνθρώπων	1	Here Jesus implies that the people **confess** that they follow Jesus.

10:42	rwto		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὃς ἐὰν ποτίσῃ ἕνα τῶν μικρῶν τούτων ποτήριον ψυχροῦ	1	Jesus speaks about giving someone **a cup of cold water to drink** as an example of one small way in which a person can help another person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could indicate that this is an example, or you could use a more general expression. Alternate translation: “whoever, for example, gives to one of these little ones a cup of cold water to drink” or “whoever helps one of these little ones in any way”
10:42	z8tk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἕνα τῶν μικρῶν τούτων	1	Here, Jesus refers to people whom others consider unimportant or insignificant as if they were **little**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase or state the meaning plainly. Alternative translation: “to any person whom people ignore” or “to an insignificant person”
10:42	v6jg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	μόνον εἰς ὄνομα μαθητοῦ	1	See how you translated the phrase **in the name of** in the previous verse. Alternate translation: “with only the knowledge that this person is a disciple” or “simply because this person is a disciple”
10:42	vax1			ἀμὴν, λέγω ὑμῖν	1	Jesus says this to emphasize what he is about to tell his disciples. Use a natural form in your language for emphasizing the truth and importance of a statement. Alternate translation: “I can assure you”
10:42	n58q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes	οὐ μὴ ἀπολέσῃ	1	Jesus is using a figure of speech here that expresses a strongly positive meaning by using a negative phrase, **certainly not**, together with an expression that is the opposite of the intended meaning, **lose**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the positive meaning. Alternate translation: “he will most certainly receive”
10:42	d61l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	οὐ μὴ ἀπολέσῃ & αὐτοῦ	1	Although the term **he** is masculine, Jesus is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a phrase that makes this clear. Alternate translation: “that person will certainly not lose his or her”
10:42	ehq3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	οὐ μὴ	1	The words translated **certainly not** are two negative words. In this construction, the second negative does not cancel the first to create a positive meaning. Instead, it gives greater emphasis to the negative. If your language can use two negatives that do not cancel one another to create a positive meaning, you could use a double negative here. If your language does not use two negatives in that way, you could translate with one strong negative, as the ULT does. Alternate translation: “by no means”
11:intro	puf4				0	# Matthew 11 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n5. Jesus teaches about the gospel of the kingdom of God. Opposition to Jesus begins. (11:1-12:50)\n      * Jesus and John the Baptist (11:1–19)\n        * John asks about who Jesus is (11:1–6)\n        * Jesus teaches about John (11:7–15)\n        * Jesus speaks about himself and John (11:16–19)\n      * Judgment on Galilean cities (11:20–24)\n      * Jesus speaks about his ministry (11:25–30)\n\nSome translations set quotations from the Old Testament farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text. The ULT does this with the quotation from [Malachi 3:1](../mal/03/01.md) in 11:10.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### “Elijah”\n\nIn [11:14](../11/14.md), Jesus says that John the Baptist is “Elijah, the one being about to come.” Here Jesus refers to a prophecy in [Malachi 4:5–6](../mal/04/05.md) that indicates that God will send “Elijah” to prepare the way before God comes to judge his enemies and reward his people. Malachi is referring to a prophet who lived even earlier. This prophet, named Elijah, performed many miracles and spoke messages from God (see [1 Kings 17–19](../1ki/17/01.md) and [2 Kings 2:1–17](../2ki/02/01.md)). So, when Jesus says that John is “Elijah,” he means that John fulfills the prophecy in Malachi that someone like the prophet Elijah will prepare the way before God comes to judge and reward people. If your readers would not know the prophecy in Malachi or the stories about the prophet Elijah, you may need to include some of this information in your translation or in a footnote.\n\n### The day of judgment\n\nIn [11:21–24](../11/21.md), Jesus refers to “the day of judgment.” He says that, on that day, it will be more tolerable for wicked people who lived in cities like Tyre, Sidon, and Sodom than it will be for people who reject Jesus’ ministry in cities like Chorazin, Bethsaida, and Capernaum. The phrase “day of judgment” refers to a specific time in the future when God will judge everyone, punish those who disobey him, and reward those who believe in and obey him. What Jesus means is that even wicked people who lived in cities like Tyre, Sidon, and Sodom will receive less punishment than people who reject him and his message. See the notes on these verses for translation options.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### The comparison with children in [11:16–19](../11/16.md)\n\nIn these verses, Jesus compares how people treat him and John with how children play in the marketplace. There are two primary ways to understand the comparison. First, Jesus and John could be like the children who play flutes or sing funeral songs. In this case, Jesus is saying that people reject both John’s mournful ministry and Jesus’ joyful ministry. Second, the people whom Jesus is speaking about could be like the children who play flutes or sing funeral songs. In this case, Jesus is saying that these people are upset that John and Jesus do not behave as they want them to behave. Since both of these options have similar meanings, and because Jesus does not clearly explain which option he intended, if possible express the comparison in such a way that either interpretation could make sense.\n\n### Jesus rebuking cities in [11:20–24](../11/20.md)\n\nIn these verses, Jesus speaks to specific cities as if they were among the crowds who were listening to him. He speaks in this way to express his attitude towards these cities. Further, when Jesus refers to the cities, he uses their names to refer to the people who live in those cities. So, when Jesus speaks directly to Chorazin, Bethsaida, and Capernaum, he is expressing his attitude toward the people who live in those cities. See the notes on these verses for translation strategies and options.\n\n### The yoke and burden metaphor in [11:28–30](../11/28.md)\n\n\nIn these verses, Jesus promises rest, an easy yoke, and a light burden to those who are laboring and heavy-burdened. There are several ways to understand these images. First, Jesus could be referring to how people struggle and suffer for many reasons, and he promises to make these things better. Second, Jesus could be referring to how people struggle to obey what the religious leaders say to do, and he promises to give them better and easier commands. Third, Jesus could be referring to how people suffer under the Roman empire, and he promises to be a better leader and ruler. Since Jesus is speaking to a crowd of people, most likely he used the images of yokes and burdens so that what he was saying would be relevant to all the people, no matter what they were struggling with. So, if possible preserve the figure of speech or express the idea in a general way that could refer to many different difficult or hard things.\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### The meaning of [11:12](../11/12.md)\n\nThis verse contains two clauses, and both clauses can be interpreted in several ways. First, there are several options for understanding the meaning of the clause “the kingdom of the heavens suffers violence”:\n\n1. the “kingdom” could be what experiences the “violence.” In this case, the violence could come from:\n      * people who hate and attack the kingdom\n      * people who want to make the kingdom stronger by using violence\n2. the “kingdom” could be what performs the “violence.” In this case, the kingdom advances or becomes stronger in forceful and powerful ways.\n\nSecond, there are also several options for understanding the meaning of the clause “violent men take it by force”:\n\n1. the “men” could be evil or wicked. In this case, they could be trying to:\n      * attack and destroy the kingdom\n      * take the kingdom away from Jesus and his disciples\n2. the “men” could be trying to do what is right. In this case, they are trying to become part of the kingdom in forceful or powerful ways.\n\nAlmost any combination of these options is possible for understanding the meaning of the verse. However, the most common interpretations are these:\n\n1. the kingdom experiences violence, and violent people attack it and try to destroy it\n2. the kingdom advances forcefully, and forceful people want to be part of it\n3. the kingdom advances forcefully, but violent people attack it and try to destroy it\n4. violent people want to make the kingdom stronger by violence, and they try to take the kingdom away from Jesus and his disciples\n\nSee the translation notes on this verse for possible ways to express the ideas. Since there are many ways to understand the verse, if possible make your translation general enough to allow for several or all of these interpretations.\n\n### Singular and plural forms of “you”\n\nMost of the forms of “you” in this chapter appear in speeches that Jesus gives to many people around him. Because of this, most forms of “you” in this chapter are plural. You should assume forms of “you” are plural unless a note specifies that the form is singular.

Use the natural form in your language for expressing the conclusion of a story. Alternate translation: “Then Jesus finished giving orders to his 12 disciples. After that, he departed from there to teach and to preach in their cities”
11:1	h5qa		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	μετέβη	1	Here Matthew implies that the **12 disciples** also left that place to do what Jesus had instructed them to do. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “he sent them out, and then he departed”
11:1	md5a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐκεῖθεν	1	Here, the word **there** refers to the place where Jesus was when he gave his disciples the instructions that are quoted in the previous chapter. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “from where he had been”
11:1	dr3u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	τοῦ διδάσκειν καὶ κηρύσσειν	1	The terms **teach** and **preach** mean similar things. Matthew is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “to teach frequently” or “to preach often”
11:1	hhfx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ταῖς πόλεσιν αὐτῶν	1	Here, the word **their** refers to Jewish people in general, particularly those who lived in Galilee.

11:2	f3j7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	ὁ & Ἰωάννης, ἀκούσας ἐν τῷ δεσμωτηρίῳ	1	Matthew has not yet told the story of why **John** was **in prison**. Since Matthew narrates this story in [14:4-5](../14/4.md), you do not need to explain it to your reader here. If it would be helpful in your language, you could clarify that John is **in the prison** when he hears about **the deeds of Christ**. Alternate translation: “John, who was in prison, having heard about”
11:2	zy7z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τὰ ἔργα τοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	Here, Matthew is using the possessive form to describe **deeds** that **Christ** did. If this is not clear in your language, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: “the deeds that Christ had done”
11:2	k1a8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πέμψας διὰ τῶν μαθητῶν αὐτοῦ	1	Here Matthew means that John **sent** his **disciples** to Jesus and had them speak to Jesus for him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “having sent his disciples to speak to Jesus for him”
11:2	q79l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	αὐτοῦ	1	The pronoun **his** refers to John. If this is not clear for your readers, you could refer to him more directly. Alternate translation: “his own”
11:3	isix		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	σὺ	1	Since John’s disciples are talking to Jesus, the word **you** in this verse is singular.
11:3	w2im		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὁ ἐρχόμενος	1	Here, John uses the phrase **the one coming** to refer to a special person whom God promised would come and help God’s people. People sometimes called this special person “the Messiah.” If it would be helpful to your readers, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “the special person whom God said would come” or “the Messiah whom God said would come”
11:3	q89t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ἕτερον προσδοκῶμεν	1	John is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You could supply these words from earlier in the sentence if it would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “should we expect another person to be the coming one”
11:4	w03k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	ἀποκριθεὶς ὁ Ἰησοῦς εἶπεν	1	Together the words **answering** and **said** mean that Jesus responded to the question that John’s disciples had asked him. Consider natural ways of introducing direct quotations in your language. Alternate translation: “Jesus responded”
11:5	dyxy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τυφλοὶ ἀναβλέπουσιν, καὶ χωλοὶ περιπατοῦσιν, λεπροὶ καθαρίζονται, καὶ κωφοὶ ἀκούουσιν, καὶ νεκροὶ ἐγείρονται, καὶ πτωχοὶ εὐαγγελίζονται	1	When he answers John’s disciples, Jesus lists many things that he has done. John’s disciples would have known that this list is similar to the lists found in [Isaiah 35:5–6](../isa/35/05.md) and [Isaiah 61:1](../isa/61/01.md) that describe what will happen when God acts to help his people. Jesus does not directly quote either of these lists, but he wants John’s disciples to know that what he has done is what God promised would happen when the Messiah came. If it would be helpful in your language, you could include a footnote that refers to the lists in Isaiah, or you could include a small amount of explanatory information. Alternate translation: “Just as God promised, the blind are seeing again, and the lame walk, lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, and the dead are raised, and the poor are being told the gospel”
11:5	tjuc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	τυφλοὶ & χωλοὶ & κωφοὶ & νεκροὶ & πτωχοὶ	1	Jesus is using the adjectives **blind**, **lame**, **deaf**, **dead**, and **poor** as nouns in order to describe groups of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate these words with equivalent phrases. Alternate translation: “Blind people … lame people … deaf people … dead people … poor people”

Alternate translation: “lepers become clean … the dead come back to life, and the poor hear the gospel”
11:5	gnt2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	λεπροὶ καθαρίζονται	1	Here, much as in [10:8](../10/08.md), Jesus speaks of ceremonially cleansing lepers, but he implies that the lepers are healed of their skin diseases, since these are what make lepers unclean. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “lepers are healed from their unclean diseases”
11:5	v274		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	νεκροὶ ἐγείρονται	1	Here, the phrase **the dead are raised** refers to people who have died becoming alive again. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the dead live again”\n

11:6	yyuo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes	μὴ σκανδαλισθῇ ἐν ἐμοί	1	Jesus is using a figure of speech here that expresses a strongly positive meaning by using a negative word, **not**, together with an expression that is the opposite of the intended meaning, **offended**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the positive meaning. Alternate translation: “who continues to trust me”
11:7	vt51		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1	Here, the word **Now** introduces the next event in the story. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces the next event, or you could leave **Now** untranslated. Alternate translation: “Then,”

11:7	ysq6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τί ἐξήλθατε εἰς τὴν ἔρημον θεάσασθαι? κάλαμον ὑπὸ ἀνέμου σαλευόμενον?	1	Jesus is using the question form to teach the crowds about John. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate these questions as statements or exclamations. Alternate translation: “Surely you did not go out into the wilderness to see a reed shaken by the wind!” or “I know what you went out into the wilderness to see. It was not a reed shaken by the wind.”
11:7	f3f1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τί ἐξήλθατε εἰς τὴν ἔρημον θεάσασθαι	1	Here Jesus implies that the people went out to see and hear John the Baptist. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “When you visited John in the wilderness, what did you go out to see”
11:7	ydn2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	κάλαμον ὑπὸ ἀνέμου σαλευόμενον	1	Here, the phrase **a reed being shaken by the wind** could describe: (1) a person who changes his or her mind or message whenever there is any trouble or difficulty, just like a **reed** moves whenever the **wind** blows. Alternate translation: “a man who changes his message whenever it is convenient” or “a man who changes his mind as easily as a reed is shaken by the wind” (2) something or someone ordinary, just like **a reed being shaken by the wind** was a common or normal sight in Matthew’s culture. Alternate translation: “something ordinary, like a reed being shaken by the wind”
11:7	w269		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	κάλαμον ὑπὸ ἀνέμου σαλευόμενον	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “a reed that the wind shakes”
11:8	fn2f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	ἀλλὰ	1	Here, the word **But** introduces a contrast with the possibility that Jesus asked about in the previous verse. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces this kind of contrast, or you could leave **But** untranslated. Alternate translation: “If not that,” or “So,”

If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate these questions as statements or exclamations. Alternate translation: “Surely you did not go out to see a man dressed in soft clothing!” or “I know what you went out to see. It was not a man dressed in soft clothing.”
11:8	y24r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἄνθρωπον ἐν μαλακοῖς ἠμφιεσμένον	1	Luke assumes that readers will know that John wore crude, rugged clothing. Like his residence in the desert, his clothing was a symbolic protest against the established order. As such, it would have been offensive rather than attractive. So no one would have gone out just to see a person dressed that way. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “A man wearing splendid clothing? You would not have gone to hear John if that was what you wanted to see.”
11:8	nrdy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐν & ἠμφιεσμένον	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “who had put on”
11:8	by2l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	μαλακοῖς & τὰ μαλακὰ	1	The term **soft clothing** refers to luxurious or expensive clothes, since normal clothing was rough.

11:8	n2k6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	ἰδοὺ	1	Here, the word **behold** draws the attention of the audience and asks them to listen carefully. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express **behold** with a word or phrase that asks the audience to listen, or you could draw the audience’s attention in another way. Alternate translation: “Listen” or “As you know”
11:9	msgi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	ἀλλὰ	1	Here, much as in [11:8](../11/08.md), the word **But** introduces a contrast with the possibility that Jesus asked about in the previous verse. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces this kind of contrast, or you could leave **But** untranslated. Alternate translation: “If not that,” or “So,”
11:9	gm97		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	ἀλλὰ τί ἐξήλθατε? προφήτην ἰδεῖν	1	Jesus is using the question form to teach the crowds about John.

Alternate translation: “Surely you went out to see a prophet!” or “I know why you went out. It was to see a prophet.”
11:9	iytz			λέγω ὑμῖν	1	Jesus uses the clause **I say to you** this to emphasize what he is telling the crowds. Use a natural form in your language for emphasizing the truth and importance of a statement. Alternate translation: “I want you to know”
11:9	fb75		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	καὶ περισσότερον	1	Jesus is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete. If it would be helpful in your language, you could supply these words from the context. Alternate translation: “and he was more than”
11:9	rp94		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	περισσότερον προφήτου	1	Here Jesus means that John was indeed a prophet, but that he was even **more** than a typical prophet. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “not just an ordinary prophet” or “greater than the other prophets”
11:10	ttv5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	οὗτός	1	The pronoun **This** refers to John the Baptist. If this is not clear for your readers, you could use the person's name here. Alternate translation: “John”
11:10	ts9k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	γέγραπται	1	In Matthew’s culture, **it is written** was a normal way to introduce a quotation from an important text, in this case, the book of Malachi (see [Malachi 3:1](../mal/03/01.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase that indicates that Jesus is quoting from an important text. Alternate translation: “you can read in the Scriptures” or “it says in the book of Malachi”
11:10	de17		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	γέγραπται	1	If your language does not use the passive form, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “Malachi wrote in the Scriptures”
11:10	jc00		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	ἰδοὺ	1	Here, the word **Behold** draws the attention of the audience and asks them to listen carefully. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express **Behold** with a word or phrase that asks the audience to listen, or you could draw the audience’s attention in another way. Alternate translation: “See” or “Pay attention”
11:10	fi5e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	πρὸ προσώπου σου	1	Here, the phrase **before your face** means before or in front of the person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “in front of you” or “before I send you”
11:10	mzmx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	σου	-1	Here, the words **your**, **your**, and **you** are singular because God is speaking to the Messiah individually in this quotation.
11:10	kva7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	κατασκευάσει τὴν ὁδόν σου ἔμπροσθέν σου	1	Here the author of the quotation speaks of helping people to get ready for the coming of the Messiah as if it were preparing the **way** or road for the Messiah. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable figure of speech or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “will help people get ready for you to arrive”
11:11	tv07			ἀμὴν, λέγω ὑμῖν	1	Jesus says this to emphasize what he is about to tell his disciples. Use a natural form in your language for emphasizing the truth and importance of a statement. Alternate translation: “I can assure you”
11:11	z5yq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐν γεννητοῖς γυναικῶν	1	The phrase **those born of women** refers to all people who have lived.

11:11	r9ws		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐν γεννητοῖς γυναικῶν	1	If you would like to retain the idiom but your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “among those whom women have borne”
11:11	c093		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes	οὐκ ἐγήγερται & μείζων	1	Jesus is using a figure of speech here that expresses a strongly positive meaning by using a negative word, **not**, together with an expression that is the opposite of the intended meaning, **greater**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the positive meaning. Alternate translation: “there have only arisen ones lesser than”
11:11	jm5o		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	οὐκ ἐγήγερται	1	Here Jesus speaks of people having lived as if they had **arisen**, or stood up. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “there has not existed” or “there has not lived”
11:11	cag4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	ὁ & μικρότερος	1	Matthew is using the adjective **least** as a noun to mean people who are not very important. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this phrase with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “the least important person”
11:11	pxbl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	μείζων αὐτοῦ ἐστιν	1	The implication is that being part of **the kingdom of the heavens** is greater than any human distinctive. So anyone who is part of **the kingdom** is greater than even John, whom Jesus said was the greatest person who had ever lived before the coming of **the kingdom**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “is greater than John is because he or she is part of something greater than anything that is human”
11:12	c2qi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1	Here, based on how this verse is interpreted (see the following notes and the chapter introduction) the word **But** could introduce: (1) a contrast with what Jesus said in the previous verse about how great the kingdom of the heavens is. In contrast with that, the **kingdom of the heavens** is attacked violently. Alternate translation: “However,” (2) a development of what Jesus said in the previous verse about how great the kingdom of the heavens is. The kingdom advances and grows forcefully. Alternate translation: “Now”
11:12	mb4v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	τῶν ἡμερῶν	1	Here, the word **days** refers to a specific period of time. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the time period”
11:12	ynqo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	Ἰωάννου τοῦ Βαπτιστοῦ	1	Here, Jesus is using the possessive form to describe **days** in which **John the Baptist** preached.

11:12	o81e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	ἡ Βασιλεία τῶν Οὐρανῶν βιάζεται, καὶ βιασταὶ ἁρπάζουσιν αὐτήν	1	If you understand these two clauses to say similar things (see the following notes and the chapter introduction), then the second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could connect the clauses with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: “the kingdom of the heavens suffers violence; yes, violent men take it by force”
11:12	inr2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἡ Βασιλεία τῶν Οὐρανῶν βιάζεται	1	Christians disagree about what exactly this clause means. See the chapter introduction for more information and options. Most likely, the clause could mean: (1) that people attack God’s kingdom. Alternate translation: “the kingdom of the heavens is attacked violently” (2) that God’s kingdom triumphs forcefully in the world. Alternate translation: “the kingdom of the heavens triumphs forcefully”

11:12	rjlg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	βιασταὶ ἁρπάζουσιν αὐτήν	1	Christians disagree about what exactly this clause means. See the chapter introduction for more information and options. Most likely, the clause could mean: (1) that the **men** are evil and **violent** and attack the kingdom. Alternate translation: “violent men attack it forcefully” (2) that the **men** are forceful and want to be part of the kingdom. Alternate translation: “forceful men take hold of it”
11:12	viv4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	βιασταὶ	1	Although the term **men** is masculine, Jesus is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a phrase that makes this clear. Alternate translation: “violent men and women”
11:12	ce88		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἁρπάζουσιν αὐτήν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **force**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “take it forcefully”
11:13	xfx5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1	Here, the word **For** introduces a further explanation of how John is an important or significant person. As the last verse showed, the kingdom of the heavens has “suffered violence” since John began his ministry, and this verse shows that **the Prophets** and **the Law** prophesied about these things up to the time when John began his ministry. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that a further explanation, or you could leave **For** untranslated. Alternate translation: “Indeed,” or “In fact,”
11:13	g1i6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	πάντες & οἱ προφῆται καὶ ὁ νόμος & ἐπροφήτευσαν	1	Here Jesus speaks as if **the Prophets** and **the Law** were people who **have prophesied**. He means that these sections of Scripture contain prophecies. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly.

11:13	r95f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	οἱ προφῆται καὶ ὁ νόμος	1	Jesus is referring to all of God’s word that had been written up to that time. He is using the names of two of its major components to do so. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the Scriptures”
11:13	s8h8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἕως Ἰωάννου ἐπροφήτευσαν	1	Here Jesus implies that the Scriptures includes prophecies about the kingdom of the heavens, Jesus’ ministry, and all the things that were happening once John and then Jesus began their ministries. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. If possible, use a general phrase that could refer to many of these events and actions. Alternate translation: “have prophesied until John about what has begun to happen”
11:13	s5ij		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἕως Ἰωάννου	1	Here Jesus could mean that: (1) **the Prophets and the Law** contain prophecies written down only **until John** began his ministry. Alternate translation: “up to when John began his ministry” (2) what **the Prophets and the Law** prophesied was a prediction about the future only **until John** began his ministry.

11:14	rdsw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	δέξασθαι, αὐτός	1	Here Jesus leaves out what will happen if the people are **willing to accept {it}**.

11:14	yg2f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	δέξασθαι	1	Here Jesus could be implying that they need to be willing to **accept**: (1) what Jesus says about John. Alternate translation: “to accept what I tell you” (2) what the Law and the Prophets prophesied (see [11:13](../11/13.md)). Alternate translation: “to accept what the Law and the Prophets said”
11:14	fj3y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	αὐτός ἐστιν Ἠλείας, ὁ μέλλων ἔρχεσθαι	1	Here Jesus is referring to a prophecy in [Malachi 4:5–6](../mal/04/05.md). This prophecy states that God will send **Elijah** before the day of the Lord arrives, and he will prepare people. **Elijah** was a prophet who did many powerful things a long time before Malachi wrote down this prophecy. What Jesus implies is that John the Baptist fulfills this prophecy, and so he is like **Elijah**, just as Malachi prophesied. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “he is the person about whom it is prophesied that someone like Elijah would come” or “he is the one being about to come, whom the prophets named Elijah”
11:14	kb67		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	αὐτός	1	The pronoun **he** refers to John the Baptist. If this is not clear for your readers, you could use the person's name here. Alternate translation: “John the Baptist”

If it would be helpful in your language, you could use the second person plural here. Alternate translation: “You who have ears to hear should hear” or “If you have ears to hear, then hear”
11:15	r1do		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative3p	ἀκουέτω	1	If your language does not use the third-person imperative in this way, you could state this in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “he should hear”
11:15	zt7p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	ἀκουέτω	1	Although the term **him** is masculine, Jesus is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a phrase that makes this clear. Alternate translation: “let that person hear”
11:16	hkq0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1	Here, the word **Now** introduces the next topic. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces the next topic, or you could leave **Now** untranslated. Alternate translation: “Next,”

11:16	zjr3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	ὁμοία ἐστὶν	1	These words are the beginning of Jesus’ comparison. His opponents complain about John being too austere, and they complain about Jesus not being austere enough, just like children who complain when other children don’t dance with them, and then complain again when they don’t cry with them. Since Jesus explains this comparison in the following verses, you do not need to explain it here in your translation.
11:16	l7km		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ταῖς ἀγοραῖς	1	A **marketplace** is a large, open-air area where people buy and sell goods. If your readers would not be familiar with this type of area, you could use the name of something similar in your area or you could use a more general term. Alternate translation: “the town square” or “the park”

11:17	t723		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	καὶ	-1	In both places, the children are expressing a contrast between what they expected their playmates to do and what those playmates actually did.

11:18	qe7y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	μήτε ἐσθίων μήτε πίνων	1	This does not mean that John never ate food.

Alternate translation: “frequently fasting” or “neither eating good food nor drinking wine”
11:18	ya2w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	λέγουσιν	1	The pronoun **they** refers to people in general. If this is not clear for your readers, you could use a form that refers to people in general. Alternate translation: “many say” or “others say”

11:18	evok		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	δαιμόνιον ἔχει	1	To say that someone **has a demon** is to say that the demon possesses or controls that person.

11:19	iwk8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	ὁ Υἱὸς τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου	1	Here Jesus speaks about himself in the third person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use the first person. Alternate translation: “I, who am the Son of Man,”
11:19	dsak		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὁ Υἱὸς τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου	1	The title **Son of Man** is equivalent to “Messiah.” Jesus uses the phrase to claim that role subtly and implicitly. You may want to translate this title directly into your language. On the other hand, if you think it would be helpful to your readers, you could state what it means. Alternate translation: “The Messiah”\n
11:19	bvon		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἦλθεν	1	Here, the word **came** refers to Jesus entering this world as a human to do what God called him to do.

Alternate translation: “they say that he is a man who is a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!”
11:19	ddxi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	ἰδοὺ	1	Here, the word **behold** draws the attention of the audience and asks them to listen carefully. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express **behold** with a word or phrase that asks the audience to listen, or you could draw the audience’s attention in another way. Alternate translation: “This is” or “Observe”
11:19	pv4n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	φάγος καὶ οἰνοπότης	1	The word **glutton** refers to a person who eats too much food. The word **drunkard** refers to a person who drinks too much wine and gets drunk as a result. If you do not have words for these kinds of people, you could use descriptive phrases.

11:19	ml8t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	ἐδικαιώθη ἡ σοφία ἀπὸ τῶν τέκνων αὐτῆς	1	Here Jesus speaks as if **wisdom** were a woman who had **children**. The **children** could be: (1) people who are wise. Alternate translation: “wisdom has been justified by wise people” (2) the **children** could be the results of wise behavior. Alternate translation: “wisdom has been justified by its results”
11:19	yyk4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐδικαιώθη ἡ σοφία ἀπὸ τῶν τέκνων αὐτῆς	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **wisdom**, you could express the same idea in another way. Make sure your translation fits with how you chose to translate **children** (see the previous note). Here, the word **wisdom** could refer to: (1) wise behavior and thinking. Alternate translation: “what is wise has been justified by wise people” (2) how God is wise. Alternate translation: “how wise God is has been justified by wise people”
11:19	o3zh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐδικαιώθη ἡ σοφία ἀπὸ τῶν τέκνων αὐτῆς	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “wisdom’s children justify her”

11:20	w12g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential	τότε	1	Here, the word **Then** introduces what happened after Jesus finished saying what Matthew has included in the previous verses.

Alternate translation: “Then, because the cities in which most of his miracles were done had not repented, he began to rebuke them”
11:20	w4g8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τὰς πόλεις	1	Here, **the cities** refers to the people who live in the cities. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “the people of the cities”
11:20	t51a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐγένοντο αἱ πλεῖσται δυνάμεις αὐτοῦ	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

He is doing this to show his listeners in a strong way how he feels about those cities. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate these words as if he were speaking directly to people about these cities. Alternate translation: “There will be woe for Chorazin! There will be woe for Bethsaida! … those cities”\n
11:21	y2hr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	οὐαί σοι	-1	The phrase **woe to you** is the opposite of “blessed are you.” It indicates that bad things are going to happen to the people being addressed, because they have displeased God.

If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “God destroyed the cities of Tyre and Sidon because they were so wicked. But even they would have repented if they had seen the miracles which happened in you. So the people of Chorazin and Bethsaida certainly should have repented as well”
11:21	lh46		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical	εἰ ἐν Τύρῳ καὶ Σιδῶνι ἐγένοντο αἱ δυνάμεις αἱ γενόμεναι ἐν ὑμῖν, πάλαι ἂν ἐν σάκκῳ καὶ σποδῷ μετενόησαν	1	Here Jesus is describing a situation that might have happened in the past but actually did not. He is doing this to express disappointment and regret about what is happening in the present. Be sure to translate this in such a way that your readers will know that this event actually did not happen but they will understand why Jesus is imagining it. Alternate translation: “suppose that the miracles had happened in Tyre and Sidon which happened in you. They would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes”
11:21	k3in		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual	ὑμῖν	1	Since Jesus is addressing two cities, **you** would be dual here if your language uses that form. Otherwise, it would be plural.
11:21	tm59		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	πάλαι ἂν ἐν σάκκῳ καὶ σποδῷ μετενόησαν	1	Jesus is saying that the people of Tyre and Sidon would have worn **sackcloth** and put **ashes** on their heads. These actions are signs of humility and sorrow that show that they were very sorry for doing what was wrong. If this would not be clear to your readers, you could explain the significance of these actions in the text or in a footnote. Alternate translation: “they would have shown how sorry they were for their sins by wearing sackcloth and putting ashes on their heads”
11:22	ewcx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	πλὴν	1	Here, the word **Nevertheless** introduces a contrast with how people might think about the wicked people of **Tyre** and **Sidon**.

11:22	g4mo			λέγω ὑμῖν & ἔσται	1	Jesus uses the clause **I say to you** to emphasize what he is about to say. Use a natural form in your language for emphasizing the truth and importance of a statement. Alternate translation: “I want you to know that it will be”
11:22	ibpo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	Τύρῳ καὶ Σιδῶνι ἀνεκτότερον ἔσται ἐν ἡμέρᾳ κρίσεως ἢ ὑμῖν	1	Jesus assumes that his audience will know that God destroyed the cities of Tyre and Sidon because the people in them were so wicked. The implication is that it must therefore be an extremely grave offense to reject the messengers of the kingdom of God. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “God will judge you more severely than he will judge the people who lived in Tyre and Sidon, even though he destroyed their cities because they were so wicked”
11:22	mr18		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	Τύρῳ καὶ Σιδῶνι	1	Here, the words **Tyre and Sidon** refer to the people who live in those cities. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “for the people of Tyre and Sidon”
11:22	ngkm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	ἐν ἡμέρᾳ κρίσεως	1	Here, Jesus is using the possessive form to describe a **day** on which **judgment** will happen. If this is not clear in your language, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: “on the day when God judges everyone”
11:22	i16e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	κρίσεως	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **judgment**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “when people are judged”

He is doing this to show his listeners in a strong way how he feels about that city. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate these words as if he were speaking directly to people about these cities. Alternate translation: “And Capernaum will not be exalted to heaven, will it? It will god down to Hades. For if the miracles that happened in it had happened in Sodom, Sodom would have remained until today”
11:23	nddz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	σύ, Καφαρναούμ, μὴ ἕως οὐρανοῦ ὑψωθήσῃ?	1	Jesus uses a rhetorical question to rebuke the people of Capernaum for their pride, because they think that they will be **exalted to heaven**.

12:intro	y7z6				0	# Matthew 12 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n5. Jesus teaches about the gospel of the kingdom of God. Opposition to Jesus begins. (11:1-12:50)\n      * Arguments with the Pharisees about the Sabbath (12:1–14)\n        * Picking heads of grain on the Sabbath (12:1–8)\n        * Healing a man on the Sabbath (12:9–14)\n      * Jesus fulfills a quotation from Isaiah (12:15–21)\n      * Argument with the Pharisees about casting out demons (12:22–30)\n      * Jesus teaches on words and God’s judgment (12:31–37)\n      * Jesus condemns “this generation” (12:38–45)\n      * Jesus’ true family (12:46–50)\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in [12:18–21](../12/18.md), which is a quotation from [Isaiah 42:1–4](../isa/42/01.md).\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### The Sabbath\n\nIn the law that God gave to Moses, God commanded the Israelites to rest on the seventh day, which was called the Sabbath. The Jewish religious leaders disagreed with each other about what kinds of things a person could do on the Sabbath and still rest as God had commanded. For example, they debated which emergencies were serious enough that someone could do work on the Sabbath without disobeying God’s command. In [12:1–14](../12/01.md), the Pharisees and Jesus engage in these kinds of debates about the Sabbath. Jesus disagrees with how the Pharisees understand the Sabbath, and he argues for a different view. If your readers may not understand what the Sabbath is and why Jesus and the Pharisees are debating about it, you may need to include some information in a footnote. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sabbath]])\n\n### Casting out demons\n\nDemons are evil spiritual beings who can control people and who serve Satan. They usually use the people they control to hurt themselves or others. In [12:22](../12/22.md), Matthew briefly describes how Jesus drove out a demon who caused the man it controlled to be blind and mute, that is, unable to see or speak. In response, the crowds wonder whether Jesus is the special “Son of David.” However, the Pharisees accuse Jesus of using the power of Beelzebul, that is, Satan, to cast out demons. Jesus tells them that it does not make sense for Satan, who rules the demons, to empower someone to cast out demons.\n\n### “Blasphemy against the Spirit”\n\nIn [12:31–32](../12/31.md), Jesus speaks about “blasphemy of the Spirit” and speaking “against the Holy Spirit.” He indicates that God will forgive all kinds of sins, including speaking against Jesus himself. However, God will not forgive people who speak against the Holy Spirit. Jesus says these things because the Pharisees said that he cast out demons by the power of Beelzebul. Jesus implies that he actually cast out demons by the power of the Holy Spirit. So, since the Pharisees have called the Holy Spirit Beelzebul, they have blasphemed or spoken against the Spirit. Christians debate what counts as this kind of blasphemy and why God will not forgive people for it. In your translation, you should express the idea as generally as Jesus does. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/blasphemy]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/holyspirit]])\n\n### The sign of Jonah\n\nIn [12:39–41](../12/39.md), Jesus refers to a story about a prophet named Jonah. God told Jonah to prophesy in the city of Nineveh that God would destroy it. Jonah instead got on a boat to go the opposite direction. God sent a bad storm on the ocean, and to stop the storm Jonah had the sailors throw him into the ocean. God then had a huge fish swallow Jonah. He was inside the fish for three days and three nights, and then the fish spit Jonah out near the city of Nineveh. Jonah then did prophesy in the city of Nineveh, and the people there repented and asked God for mercy. In response, God chose not to destroy the city. You can read this story in [Jonah 1–4](../jon/01/01.md). When Jesus refers to “the sign of Jonah,” he is speaking about this story, particularly about how Jonah was in the fish for three days and nights. Jesus indicates that he will be in his tomb for three days, just as Jonah was in the fish for three days.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### The parable about the strong man\n\nIn [12:29](../12/29.md), Jesus describes how thieves must subdue and tie up a strong man before they can steal things from his house. Jesus does not directly state how to apply this proverb. However, most Christians think that Satan is like the strong man, and the demons that Jesus casts out are like the strong man’s things. In this case, Jesus is like the thieves who tie up the strong man. Jesus is saying that, since he can cast out demons, it proves that he has subdued and conquered Satan, just as thieves can only steal things after they have subdued the strong man. You should not include this extra information in your translation, but if it would be helpful for your readers, you could include it in a footnote. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])\n\n### Demons living in people as if they were houses\n\nIn [12:43–45](../12/43.md), Jesus tells a story that describes people as if they were houses that demons could live in. When a demon is living in someone, this means that the demon is controlling that person. If possible, preserve this metaphor. If it is necessary, you could use simile form or state the meaning more plainly. See the notes on this verse for translation options. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n### Jesus’ mother and brothers\n\nIn [12:46–50](../12/46.md), Jesus’ mother and brothers arrive and want to talk with Jesus. In response, Jesus says that his disciples, those who do God’s will, are his mother and brothers and sisters. In other words, Jesus calls his disciples, who are those who do God’s will, his family members. He means that they are as close and important to him as his own family. This is an important metaphor that appears throughout the Bible, so preserve the metaphor or express the idea in simile form. See the notes on these verses for translation options. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Singular and plural forms of “you”\n\nMost of the forms of “you” in this chapter appear in speeches that Jesus gives to many people around him. Because of this, most forms of “you” in this chapter are plural. You should assume forms of “you” are plural unless a note specifies that the form is singular. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])\n\n### The quotation from [Isaiah 42:1–4](../isa/42/01.md) in [12:18–21](../12/18.md)\n\nMatthew quotes a long section of Isaiah in this chapter. However, he does not quote every line, specifically leaving out parts of [Isaiah 42:4](../isa/42/04.md). Also, in many places his quotation does not directly match the Hebrew version of Isaiah. However, since Matthew quotes these verses for a specific reason and in a different language (Greek), you should translate what Matthew wrote, not what you might find in [Isaiah 42:1–4](../isa/42/01.md).
12:1	m2n1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	ἐν ἐκείνῳ τῷ καιρῷ	1	The phrase **At that time** introduces a new event that happened some time after the events the story has just related.

12:1	rgpc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	δὲ	1	Here, the word **but** introduces a contrast with how people were expected to behave **on the Sabbaths**, which included not picking grain or other crops.

12:3-4	d712		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	οὐκ ἀνέγνωτε τί ἐποίησεν Δαυεὶδ, ὅτε ἐπείνασεν καὶ οἱ μετ’ αὐτοῦ & πῶς εἰσῆλθεν εἰς τὸν οἶκον τοῦ Θεοῦ, καὶ τοὺς ἄρτους τῆς Προθέσεως ἔφαγεν, ὃ οὐκ ἐξὸν ἦν αὐτῷ φαγεῖν, οὐδὲ τοῖς μετ’ αὐτοῦ, εἰ μὴ τοῖς ἱερεῦσιν μόνοις?	1	Jesus is using the question form to show the Pharisees that they should have learned a principle from the story about **David** that indicates that they are wrong to criticize the disciples. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “You have not understood what you have read about what David did when he was hungry, and the ones with him—how he went into the house of God and ate the bread of the Presence, which was not lawful for him to eat nor for the ones with him, except only for the priests.”

The current king, Saul was trying to kill David. So, David ran away to the priest who was serving God at the time. David and the men who ran away with him were very hungry, so they asked the priest for food. The priest gave them the special bread that was laid out in God’s presence every day, and David and his men ate this bread. You can read this story in [1 Samuel 21:1–6](../1sa/21/01.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could include some extra information in your translation or in a footnote. Alternate translation: “Have you not read what David did when he was hungry after he escaped from King Saul, who wanted to kill him? He and the ones with him visited the priest, went into the house of God, and ate the bread of the Presence, which was not lawful for him to eat nor for the ones with him, except only for the priests.”

If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “Again, you have not understood what you have read in the law about how on the Sabbaths the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath, but are innocent.”
12:5	bkjv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	ἢ	1	Here, the word **Or** introduces a second example from the Scriptures that Jesus uses to prove his point.

12:5	i9ys		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀναίτιοί εἰσιν	1	Here Jesus means that, although the priests do work on the Sabbath, the law does not condemn them, since doing priestly work on the Sabbath is an exception to the Sabbath requirements. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “are innocent, since God permits this kind of work on the Sabbaths”
12:6	b6i0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	δὲ	1	Here, the word **But** introduces a slight contrast with what Jesus has said about how serving in **the temple** is an exception to keeping the Sabbath.

He has concluded that the Pharisee have not understood this quotation, because they have indeed **condemned the innocent**. Use a natural form in your language for introducing a condition that the speaker believes is not true.

12:7	pp9n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	τί ἐστιν	1	Here Jesus means that they should learn what the passage he is about to quote means. See how you translated this phrase in [9:13](../09/13.md). Alternate translation: “what this means” or “the meaning of this passage”

12:7	s23l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	τοὺς ἀναιτίους	1	Jesus is using the adjective **innocent** as a noun in order to describe his disciples.

12:8	nca0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὁ Υἱὸς τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου	1	The title **Son of Man** is equivalent to “Messiah.” Jesus uses the phrase to claim that role subtly and implicitly.

12:10	xb13		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	χεῖρα ἔχων ξηράν	1	This means that the man’s hand was damaged in such a way that he could not stretch it out.

12:19	gj1p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τὴν φωνὴν αὐτοῦ	1	Here, **his voice** represents him speaking. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your language or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “him talking”
12:19	jr87		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐν ταῖς πλατείαις	1	In Jesus’ culture, **the streets** were public, noisy places. The author of the quotation uses the phrase **the streets** as an example of any public, noisy place. If it would be helpful in your language, you could refer a similar place in your culture. Alternate translation: “in the public square” or “in noisy places where there are many people”
12:20	kbu9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	κάλαμον συντετριμμένον οὐ κατεάξει, καὶ λίνον τυφόμενον οὐ σβέσει	1	These two clauses mean basically the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if it would be helpful to your readers, you could connect the phrases with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: “He will not break a bruised reed; yes, he will not quench a smoking flax”
12:20	cdk2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	κάλαμον συντετριμμένον οὐ κατεάξει	1	Here the author of the quotation speaks of weak or suffering people as if they were **a bruised** or damaged **reed**. He means that Jesus will not ignore or hurt these people. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in simile form or use plain language. Alternate translation: “He will not hurt suffering people, which would be like breaking a bruised reed” or “He will not hurt suffering people”
12:20	p3f4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	λίνον τυφόμενον οὐ σβέσει	1	Here the author of the quotation speaks of weak or suffering people as if they were **a smoking flax**. He means that Jesus will not ignore or hurt these people. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in simile form or use plain language. Alternate translation: “He will not ignore injured people, which would be like quenching a smoking flax” or “He will not ignore injured people”
12:20	y8mn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	λίνον τυφόμενον	1	A **flax** is a piece of cloth or thread made out parts of the flax plant. People in the author’s culture would use these pieces of cloth or thread as lamp wicks. If the **flax** was **smoking**, it was not burning properly and would normally be thrown away and replaced. If your readers would not be familiar with this type of cloth and its use, you could use the name of something similar in your area or you could use a more general term. Alternate translation: “a smoldering wick” or “a lamp that is barely burning”
12:20	sqy4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential	ἕως	1	Here, the word **until** indicates that the servant will continue to act as this verse describes up to the time when the goal of **justice** is accomplished.

12:20	iytt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐκβάλῃ & τὴν κρίσιν	1	Here, the phrase **casts out** indicates that the servant is producing **justice** or causing **justice** to happen.

12:20	gqb2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	εἰς νῖκος	1	Here, the phrase **to victory** could mean that **justice**: (1) is accomplished successfully. Alternate translation: “successfully” or “completely” (2) lasts forever. Alternate translation: “forever”
12:20	b6tw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐκβάλῃ εἰς νῖκος τὴν κρίσιν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the ideas of **justice** or **victory**, you could express the same ideas in another way. Make sure that your translation fits with the choices you made in the previous two notes. Alternate translation: “he successfully accomplishes what is just” or “he makes everything just forever”
12:21	voi4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τῷ ὀνόματι αὐτοῦ ἔθνη ἐλπιοῦσιν	1	Here the author of the quotation implies that the **Gentiles will hope** for the servant to help or save them.

12:22	nba2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	τότε	1	The word **Then** introduces a new event that happened some time after the events the story has just related. The story does not say how long after those events this new event happened. Use the natural form in your language for introducing a new event. Alternate translation: “Some time later,”
12:22	vilg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	προσηνέχθη αὐτῷ δαιμονιζόμενος, τυφλὸς καὶ κωφός	1	Matthew is using the phrase **one being demon-possessed** to introduce this man as a new participant in the story. If your language has its own way of introducing new participants, you could use it here in your translation. Alternate translation: “a person was brought to Jesus. He was demon-possessed, blind, and mute”
12:22	f54d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	προσηνέχθη αὐτῷ δαιμονιζόμενος, τυφλὸς καὶ κωφός	1	Here Matthew implies that the demon made the man **blind and mute**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “one being possessed by a demon that made him blind and mute was brought to Jesus”
12:22	e1g4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	προσηνέχθη αὐτῷ δαιμονιζόμενος	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who did the action, you could use an indefinite subject. Alternate translation: “they brought to him one being demon-possessed”
12:22	osqr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	δαιμονιζόμενος	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “one whom a demon had possessed”\n
12:22	k2vt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τυφλὸς καὶ κωφός	1	A **mute** person is a person who cannot speak, and a **blind** person is a person who cannot see. If your readers would not be familiar with these types of disorders or illnesses, you could use the names of similar things in your area or you could use more general terms. Alternate translation: “who was unable to talk or see things”
12:22	fpxp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐθεράπευσεν αὐτόν	1	Here Matthew implies that Jesus **healed** the man in every, which would include casting out the demon. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “he cast out the demon and healed him”
12:22	aewk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὸν κωφὸν	1	Here Matthew uses the phrase **the mute one** to indicate that the man had been **mute**, and also **blind**, before Jesus healed him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could indicate that this phrase describes what the man was like before Jesus healed him, or you could refer back to the man in a different way. Alternate translation: “the man who had been mute and blind” or “he”
12:23	m743		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐξίσταντο	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “marveled”

If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation.

12:23	h8kf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ὁ υἱὸς Δαυείδ	1	Here, the word **Son** means a male descendant. It does not mean that Jesus was the direct son of David. Express the idea as you did in [9:27](../09/27.md). Alternate translation: “Descendant of David” or “you who are descended from David”
12:23	ink7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ὁ υἱὸς Δαυείδ	1	**David** was Israel’s most important king, and God had promised him that one of his descendants would be the Messiah. So the title **Son of David** could implicitly mean “Messiah.” Express the idea as you did in [9:27](../09/27.md). Alternate translation: “Son of David, Messiah”
12:24	jibk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀκούσαντες	1	Here Matthew implies that Pharisees heard what the crowds were asking about Jesus (see [12:23](../12/23.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “having heard what the crowds were asking”
12:24	p1mi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-exceptions	οὗτος οὐκ ἐκβάλλει τὰ δαιμόνια, εἰ μὴ ἐν τῷ Βεελζεβοὺλ	1	If, in your language, it would appear that the Pharisees were making a statement here and then contradicting it, you could reword this to avoid using an exception clause.

12:24	r1ls		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐν τῷ Βεελζεβοὺλ	1	These people are using the name of this chief demon to refer by association to his power, which they are accusing Jesus of using. Alternate translation: “by the power of Beelzebul”
12:25	plnm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1	Here, the word **But** introduces the next thing that happened.

Translate these proverbs in such a way that they will be recognized as proverbs and be meaningful in your language and culture. Alternate translation: “If a kingdom is divided against itself, it will be made desolate. Similarly, if a city or a house is divided against itself, it will not stand”
12:25	ll42		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	πᾶσα βασιλεία μερισθεῖσα καθ’ ἑαυτῆς ἐρημοῦται, καὶ πᾶσα πόλις ἢ οἰκία μερισθεῖσα καθ’ ἑαυτῆς οὐ σταθήσεται	1	These two sentences mean basically the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could connect the sentences with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second sentence is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: “Every kingdom divided against itself is made desolate; indeed, every city or house divided against itself will not stand”
12:25	g9ec		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	πᾶσα βασιλεία μερισθεῖσα καθ’ ἑαυτῆς ἐρημοῦται, καὶ πᾶσα πόλις ἢ οἰκία μερισθεῖσα καθ’ ἑαυτῆς οὐ σταθήσεται	1	Here, the words **kingdom**, **city**, and **house** represent the people who live in those places. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use equivalent expressions from your language or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “People in one kingdom who are divided against each other will be made desolate, and people in one city or house who are divided against each other will not stand”
12:25	rvzh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	μερισθεῖσα καθ’ ἑαυτῆς	-1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “that attacks itself … that attacks itself”

12:25	za8g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	οὐ σταθήσεται	1	Here, the phrase **will not stand** means that the **city or house** will not exist much longer.

12:26	yixz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-contrary	εἰ ὁ Σατανᾶς τὸν Σατανᾶν ἐκβάλλει, ἐφ’ ἑαυτὸν ἐμερίσθη	1	Jesus is making a conditional statement that sounds hypothetical, but he is already convinced that the condition is not true. He has concluded that **Satan** is not **divided against himself**, because Satan has not **been divided against himself**. Use a natural form in your language for introducing a condition that the speaker believes is not true. Alternate translation: “were Satan to cast out Satan, he would have been divided against himself”
12:26	i42r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ὁ Σατανᾶς τὸν Σατανᾶν ἐκβάλλει	1	In both places, **Satan** represents people who act by the power of Satan. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your language or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Satan’s followers cast out Satan’s followers” or “those who act by Satan’s power cast out others who also act by Satan’s power”
12:26	siu2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐφ’ ἑαυτὸν ἐμερίσθη	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “he has attacked himself”
12:26	ah7t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	πῶς οὖν σταθήσεται ἡ βασιλεία αὐτοῦ	1	Jesus is using the question form to show that Satan’s **kingdom** will not **stand** if he is divided against himself. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “His kingdom, then, will not stand.” or “His kingdom will certainly not stand!”
12:26	ce2i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	σταθήσεται ἡ βασιλεία αὐτοῦ	1	Here, the word **stand** means that the **kingdom** would exist for a long time.

He knows that he does not **cast out demons by Beelzebul**, but he wants to show what would also be true if he did **cast out demons by Beelzebul**. Use a natural form in your language for introducing a condition that the speaker believes is not true. Alternate translation: “were I to be casting out the demons by Beelzebul, by whom would your sons be casting them out”
12:27	f00a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	εἰ ἐγὼ ἐν Βεελζεβοὺλ ἐκβάλλω τὰ δαιμόνια, οἱ υἱοὶ ὑμῶν ἐν τίνι ἐκβάλλουσιν	1	The implication is that the people challenging Jesus would not say that their own followers were using the power of Beelzebul, and so they should agree that he is not using that power himself. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “if I cast out the demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons cast them out? Since you do not believe that they cast out demons by Beelzebul, it must not be true about me, either.”
12:27	gee9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	οἱ υἱοὶ ὑμῶν ἐν τίνι ἐκβάλλουσιν?	1	Jesus is using the question form to show that the **sons** of the Pharisees must use the same power that he uses.

12:27	scn6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	διὰ τοῦτο	1	Here, Jesus implies that the Pharisees would not say that their **sons** cast out demons by Beelzebul, and the phrase **Because of this** introduces a result based on this implied answer. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the reason for this result more explicit. Alternate translation: “Because you would not say that they cast out demons by Beelzebul,” or “Since you would not answer that they do it by Beelzebul,”
12:27	jja2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	αὐτοὶ κριταὶ ἔσονται ὑμῶν	1	Here Jesus speaks of the **sons** of the Pharisees as if they were the Pharisees’ **judges**. He means that what the **sons** proves that the Pharisees are wrong about what they have said about Jesus. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “what they do proves that you are wrong” or “when they cast out demons, it shows that you have spoken falsely”
12:28	j0yv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	δὲ	1	Here, the word **But** introduces a contrast with what the Pharisees have said about how Jesus casts out demons.

12:28	zb4d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἰ & ἐν Πνεύματι Θεοῦ ἐγὼ ἐκβάλλω τὰ δαιμόνια, ἄρα ἔφθασεν ἐφ’ ὑμᾶς ἡ Βασιλεία τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Jesus speaks as if this were a hypothetical situation, but he means that it must be true. If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, and if your readers might think that what Jesus is saying is uncertain, then you could translate his words as an affirmative statement. Alternate translation: “since I cast out the demons by the Spirit of God, the kingdom of God has come upon you”

He means that God is making where they and Jesus are into part of his **kingdom**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “God is ruling among you” or “this region has become part of God’s kingdom”
12:29	ille		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	ἢ	1	Here, Jesus uses the word **Or** to introduce another explanation of the same point that he has been making.

12:29	t4vu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables	ἢ πῶς δύναταί τις	1	To help the Pharisees understand what he has been saying, Jesus offers a brief illustration. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. For an explanation of this parable, see the chapter introduction. Alternate translation: “Here is an illustration of what I mean: how is anyone able”
12:29	w54c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	ἢ πῶς δύναταί τις εἰσελθεῖν εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν τοῦ ἰσχυροῦ καὶ τὰ σκεύη αὐτοῦ ἁρπάσαι, ἐὰν μὴ πρῶτον δήσῃ τὸν ἰσχυρόν?	1	Jesus is using the question form to show that a **strong man** must be **tied up** before someone can **steal his possessions**. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “No one is able to enter into the house of the strong man and steal his possessions if he has not first tied up the strong man.” or “It is impossible for anyone to enter into the house of the strong man and steal his possessions if he has not first bound the strong man!”
12:29	zluo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-exceptions	πῶς δύναταί τις εἰσελθεῖν εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν τοῦ ἰσχυροῦ καὶ τὰ σκεύη αὐτοῦ ἁρπάσαι, ἐὰν μὴ πρῶτον δήσῃ τὸν ἰσχυρόν	1	If, in your language, it would appear that Jesus was making a statement here and then contradicting it, you could reword this to avoid using an exception clause. Alternate translation: “how, unless he has first bound the strong man, is anyone able to enter into the house of that strong man and steal his belongings”
12:29	b2et		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	μὴ πρῶτον δήσῃ & διαρπάσει	1	Although the term **he** in both these places is masculine, Jesus is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women.

12:29	tsrk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	αὐτοῦ διαρπάσει	1	Here, the word **he** refers to the person who is stealing. The word **his** refers to the strong man. If this is not clear for your readers, you could refer to these people more directly. Alternate translation: “the thief will plunder the strong man’s”
12:30	lvjf			ὁ μὴ ὢν μετ’ ἐμοῦ κατ’ ἐμοῦ ἐστιν; καὶ ὁ μὴ συνάγων μετ’ ἐμοῦ σκορπίζει	1	Jesus is not referring to a specific individual. Rather, he is making a general statement that applies to any person or group of people. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that refers to any person. Alternate translation: “Anyone who is not with me is against me, and anyone who does not gather with me scatters” or “Those who are not with me are against me, and those who do not gather with me scatter”
12:30	ivp9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ὁ μὴ ὢν μετ’ ἐμοῦ	1	Here, the phrase **with me** describes people who support or are friendly to Jesus. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “The one not being my friend” or “The one not helping me”
12:30	ek1h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὁ μὴ συνάγων μετ’ ἐμοῦ σκορπίζει	1	Here Jesus implies that people are either **gathering** other people to him as disciples or scattering other people away from Jesus.

12:31	x5dd			λέγω ὑμῖν, πᾶσα ἁμαρτία	1	Jesus uses the clause **I say to you** to emphasize what he is about to tell his audience. Use a natural form in your language for emphasizing the truth and importance of a statement. Alternate translation: “I want you to know that every sin”

Alternate translation: “every sin and blasphemy can be forgiven may” or “all kinds of sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men”
12:31	kqx0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	πᾶσα ἁμαρτία καὶ βλασφημία	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **sin** and **blasphemy**, you could express the same ideas in another way.

12:32	mark		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τοῦ Υἱοῦ τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου	1	The title **Son of Man** is equivalent to “Messiah.” Jesus uses the phrase to claim that role subtly and implicitly. You may want to translate this title directly into your language. On the other hand, if you think it would be helpful to your readers, you could state what it means. See how you translated the title in [8:20](../08/20.md). Alternate translation: “the Messiah”
12:32	z3ma		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἀφεθήσεται αὐτῷ & οὐκ ἀφεθήσεται αὐτῷ	1	If your language does not use these passive forms, you could express the ideas in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

12:32	vnr8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	αὐτῷ	-1	Although the terms **him** and **him** are masculine, Jesus is using the words in a generic sense that includes both men and women.

It makes sense to say that a tree and its fruit together are either **good** or **rotten**. It does not make sense to say that a tree is good and its fruit **rotten** or that a tree is **rotten** and its fruit **good**. That is because trees are **known** by their fruits. Similarly, people who follow God do what is right, and people who do not follow God do what is wrong. It does not make sense to say that someone who does what is right is not following God or that someone who does what is wrong is following God. Most likely, Jesus wishes to apply this figure of speech both to himself (a good tree) and to the Pharisees (bad trees). If possible, preserve the figure of speech or use simile form. Alternate translation: “Either make the tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree rotten and its fruit rotten. Similarly, either call people good and their deeds good, or call people bad and their deeds bad. For, just as a tree is known by its fruit, so people are known by their deeds”

Alternate translation: “Either consider both the tree and its fruit good, or consider both the tree and its rotten bad” (2) people can **make** a tree either **good** or **rotten** by how they care for that tree. Then, the tree will **make** fruit that fits with how people cared for that tree. Alternate translation: “Either make the tree good, and it will make its fruit good, or make the tree rotten, and it will make its fruit rotten” or “Either make the tree good, and its fruit will be good, or make the tree rotten, and its fruit will be rotten” (3) a tree produces fruit that fits with what kind of tree it is. Alternate translation: “Either a tree is good and produces good fruit, or a tree is rotten and produces rotten fruit”

12:34	e7x3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	πῶς δύνασθε ἀγαθὰ λαλεῖν	1	Jesus is using the question form to rebuke the Pharisees for failing to speak **good things**.

12:34	e9bg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τῆς καρδίας	1	In Matthew’s culture, **the heart** is the place where humans think and feel.

12:42	uf5k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	πλεῖον	1	Here, the phrase **something greater** is a very general term. It could refer to the kingdom of God, Jesus himself, the ministry that Jesus begins, what Jesus calls his disciples to do, or many other things. If possible, you should use a general term that could refer to many or all of these things. See how you translated the similar phrase in [12:6](../12/06.md). Alternate translation: “an entity greater than” or “a new thing greater than”
12:43	yj4w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1	Here, the word **Now** introduces the next topic that Jesus wants to speak about.

When the unclean spirit has gone out from the man”
12:43	f5jr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἀνύδρων τόπων	1	Jesus is describing the desert by reference to the lack of water there.

12:44	j40t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	ἐλθὸν	1	In a context such as this, your language might say “gone” instead of **come**. Alternate translation: “having gone”
12:44	s6jf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor	εὑρίσκει σχολάζοντα σεσαρωμένον καὶ κεκοσμημένον	1	Here Jesus refers to the person whom the demon formerly controlled as if he were a house that was **empty**, **swept out**, and **put in order**. This means that no one is living in the house, so it is ready for someone to move in. Similarly, the person is not serving or obeying anyone, so he is ready for someone to lead or control him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use simile form or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “it finds the man like an empty house, having been swept out and put in order” or “it finds that the man is not serving anybody, but he is living a good life”
12:44	cd4f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	σεσαρωμένον καὶ κεκοσμημένον	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

12:45	l9do		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor	εἰσελθόντα κατοικεῖ ἐκεῖ	1	Here Jesus continues to refer to the person whom the evil spirit formerly controlled as if he were a house.

If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “that man’s condition is now worse than it was before” or “the current situation of that man has become worse than the previous situation”

12:46	i4t5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship	οἱ ἀδελφοὶ	1	These were Jesus' younger **brothers**. They were sons of Mary and Joseph.

That detail is not normally translated, but if your language has a specific word for “younger brother,” you could use it here.
12:46	rg73		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἵστήκεισαν ἔξω	1	Here Matthew implies that Jesus’ mother and brothers arrived and then stood **outside** wherever Jesus was. Since [13:1](../13/01.md) describes Jesus leaving a house, he may have been in a house while he was teaching.

12:48	e535		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τίς ἐστιν ἡ μήτηρ μου καὶ τίνες εἰσὶν οἱ ἀδελφοί μου?	1	Jesus is using the question form to teach his audience about whom he considers to be part of his family. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Since Jesus answers the question in [12:49](../12/49.md), you should not include an implied answer here. Alternate translation: “I will inform you about whom I call my mother and my brothers.” or “Let me tell you whom I love as if they were my mother or my brothers.”

The ULT does this with the poetry in [13:14–15](../13/14.md), which is a quote from [Isaiah 6:9–10](../isa/06/09.md), and in [13:35](../13/35.md), which is a quote from [Psalm 78:2](../psa/78/02.md).\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Farming\n\nJesus refers to many different farming practices in this chapter. In his culture, farmers often threw seeds over their fields, a process called sowing. After throwing the seeds, they would use a tool called a plow to cover the seeds with dirt. Then, they would water and take care of the seeds until they sprouted and grew. Finally, when the plants produced grain or other kinds of crops, they would cut down the plants, separate the edible parts from the inedible parts, and store the edible parts in a safe place. See the notes on the verses in which Jesus discusses farming practices for specific information and translation options.\n\n### Darnel\n\nDarnel are plants that look much like wheat plants. However, they do not produce the same kind of grain, and the grain that they do produce is somewhat poisonous. In your translation, you could refer to a plant that looks like wheat or grain plants, or you could use a descriptive phrase. See the notes for translation options.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Parables\n\nThroughout this chapter, Jesus uses many parables to teach the crowds and his disciples. Each parable is a short story that includes a specific lesson. Jesus uses parables to teach so that people who already know his message will learn more but people who do not know his message will not learn anything (see [13:10–17](../13/10.md)). Jesus explains three of the parables, but he does not explain any of the others. Possible explanations for each parable are included below, but only for help in translation. Your translation should not directly explain the meaning of any parable more than Jesus does. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])\n\n- **The parable of the sower** – In [13:3–9](../13/03.md), Jesus tells a story about a man who sows seed and about what happens to the seed. Jesus explains this parable in [13:18–23](../13/18.md). Even with this explanation, Christians debate who the sower is, what the seed represents, and what the different areas in the field represent. The sower could be Jesus himself, God, or anyone who preaches the gospel. The seed could be the gospel or the person who hears the gospel. The different areas in the field could be regions or areas where people hear the gospel, different kinds of people, or different ways of responding to the gospel. Most likely, the seed and the area in the field together describe what happens when people respond to the gospel in these four ways.\n\n- **The parable of the darnel** – In [13:24–30](../13/24.md), Jesus tells a story about a farmer who planted good seed and the farmer’s enemy who planted darnel seed in the same field. Jesus explains this parable in [13:37–43](../13/37.md). Jesus is the farmer, and the good seed are people who believe in him. The enemy is the devil, and the darnel seed are people who serve him. The farmer in the story allows the darnel to grow until the harvest, when he has them cut down and burned. Similarly, Jesus allows people who serve the devil to live until this time period ends, when he will have his angels collect these people. Then, he will judge and punish them, and he will reward those who believed in him.\n\n- **The parable of the mustard seed** – In [13:31–32](../13/31.md), Jesus tells a story about how a very small seed (a mustard seed) grows into a very large plant. Most likely, he is describing how his group of followers was very small but will eventually become very large. Jesus mentions that birds nest in the branches of this large plant. Some people think that Jesus is referring to passages like [Ezekiel 17:23](../ezk/17/23.md), which could suggest that the birds represent Gentiles who become part of God’s kingdom. Others think that the detail about the birds simply illustrates how large the plant is. If possible, your translation should allow for all of these interpretations.\n\n- **The parable of the yeast** – In [13:33](../13/33.md), Jesus tells a story about how a woman leavened a large amount of flour with some yeast. Most likely, he is describing how his message and his followers will affect many things. He could be speaking about how his message completely changes people. Or, he could be speaking about how his message and his followers will spread throughout the whole world. Or, he could be speaking about how his message and his followers are small and insignificant but affect the whole world. If possible, your translation should allow for all of these interpretations.\n\n- **The parable of the treasure in the field** – In [13:44](../13/44.md), Jesus tells a story about a worker who discovered a hidden treasure in a field that belonged to someone else. To obtain the treasure, the worker sold everything that he had and bought the field. Most likely, Jesus means that being part of God’s kingdom is very valuable, like a treasure, and people should be willing to give up everything to be part of the kingdom.\n\n- **The parable of the pearl** – In [13:45–46](../13/45.md), Jesus tells a story about a merchant who wanted to obtain valuable pearls. When he saw a very expensive pearl, he sold everything that he had and bought the pearl. Most likely, Jesus means that being part of God’s kingdom is very valuable, like an expensive pearl, and people should be willing to give up everything to be part of the kingdom.\n\n- **The parable of the net** – In [13:47–48](../13/47.md), Jesus tells a story about fishermen who use a net to catch many kinds of fish, some useful and some useless. They sort through the fish, keeping the good ones and throwing away the bad ones. Jesus explains this parable in [13:49–50](../13/49.md). The fish are like people, and the fishermen are like angels. At the end of this time period, the angels will separate righteous people from wicked people, just like the fishermen sorted the fish. Then, the wicked people will be punished, just as the useless fish were thrown away.\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Singular and plural forms of “you”\n\nMost of the forms of “you” in this chapter appear in speeches that Jesus gives to many people around him. Because of this, most forms of “you” in this chapter are plural. You should assume forms of “you” are plural unless a note specifies that the form is singular. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
13:1	vx5y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ	1	Here, the phrase **On that day** introduces the next major event in the story, an event that happened on the same day as the teaching recorded in the previous chapter.

13:2	d16z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	συνήχθησαν πρὸς αὐτὸν ὄχλοι πολλοί	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

13:2	d0v5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καθῆσθαι	1	Just as in the previous verse, Jesus **sat down** to teach. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “sat down down to instruct the people” or “sat down as a teacher does”
13:2	us0a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ἐπὶ τὸν αἰγιαλὸν	1	The word **beach** refers to the ground next to a body of water when this ground is covered by sand or small rocks.

13:3	kcvm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	ἰδοὺ	1	Here, the word **Behold** draws the attention of the audience and asks them to listen carefully. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express **Behold** with a word or phrase that asks the audience to listen, or you could draw the audience’s attention in another way. Alternate translation: “Picture this:” or “Listen”
13:4	gw0z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐν τῷ σπείρειν αὐτὸν	1	While there are many ways to sow or plant seeds, here Jesus is describing a practice in which farmers pick up handfuls of seed and throw them so that they are scattered all over the top of the soil. This method is a quick and easy way to plant seeds in large fields, but some seeds land on ground that is not good for them to grow in. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make it more explicit what kind of sowing this is. Alternate translation: “as he threw the seeds over the ground” or “as he scattered the seeds over the field”

Instead, they just sit on top of the hard-packed dirt by the **road** and are unprotected from birds. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “some fell on the hard ground beside the road, and the birds came and easily devoured them”
13:4	cvj4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	ἃ	1	Jesus is using the adjective **some** as a noun to mean some of the seeds. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “some seeds”
13:4	rdmi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	τὰ πετεινὰ	1	The phrase **the birds** represents any birds, not particular birds. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: “birds”

13:5	njjm			οὐκ εἶχεν & ἐξανέτειλεν διὰ τὸ μὴ ἔχειν	1	Here Jesus refers back to the **others** as a group using singular words.

13:5	x4av		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	εὐθέως ἐξανέτειλεν διὰ τὸ μὴ ἔχειν βάθος γῆς	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these clauses, since the second clause gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “because it did not have deep soil, immediately it sprang up”
13:5	nz17		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐξανέτειλεν	1	Here, the phrase **sprang up** refers to how plants sprout or begin to grow. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase. Alternate translation: “it came up” or “it began to grow”

If it would be helpful in your language, you could use plural words to refer to these plants. Alternate translation: “they were scorched, and because they had no roots, they withered”
13:6	qq5x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐκαυματίσθη	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

13:6	lswv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	τὸ μὴ ἔχειν ῥίζαν	1	Jesus says **no root** here as a generalization for emphasis.

13:7	vt8z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀνέβησαν αἱ ἄκανθαι καὶ ἀπέπνιξαν αὐτά	1	Here Jesus means that the **thorns** grew quickly and took all the nutrients, water, and sunlight, so the farmer’s plants could not grow well. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “the thorns grew very large and crowded them out” or “the thorns grew faster and kept them from growing well”
13:8	iwv2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	ἄλλα	1	Jesus is using the adjective **others** as a noun to mean some of the rest of the seeds that did not fall beside the road or on rocky soil. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this word with an equivalent phrase. See how you translated the word in [13:5](../13/05.md). Alternate translation: “some of the rest of the seeds”
13:8	d30o		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐδίδου καρπόν	1	Here the word **fruit** refers to the crop that the plants that grew from the seeds produced. Since the farmer is sowing wheat seeds, this crop would be more seeds. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “were producing more seeds” or “sprouted and produced a harvest”
13:8	tqs8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	καρπόν	1	Here, the word **fruit** is singular in form, but it refers to many fruits as a group. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this plainly. Alternate translation: “fruits”

Scholars estimate that these numbers are very good in Jesus’ time period, although not impossible or unheard of. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make these ideas more explicit. Alternate translation: “and they produced a very good harvest, with some plants producing 100 seeds, and some plants producing 60 seeds, and other plants producing 30 seeds” or “many times more than the farmer planted: some 100 times more, and some 60 times more, and some 30 times more”
13:9	q2e2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ὁ ἔχων ὦτα, ἀκουέτω	1	This verse is almost identical to [11:15](../11/15.md), although that verse includes the phrase “to hear” after **ears**. Express the idea as you did in [11:15](../11/15.md), but omit the phrase “to hear” if you expressed it explicitly there.
13:10	utyp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	εἶπαν αὐτῷ, διὰ τί ἐν παραβολαῖς λαλεῖς αὐτοῖς?	1	It may be more natural in your language to have an indirect quotation here. Alternate translation: “asked him for what reason he spoke to them in parables.”
13:10	gqnu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	λαλεῖς	1	Here, the word **you** is singular since the disciples are speaking to Jesus.
13:10	b16z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	αὐτοῖς	1	The pronoun **them** refers to the “crowd” that was standing on the shore of the sea to listen to Jesus (see [13:2](../13/02.md)).

13:11	g2cs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1	Here, the word **But** introduces the next thing that happened.

13:11	wmlo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τὰ μυστήρια τῆς Βασιλείας τῶν Οὐρανῶν	1	Here, Jesus is using the possessive form to describe **mysteries** that are about **the kingdom of the heavens**.

13:11	xq2v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐκείνοις & οὐ δέδοται	1	Here Jesus implies that **those** people have not **been given** the **mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “to those it has not been given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens”
13:11	mgx2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	ἐκείνοις	1	Jesus is using the adjective **those** as a noun to mean the people whom the disciples asked him about.

Translate this proverb in a way that will be recognized as a proverb and be meaningful in your language and culture. Alternate translation: “people who have things receive more, and they have an abundance. But people who do not have things lose what they used to have”
13:12	lukr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὅστις & ἔχει, δοθήσεται αὐτῷ καὶ περισσευθήσεται; ὅστις δὲ οὐκ ἔχει, καὶ ὃ ἔχει ἀρθήσεται ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ	1	Here Jesus implies that what the person **has** or **does not have** is knowledge or understanding about the “mysteries of the kingdom of heaven” (see [13:11](../13/11.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “whoever has understanding, it will be given to him, and he will have an abundance. But whoever does not have understanding, even what he has will be taken away from him” or “whoever has knowledge about the kingdom, more will be given to him, and he will have an abundance of knowledge.

13:12	v61y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	δοθήσεται & ἀρθήσεται	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

13:12	j3rl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	αὐτῷ καὶ περισσευθήσεται & ὃ ἔχει & αὐτοῦ	1	Although the terms **him** and **he** are masculine in this verse, Jesus is using the words in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use phrases that make this clear. Alternate translation: “to that person, and he or she will have an abundance … what that person has … him or her”
13:12	rfgc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	περισσευθήσεται	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **abundance**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “he will abound” or “he will have very much”
13:12	ug61		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	ὅστις δὲ οὐκ ἔχει	1	Jesus says **whoever does not have** here as a generalization for emphasis. It is clear in the second half of the sentence that the person did have something. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different way to express the emphasis. Alternate translation: “But whoever has almost nothing” or “But whoever does not have much”
13:13	cagw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	διὰ τοῦτο	1	Here, the pronoun **this** could refer to: (1) what Jesus is about to say, beginning with the word **because**. Alternate translation: “Here is why” (2) what Jesus said in the previous two verses. Alternate translation: “That is why” or “For those reasons”

They **hear** things, but they do not listen carefully or **understand**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit.

13:14	khve		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἀναπληροῦται αὐτοῖς ἡ προφητεία Ἠσαΐου	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “they are fulfilling the prophecy of Isaiah” or “what they do fulfills the prophecy of Isaiah”
13:14	jz9n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	ἀναπληροῦται & ἡ προφητεία Ἠσαΐου ἡ λέγουσα	1	In Jesus’s culture, this was a normal way to introduce a quotation from an important text, in this case, the Old Testament book written by Isaiah the prophet (see [Isaiah 6:9–10](../isa/06/09.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase that indicates that Jesus is quoting from an important text. Alternate translation: “the prophecy from the book of Isaiah is being fulfilled. Here is the prophecy:” or “is being fulfilled what Isaiah prophesied when he wrote”\n
13:14	a1im		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-reduplication	ἀκοῇ ἀκούσετε & βλέποντες βλέψετε	1	Here the author of the quotation repeats the words **hear** and **see** in order to emphasize that the people really do **hear** and **see**. If your language can repeat words for emphasis, it would be appropriate to use that construction here in your translation. Otherwise, you could express the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “You will certainly hear … you will certainly see” or “You will indeed hear … you will indeed see”
13:14	q4cj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	οὐ μὴ	-1	The words translated **certainly not** are two negative words. In this construction, the second negative does not cancel the first to create a positive meaning. Instead, it gives greater emphasis to the negative. If your language can use two negatives that do not cancel one another to create a positive meaning, you could use a double negative here. If your language does not use two negatives in that way, you could translate with one strong negative, as the ULT does. Alternate translation: “by no means … by no means”
13:15	mxzy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	Here, the word **For** introduces a reason why the people hear but do not understand and see but do not perceive. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a reason or basis for a claim, or you could leave **For** untranslated. Alternate translation: “That is because” or “That happens since”
13:15	oz31		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	ἐπαχύνθη & ἡ καρδία τοῦ λαοῦ τούτου, καὶ τοῖς ὠσὶν βαρέως ἤκουσαν, καὶ τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς αὐτῶν ἐκάμμυσαν; μήποτε ἴδωσιν τοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς, καὶ τοῖς ὠσὶν ἀκούσωσιν, καὶ τῇ καρδίᾳ συνῶσιν, καὶ ἐπιστρέψωσιν καὶ ἰάσομαι αὐτούς	1	The author of the quotation switches from speaking to the Israelite people in the second person (see [13:14](../13/14.md)) to speaking about them in the third person. If this would not be natural in your language, you could use second person forms in this verse. Alternate translation: “the heart of you people has been thickened, and with your ears you have hardly heard, and you have shut your eyes, lest you might see with your eyes, and you might hear with your ears, and you might understand with your heart and turn back, and I would heal you”
13:15	ljec		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	ἐπαχύνθη & ἡ καρδία τοῦ λαοῦ τούτου, καὶ τοῖς ὠσὶν βαρέως ἤκουσαν, καὶ τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς αὐτῶν ἐκάμμυσαν	1	These three clauses mean basically the same thing. The second and third emphasize the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could connect the clauses with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second and third phrase are repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternatively, you could express the idea with just one or two clauses. Alternate translation: “the heart of this people has been thickened; yes, with their ears they have hardly heard; indeed, they have shut their eyes” or “the heart of this people has been thickened, and they barely use their ears and eyes”
13:15	tfl1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐπαχύνθη & ἡ καρδία τοῦ λαοῦ τούτου	1	Here the author of the quotation is speaking as if the **heart** of the people of Israel has literally been **thickened**. He means that they are resisting God stubbornly. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “this people has been made stubborn”
13:15	n416		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	ἐπαχύνθη & ἡ καρδία τοῦ λαοῦ τούτου & τῇ καρδίᾳ	1	If it would not be natural in your language to speak as if a group of people had only one **heart**, you could use the plural form of that word in your translation. Alternate translation: “the hearts of these people have been thickened … with their hearts”
13:15	driw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐπαχύνθη & ἡ καρδία τοῦ λαοῦ τούτου & τῇ καρδίᾳ	1	In the author’s culture, the **heart** is the place where humans think and feel. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate **heart** by referring to the place where humans think and feel in your culture or by expressing the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “the mind of this people was made dull … with their mind” or “the thoughts of this people were made dull … in their thoughts”
13:15	o0ir		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐπαχύνθη	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “has become thick”

If so, you could shorten them. Alternate translation: “and they have hardly heard anything, and they have shut their eyes, lest they might see clearly, and they might hear clearly”
13:15	u9la		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	καὶ τοῖς ὠσὶν βαρέως ἤκουσαν, καὶ τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς αὐτῶν ἐκάμμυσαν	1	The author of the quotation is speaking as if the people of Israel have become unable to hear and have **shut their eyes** so that they will not see. He means that they are refusing to consider what God wants to tell them. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea in simile form or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and they are refusing to pay attention to God, as if they were closing their ears and eyes” or “and they are refusing to consider what God wants to tell them”
13:15	p6we		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	ἴδωσιν τοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς, καὶ τοῖς ὠσὶν ἀκούσωσιν, καὶ τῇ καρδίᾳ συνῶσιν	1	These three clauses mean basically the same thing.

13:15	ps56		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐπιστρέψωσιν	1	The author of the quotation is speaking of the people of Israel as if they had been traveling somewhere and had taken the wrong way and needed to **turn back** onto the right way.

13:15	q1h9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἰάσομαι αὐτούς	1	Here the author of the quotation does not mean God would only **heal** the people physically. He would also **heal** them spiritually by forgiving their sins. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “I would heal them and forgive them”
13:16	glp8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	ὑμῶν & οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ ὅτι βλέπουσιν, καὶ τὰ ὦτα ὑμῶν ὅτι ἀκούουσιν	1	Jesus is using **eyes** and **ears** to represent people as they **see** and **hear**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your culture or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “you, for you see; and blessed are you, for you hear” or “you as you look at things, for you see; and as you listen to things, for you hear”
13:16	rlt3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	βλέπουσιν & ἀκούουσιν	1	Here Jesus implies that their **eyes** can **see** properly and their **ears** can **hear** properly.

Alternate translation: “You are blessed because” or “That is because”
13:17	txyn			ἀμὴν & λέγω ὑμῖν	1	Jesus says this to emphasize what he is about to tell his disciples. Use a natural form in your language for emphasizing the truth and importance of a statement. Alternate translation: “I can assure you”
13:17	e6ci		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἃ βλέπετε & ἃ ἀκούετε	1	Here Jesus implies that what the disciples **see** and **hear** is what he does and teaches.

If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “did not see those things … did not hear those things”
13:17	nq4p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οὐκ εἶδαν & οὐκ ἤκουσαν	1	Here Jesus implies that these people did not **see** or **hear** what the disciples see and hear because they lived before Jesus was born. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “because they lived before this time, did not see … because they lived before this time, did not hear”
13:17	lslf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	καὶ ἀκοῦσαι	1	Jesus is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete.

13:18	pg1f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	οὖν	1	Here, the word **therefore** introduces an inference or conclusion based on what Jesus has said in the previous verses about how the disciples are blessed because they can listen to Jesus. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different word or phrase that introduces an inference, or you could leave **therefore** untranslated. Alternate translation: “then” or “given all that”
13:18	w35t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀκούσατε τὴν παραβολὴν	1	Here Jesus means that he is going to explain the **parable** that he just spoke. He does not mean that he is going to tell it again. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “listen to the explanation of the parable”

13:19	het1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τὸν λόγον	1	Matthew is using the term **word** to mean something spoken in words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the proclamation” or “the news”
13:19	a8nu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἔρχεται ὁ πονηρὸς καὶ ἁρπάζει τὸ ἐσπαρμένον ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ αὐτοῦ	1	Here Jesus speaks about the message about the kingdom as if it were seed that **had been sown** in a person’s **heart**. He speaks of **the evil one** as if he were a bird that swooped down and snatched away the seed. Since these figures of speech connect to the parable that Jesus told, if possible you should preserve them or express the ideas in simile form. Alternate translation: “the evil one comes like a bird and snatches away the word, which had been sown like a seed in his heart”
13:19	sb7u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὁ πονηρὸς	1	Here, the phrase **the evil one** refers to the devil, Satan. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “the devil” or “the evil one, Satan,”

Even so, it would probably be best to translate **Father** with the same word that your language would naturally use to refer to a human father.

Further opposition to Jesus and misunderstanding of the kingdom of God (13:53–17:57)\n      * Herod hears about Jesus (14:1–2)\n      * Flashback: Herod executes John the Baptist (14:3–12)\n      * Jesus feeds 5,000 men (14:13–21)\n      * Jesus walks on water (14:22–33)\n      * Jesus heals people in the region of Gennesaret (14:34–36)\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### The miracle of multiplying food\n\n\n\n### The miracle of walking on water\n\n\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### The flashback to John’s death\n\nVerses 1 and 2 continue the account from chapter 13. Verses 3-12 stop the account and speak of things that happened earlier, possibly soon after Satan tempted Jesus (See: [4:12](../mat/04/12.md)). Verse 13 continues the account from verse 2. Be sure to have words in verses 3-12 that tell the reader that Matthew has stopped his account to give new information before he continues. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])\n\n### Singular and plural forms of “you”\n\nMost of the forms of “you” in this chapter appear in dialogue between characters. Because of this, most forms of “you” in this chapter are singular. You should assume forms of “you” are singular unless a note specifies that the form is plural. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
14:1	ny6u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	ἐν ἐκείνῳ τῷ καιρῷ	1	Here, the phrase **At that time** introduces the next major event in the story. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces the next event. Alternate translation: “While all those things were happening” or “During this period”
14:2	pd1b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	οὗτός	1	The pronoun **This** refers to Jesus. If this is not clear for your readers, you could refer to him more directly. Alternate translation: “This person” or “This Jesus”
14:2	nx7x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	αὐτὸς ἠγέρθη	1	Here, the word **raised** refers to someone who died coming back to life. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable idiom or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “He has been restored to life”
14:2	dy2j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	αὐτὸς ἠγέρθη	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who did the action, Herod could be implying that: (1) God did it. Alternate translation: “God has raised him” (2) John himself did it. Alternate translation: “He has risen”
14:2	wwe3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	ἀπὸ τῶν νεκρῶν	1	Paul is using the adjective **dead** as a noun in order to refer to all people who are **dead**. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this with a noun phrase. Alternate translation: “from among the dead people” or “from the corpses”
14:2	x4zz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	διὰ τοῦτο	1	Here, the phrase **because of this** introduces the result of what Herod thinks about John being **raised from the dead**.

Alternate translation: “because he has been raised,”
14:2	vve7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	αἱ δυνάμεις ἐνεργοῦσιν ἐν αὐτῷ	1	Here Herod speaks as if **the powers** were people that could **work** in Jesus. He means that Jesus is powerful and can do powerful things. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “he has his powers” or “he is very powerful”
14:3-4	zgp9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge	ὁ γὰρ Ἡρῴδης κρατήσας τὸν Ἰωάννην, ἔδησεν αὐτὸν καὶ ἐν φυλακῇ ἀπέθετο, διὰ Ἡρῳδιάδα, τὴν γυναῖκα Φιλίππου, τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ αὐτοῦ & ἔλεγεν γὰρ αὐτῷ ὁ Ἰωάννης, οὐκ ἔξεστίν σοι ἔχειν αὐτήν	1	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could combine [14:3](../14/03.md) and [14:4](../14/04.md) into a verse bridge, as UST does, in order to include what John said to Herod before stating what Herod did in response. Alternate translation: “For John had said to Herod, ‘It is not lawful for you to have Herodias, the wife of your brother Philip.’ So, because of Herodias, Herod, having seized John, bound him and put him in prison.”
14:3	ybyz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	γὰρ	1	Here, the word **For** introduces background information that tells about how John died. This background information continues in [14:4–12](../14/04.md). In your translation, present this information in a way that makes it clear that this is background information, not the next event in the story. Alternate translation: “Now sometime earlier,” or “By this time, John had already died. Here is what happened:”
14:3	zsvz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ὁ & Ἡρῴδης κρατήσας τὸν Ἰωάννην, ἔδησεν αὐτὸν καὶ ἐν φυλακῇ ἀπέθετο, διὰ Ἡρῳδιάδα, τὴν γυναῖκα Φιλίππου, τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ αὐτοῦ	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these elements, since the second half of the verse gives the reason for the result that the first half of the verse describes. Alternate translation: “Because of Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip, Herod, having seized John, bound him and put him in prison”
14:3	h466		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὁ & Ἡρῴδης κρατήσας τὸν Ἰωάννην, ἔδησεν αὐτὸν καὶ ἐν φυλακῇ ἀπέθετο	1	Here Matthew implies that **Herod** sent his soldiers to do these things.

So, if you have to use a form that refers to an older or younger **brother**, you could state that **Philip** was older. Alternate translation: “his older brother”
14:3	e6zc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	αὐτοῦ	1	The pronoun **his** refers to Herod. If this is not clear for your readers, you could use the person's name here. Alternate translation: “Herod’s”
14:4	jpro		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	Here, the word **For** introduces a reason why Herod put John in prison.

14:4	lp4d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	αὐτῷ	1	The pronoun **him** refers to Herod. If this is not clear for your readers, you could use the person's name here. Alternate translation: “to Herod”
14:4	n1t6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	ἔλεγεν & αὐτῷ & οὐκ ἔξεστίν σοι ἔχειν αὐτήν.	1	It may be more natural in your language to have an indirect quotation here. Alternate translation: “was saying to him that it was not lawful for him to have her”

If this is not clear for your readers, you could refer to these people more directly. Alternate translation: “John … Herod feared … John”
14:5	rtp0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐφοβήθη τὸν ὄχλον	1	Here Matthew implies that Herod both **feared the crowd** and did not have John killed. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “he feared the crowd and did not put him to death” or “he did not give the order, for he feared the crowd”
14:5	epdd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὸν ὄχλον	1	Here Matthew implies that Herod feared what **the crowd** would do if he put John to death. They might have rioted or attacked Herod.

14:6	d2em		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1	Here, the word **But** introduces the next thing that happened.

14:6	ejhk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship	ἡ θυγάτηρ τῆς Ἡρῳδιάδος	1	Here Matthew implies that this woman was **the daughter of Herodias** by a previous husband, probably Philip. She was not the daughter of Herod. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this relationship more explicit.

14:6	fvs5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐν τῷ μέσῳ	1	Here, the phrase **in the midst** indicates that **the daughter of Herodias** danced so that Herod and the guests at his party could all see her.

If it would be helpful in your language, you could make these reasons more explicit.

14:9	op6o		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τοὺς συνανακειμένους	1	In Jesus’ culture, people would usually recline, or lay on one side, at a table when they were eating.

15:intro	i9a5				0	# Matthew 15 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 15:8-9, which are words from the Old Testament.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### The “traditions of the elders”\n\nThe “traditions of the elders” were oral laws that the Jewish religious leaders developed because they wanted to make sure that everyone obeyed the law of Moses. However, they often worked harder to obey these rules than to obey the law of Moses itself. Jesus rebuked the religious leaders for this, and they became angry as a result. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]])\n\n### Jews and Gentiles\n\nThe Jews of Jesus’ time thought that only Jews could please God by the way they lived. Jesus healed a Canaanite Gentile woman’s daughter to show his followers that he would accept both Jews and Gentiles as his people.\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Sheep\n\nThe Bible often speaks of people as if they were sheep because sheep require someone to take care of them. This is because they do not see well and they often go to where predatory animals can easily kill and eat them. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

16:intro	za2k				0	# Matthew 16 General Notes\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Yeast\n\nJesus spoke of the way people thought about God as if it were bread, and he spoke of what people taught about God as if it were the yeast that makes bread dough become larger and the baked bread taste good. He did not want his followers to listen to what the Pharisees and Sadducees taught. This was because if they did listen, they would not understand who God is and how he wants his people to live. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Metaphor\n\nJesus told his people to obey his commands. He did this by telling them to “follow” him. It is as if he were walking on a path and they were walking after him. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Background information\n\nMatthew continues his account from chapter 15 in verses 1-20. The account stops in verse 21 so that Matthew can tell the reader that Jesus told his disciples again and again that people would kill him after he arrived in Jerusalem. Then the account continues in verses 22-27 with what happened the first time Jesus told the disciples that he would die.\n\n### Paradox\n\nA paradox is a true statement that appears to describe something impossible. Jesus uses a paradox when he says, “Whoever wants to save his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it” ([Matthew 16:25](../mat/16/25.md)).

17:intro	yb4k				0	# Matthew 17 General Notes\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Elijah\n\nThe Old Testament prophet Malachi lived many years before Jesus was born. Malachi had said that before the Messiah came a prophet named Elijah would return. Jesus explained that Malachi had been talking about John the Baptist. Jesus said this because John the Baptist had done what Malachi had said that Elijah would do. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/christ]])\n\n### “transfigured”\n\nScripture often speaks of God’s glory as a great, brilliant light. When people see this light, they are afraid. Matthew says in this chapter that Jesus’ body shone with this glorious light so that his followers could see that Jesus truly was God’s Son. At the same time, God told them that Jesus was his Son. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/glory]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/fear]])

21:intro	ni1x				0	# Matthew 21 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 21:5,16 and 42, which is quoted from the Old Testament.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### The donkey and the colt\n\nJesus rode into Jerusalem on an animal. In this way he was like a king who came into a city after he had won an important battle. Also, the kings of Israel in the Old Testament rode on a donkeys. Other kings rode on horses. So Jesus was showing that he was the king of Israel and that he was not like other kings.\n\nMatthew, Mark, Luke, and John all wrote about this event. Matthew and Mark wrote that the disciples brought Jesus a donkey. John wrote that Jesus found a donkey. Luke wrote that they brought him a colt. Only Matthew wrote that there was both a donkey had a colt. No one knows for sure whether Jesus rode the donkey or the colt. It is best to translate each of these accounts as it appears in the ULT without trying to make them all say exactly the same thing. (See: [Matthew 21:1-7](../mat/21/01.md) and [Mark 11:1-7](../mrk/11/01.md) and [Luke 19:29-36](../luk/19/29.md) and [John 12:14-15](../jhn/12/14.md))\n\n### Hosanna\n\nThis is what the people shouted to welcome Jesus into Jerusalem. This word meant “Save us,” but people used it to praise God.\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### “The kingdom of God will be taken away from you”\n\nNo one knows for sure what this phrase means. No one knows if Jesus meant that God would someday give the kingdom back or not.

If your readers would misunderstand this question, you can express it as a statement. Alternate translation: “Think about what you have read in the Scriptures, ‘A stone that the builders rejected, this has become the head of the corner.

21:42	mcm8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	λίθον ὃν ἀπεδοκίμασαν οἱ οἰκοδομοῦντες, οὗτος ἐγενήθη εἰς κεφαλὴν γωνίας	1	Jesus is quoting from the Psalms. This is a metaphor that means the religious leaders, like builders, will reject Jesus, but God will make him the most important in his kingdom, like the cornerstone in a building. Since this is a quotation from Scripture, we recommend that you translate the words directly rather than providing a non-figurative explanation of them, even if your language does not customarily use such figures of speech. If you want to explain the meaning of the metaphor, we recommend that you do that in a footnote rather than in the Bible text.

22:intro	k5ze				0	# Matthew 22 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in verse 44, which is quoted from the Old Testament.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Wedding Feast\n\nIn the parable of the wedding feast ([Matthew 22:1-14](../22/01.md)), Jesus taught that when God offers to save a person, that person needs to accept the offer. Jesus spoke of life with God as a feast that a king prepared for his son who had just gotten married. In addition, Jesus emphasized that not everyone whom God invites will properly prepare himself to come to the feast. God will throw such people out from the feast.\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### Implicit information\n\nSpeakers usually do not say things that they think their hearers already understand. When the king in the parable says, “My oxen and fattened calves have been killed” ([Matthew 22:4](../mat/22/04.md)), he assumes that the hearers will understand that those who had killed the animals had also cooked them.\n\n### Paradox\n\nA paradox is a statement that describes two things that seemingly cannot both be true at the same time. To the Jews, ancestors were greater than their descendants. But in one psalm David calls one of his descendants “Lord.” Jesus tells the Jewish leaders that this is a paradox, asking, “If David then calls the Christ ‘Lord,’ how is he David’s son?” ([22:45](../22/45.md)).

23:intro	m99i				0	# Matthew 23 General Notes\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Hypocrites\n\nJesus calls the Pharisees “hypocrites” many times in verses13–29. He carefully explains why he calls them that. The Pharisees made rules that no one could actually obey, and then they persuaded the ordinary people that they were guilty because they could not obey those rules. Also, the Pharisees obeyed their own rules instead of obeying God’s original commands in the law of Moses.\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### Name-calling\n\nIn most cultures, it is wrong to insult people. The Pharisees took many of the words in this chapter as insults. Jesus called them “hypocrites,” “blind guides,” “fools,” and “serpents.” But Jesus used these words not as insults but as warnings that God would surely punish the Pharisees because they were doing wrong.\n\n### Paradox\n\nA paradox is a statement that describes two things that seemingly cannot both be true at the same time. Jesus uses a paradox when he says, “He who is greatest among you will be your servant” ([23:11-12](../23/11.md)).

He means that they are making people try to obey many difficult laws. If it would be helpful for your readers, you could express the meaning as a comparison.

23:30	kkf2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τῶν πατέρων ἡμῶν	1	Jesus is using the term **fathers** to mean “ancestors.” If your readers would misunderstand this, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “our ancestors”
23:30	x99m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τῷ αἵματι	1	Jesus is using the word **blood ** to mean “death” by association. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the death”
23:31	l7rl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	υἱοί ἐστε τῶν φονευσάντων	1	Jesus may be using the term **sons** to mean descendants. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “you are the descendants of the ones having killed” or see next note for another possibility.
23:31	eale		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	υἱοί ἐστε τῶν φονευσάντων	1	Jesus may also be using the expression **sons of** to describe people who share the qualities of something. He would be saying that the scribes and Pharisees share the quality of resistance to God that led their ancestors to kill the prophets. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “you are resistant to God just like your ancestors, who killed”
23:32	bpz8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	καὶ ὑμεῖς πληρώσατε τὸ μέτρον τῶν πατέρων ὑμῶν	1	Jesus is speaking as if he wants the scribes and Pharisees literally to **fill up** a **measure** of a certain amount. This represents them completing the wicked behavior that their ancestors began when they killed the prophets. If it would be helpful for your readers, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Now you finish the sins your ancestors began when they killed the prophets”
23:32	hmsh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καὶ ὑμεῖς πληρώσατε τὸ μέτρον τῶν πατέρων ὑμῶν	1	The implication is that the scribes and Pharisees would **fill up the measure** of their **fathers** by killing the greatest prophet of all, the Messiah. You can provide this information in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “Now, by killing the Messiah, finish the sins your ancestors began when they killed the prophets”
23:32	vhes		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony	ὑμεῖς πληρώσατε τὸ μέτρον τῶν πατέρων ὑμῶν	1	Even though Jesus is using an imperative form, he does not actually want the Pharisees to **fill up the measure** of their **fathers** by killing him, the Messiah. If they did that, they would not be obeying a command from him. Instead, Jesus is using a figure of speech in which he says the opposite of what he means. He does that in order to warn the scribes and Pharisees about where their attitude and behavior will lead if they do not change those things. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express this meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “You should be very concerned, because if you do not stop resisting God, you will finish the sins of your ancestors by killing the Messiah”
23:33	va5c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	ὄφεις, γεννήματα ἐχιδνῶν	1	The terms **serpents** and **vipers** mean similar things. Both are names of poisonous snakes. Jesus is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single expression. Alternate translation: “poisonous snakes”
23:33	cfj3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ὄφεις, γεννήματα ἐχιδνῶν	1	Jesus is speaking of the scribes and Pharisees as if they were literally **serpents** and **offspring of vipers**. He means that they are evil. If it would be helpful for your readers, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “You evil people”
23:33	blv6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	γεννήματα ἐχιδνῶν	1	The expression **offspring of** figuratively describes a person who shares the qualities of something. In this case, **vipers** represent evil or harmful people. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent idiom from your language or express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “you who are harmful like vipers”
23:33	vi6c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	πῶς φύγητε ἀπὸ τῆς κρίσεως τῆς Γεέννης?	1	Jesus is using the question form to challenge the religious leaders. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “You will certainly not escape from the judgment of Gehenna”
23:33	u1ju		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	Γεέννης	1	See how you translated **Gehenna** in [5:30](../05/30.md).
23:35	l7ya		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἔλθῃ ἐφ’ ὑμᾶς	1	Jesus is speaking as if the **blood** of **righteous** people would literally **come upon** the scribes and Pharisees. He means that God would consider them guilty of shedding this blood. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “God might consider you guilty for shedding”

23:35	espy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	αἷμα δίκαιον	1	Jesus is speaking by association as if the **blood** of righteous people were **righteous** itself. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the blood of righteous people”
23:35	z95g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	ἀπὸ τοῦ αἵματος Ἂβελ τοῦ δικαίου, ἕως τοῦ αἵματος Ζαχαρίου, ὃν ἐφονεύσατε μεταξὺ τοῦ ναοῦ καὶ τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου	1	**Abel** was the first righteous victim of murder and **Zechariah**, who was murdered by Jews in the temple, was the last righteous person whose murder was recorded in the Hebrew Scriptures in the order in which the Jews of this time likely read them. Jesus is using these first and last men to represent all the righteous people who have been murdered. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “all throughout human history”
23:35	s11l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ὃν ἐφονεύσατε	1	By using the term **you**, Jesus is speaking as if the scribes and Pharisees he is addressing had killed **Zechariah**, but he means by association that their ancestors killed him.

23:37	vne9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe	Ἰερουσαλὴμ, Ἰερουσαλήμ	1	Jesus is figuratively addressing something that he knows cannot hear him, the city of Jerusalem, in order to show his listeners in a strong way how he feels about it. If it would be more natural in your language, you could show in your translation that Jesus is talking about Jerusalem rather than to Jerusalem. Alternate translation: “I am very upset with the city of Jerusalem”
23:37	tz4r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τοὺς ἀπεσταλμένους πρὸς αὐτήν	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Jesus implies that God did it. Alternate translation: “the ones whom God sent to you”
23:37	t9y7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τὰ τέκνα σου	1	Jesus is speaking as if Jerusalem had **children**. If it would be helpful for your readers, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “those who live in you”
23:37	xv4t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	ὃν τρόπον ὄρνις ἐπισυνάγει τὰ νοσσία αὐτῆς ὑπὸ τὰς πτέρυγας	1	The point of this comparison is that Jesus wishes he could comfort and protect the people of Jerusalem, just as a **hen** does that for her **chicks**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “the way a hen gathers her chicks under her wings to comfort and protect them”
23:37	as8p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ὄρνις	1	A **hen** is a female chicken. You could translate this with the name of a bird familiar in your culture that protects her chicks under her wing.

Alternate translation: “your house will be left to you desolate”
23:38	ck2z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ὁ οἶκος ὑμῶν	1	Jesus is speaking of the city of Jerusalem as if it were a **house** in which its people lived. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “your city”

24:intro	h2a2				0	# Matthew 24 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nIn this chapter, Jesus begins to prophesy about the future from that time until he returns as king of everything. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]])\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### “The end of the age”\n\nIn this chapter, Jesus gives an answer to his disciples when they ask how they will know when he will come again. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-apocalyptic]])\n\n### The example of Noah\n\nIn the time of Noah, God sent a great flood to punish people for their sins. He warned them many times about this coming flood, but it actually began suddenly. In this chapter, Jesus draws a comparison between that flood and the last days. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])\n\n## Important translation issues in this chapter\n\n### “Let”\n\nThe ULT uses this word to begin several commands of Jesus, such as “let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains” (24:16), “let him who is on the housetop not go down to take anything out of his house” (24:17), and “let him who is in the field not return to take his cloak” (24:18). There are many different ways to form a command. Translators may select the most natural ways in their own languages.\n\n### “The one”\n\nSeveral times in this chapter, Jesus speaks of “the one” who does a certain thing. (Matthew himself uses that phrase in verse 15.) This phrase does not refer to a specific person. It refers to anyone who performs the action that it names. Express this in the way that would be most natural in your language. For example, in verse 13, Jesus says that “the one having endured to the end, he will be saved.” You might say that “whoever endures to the end will be saved.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])
24:1	ke79		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἀπὸ τοῦ ἱεροῦ	1	Here, **temple** is referring to the courtyard around the temple. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that in your translation. Alternate translation: “from the courtyard of the temple”
24:2	mh5y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	οὐ βλέπετε ταῦτα πάντα	1	Jesus is using the question form to challenge his disciples. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “Certainly you see all of these things!”
24:2	ecdz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	οὐ μὴ ἀφεθῇ ὧδε λίθος ἐπὶ λίθον, ὃς οὐ καταλυθήσεται	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who will do the action. Alternate translation: “Your enemies will not leave one stone upon another here, but will tear them down”
24:3	e1is		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τῆς σῆς παρουσίας, καὶ συντελείας τοῦ αἰῶνος	1	Here, **your coming** refers to when Jesus will come in power, establishing God’s reign on earth and bringing this **age** to an end. Alternate translation: “that you are about to come and reign in power and that the world is about to end”
24:3	uf7g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	καθημένου & αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τοῦ Ὄρους τῶν Ἐλαιῶν, προσῆλθον αὐτῷ οἱ μαθηταὶ	1	Here, the pronouns **he** and **him** refer to Jesus. If it would be helpful in your language, you could clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “as Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples approached Jesus”
24:3	pudy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	προσῆλθον αὐτῷ οἱ μαθηταὶ κατ’ ἰδίαν λέγοντες, εἰπὲ ἡμῖν πότε ταῦτα ἔσται, καὶ τί τὸ σημεῖον τῆς σῆς παρουσίας, καὶ συντελείας τοῦ αἰῶνος?	1	If the direct quotation inside a direct quotation would be confusing in your language, you could translate the second direct quotation as an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: “the disciples came to him by themselves asked Jesus to tell them when these things would be and what would be the sign of his coming and the end of the age”
24:4	s64s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	βλέπετε μή τις ὑμᾶς πλανήσῃ	1	See how you translated the similar expression in [22:29](../22/29.md). Alternate translation: “Be careful that no one deceives you”
24:4-5	q6q1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	βλέπετε μή τις ὑμᾶς πλανήσῃ. πολλοὶ γὰρ ἐλεύσονται ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματί μου λέγοντες, ἐγώ εἰμι ὁ Χριστός; καὶ πολλοὺς πλανήσουσιν	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “Since many will come in my name saying, ‘I am the Christ,’ and will lead many astray, you ought to be careful not to be led astray”
24:5	w7i0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	πολλοὶ γὰρ ἐλεύσονται ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματί μου λέγοντες, ἐγώ εἰμι ὁ Χριστός; καὶ πολλοὺς πλανήσουσιν	1	If the direct quotation inside a direct quotation would be confusing in your language, you could translate the second direct quotation as an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: “For many will come in my name saying that they are the Christ, and they will lead many people astray”
24:5	lq71		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματί μου	1	Here, Jesus uses the word **name** to mean identity. The people he is talking about will likely not say that their name is Jesus, they will claim to be the Messiah. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “claiming to be me”
24:5	twh8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	πλανήσουσιν	1	See how you translated the similar expression in the previous verse.
24:6	pgdl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	μελλήσετε & ἀκούειν πολέμους, καὶ ἀκοὰς πολέμων	1	This probably means implicitly that the disciples will hear about wars that are definitely happening and about wars that may be happening (**reports of wars**). If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly in your translation. Alternate translation: “you are going to hear about wars that are definitely happening and about wars that may be happening”
24:6	hdz3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ὁρᾶτε, μὴ θροεῖσθε	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you can state this in active form. Alternate translation: “Do not let these things trouble you”
24:6	fvq7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὸ τέλος	1	Here, **the end** implicitly means “the end of the world.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could say that explicitly, as the UST models.
24:7	ygf2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	ἐγερθήσεται γὰρ ἔθνος ἐπὶ ἔθνος, καὶ βασιλεία ἐπὶ βασιλείαν	1	These two phrases mean basically the same thing. Jesus is likely using repetition for emphasis. If it would be helpful in your language, you could combine these two phrases into one phrase. Alternate translation: “Different groups of people will attack each other”
24:7	xuow		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐγερθήσεται & ἔθνος ἐπὶ ἔθνος, καὶ βασιλεία ἐπὶ βασιλείαν	1	Here, **nation** and **kingdom** represent the people who live within them. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the people of one nation will rise up against the people of another nation, and the people of one kingdom against the people of another kingdom”
24:7	tc4y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	ἐγερθήσεται & ἔθνος ἐπὶ ἔθνος, καὶ βασιλεία ἐπὶ βασιλείαν	1	The word **kingdom** represents kingdoms in general, not one particular kingdom. The word **nation** represents nations in general, not one particular nation. Alternate translation: “some nations will attack other nations, and some kingdoms will attack other kingdoms”
24:7	fmy4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐγερθήσεται & ἐπὶ	1	The phrase **rise against** is an idiom that means to attack. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent idiom or use plain language. Alternate translation: “will attack”
24:7	xo7r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	βασιλεία ἐπὶ βασιλείαν	1	Jesus is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from earlier in the sentence if it would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “kingdom will rise up against kingdom”
24:8	cnrt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πάντα δὲ ταῦτα	1	Here, **all these things** refers to the things that Jesus has said will happen. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express that explicitly. Alternate translation: “These things that I have just described”
24:8	q4gl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἀρχὴ ὠδίνων	1	Jesus uses the image of **birth pains** to indicate that in the same way that the pain of childbirth is eventually replaced by joy when the child is born, so the suffering that is experienced by true believers will eventually be replaced by joy when Christ returns. Because childbirth occurs in all cultures, you may wish to retain this metaphor in your translation. You could express it as a simile if your language would not say directly that **these things** are **birth pangs**. Alternate translation: “These events will be like the first pains a woman suffers when she is about to give birth to a child”

24:10	kvbw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	σκανδαλισθήσονται πολλοὶ	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

24:11	mi2e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐγερθήσονται	1	Here, **will be raised up** is an idiom that means “will come.” If this phrase does not have that meaning in your language, use an idiom from your language that does have this meaning or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “will come”
24:11	tjb3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	καὶ πλανήσουσιν πολλούς	1	See how you translated **lead … astray** in [24:4](../24/04.md).

24:12	w4af		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τὸ πληθυνθῆναι τὴν ἀνομίαν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **lawlessness**, you could express the same idea with a verbal form. Alternate translation: “people will commit more lawless deeds”
24:12	bu9b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ψυγήσεται ἡ ἀγάπη τῶν πολλῶν	1	Jesus is speaking as if the **love of many** would literally **grow cold**. This could mean: (1) Alternate translation: “many people will no longer love other people” (2) Alternate translation: “many people will no longer love God”

24:13	sheo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	ὁ δὲ ὑπομείνας εἰς τέλος	1	As the General Notes to this chapter discuss, the phrase **the one** does not refer to a specific person.

24:14	x3e6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	κηρυχθήσεται τοῦτο τὸ εὐαγγέλιον τῆς βασιλείας	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Jesus implies that his disciples will do it. Alternate translation: “my disciples will preach this gospel of the kingdom”
24:14	opuo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τοῦτο τὸ εὐαγγέλιον τῆς βασιλείας	1	Here, **kingdom** refers to God’s rule as king. If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **kingdom**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “the message about how God rules as a king over his people”

24:15	lhas		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὸ βδέλυγμα τῆς ἐρημώσεως	1	The phrase **the abomination of desolation** is found in [Daniel 9:27](../dan/09/27.md), [Daniel 11:31](../11/31.md), and [Daniel 12:11](../12/11.md). Jesus’ audience would have been familiar with those passages, which prophesy about **the abomination** defiling the temple. If it would be helpful in your language, you could indicate the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “the shameful thing that defiles the temple”
24:15	lz9p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks	ὁ ἀναγινώσκων νοείτω	1	The phrase **Let the one reading understand** is not Jesus speaking. Matthew added this to get his readers to pay attention to this warning. If it would be helpful in your language, you could show that this is not part of Jesus’ direct speech by not enclosing it within quotation marks or in some other way that is natural in your language.
24:17	iv2j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὁ ἐπὶ τοῦ δώματος, μὴ καταβάτω ἆραι τὰ ἐκ τῆς οἰκίας αὐτοῦ	1	Where Jesus lived, the tops of houses were flat. People would eat and do other activities on top of their houses. Jesus assumes that his hearers know this and that they know that the roofs were accessed by an exterior staircase at the back of the house, distant from the entry at the front. If it would be helpful in your language, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “the person who is on top of his roof should escape immediately by the back stairway and not enter his house to get anything”
24:18	a6c2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καὶ ὁ ἐν τῷ ἀγρῷ, μὴ ἐπιστρεψάτω ὀπίσω ἆραι τὸ ἱμάτιον αὐτοῦ	1	People in Jesus’ time often walked from their towns to the field that they worked in during the day.

If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express that explicitly. Alternate translation: “let the one working the field not return to his town to get his cloak before fleeing”
24:18	duz4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τὸ ἱμάτιον	1	See how you translated **cloak** in [5:40](../05/40.md).
24:19	kq12		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ταῖς ἐν γαστρὶ ἐχούσαις	1	The phrase **having in the womb** is an idiom that refers to women who are expecting babies. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent idiom or use plain language. Alternate translation: “to women who are pregnant”
24:19	piql		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ταῖς θηλαζούσαις	1	This does not mean babies who are nursing but women who are nursing babies (providing their milk for them).

25:intro	qe8a				0	# Matthew 25 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nThis chapter continues the teaching of the previous chapter.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### The parable of the ten virgins\n\nJesus told the parable of the ten virgins in [25:1–13](../25/01.md) to tell his followers to be ready for him to return. His hearers could understand the parable because they knew Jewish wedding customs. When the Jews arranged marriages, they would plan for the wedding to take place weeks or months later. At the appointed time, the bridegroom would go to his bride’s house and she would be waiting for him there. The wedding ceremony would take place, and then the man and his bride would travel to his home, where there would be a feast. In this parable, the bridegroom represents Jesus, the five foolish virgins represent false believers in Jesus who do not prepare for Jesus’ return, and the five wise virgins represent true Christians who are ready for Jesus to come back at the end of the world. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])\n\n### The parable of the talents\n\nJesus told the parable of the talents in [25:14–30](../25/14.md) to teach that true Christians use the blessings that God gives them in order to live fruitful lives that glorify him. Jesus’ hearers could understand the parable because they knew about investing money and the relationship between masters and slaves. In this parable, the master represents Jesus, the “talents” (a form of money) represent blessings from God, the two good slaves represent true Christians who faithfully use the blessings that God gives them, and the wicked slave represents false believers in Jesus.\n\nA talent was a unit of weight that, when used for precious metals, was also a unit of money. One talent weighed nearly 30 kilograms or over 60 pounds. One silver talent was the equivalent of over 16 years’ wages for a laborer. You could try to express this amount in terms of current monetary values, but that might cause your Bible translation to become outdated and inaccurate, since those values can change over time. So instead you might state something more general or give the equivalent in wages. See the suggestions at each occurrence of the word “talent” in this chapter. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]] and rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney]])
25:1	em28		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τότε	1	Here, **Then** refers to the time in the future when Jesus will return to the world.

26:intro	mtq8				0	# Matthew 26 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in [26:31](../26/31.md), which is quoted from the Old Testament.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Sheep\n\nSheep are a common image used in Scripture to refer to the people of Israel. In [26:31](../26/31.md), however, Jesus uses the words “the sheep” to refer to his disciples and to say that they would run away when he was arrested.\n\n### Passover\n\nThe Passover festival was when the Jews celebrated the day God killed the firstborn sons of the Egyptians but “passed over” the Israelites and let them live.\n\n### The meaning of the “body” and “blood” of Jesus\n\n[26:26–28](./26.md) describes Jesus’ last meal with his followers. During this meal, Jesus said of the bread, “This is my body,” and of the wine, “This is my blood of the covenant, that is being poured out for many.” As Jesus instructed, Christian churches around the world re-enact this meal regularly, calling it “the Lord’s Supper,” the “Eucharist”, or “Holy Communion.” But they have different understandings of what Jesus meant by these sayings. Some churches believe that Jesus was speaking figuratively and that he meant that the bread and wine represented his body and blood. Other churches believe that he was speaking literally and that the actual body and blood of Jesus are really present in the bread and wine of this ceremony. Translators should be careful not to let how they understand this issue affect how they translate this passage.\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### Judas’ kiss for Jesus\n\n[26:49](../mat/26/49.md) describes how Judas kissed Jesus so the soldiers would know whom to arrest. In this culture, when men greeted other men who were family or friends, they would **kiss** them on one cheek or on both cheeks. If your readers would find it embarrassing if you said that one man would kiss another man, you could explain the purpose of the gesture, or you could translate the expression in a more general way. You might say, for example, that Judas “kissed Jesus on the cheek as a greeting” or that Judas “gave Jesus a friendly greeting.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])\n\n### “I am able to destroy the temple of God”\n\nTwo men accused Jesus of saying that he could destroy the temple in Jerusalem and then rebuild it “in three days” ([26:61](../26/61.md)). They were accusing him of insulting God by claiming that God had given him the authority to destroy the temple and the power to rebuild it. What Jesus actually said was that if the Jewish authorities were to destroy this temple, he would certainly raise it up in three days ([John 2:19](../jhn/02/19.md)).

27:intro	deu4				0	# Matthew 27 General Notes\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### “The curtain of the temple was split in two”\n\nThe curtain in the temple was an important symbol that showed that people needed to have someone speak to God for them. They could not speak to God directly, because all people are sinful and God hates sin. God split the curtain to show that Jesus’ people can now speak to God directly because Jesus has paid for their sins.\n\n### The tomb\n\nThe tomb in which Jesus was buried ([27:60](../27/60.md)) was the kind of tomb in which wealthy Jewish families buried their dead. It was an actual room cut into a rock. It had a flat place on one side where they could place the body after they had put oil and spices on it and wrapped it in cloth. Then they would roll a large rock in front of the tomb so no one could see inside or enter.\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### Sarcasm\n\nIn [27:28–29](../27/28.md) the soldiers were insulting Jesus when they put a “scarlet robe” on him, placed a “crown of thorns” on his head, said, “Hail, King of the Jews,” and knelt down in front of him. These actions were symbolic of things that people would do to honor a king, but the soldiers did not really believe that Jesus was a king. By pretending that they thought Jesus was a king, and by putting a “crown of thorns” on Jesus’ head instead of a regular crown, and by spitting on him and “striking him on his head” (See: [27:30](../27/30.md)) the soldiers showed that they did not believe that Jesus was the Son of God. (See: [[rc:///ta/man/translate/figs-irony]] and [[rc:///ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]]) and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/mock]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Golgotha\n\nThe word “Golgotha” is an Aramaic word. Matthew used Greek letters to express the sound of this Aramaic word so that his readers would know how it sounded, and then he told them it meant “Place of a Skull.” You may also use the letters of your language to express the sound of this Aramaic word. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate]])\n\n### Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?\n\nThis is an Aramaic phrase. Matthew used Greek letters to express the sound of this Aramaic phrase so that his readers would know how it sounded, and then he told them that it meant “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” You may also use the letters of your language to express the sounds of these Aramaic words. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate]])

27:22	kkus		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	σταυρωθήτω	1	The Romans executed some criminals by nailing them to a wooden beam with a crossbar and setting the beam upright so that the criminals would slowly suffocate. That was what it meant to have someone **crucified**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “Let him be nailed to a cross” or “Let him be executed!”
27:22	uedb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	σταυρωθήτω	1	Here, the phrase **Let him be crucified** is an imperative, but since the crowd cannot command Pilate to do this, you could translate this phrase as an expression of what they want. Alternate translation: “We want you to nail him to a cross to execute him”
27:23	m5jm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τί γὰρ κακὸν ἐποίησεν?	1	Pilate does not expect the crowd to tell him what Jesus has done wrong. Rather, he is using the question form to emphasize to the crowd that Jesus is innocent. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “There is no reason to execute this man, because he has not done anything wrong!”
27:23	bijy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	κακὸν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **evil**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “evil thing”

Use the most natural way in your language to indicate a reason. Alternate translation: “because he saw that he was accomplishing nothing, but instead a riot was starting”
27:24	gefl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture	οὐδὲν ὠφελεῖ & θόρυβος γίνεται	1	To call attention to a development in the story, Matthew uses the present tense in past narration. If it would not be natural to do that in your language, you can use the past tense in your translation. Alternate translation: “he was accomplishing nothing … a riot was starting”
27:24	yj8t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	ἀπενίψατο τὰς χεῖρας ἀπέναντι τοῦ ὄχλου	1	Pilate **washed his hands** as a sign to the people that he was not responsible for Jesus’ death.

27:24	u1fe		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τοῦ αἵματος	1	Here Pilate uses **blood** to refer to a person’s death. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the death”

27:25	n5k1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τὸ αἷμα	1	See how you translated the same use of **blood** in the previous verse.
27:25	timm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἡμᾶς & ἡμῶν	1	Here, **us** and **our** refer to the Jewish people, so **us** and **our** would be exclusive. Your language may require you to mark these forms.
27:25	bsfd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τὰ τέκνα	1	Here, **children** refers to future descendants in general, not only to the **children** of the people who were speaking. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “future generations”
27:26	yb5y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἀπέλυσεν & παρέδωκεν ἵνα σταυρωθῇ	1	The first two occurrences of **he** refer to Pilate, but **him** and the third occurrence of **he** refer to **Jesus**.

If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “he commanded his soldiers to release Barabbas … having commanded his soldiers to flog Jesus”
27:26	adak		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	φραγελλώσας	1	If your readers would not be familiar with this form of punishment, you could explain explicitly what flogging was. Flogging was a Roman penalty in which soldiers whipped a person with a whip to which were attached pieces of bone and metal to increase the whip’s capacity to do harm to the person being flogged. Alternate translation: “having whipped Jesus with a whip to which someone had attached pieces of bone and metal”
27:26	n421		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	παρέδωκεν	1	Matthew is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete.

27:26	y3kf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	σταυρωθῇ	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “they would crucify him”

27:27	bn22		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὅλην τὴν σπεῖραν	1	Matthew assumes that his readers will know that a **cohort** was a unit of Roman soldiers. A **cohort** normally numbered around 600 men but could sometimes refer to as few as 200 men. Here, by saying **the whole cohort**, Matthew most likely means that all the soldiers from the **cohort** who were on duty at that time. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “the whole unit of soldiers” or “the whole unit of soldiers who were on duty there”
27:28	nx81			καὶ ἐκδύσαντες αὐτὸν	1	Alternate translation: “And having pulled off his clothes”
27:28	id2a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	χλαμύδα κοκκίνην περιέθηκαν αὐτῷ	1	In Roman culture, a **scarlet robe** was worn by kings.

See the discussion of this in the General Notes for this chapter. Alternate translation: “they put a scarlet robe on him in order to mock him by pretending that they believed he really was a king”
27:28	yf6s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	κοκκίνην	1	The word **scarlet** refers to a color. Since Mark records in [Mark 15:17](../mrk/15/17.md) that the color of this **robe** was “purple,” the color closely resembled both **scarlet** and “purple.” If your readers would be unfamiliar with these colors, you could use the closest equivalent color that they would be familiar with. Alternate translation: “dark red” or “crimson”
27:29	ksjn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	στέφανον ἐξ ἀκανθῶν	1	Matthew is using the possessive form to describe a **crown** that is made from branches with **thorns** on them.

27:29	km30		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	ἀκανθῶν	1	Matthew uses the word **thorns** to refer to small branches with **thorns** on them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “thorny branches”

In order to mock Jesus, the soldiers put a **crown** made from **thorns** on Jesus’ head and put **a reed in his right hand** that resembled a king’s scepter. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this explicitly. See the discussion of this in the General Notes for this chapter.

27:29	dlz7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony	γονυπετήσαντες	1	The act of kneeling down was normally done as a way of honoring kings. The soldiers actually mean to communicate the opposite of the literal meaning of this action. These soldiers do not really believe that Jesus is a king, but rather, they have **knelt down** to mock him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could provide a brief explanation. See the discussion of this in the General Notes for this chapter. Alternate translation: “having knelt down as if honoring a king”
27:29	qf8j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony	ἐνέπαιξαν αὐτῷ λέγοντες, χαῖρε, ὁ Βασιλεῦ τῶν Ἰουδαίων	1	**Hail** was a common greeting, but the soldiers used this greeting in order to mock Jesus. They did not believe that Jesus was really the **King of the Jews**. They actually meant to communicate the opposite of the literal meaning of their words, as Matthew indicates when he says that **they mocked him**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different expression. Alternate translation: “they mocked him by saying, ‘Hail, you so-called King of the Jews’”

27:32	m5bl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	δὲ	1	**Now** here indicates that this verse is a break in the main story line. Matthew does this in order to give information about **Simon** from **Cyrene**. Use the natural form in your language for expressing background information.
27:32	d0ps		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	ἐξερχόμενοι	1	Your language may say “going out” rather than **coming out** in contexts such as this. Use whichever is more natural.

Alternate translation: “a place that people called Golgotha, which means”
27:33	lopg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate	Γολγοθᾶ	1	Here Matthew writes out the sounds of this Jewish Aramaic word using Greek letters. Since Matthew translates the meaning later in the verse, you may write out this word using the most similar sounds in your language. See the discussion of **Golgotha** in the General Notes for this chapter.
27:34	f11j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	πιεῖν οἶνον μετὰ χολῆς μεμιγμένον	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

They were tossed onto the ground to see which marked side would come up on top. If your readers would not be familiar with **lots**, you could use a general expression for gambling. Alternate translation: “by gambling”
27:35	u4dl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	βάλλοντες κλῆρον	1	Matthew implies that the soldiers were **casting lots** in order to determine who would take which pieces of Jesus’ clothing.

28:intro	psw9				0	# Matthew 28 General Notes\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### The tomb\n\nThe tomb in which Jesus was buried ([28:1](../28/01.md)) was the kind of tomb in which wealthy Jewish families buried their dead. It was an actual room cut into a rock. It had a flat place on one side where they could place the body after they had put oil and spices on it and wrapped it in cloth. Then they would roll a large rock in front of the tomb so no one could see inside or enter. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/tomb]])\n\n### “Make disciples”\n\nThe last two verses ([28:19–20](../28/19.md)) are commonly known as “The Great Commission” because they contain a very important command given to all Christians. Christians are to “make disciples” by going to people, sharing the gospel with them, and training them to live according to what Jesus commanded. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/disciple]])\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### An angel of the Lord\n\nMatthew, Mark, Luke, and John all wrote about angels in white clothing appearing to the women at Jesus’ tomb. Two of the authors called them men, but that is only because the angels looked like male humans. Two of the authors wrote about two angels, but the other two authors wrote about only one of them. It is best to translate each of these passages as it appears in the ULT without trying to make the passages all say exactly the same thing. (See: [Matthew 28:1–2](../mat/28/01.md) and [Mark 16:5](../mrk/16/05.md) and [Luke 24:4](../luk/24/04.md) and [John 20:12](../jhn/20/12.md))

28:1	avwc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	εἰς μίαν σαββάτων	1	Matthew uses **first** to imply the **first** day **of the week**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “on the first day of the week”
28:1	gs43		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal	μίαν σαββάτων	1	Here Matthew is actually using a cardinal number, “one,” in the original language to mean **first**. If your language does not use ordinal numbers, you can also use a cardinal number here in your translation. Alternate translation: “on day one of the week”
28:1	zu2b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἡ ἄλλη Μαρία	1	This **Mary** is the mother of James and Joseph, as stated in [27:56](../27/56.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this explicitly. See how you translated **the other Mary** in [27:61](../27/61.md)

28:2	l4s2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	Here, **for** indicates that what follows is the reason why the **earthquake happened**. Use the most natural way in your language to indicate a reason. Alternate translation: “due to the fact that”

28:3	qloc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	δὲ	1	**Now** here indicates that this verse is a break in the main story line. Matthew does this in order to give information about an angel at Jesus’ tomb. Use the natural form in your language for expressing background information.

28:3	i4hp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	τὸ ἔνδυμα αὐτοῦ λευκὸν ὡς χιών	1	Matthew is leaving out a word that a clause would need in many languages to be complete.

28:3	bzow		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	λευκὸν ὡς χιών	1	The point of this comparison is that the **clothing** of the angel was pure **white**, as **snow** is pure white.

28:3	orq7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	λευκὸν ὡς χιών	1	Matthew is comparing the angel’s clothing to **snow** because **snow** is a very white substance.

Alternate translation: “white as cotton” or “very, very white”
28:4	u00v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἀπὸ & τοῦ φόβου αὐτοῦ, ἐσείσθησαν οἱ τηροῦντες	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

28:4	b1ic		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	ἐγενήθησαν ὡς νεκροί	1	Matthew compares **the guards** to **dead men** because **dead men** lie on the ground and do no move.

Alternate translation: “tell his disciples that he has been raised up from the dead ones. And behold, he is going ahead of you to Galilee. There you will see him”
28:7	r5cw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἠγέρθη ἀπὸ τῶν νεκρῶν	1	See how you translated this sentence in [27:64](../27/64.md).
28:7	a1ir		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ & ἰδοὺ	1	The angel uses **behold** twice in this verse because he wants the disciples to focus their attention on what he is saying. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “pay attention … Pay attention to what”
28:7	ljb2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	ὑμᾶς & ὄψεσθε & ὑμῖν	1	All occurrences of **you** are plural in this verse and refer to the disciples. You may need to translate these as plural in your language.

28:10	hfkc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture	λέγει	1	To call attention to a development in the story, Matthew uses the present tense in past narration. If it would not be natural to do that in your language, you could use the past tense in your translation. Alternate translation: “said”
