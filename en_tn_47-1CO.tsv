Against sexual immorality (4:16–6:20)\n4. On abstinence (7:1–40)\n5. On food (8:1–11:1)\n6. On head coverings (11:2–16)\n7. On the Lord’s Supper (11:17-34)\n8. On spiritual gifts (12:1–14:40)\n9. On the resurrection of the dead (15:1–58)\n10. On the collection and visits (16:1–12)\n11. Closing: final commands and greetings (16:13–24)\n\n### Who wrote the Book of 1 Corinthians?\n\nPaul wrote 1 Corinthians. Paul was from the city of Tarsus. He had been known as Saul in his early life. Before becoming a Christian, Paul was a Pharisee. He persecuted Christians. After he became a Christian, he traveled several times throughout the Roman Empire telling people about Jesus.\n\nPaul started the church that met in Corinth. He was staying in the city of Ephesus when he wrote this letter.\n\n### What is the Book of 1 Corinthians about?\n\n1 Corinthians is a letter that Paul wrote to the believers who were in the city of Corinth. Paul had heard that there were problems among the believers there. They were arguing with each other. Some of them did not understand some of the Christian teachings. And some of them were behaving badly. In this letter, Paul responded to them and encouraged them to live in a way that pleased God.\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nTranslators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “First Corinthians.” Or they may choose a clearer title, such as “Paul’s First Letter to the Church in Corinth.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### What was the city of Corinth like?\n\nCorinth was a major city located in ancient Greece. Because it was near the Mediterranean Sea, many travelers and traders came to buy and sell goods there. This resulted in the city having people from many different cultures. The city was famous for having people who lived in immoral ways. The people worshipped Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love. As part of the ceremonies honoring Aphrodite, her worshipers had sexual intercourse with temple prostitutes.\n\n### What was the problem with meat sacrificed to idols?\n\nMany animals were slaughtered and sacrificed to the false gods in Corinth. Priests and worshipers kept some of the meat. Much of the meat was sold in markets. Many Christians disagreed with each other over whether it was right for them to eat this meat, because it had been dedicated to a false god. Paul writes about this problem in 1 Corinthians.\n\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\n\n### What do “knowledge” and “wisdom” mean in 1 Corinthians?\n\n### How are the ideas of “holy” and “sanctify” represented in 1 Corinthians in the ULT?\n\nThe scriptures use such words to indicate any one of various ideas. For this reason, it is often difficult for translators to represent them well in their versions. In translating into English, 1 Corinthians ULT uses the following principles:\n\n* Sometimes the meaning in a passage implies moral holiness. Especially important for understanding the gospel is the fact that God considers Christians to be sinless because they are united to Jesus Christ. Another related fact is that God is perfect and faultless. A third fact is that Christians are to conduct themselves in a blameless, faultless manner in life. In these cases, the ULT uses “holy,” “holy God,” “holy ones,” or “holy people.” (See: 1:2; 3:17)\n* Sometimes the meaning in a passage indicates a simple reference to Christians without implying any particular role filled by them. In these cases, the ULT uses “believer” or “believers.” (See: 6:1, 2; 14:33; 16:1, 15)\n* Sometimes the meaning in the passage implies the idea of someone or something set apart for God alone. In these cases, the ULT uses “set apart,” “dedicated to,” “reserved for,” or “sanctified.” (See: 1:2; 6:11; 7:14, 34)\n\nThe UST will often be helpful as translators think about how to represent these ideas in their own versions.\n\n### What is the meaning of “flesh?”\n\nPaul frequently used the terms “flesh” or “fleshly” to refer to Christians who did sinful things. However, it is not the physical world that is evil. Paul also described Christians who lived in a righteous way as “spiritual.” This is because they did what the Holy Spirit taught them to do. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/flesh]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/spirit]])\n\n### What did Paul mean by the expression “in Christ,” “in the Lord,” etc.?\n\nThis kind of expression occurs in 1:2, 30, 31; 3:1; 4:10, 15, 17; 6:11, 19; 7:22; 9:1, 2; 11:11, 25; 12:3, 9, 13, 18, 25; 14:16; 15:18, 19, 22, 31, 58; 16:19, 24. Paul meant to express the idea of a very close union with Christ and the believers. At the same time, he often intended other meanings as well. See, for example, “those who have been dedicated in Christ Jesus” (1:2), where Paul specifically meant that Christian believers have been dedicated to Christ.\n\nPlease see the introduction to the Book of Romans for more details about this kind of expression.\n\n### What are the major issues in the text of the Book of 1 Corinthians?\n\nFor the following verses, modern versions of the Bible differ from older versions. Translators are advised to follow the modern versions of the Bible. However, if in the translators’ region there are Bibles that read according to older versions of the Bible, the translators can follow those. If so, these verses should be put inside square brackets (\\[\\]) to indicate that they were probably not original to 1 Corinthians.\n\n* “Therefore glorify God with your body.” Some older versions read “Therefore glorify God with your body and in your spirit, which are God’s.” (6:20)\n* “I did this even though I myself was not under the law” (9:20). Some older versions leave this passage out.\n* “for the sake of conscience--the conscience of the other man.” Some older versions read “for the sake of conscience: for the earth and everything in it belong to the Lord: the conscience of the other man.” (10:28)\n* “and that I give my body to be burned” (13:3). Some older versions read, “and that I give my body so that I might boast.”\n* “But if anyone does not recognize this, let him not be recognized” (14:38). Some older versions read, “But if anyone is ignorant of this, let him be ignorant.”\n\n(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
1CO	1	intro	ud5y			0		# 1 Corinthians 1 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n1. Opening (1:1–9)\n      * Greetings and Blessing (1:1–3)\n      * Praise and Prayer (1:4–9)\n2. Against divisions (1:10–4:15)\n      * Divisions, Leaders, and Baptism (1:10–17)\n      * Wisdom, Foolishness, and Boasting (1:18–31)\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the words of verse 19, which are from the Old Testament.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Disunity\n\nIn this chapter, Paul urges the Corinthians to stop dividing up into smaller groups that identify themselves with one specific leader. He mentions some of the leaders, including himself, in [1:12](../01/12.md). The Corinthians probably chose these leaders themselves, since there is no evidence that any of the people mentioned in [1:12](../01/12.md) were trying to create their own groups. People in the Corinthian church were probably trying to sound wiser or more powerful than other people, so they would choose a group and a leader and say they were better than others. Paul argues against these kinds of divisions first, and then he argues against anyone who tries to sound wiser and more powerful than others.\n\n### Wisdom and foolishness\n\nThroughout this chapter, Paul speaks of both wisdom and foolishness. These words do not refer primarily to how much or how little education someone has. Rather, they refer to how well or how poorly someone plans actions and knows how the world works. If someone creates plans and ideas that work out well, that person is wise. If someone creates plans and ideas that do not work out well, that person is foolish. The wise person makes good choices, and the foolish person makes bad choices. Use words in your language that indicate these ideas. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/wise]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/fool]])\n\n### Power and weakness\n\nThroughout this chapter, Paul speaks of both power and weakness. These words primarily refer to how much influence and authority a person has and to how much they can accomplish. Someone who has “power” has much influence and authority and can accomplish many things. Someone who has “weakness” does not have much influence and authority and is not able to accomplish many things. Use words in your language that indicate these ideas (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/power]])\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Metaphors about Christ\n\nIn this chapter, Paul says that “Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God” ([1:24](../01/24.md)) and that Christ “was made for us wisdom from God, righteousness, and also sanctification and redemption” ([1:30](../01/30.md)). With these two verses, Paul is not saying that Christ is no longer a person and is instead these abstract ideas. Rather, Paul is speaking in this way because Christ and his work for believers include all of these abstract ideas. Christ’s work is powerful and wise, and gives those who believe in him wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. For ways to translate these two statements, see the notes on these two verses.\n\n### Rhetorical questions\n\nPaul asks many questions in this chapter. He is not asking these questions because he wants the Corinthians to provide him with information. Rather, he is asking these questions because he wants the Corinthians to think about how they are acting and what they are thinking. The questions encourage them to think along with Paul. For ways to translate these questions, look for the notes on each verse that includes these kinds of questions. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Positive and negative uses of “wisdom”\n\nThroughout this chapter, Paul speaks about wisdom in both positive and negative ways. He uses the same words throughout the chapter, and he distinguishes between positive and negative meanings by connecting the words to different people or ideas. For example, he speaks of wisdom negatively when it is the wisdom of the world, or the wisdom of humans. However, he speaks of wisdom positively when it is wisdom from God or wisdom given by God. If possible, translate the negative and positive meanings of wisdom with the same word, just as Paul uses one word for both negative and positive. If you must use different words, use positive words for God’s wisdom and negative words for human wisdom.\n\n### Using different perspectives\n\nSometimes, Paul speaks of God as if God were “foolish” and “weak” ([1:25](../01/25.md)) and as if he chose “foolish” and “weak” things ([1:27](../01/27.md)). Paul does not actually think that God is foolish and weak and chooses foolish and weak things. Rather, he is speaking from the perspective of normal human thinking. What God does, from a human perspective, is “weak” and “foolish.” He makes this clear in several verses. For example, in [1:26](../01/26.md), Paul says that most of the Corinthians were not wise “according to the flesh.” This is Paul’s way of saying that they were not wise according to human thinking. If possible translate the times Paul speaks from a human perspective with the same words he uses for “weakness” and “foolishness” when he speaks from God’s perspective. If it is necessary to distinguish these uses, use a word or phrase that explains which perspective Paul is using. He does this himself sometimes, and if it is necessary, you can do it in other places as well.\n\n### Information presented out of order\n\nThe ULT puts parentheses around [1:16](../01/16.md) because Paul is speaking about whom he baptized, an idea that fits logically with [1:14](../01/14.md) and not as well after [1:15](../01/15.md). Paul has remembered someone else that he baptized, and instead of going back and putting that information in [1:14](../01/14.md), he includes it in [1:16](../01/16.md), interrupting the flow of the argument. If possible, keep [1:16](../01/16.md) where it is, and use a form in your language that indicates that Paul is interrupting his argument. If there is no way to do this in your language, you could move it between [1:14](../01/14.md) and [1:15](../01/15.md).

1CO	1	1	o7ie	figs-123person	Παῦλος	1		In this culture, letter writers would give their own names first, referring to themselves in the third person. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you can use the first person here. Or if your language has a particular way of introducing the author of a letter, and if it would be helpful to your readers, you can use it here. Alternate translation: “From Paul. I have been” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

1CO	1	1	qp1n	figs-activepassive	κλητὸς ἀπόστολος Χριστοῦ Ἰησοῦ	1	Sosthenes our brother	If this form would be misunderstood in your language, you could express **called by Christ Jesus {to be} an apostle** in active form. Alternate translation: “whom Christ Jesus called {to be} an apostle” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1CO	1	1	qvn5	figs-possession	διὰ θελήματος Θεοῦ	1		Here, Paul uses the possessive form to describe **the will** that **God** has.

Alternate translation: “because God desired this” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
1CO	1	1	xfbo	figs-explicit	καὶ Σωσθένης	1		This phrase means that Sosthenes is with Paul, and Paul writes the letter for both of them. It does not mean that Sosthenes was the scribe who wrote the letter down. It also does not mean that Sosthenes dictated the letter with Paul, since Paul uses the first person singular more than the first person plural in the letter. If there is a way in your language to indicate that Paul writes in behalf of Sosthenes, you can use it here. Alternate translation: “and I write in behalf of Sosthenes” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

In this case, being **in Christ**, or united to Christ, explains: (1) the means by which God has sanctified the Corinthians. Alternate translation: “by means of your union with Christ Jesus” (2) the reason why God has sanctified the Corinthians. Alternate translation: “because of your union with Christ Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	1	2	e8jw	figs-activepassive	κλητοῖς ἁγίοις	1	who are called to be saints	If you cannot use this form in your language, you could express **called {to be} saints** in active form with “God” as the subject.

If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable idiom or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “who pray to and venerate our Lord” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1CO	1	2	l9rq	figs-ellipsis	αὐτῶν καὶ ἡμῶν	1	their Lord and ours	In the phrase, Paul has left out words that may be needed in some languages to make a complete thought. If you cannot leave out these words in your language, you could supply words such as “who is” and “Lord” to make a complete thought. Alternate translation: “who is Lord over them and us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
1CO	1	3	gc2c	translate-blessing	χάρις ὑμῖν καὶ εἰρήνη ἀπὸ Θεοῦ Πατρὸς ἡμῶν καὶ Κυρίου Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	General Information:	After stating his name and the name of the person to whom he is writing, Paul adds a blessing for the Corinthians. Use a form that people would recognize as a blessing in your language. Alternate translation: “May you experience kindness and peace within you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus the Messiah” or “I pray that grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus the Messiah will always be with you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-blessing]])
1CO	1	4	zd7l	figs-hyperbole	πάντοτε	1		Here, **always** is an exaggeration that Paul uses to express how often he prays for the Corinthians. If **always** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word that indicates frequency. Alternate translation: “consistently” or “frequently” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
1CO	1	4	qoag	figs-distinguish	τῷ Θεῷ μου	1		When Paul speaks of **my God**, he does not mean that this is a different **God** than the one the Corinthians believe in. Rather, he simply wishes to state that this is **God** is his God. If **my God** in your translation sounds like it makes a distinction between Paul’s God and the Corinthians’ God, you could translate with a plural pronoun. Alternate translation: “to our God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish]])
1CO	1	4	t16d	figs-activepassive	τῇ δοθείσῃ	1	because of the grace of God that was given to you in Christ Jesus	If you cannot use this form in your language, you could express **that was given** in active form with “God” or “he” as the subject.

1CO	1	5	js7f	figs-metaphor	ἐπλουτίσθητε	1	you have been made rich in him	Here, Paul speaks as if the Corinthians had received a lot of money **in him**. With this language of being **rich**, Paul means that the Corinthians have received more than they need, and [1:7](../01/07.md) shows that what they have received are spiritual blessings and gifts. If being **made rich** would be misunderstood by your readers, you could: (1) express this idea with a phrase that refers to how much God has given them. Alternate translation: “you were given many gifts” (2) clarify that Paul speaks of spiritual riches. Alternate translation: “you were made spiritually rich” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	1	5	kaie	figs-activepassive	ἐπλουτίσθητε	1		If you cannot use this form in your language, you could express **you were made rich** in active form, with “God” as the subject. Alternate translation: “God has made you rich” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1CO	1	5	n9wn	writing-pronouns	ἐν αὐτῷ	1		The word translated **him** refers to Jesus, since God the Father is the one who makes the Corinthians rich. If **him** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use the words “Christ” or “Christ Jesus” to make this clear.

1CO	1	6	ub5r	figs-exmetaphor	τὸ μαρτύριον τοῦ Χριστοῦ ἐβεβαιώθη	1		In this verse, Paul speaks as if what he told the Corinthians about Christ was testimony he gave as a witness in a court of law. This testimony has been **confirmed**, just as if other evidence proved to the judge that his **testimony** was accurate. With this metaphor, he reminds the Corinthians that they have believed the message about Christ and that it is now an important part of their lives. If this metaphor would be misunderstood in your language, you could express this idea with a comparable metaphor or non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “our message about Christ has been firmly founded” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])
1CO	1	6	h9zk	figs-possession	τὸ μαρτύριον τοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	the testimony about Christ has been confirmed as true among you	Here, Paul uses the possessive form to speak about a **testimony** that concerns **Christ**. If this form would be misunderstood in your language, you could make it explicit that **Christ** is the content of the **testimony**. Alternate translation: “the testimony about Christ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
1CO	1	6	tfo3	figs-activepassive	τὸ μαρτύριον τοῦ Χριστοῦ ἐβεβαιώθη	1		If you cannot use this form in your language, you could express this idea in active form with “God” as the subject. Alternate translation: “God has confirmed the testimony of Christ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1CO	1	7	t2hd	grammar-connect-words-phrases	ὥστε	1	Therefore	The word translated **so that** could introduce: (1) a result from “being made rich” in [1:5](../01/05.md) and from the confirmation of the “testimony” in [1:6](../01/06.md). Alternate translation: “God has made you rich and confirmed our testimony so that” (2) a result from just the confirmation in [1:6](../01/06.md). Alternate translation: “God confirmed our testimony among you so that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
1CO	1	7	p5y6	figs-litotes	ὑμᾶς μὴ ὑστερεῖσθαι ἐν μηδενὶ χαρίσματι	1	you lack no spiritual gift	Here, Paul uses two negative words, **not** and **lack**, to express a strong positive meaning. He means that the Corinthians have every spiritual gift that God gives. If this form would be misunderstood in your language, you could express this idea in positive form. Alternate translation: “you have every gift” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
1CO	1	7	ymph	grammar-connect-time-simultaneous	ἀπεκδεχομένους	1		The word translated **eagerly waiting for** introduces something that happens at the same time as not lacking **in any gift**. If this connection would be misunderstood in your language, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “while you eagerly wait for” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous]])
1CO	1	7	fe4q	figs-possession	τὴν ἀποκάλυψιν τοῦ Κυρίου ἡμῶν, Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ;	1	the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ	Here, Paul uses the possessive form to describe a **revelation** whose content is **our Lord Jesus Christ**. If this form would be misunderstood in your language, you could make this explicit by translating the phrase with a verb with “God” or **our Lord Jesus Christ** as the subject. Alternate translation: “God to reveal our Lord Jesus Christ” or “our Lord Jesus Christ to be revealed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
1CO	1	7	o145	figs-explicit	τὴν ἀποκάλυψιν τοῦ Κυρίου ἡμῶν, Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ	1		In this context, it is clear that Paul does not simply mean that knowledge about **our Lord Jesus Christ** will be revealed. Rather, he means that **our Lord Jesus Christ** himself will return to earth. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word such as “return” to make this idea clear. Alternate translation: “the return of our Lord Jesus Christ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	1	8	cqpk	writing-pronouns	ὃς	1		This pronoun could refer to: (1) God, who is the implied subject of all the verbs in this section. Alternate translation: “It is God who” (2) Jesus, which is the closest name. Alternate translation: “It is Jesus who” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
1CO	1	8	usci	translate-unknown	καὶ βεβαιώσει ὑμᾶς	1		The word translated **confirm** is the same word that Paul used in [1:6](../01/06.md), also translated “confirmed.” Paul uses the word **also** to remind the reader that he has already used **confirmed**. If possible, translate **confirmed** as you did in [1:6](../01/06.md). Just as there, here it refers to something or someone that is proved to be true or accurate. In this case, it means that God will make the Corinthians’ faith true **to the end**. Alternate translation: “will also firmly found your faith” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	1	8	qtpq	figs-idiom	ἕως τέλους	1		The phrase translated **to the end** means that some activity or state will continue until a definable point in the future. Here, it means that God will **confirm** the Corinthians until their earthly lives end.

1CO	1	10	huz1	grammar-connect-words-phrases	παρακαλῶ δὲ	1		The word translated **now** indicates the beginning of a new section. Paul transitions from giving thanks to appealing to the Corinthians to avoid divisions. You could: (1) leave this word untranslated, and show the shift in topic by starting a new paragraph. Alternate translation: “I urge” (2) use a word or phrase that indicates the beginning of a new section. Alternate translation: “Next, I urge” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
1CO	1	10	u1u1	figs-infostructure	παρακαλῶ δὲ ὑμᾶς, ἀδελφοί, διὰ τοῦ ὀνόματος τοῦ Κυρίου ἡμῶν, Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ,	1		In this sentence, **I urge you** is far away from what Paul is urging. If it would be clearer in your language, you could move **I urge you** so that it comes right before **that you all speak**. Alternate translation: “Now brothers, through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, I urge you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
1CO	1	10	k7gw	figs-gendernotations	ἀδελφοί	1	brothers	Although the word translated **brothers** is masculine, Paul is using it to refer to anyone, whether man or woman.

Alternate translation: “you all see eye to eye” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1CO	1	10	j75c	translate-unknown	σχίσματα	1	that there be no divisions among you	The word translated **divisions** refers to when one group splits into multiple different groups because they have different leaders, beliefs, or opinions.

1CO	1	11	tayn	figs-activepassive	ἐδηλώθη…μοι περὶ ὑμῶν, ἀδελφοί μου, ὑπὸ τῶν Χλόης	1		If you cannot use this form in your language, you could write this sentence in active form.

1CO	1	11	e8jb	figs-explicit	τῶν Χλόης	1	Chloe’s people	**those of Chloe** refers to people who are connected to Chloe and probably live in her house or work for her. Paul does not tell us whether they are family members, slaves, or employees.

1CO	1	11	fd71	translate-names	Χλόης	1		This is the name of a woman. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
1CO	1	11	vbe6	translate-unknown	ἔριδες ἐν ὑμῖν εἰσιν	1	there are factions among you	The word translated **factions** refers to quarrels or strife within a community.

1CO	1	12	umbx	grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1		Paul uses the word translated **Now** to introduce a further explanation of what he started talking about in [1:11](../01/11.md). If the meaning of this word would be misunderstood in your language, you could leave the word untranslated or use a word that introduces an explanation. Alternate translation: “Indeed,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
1CO	1	12	tsn6	figs-idiom	λέγω…τοῦτο,	1		Here, Paul uses the phrase **I say this** to explain what he meant in the previous verse when he mentioned “factions” ([1:11](../01/11.md)).

1CO	1	12	a4lo	figs-explicitinfo	τοῦτο, ὅτι	1		Having both **this** and **that** in this sentence may be redundant in your language.

1CO	1	12	wf0n	figs-hyperbole	ἕκαστος ὑμῶν λέγει	1		Here, Paul uses **each of them** to emphasize that many individuals within the Corinthian congregation are saying these kinds of things. He does not mean that each person says all four of these things. He also does not mean that every single person in the church is making these kinds of claims. Finally, he does not mean that these are the only four claims that they are making. If the form that Paul uses would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an expression that singles out many individuals within a group, and you could add a phrase that indicates that these are examples of what they are saying. Alternate translation: “people in your group say are saying things like” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
1CO	1	12	vpym	translate-names	Παύλου…Ἀπολλῶ…Κηφᾶ	1		These are the names of three men. Cephas is another name for Peter. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

Alternate translation: “that you are of Paul, or you are of Apollos, or you are of Cephas, or you are of Christ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
1CO	1	12	a57r	figs-possession	ἐγὼ μέν εἰμι Παύλου, ἐγὼ δὲ Ἀπολλῶ, ἐγὼ δὲ Κηφᾶ, ἐγὼ δὲ Χριστοῦ	1	Each one of you says	Here, Paul uses the possessive form to indicate that these people claim to be part of a specific leader’s group. If this form would be misunderstood in your language, you could express this idea with a word such as “belong” or “follow.” Alternate translation: “‘I follow Paul,’ or ‘I follow Apollos,’ or ‘I follow Cephas,’ or ‘I follow Christ.’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
1CO	1	13	iam2	figs-123person	μὴ Παῦλος ἐσταυρώθη ὑπὲρ ὑμῶν, ἢ εἰς τὸ ὄνομα Παύλου ἐβαπτίσθητε	1		In this verse, Paul speaks of himself in the third person. This could sound like he is speaking about a different **Paul** than himself. If this use of **Paul** would be misunderstood in your language, you could clarify that Paul is naming himself. Alternate translation: “I, Paul, was not crucified for you, was I? Or were you baptized in my name, that of Paul?” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
1CO	1	13	wf6r	figs-rquestion	μεμέρισται ὁ Χριστός?	1	Is Christ divided?	Paul asks if **Christ** has **been divided**, but he is not really asking for information. Rather, the question assumes that the answer is “no,” and Paul uses a question to invite the Corinthians to think about how absurd their behavior is. If the meaning of this question would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea with a strong negative statement. Alternate translation: “Christ has certainly not been divided!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
1CO	1	13	w175	figs-activepassive	μεμέρισται ὁ Χριστός?	1		If you cannot use this form in your language, you could express the idea in active form, with an indefinite or vague subject. Alternate translation: “Have they divided Christ?” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1CO	1	13	aw2r	figs-metaphor	μεμέρισται ὁ Χριστός	1		Here, Paul speaks as if **Christ** could be **divided** into pieces and given to different groups. He speaks this way because he identifies the church with the body of Christ. If the church is divided into groups, then the body of Christ has been divided up as well. However, it is absurd to think that Christ’s body has been cut up into pieces, so it is also absurd to divide the church into pieces. If the meaning of this phrase would be misunderstood in your language, you could make this connection more explicit. Alternate translation: “Has Christ’s own body been divided, just as your church has been divided?” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	1	13	g5qh	figs-rquestion	μὴ Παῦλος ἐσταυρώθη ὑπὲρ ὑμῶν	1	Was Paul crucified for you?	Paul asks if **Paul was not crucified**, but he is not really asking for information. Rather, the question assumes that the answer is “no,” and Paul uses a question to invite the Corinthians to think about how absurd their thinking is. If this question would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea with a strong negative statement. Alternate translation: “Paul was certainly not crucified for you!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
1CO	1	13	lqsy	figs-activepassive	μὴ Παῦλος ἐσταυρώθη ὑπὲρ ὑμῶν	1		If you cannot use this form in your language, you could express this idea in active form, with an indefinite or vague subject.

1CO	1	13	tb2i	figs-rquestion	ἢ εἰς τὸ ὄνομα Παύλου ἐβαπτίσθητε?	1	Were you baptized in the name of Paul?	Paul asks if they **were baptized in the name of Paul**, but he is not really asking for information. Rather, the question assumes that the answer is “no,” and Paul uses a question to invite the Corinthians to think about how absurd their thinking is. If this question would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea with a strong negative statement. Alternate translation: “You were certainly not baptized in the name of Paul!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
1CO	1	13	tii7	figs-activepassive	ἢ εἰς τὸ ὄνομα Παύλου ἐβαπτίσθητε?	1		If you cannot use this form in your language, you could express this idea in active form, with a vague or indefinite subject. Alternate translation: “Or did they baptize you in the name of Paul?” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1CO	1	13	zi1y	figs-metonymy	εἰς τὸ ὄνομα Παύλου	1	in the name of Paul	Here, Paul uses the word **name** to refer to authority. What he means is that, when they were baptized, no one used the **name of Paul**, and therefore they do not belong to his group. Instead, he implicitly asserts that they belong to God, whose name would have been used when they were baptized. If the meaning of this word would be misunderstood in your language, you could express this idea by using the word “authority” or by a phrase that includes the language of “belonging.” Alternate translation: “under the authority of Paul” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1CO	1	14	hhh8	grammar-connect-exceptions	οὐδένα ὑμῶν ἐβάπτισα, εἰ μὴ	1	none of you, except	If it would appear in your language that Paul is making a statement here and then contradicting it, you could reword the sentence to avoid using an exception clause. Alternate translation: “I baptized only two of you:” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-exceptions]])
1CO	1	14	vqq6	translate-names	Κρίσπον…Γάϊον	1	Crispus	These are the names of two men. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
1CO	1	15	hv3m	grammar-connect-logic-goal	ἵνα	1	This was so that no one would say that you were baptized into my name	The word translated **so that** introduces a purpose or result. In this case, it introduces what results from Paul not baptizing many of the Corinthians. Because he did not baptize almost any of them, they cannot say that they were baptized into his name. If this connection would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word that indicates result, and you could specify that it is the result of Paul not baptizing many of them. Alternate translation: “The result is that” or “Therefore,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
1CO	1	15	dwdv	figs-activepassive	εἰς τὸ ἐμὸν ὄνομα ἐβαπτίσθητε	1		If you cannot use this form in your language, you could state this in active form with an indefinite subject or with Paul as the subject. Alternate translation: “someone baptized you into my name” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1CO	1	15	u8f6	figs-metonymy	εἰς τὸ ἐμὸν ὄνομα	1		Here, just as in [1:13](../01/13.md), Paul uses the word **name** to refer to authority. What he means is that, when they were baptized, no one used Paul’s **name**, and therefore they do not belong to his group. If the meaning of this word would be misunderstood in your language, you could express this idea by using the word “authority” or by a phrase that includes the language of “belonging.” Alternate translation: “under the my authority” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1CO	1	16	mq74	grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1		Here, the word translated **Now** interrupts the argument and reintroduces the theme of [1:14](../01/14.md), which is about whom Paul baptized. If this transition would be misunderstood in your language, you could express this idea by using punctuation that indicates a brief aside or parenthesis, or you could use a phrase that introduces when someone remembers something. Alternate translation: “Speaking of baptizing, I remember that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
1CO	1	16	ed59	translate-names	Στεφανᾶ	1	the household of Stephanas	This is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
1CO	1	16	nlzn	translate-unknown	οὐκ οἶδα εἴ τινα ἄλλον ἐβάπτισα	1		This statement could be more or less confident about how many people Paul baptized. It could be: (1) relatively confident that Paul has thought of everyone he baptized. Alternate translation: “I think that this is everyone that I baptized” (2) less confident that Paul has thought of everyone he baptized. Alternate translation: “I do not remember if I baptized any others” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	1	16	qbjf	grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical	εἴ	1		Paul here uses the condition introduced by **if** because he wishes to acknowledge that he thinks he has mentioned everyone that he baptized, but he is not sure. If the meaning of this word would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word that expresses uncertainty. Alternate translation: “whether” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical]])
1CO	1	17	jkfj	grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1		The word translated **For** introduces an explanation for why Paul has baptized so few people. If this connection would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word that introduces an explanation, and you could clarify that it explains how little he baptizes. Alternate translation: “I only baptized a few people because” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
1CO	1	17	ga5k	figs-infostructure	οὐ…ἀπέστειλέν με Χριστὸς βαπτίζειν, ἀλλὰ εὐαγγελίζεσθαι	1		If putting the negative statement before the positive statement would be misunderstood in your language, you could reverse them and introduce **not with wise speech** by repeating **proclaim**. Alternate translation: “Christ sent me to proclaim the gospel, not to baptize. I proclaim the gospel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
1CO	1	17	tg7i	figs-ellipsis	ἀλλὰ εὐαγγελίζεσθαι	1	Christ did not send me to baptize	In this clause, Paul has omitted some words that might be necessary to make a complete thought in your language.

Alternate translation: “but he sent me to proclaim the gospel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
1CO	1	17	p3cf	figs-ellipsis	οὐκ ἐν σοφίᾳ λόγου	1		In this clause, Paul has omitted some words that might be necessary to make a complete thought in your language. If this sentence would be misunderstood in your language, you could repeat the “proclaiming” language. Alternate translation: “I do not proclaim it with wise speech” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
1CO	1	17	u60s	grammar-connect-logic-goal	ἵνα	1		The word translated **so that** introduces the purpose for which Paul does not use “wise speech.” Here, you could use a word or phrase that normally indicates purpose. Alternate translation: “in order that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
1CO	1	17	zn1n	figs-metaphor	μὴ κενωθῇ ὁ σταυρὸς τοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	clever speech … the cross of Christ should not be emptied of its power	Here, Paul speaks as if the **cross of Christ** was a container that was full of power that he does not wish to empty of that power. By this, he means that he does not want to take away the power that the cross and the message about it have. If this phrase would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea non-figuratively, including the idea of power. Alternate translation: “the cross of Christ would not lose its power” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	1	17	qdyj	figs-activepassive	μὴ κενωθῇ ὁ σταυρὸς τοῦ Χριστοῦ	1		If you cannot use this form in your language, you could express this idea in active form, with Paul as the subject. Alternate translation: “I would not empty the cross of Christ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1CO	1	18	j7cw	grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	Connecting Statement:	The word translated **For** introduces an explanation of the last part of [1:17](../01/17.md). In this verse, then, Paul explains further why he does not use wise speech. If this connection would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word that introduces an explanation, and you could briefly restate what Paul is explaining. Alternate translation: “I speak in this way because” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
1CO	1	18	fq4x	figs-possession	ὁ λόγος…ὁ τοῦ σταυροῦ	1	the message about the cross	Here, Paul uses the possessive form to speak about a **word** that is about **the cross**. If this form would be misunderstood in your language, you could clarify that the **cross** is the content of the **word**. Alternate translation: “the word about the cross” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
1CO	1	18	utr3	figs-metonymy	τοῦ σταυροῦ	1		Here, the word **cross** stands for the event in which Jesus died on the cross. If the meaning of this word would be misunderstood in your language, you could include Jesus’ death in your translation. Alternate translation: “of Jesus’s death on the cross” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1CO	1	18	p4wb	figs-abstractnouns	μωρία ἐστίν	1	is foolishness	If you cannot use this form in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **foolishness** by translating it as an adjective such as “foolish.” Alternate translation: “seems foolish” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

1CO	1	18	m66w	figs-distinguish	τοῖς δὲ σῳζομένοις ἡμῖν	1		The description **who are being saved** distinguishes **us** from anyone else. It is not just adding information. Use a form in your language that shows that this is a distinguishing phrase. Alternate translation: “but to us, that is, the ones who are being saved” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish]])
1CO	1	18	ji74	figs-possession	δύναμις Θεοῦ ἐστιν	1	it is the power of God	Here, Paul uses the possessive form to describe **power** that comes from **God**.

1CO	1	19	tc6n	figs-quotations	ἀπολῶ τὴν σοφίαν τῶν σοφῶν, καὶ τὴν σύνεσιν τῶν συνετῶν ἀθετήσω	1	I will frustrate the understanding of the intelligent	If you cannot use this form in your language, you could translate this direct quote as an indirect quote, specifying that God is the subject and including an introductory word such as “that.” Alternate translation: “that God will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and he will frustrate the understanding of the intelligent” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
1CO	1	19	kzb0	figs-possession	τὴν σοφίαν τῶν σοφῶν…τὴν σύνεσιν τῶν συνετῶν	1		In both of these clauses, Paul uses the possessive form to describe **wisdom** or **understanding** that belongs to **the wise** or **the intelligent**. If this form would be misunderstood in your language, you could indicate that **wisdom** and **understanding** belong to **the wise** or **the intelligent**. Alternate translation: “the wisdom that the wise have … the understanding that the intelligent have” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
1CO	1	19	gft6	figs-nominaladj	τῶν σοφῶν…τῶν συνετῶν	1		Paul is using the adjectives **wise** and **intelligent** as nouns in order to describe groups of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate these with noun phrases. Alternate translation: “of the people who are wise … of the people who are intelligent” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
1CO	1	19	pa5n	translate-unknown	τῶν συνετῶν	1		The word translated **intelligent** describes someone who is good at figuring problems out, understanding new ideas, and making smart decisions. Use a word in your language that gets this general idea across. Alternate translation: “of the smart” or “of the clever” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	1	20	m6tf	figs-rquestion	ποῦ σοφός? ποῦ γραμματεύς? ποῦ συνζητητὴς τοῦ αἰῶνος τούτου?	1	Where is the wise person? Where is the scholar? Where is the debater of this world?	With these questions, Paul is not actually asking about the location of certain people. Rather, he is suggesting to the Corinthians that these kinds of people cannot be found. If these questions would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea with statements that: (1) assert that these people do not actually have real wisdom, knowledge, or skill. Alternate translation: “The wise person does not really have wisdom. The scholar does not really know much. The debater of this age is not really good at arguing” (2) assert that these people do not exist. Alternate translation: “There is no wise person. There is no scholar. There is no debater of this age” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
1CO	1	20	h0qa	figs-genericnoun	σοφός…γραμματεύς…συνζητητὴς	1		Paul uses these singular nouns to identify types of people, but he does not mean just one **wise person**, **scholar**, or **debater**. If this form would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a form that identifies a type of person, or you could translate these nouns in plural form. Alternate translation: “the kind of person who has wisdom … the kind of person who is a scholar … the kind of person who is a debater” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])
1CO	1	20	mzxx	figs-possession	συνζητητὴς τοῦ αἰῶνος τούτου	1		Here, Paul uses the possessive form to describe a **debater** who is part of **this age**. In fact, Paul may mean that the **wise person** and the **scholar** also belong to **this age**. If this form would be misunderstood in your language, you could express this idea with a relative clause. Alternate translation: “the debater, who belongs in this age” or “the debater? All these kinds of people belong to this age” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
1CO	1	20	u5j5	translate-unknown	συνζητητὴς	1	the debater	The word translated **debater** refers to someone who spends much of their time arguing about beliefs, values, or actions. If the meaning of this word would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a short phrase or a term that expresses this idea better. Alternate translation: “the disputant” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	1	20	a7zl	figs-rquestion	οὐχὶ ἐμώρανεν ὁ Θεὸς τὴν σοφίαν τοῦ κόσμου?	1	Has not God turned the wisdom of the world into foolishness?	Paul does not ask this question because he is looking for information. Rather, he asks it to involve the Corinthians in what he is arguing. The question assumes that the answer is “yes.” If this question would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea with a statement. Alternate translation: “ God has turned the wisdom of the world into foolishness” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
1CO	1	20	y5wx	figs-possession	τὴν σοφίαν τοῦ κόσμου	1		Here, Paul uses the possessive form to describe **wisdom** that seems wise according to the standard of this **world**. If this form would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea using a relative clause. Alternate translation: “the wisdom that this world values” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
1CO	1	21	cihg	grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1		The word translated **For** introduces an explanation of how God has turned the wisdom of the world into foolishness ([1:20](../01/20.md)). You could use a word that introduces an explanation in your language or a short phrase that identifies that this verse explains the previous verse. Alternate translation: “That is,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
1CO	1	21	eauj	grammar-connect-logic-result	ἐπειδὴ…οὐκ ἔγνω ὁ κόσμος διὰ τῆς σοφίας τὸν Θεόν, εὐδόκησεν ὁ Θεὸς	1		The word translated **since** introduces the reason for the second half of the verse, beginning with **God was pleased**. If this connection would be misunderstood in your language, you could make this more explicit or break the two pieces into two sentences and use a transition word that indicates result. Alternate translation: “because … the world did not know God through wisdom, therefore God was pleased” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
1CO	1	21	tnez	figs-possession	ἐν τῇ σοφίᾳ τοῦ Θεοῦ	1		Here, Paul uses the possessive form to speak of **wisdom** that **God** uses when he makes decisions or acts. If this form would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea by adding “plans” or “thinking” and translating **wisdom** with an adjective such as “wise.” Alternate translation: “in God’s wise plan” or ”in God’s wise thinking” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
1CO	1	21	odyk	figs-synecdoche	ὁ κόσμος	1		Here, Paul uses the word translated **world** to refer to the humans that are part of the **world**. If the meaning of this word would be misunderstood in your language, you could translate **world** with a word or phrase that refers to people who do not believe in Christ, or you could use a phrase like “people of the world.” Alternate translation: “the people of the world” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
1CO	1	21	d7xw	figs-possession	τῆς μωρίας τοῦ κηρύγματος	1	those who believe	Here, Paul uses the possessive form to speak of **preaching** that is characterized by **foolishness**. If this form would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea by translating **foolishness** as an adjective describing **the preaching** or the content of **the preaching**. Alternate translation: “the foolish preaching” or “the foolish message that we preach” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
1CO	1	21	lkk1	figs-irony	τῆς μωρίας	1		Paul describes the **preaching** as **foolishness**. He does not actually think his message is foolish. Instead, he speaks from the perspective of **the world** and its **wisdom**, because the message is foolish to **the world**. If this way of speaking would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an expression that indicates that Paul is using irony or speaking from another person’s perspective. Alternate translation: “the so-called foolishness” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])
1CO	1	22	j8nh	grammar-connect-words-phrases	ἐπειδὴ καὶ	1		The word translated **For** sets up the contrast between this verse and what Paul preaches in the next verse. If your language has a way to begin a contrast, you could use it here. Otherwise, you could leave the word untranslated. Alternate translation: “It is indeed true that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
1CO	1	22	e1sy	figs-hyperbole	Ἰουδαῖοι…Ἕλληνες	1		By using the words translated **Jews** and **Greeks**, Paul is not saying that every single Jewish and Greek person does these things. Instead, he is generalizing, identifying common patterns among people who are Jewish and Greek. If this form would be misunderstood in your language, you could clarify that not all **Jews** and **Greeks** are meant. Alternate translation: “most Jews … most Greeks” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
1CO	1	22	t32r	translate-unknown	Ἕλληνες	1		The word translated **Greeks** does not refer only to people who are ethnically Greek. However, it also does not refer to everyone who is not a Jew. Rather, it refers to people who speak the Greek language and who value the philosophy and education that are part of Greek culture. If the meaning of this word would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word or phrase that identifies these people by their interests and values more than by their ethnicity. Alternate translation: “people who value Greek philosophy” or “people who had a Greek education” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	1	23	q8sj	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	δὲ	1		Here, Paul continues the contrast he set up in [1:22](../01/22.md). Jews seek signs, and Greeks seek wisdom, but Paul and those like him proclaim that the Messiah was crucified. If this connection would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word or phrase that indicates a strong contrast between behavior or beliefs. Alternate translation: “In contrast with them,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
1CO	1	23	v9fa	figs-exclusive	ἡμεῖς	1	General Information:	Here, the word **we** refers to Paul and others who proclaim the Gospel with him. It does not include the Corinthians. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
1CO	1	23	ntu3	figs-activepassive	Χριστὸν ἐσταυρωμένον	1	Christ crucified	If you cannot use this form in your language, you could state this in active form, with: (1) **Christ** as the subject. Alternate translation: “that Christ laid down his life on the cross” (2) an indefinite or vague subject. Alternate translation: “that they crucified Christ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1CO	1	23	krw3	figs-metaphor	σκάνδαλον	1	a stumbling block	Paul uses the word translated **stumbling block** to indicate that the message about “Christ crucified” causes offense or repulses many Jews. If the meaning of this word would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “a repulsive concept” or “an unacceptable idea” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	1	23	n6u2	figs-hyperbole	Ἰουδαίοις…ἔθνεσιν	1		By using the words translated **Jews** and **Gentiles**, Paul is not saying that every single Jewish and Gentile person responds to the Gospel in these ways. Instead, he is generalizing, identifying common patterns among people who are Jewish and Gentile. If this form would be misunderstood in your language, you could clarify that not all **Jews** and **Gentiles** are meant. Alternate translation: “to most Jews … to most Gentiles” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
1CO	1	24	xgw1	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	δὲ	1		Here, Paul uses the word translated **But** to contrast **those who are called** and the “Jews” and “Gentiles” in [1:23](../01/23.md). If this connection would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word or phrase that contrasts people and their thinking. Alternate translation: “In contrast with them,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
1CO	1	24	i7l4	figs-infostructure	αὐτοῖς…τοῖς κλητοῖς, Ἰουδαίοις τε καὶ Ἕλλησιν, Χριστὸν Θεοῦ δύναμιν, καὶ Θεοῦ σοφίαν	1		Paul here puts the people he is talking about first before he makes a statement about them. If this is unnatural in your language, you could: (1) phrase the sentence so that **those who are called** is the subject of the whole sentence. Alternate translation: “those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, know that Christ {is} the power of God and the wisdom of God” (2) move **to those who are called** to the end of the sentence. Alternate translation: “Christ {is} the power of God and the wisdom of God to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
1CO	1	24	h7iw	figs-123person	αὐτοῖς…τοῖς κλητοῖς	1	to those whom God has called	Paul uses the third person to speak about those whom God has called because he is speaking of the group as a category in comparison with Jews who find the Gospel a stumbling block and Gentiles who find the Gospel to be foolish. He does not use the third person because he excludes himself or the Corinthians from this category. If this form would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea with the first person. Alternate translation: “to those of us who are called” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
1CO	1	24	appp	figs-activepassive	τοῖς κλητοῖς	1		If you cannot use this form in your language, you could write this in active form, with God as the subject. Alternate translation: “whom God has called” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1CO	1	24	pt5x	translate-unknown	Ἕλλησιν	1		The word translated **Greeks** does not refer only to people who are ethnically Greek. However, it also does not refer to everyone who is not a Jew. Rather, it refers to people who speak the Greek language and who value the philosophy and education that are part of Greek culture. If the meaning of this word would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word or phrase that identifies these people by their interests and values more than by their ethnicity. Alternate translation: “people who value Greek philosophy” or “people who had a Greek education” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	1	24	hu1s	figs-metonymy	Χριστὸν	1	Christ as the power and the wisdom of God	Here, the word **Christ** could refer to: (1) the message about the work of Christ. Alternate translation: “the message about Christ” (2) the work of Christ, especially his death. Alternate translation: “Christ’s work” or “Christ’s death” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1CO	1	24	w9vm	figs-possession	Θεοῦ δύναμιν	1	the power … of God	Here, Paul uses the possessive form to speak of **power** that comes from **God**. If this form would be misunderstood in your language, you could clarify that **God** is the source of the **power**. Alternate translation: “power from God” or “God acting powerfully” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
1CO	1	24	p1hu	figs-possession	Θεοῦ σοφίαν	1	the wisdom of God	Here, Paul uses the possessive form to speak of **wisdom** that comes from **God**. If this form would be misunderstood in your language, you could clarify that **God** is the source of the **wisdom**. Alternate translation: “wisdom from God” or “God giving wisdom” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
1CO	1	25	fst8	grammar-connect-logic-result	ὅτι	1		With the word translated **For**, Paul introduces the reason why the seemingly foolish message about Christ is power and wisdom ([1:24](../01/24.md)). If this connection would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word that introduces a reason or a short phrase that connects this verse to the previous verse or verses. Alternate translation: “God works through foolishness because” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
1CO	1	25	h9hh	figs-irony	τὸ μωρὸν τοῦ Θεοῦ…τὸ ἀσθενὲς τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	the foolishness of God is wiser than people, and the weakness of God is stronger than people	Paul describes God as having **foolishness** and **weakness**. He does not actually think that God is weak and foolish, but he is speaking from the perspective of the world and its wisdom. From the perspective of the world, Paul’s God is indeed foolish and weak. What Paul means to say is that what the world sees as **foolishness** and **weakness** is still **wiser** and **stronger** than anything that humans have to offer. If this way of speaking would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an expression that indicates that Paul is using irony or speaking from another person’s perspective. Alternate translation: “the apparent foolishness of God … the apparent weakness of God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])
1CO	1	25	esc9	figs-gendernotations	τῶν ἀνθρώπων	-1		The words translated **men** in both places in this verse do not refer just to male people. Rather, Paul means any human of any sex. If the meaning of this word would be misunderstood in your language, you could use both genders or a gender-neutral word. Alternate translation: “women and men … women and men” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
1CO	1	25	jydy	figs-possession	τὸ μωρὸν τοῦ Θεοῦ…ἐστίν	1		Here, Paul uses the possessive form to describe **foolishness** that comes from **God**. If this form would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea with a phrase that indicates that **God** does **foolishness**. Alternate translation: “the foolish things that God does are” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
1CO	1	25	uciw	figs-ellipsis	σοφώτερον τῶν ἀνθρώπων ἐστίν	1		Paul does not say everything that is needed in many languages to make a complete comparison. If the sentence would be misunderstood in your language, you could add whatever is needed to make the comparison complete, such “the wisdom.” Alternate translation: “is wiser than the wisdom of men” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
1CO	1	25	gnpe	figs-possession	τὸ ἀσθενὲς τοῦ Θεοῦ	1		Here, Paul uses the possessive form to describe **weakness** that comes from **God**. If it this form would be misunderstood in your language, you could translate this idea with a phrase that indicates that **God** does **weakness**. Alternate translation: “the weak things that God does {are}” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
1CO	1	25	i7pl	figs-ellipsis	ἰσχυρότερον τῶν ἀνθρώπων	1		Paul does not say everything that is needed in many languages to make a complete comparison. If this sentence would be misunderstood in your language, you could add whatever is needed to make the comparison complete, such “the strength.” Alternate translation: “stronger than the strength of men” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
1CO	1	26	je03	grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1		Here, the word translated **For** introduces proof for or examples of what Paul has claimed so far about God choosing to work through foolishness and weakness. If this connection would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces examples or support. Alternate translation: “For instance,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
1CO	1	26	c8sf	translate-unknown	τὴν κλῆσιν ὑμῶν	1		Here, the word translated **calling** primarily to who they were at the time of their **calling**. It does not primarily refer to God’s act in **calling** them. If the meaning of this word would be misunderstood language, you can emphasize this aspect in your translation. Alternate translation: “who you were at your calling” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
1CO	1	26	xq6b	figs-gendernotations	ἀδελφοί	1		Here, the word translated **brothers** does not just refer to men but to people of any sex. If this form would be misunderstood in your language, you could: (1) use a non-gendered word. Alternate translation: “siblings” (2) use words for both men and women. Alternate translation: “brothers and sisters” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
1CO	1	26	w6l1	figs-litotes	οὐ πολλοὶ	-1	Not many of you	Here, Paul uses a form that can more easily be stated in inverse form in many languages. If: (1) your language would most naturally put **not** with the verb instead of **many**, you could do so here. Alternate translation: “many {were} not … many {were} not … and many {were} not” (2) your language would most naturally use a word that indicates a small number of people here, you could use it without **not**. Alternate translation: “few … few … and few” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
1CO	1	26	unig	writing-pronouns	οὐ πολλοὶ	-1		While Paul does not explicitly state that **not many** refers to the Corinthians, he is referring to the Corinthians when he says **not many**. If this form would be misunderstood in your language, you could insert “you.” Alternate translation: “not many of you … not many of you … and not many of you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
1CO	1	26	camj	figs-infostructure	οὐ πολλοὶ σοφοὶ κατὰ σάρκα, οὐ πολλοὶ δυνατοί, οὐ πολλοὶ εὐγενεῖς	1		Paul here uses the phrase **according to the flesh** to clarify what he means by **wise**, **powerful**, and **of noble birth**, not just **wise**. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could move **according to the flesh** so that it is clear that it modifies all three of these statements. Alternate translation: “according to the flesh, not many {were} wise, not many {were} powerful, and not many {were} of noble birth (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
1CO	1	26	pws2	figs-idiom	κατὰ σάρκα	1	wise according to the flesh	Here, Paul uses the phrase **according to the flesh** to refer to human ways of thinking. If the meaning of thsi phrase would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idiom **according to the flesh** with a phrase that refers to human values or perspectives. Alternate translation: “according to human definitions” or “according to what humans value” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1CO	1	27	qjvd	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	ἀλλὰ	1		Here, Paul introduces a contrast. hH is contrasting **God chose the foolish things** with what a person might expect about how God would treat foolish and weak people like the Corinthians. He is not contrasting how **God chose the foolish things** with the statements in the previous verse about the foolishness and weakness of the Corinthians. If this contrast would be misunderstood in your language, you could clarify that Paul writes **But** to contrast with what a person might expect about God. Alternate translation: “Despite what might be expected,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
1CO	1	27	qv5l	figs-parallelism	τοῦ κόσμου ἐξελέξατο ὁ Θεός, ἵνα καταισχύνῃ…τοῦ κόσμου ἐξελέξατο ὁ Θεός, ἵνα καταισχύνῃ	2<br>	God chose … wise. God chose … strong	Here, Paul repeats the exact same words: **God chose … in order that he might shame**. He does this because repeating the same idea with different examples was more convincing than just one example in his culture. If possible, translate these words the same way in both parts of the sentence to preserve the parallelism. If it is necessary, you could remove or change some of the words if it makes the sentence sound more convincing, which is what Paul intended. Alternate translation: “God chose … of the world in order that he might shame … he chose … of the world to shame” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
1CO	1	27	r4ly	figs-possession	τὰ μωρὰ τοῦ κόσμου…τὰ ἀσθενῆ τοῦ κόσμου	1		Paul uses the possessive form twice to clarify that the **foolish things** and **weak things** are only **foolish** and **weak** from the perspective of the **world**. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea with a phrase such as “according to the world.” Alternate translation: “things that are foolish according to the world … things that are weak according to the world” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
1CO	1	27	gdob	figs-synecdoche	τοῦ κόσμου	-1		When Paul uses **the world** in this context, he is not referring primarily to everything that God has made. Rather, he uses **the world** to refer to human beings. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an expression that refers to human beings in general. Alternate translation: “of people … of people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
1CO	1	27	iwho	grammar-connect-logic-goal	ἵνα	-1		Here, the word translated **in order that** could introduce: (1) the purpose for which **God chose the foolish things of the world** and **the weak things of the world**. Alternate translation: “so that … so that” (2) what happened when **God chose the foolish things of the world** and **the weak things of the world**. Alternate translation: “with the result that … with the result that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
1CO	1	27	vtzx	figs-nominaladj	τοὺς σοφούς…τὰ ἰσχυρά	1		Paul uses the adjective **wise** to describe a group of people, and he uses the adjective **strong** to describe a group of people and things. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate these two adjectives with noun phrases. Alternate translation: “people who are wise … people and things which are strong” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
1CO	1	28	tqxg	figs-parallelism	τοῦ κόσμου…ἐξελέξατο ὁ Θεός,…ἵνα	1		In this verse, Paul repeats many of the words from the parallel parts of previous verse. He does this because repeating the same idea with different examples was more convincing than just one example in his culture. If possible, translate these words the same way that you translated them in [1:27](../01/27.md). If it is necessary, you could remove or change some of the words if it makes the sentence sound more convincing, which is what Paul intended. Alternate translation: “he chose … of the world … in order that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
1CO	1	28	k3kd	translate-unknown	τὰ ἀγενῆ	1	what is low and despised	The word translated **base things** is the opposite of the word translated “of noble birth” in [1:26](../01/26.md). Paul uses it to refer to things and people that were not considered important or powerful in his culture. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to people and things that have low status or low importance. Alternate translation: “the marginalized things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	1	28	d5pa	translate-unknown	τὰ ἐξουθενημένα	1		While the word translated **base things** refers to a person’s status or a thing’s status, the word translated **despised things** refers to how people treat other people or things that have low status. Usually, people badly treat others whom they consider to be of lower status, ignoring them or mocking them. That is what Paul means when he says **despised**. If this might be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to how people treat others of lower status badly. Alternate translation: “the scorned things” or “the things people treat with contempt” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	1	28	wir6	figs-possession	τὰ ἀγενῆ τοῦ κόσμου καὶ τὰ ἐξουθενημένα	1		Here, Paul uses **of the world** to describe both **the base things** and **the despised things**. As in [1:27](../01/27.md), he uses the possessive form to clarify that **base things and the despised things** are only **base** and **despised** from the perspective of the world. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea with a phrase such as “according to the world.” Alternate translation: “the base things and the despised things according to the world” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
1CO	1	28	unyl	figs-synecdoche	τοῦ κόσμου	1		When Paul uses **the world** in this context, he is not referring primarily to everything that God has made. Rather, he uses **the world** to refer to human beings. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an expression that refers to human beings in general. Alternate translation: “of people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
1CO	1	28	gj19	figs-hyperbole	τὰ μὴ ὄντα	1	nothing, to bring to nothing things that are held as valuable	Here, Paul further describes the **base things** and **the despised things** as if they were **things that are not**. He does not mean that the **base** and **despised things** do not exist. Instead, he is identifying how people often ignore the **base** and **despised things**, just as if they did not exist at all. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable phrase or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “the things that people ignore” or “the nobodies” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
1CO	1	28	f11p	grammar-connect-logic-goal	ἵνα	1	things that are held as valuable	Here, the word translated **in order that** could introduce: (1) the purpose for which **God chose the base things and the despised things of the world, the things that are not**. Alternate translation: “so that” (2) what happened when **God chose the base things and the despised things of the world, the things that are not**. Alternate translation: “with the result that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
1CO	1	28	f9s5	translate-unknown	καταργήσῃ	1		The word translated **he might bring to nothing** refers to making something ineffective, useless, or irrelevant. What Paul means is that God has made **the things that are** unimportant and without function because he instead worked through **the things that are not**. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word or phrase that indicates that a person has acted so that something else is no longer important, useful, or effective. Alternate translation: “he might sideline” or “render ineffective” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	1	28	etjg	figs-idiom	τὰ ὄντα	1		In this context, **the things that are** does not refer primarily to things that exist. Rather, it refers primarily to things that are important in society and culture. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable phrase that refers to important or significant things and people in your culture. Alternate translation: “the things that people care about” or “the somebodies” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1CO	1	29	unr6	grammar-connect-logic-goal	ὅπως	1		The word translated **so that** introduces a final goal. In [1:28–29](../01/28–29.md), Paul uses “in order that” to introduce immediate goals, but here, **so that** is the overall goal. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a final or overall goal, making sure to distinguish it from the words you used in [1:28–29](../01/28–29.md), if possible. Alternate translation: “so that, in the end,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
1CO	1	29	q4gh	figs-idiom	μὴ…πᾶσα σὰρξ	1		Paul uses the word **flesh** to refer to humans. Unlike in other places in his letters, **flesh** does not indicate sinful and weak humanity. Instead, it simply refers to humans compared to their creator, God. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word or phrase that commonly refers to people in general, especially if it includes the idea that people are created by God. Alternate translation: “no creature” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1CO	1	29	fdv5	figs-metaphor	ἐνώπιον τοῦ Θεοῦ	1		Here, Paul speaks of people not boasting **before God**, as if they were standing in front of **God**. With this way of talking, Paul means that people are acting as if they could see God and God could see them. This means that they recognize that God knows what they say and do. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable phrase that indicates that someone recognizes that God knows what they are doing and thinking. Alternate translation: “when they know that God sees them” or “while God looks on” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	1	30	yk4y	grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1		The word translated **But** introduces a slight contrast between people who might boast and the Corinthians, who are united to Christ. However, **But** primarily means that Paul is moving to the next step in his argument. If **But** would not express this idea in your language, you could use a word that indicates that the author is moving on to the next step, or you could leave it untranslated. Alternate translation: “Now” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
1CO	1	30	fmr3	figs-activepassive	ἐξ αὐτοῦ…ὑμεῖς ἐστε ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ	1	because of him	While **because of him, you are in Christ Jesus** is not written the way most passive sentences are, this construction is like a passive sentence and may be difficult to represent in your language. What **because of him** means is that God is the source of how the Corinthians **are in Christ Jesus**. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could rephrase these words so that “God” is the subject who makes it so that **you are in Christ Jesus**. Alternate translation: “he puts you in Christ Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1CO	1	30	alyj	writing-pronouns	αὐτοῦ	1		The word translated **of him** refers to God. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use the name “God” here. Alternate translation: “of God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
1CO	1	30	a986	figs-metaphor	ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ	1		Paul uses the spatial metaphor **in Christ Jesus** to describe the union of believers with Christ. In this case, being **in Christ Jesus**, or united to Christ Jesus, explains how **Christ Jesus** can be **wisdom**, **righteousness**, **sanctification**, and **redemption** for the Corinthians. Alternate translation: “in union with Christ Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	1	30	f1at	figs-metaphor	ὃς ἐγενήθη σοφία ἡμῖν ἀπὸ Θεοῦ, δικαιοσύνη τε, καὶ ἁγιασμὸς, καὶ ἀπολύτρωσις;	1	Christ Jesus, who was made for us wisdom from God	Here, Paul uses language and structure that is very similar to what he used in [1:24](../01/24.md). Refer back to that verse to help you translate this verse. When Paul says that Jesus **was made … wisdom** and **righteousness, and also sanctification and redemption**, he does not mean that Jesus has become these abstract ideas. Instead, he means that Jesus is the source of **wisdom**, **righteousness**, **sanctification**, and **redemption** for **us** who are **in Christ Jesus**. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could include some clarifying words such as “the source of.” Alternate translation: “who was made for us the source of wisdom from God, the source of righteousness, and also the source of sanctification and redemption” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	1	30	lxpy	figs-activepassive	ὃς ἐγενήθη σοφία ἡμῖν ἀπὸ Θεοῦ	1		If you cannot write **who was made for us wisdom from God** in this form, you could state it in active form. Alternate translation: “whom God made for us wisdom from himself” or “whom God made for us wisdom” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1CO	1	30	yyns	writing-pronouns	ὃς	1		The word **who** refers to **Christ Jesus**. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could write the name of **Christ Jesus** instead of using **who** or along with **who**. Alternate translation: “the Christ who” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
1CO	1	30	g5um	figs-abstractnouns	σοφία…ἀπὸ Θεοῦ, δικαιοσύνη τε, καὶ ἁγιασμὸς, καὶ ἀπολύτρωσις	1		If you cannot write the abstract nouns **wisdom**, **righteousness**, **sanctification**, and **redemption** in your language, you could express their meaning by using verbs with God as the subject. Alternate translation: “a person through whom God taught us, judged us not guilty, and also set us apart for himself and set us free” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1CO	1	31	dm5h	grammar-connect-logic-result	ἵνα	1		Paul uses the word translated **so that** to introduce (1) the result of everything he has said about God being the one who chooses and acts. If you use one of the following alternate translations, you may need to add period before it. Alternate translation: “Because of all this” or “Therefore” (2) the purpose for which God chose the weak and foolish. Alternate translation: “in order that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
1CO	1	31	gtv0	figs-ellipsis	ἵνα καθὼς γέγραπται	1		Here, Paul leaves out some words that might be required in your language to make a complete thought. If this form would be misunderstood in your language, you could supply the needed words, such as “we should do.” Alternate translation: “so that we should behave just as it is written” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
1CO	1	31	paga	figs-infostructure	καθὼς γέγραπται, ὁ καυχώμενος, ἐν Κυρίῳ καυχάσθω	1		If it would be unnatural in your language to put **just as it is written** before the quotation, you could put **just as it is written** at the end of the sentence. Alternate translation: “‘Let the one who boasts, boast in the Lord,’ just as it is written” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
1CO	1	31	ebvw	writing-quotations	καθὼς γέγραπται	1		In Paul’s culture, **just as it is written** is a normal way to introduce a quotation from an important text, in this case, the Old Testament book written by Jeremiah the prophet. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable phrase that indicates that Paul is quoting from an important text. Alternate translation: “as it can be read in the Old Testament” or “according to Jeremiah the prophet” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
1CO	1	31	fym9	figs-imperative	ὁ καυχώμενος, ἐν Κυρίῳ καυχάσθω	1	Let the one who boasts, boast in the Lord	Here, Paul uses a third person imperative. If you have third person imperatives in your language, you could use one here. If you do not have third person imperatives, you could (1) translate this one as a conditional sentence, adding “if.” Alternate translation: “If people want to boast, they should boast in the Lord” (2) translate this one using a word such as “should.” Alternate translation: “Anyone who boasts should boast in the Lord” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
1CO	1	31	mo0q	figs-idiom	ἐν Κυρίῳ καυχάσθω	1		When Paul says that someone can **boast in the Lord**, he does not mean that they are inside **the Lord**. Rather, he means that they are boasting about **the Lord** and what he has done. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable phrase that indicates that someone is boasting about someone else. Alternate translation: “Let … boast with reference to the Lord” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1CO	2	intro	k86p			0		# 1 Corinthians 2 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>2. Against divisions (1:10–4:15)<br>      * Paul’s attitude among the Corinthians (2:1–5)<br>      * The wisdom of God, revealed by the Spirit (2:6–16)<br><br>Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the words of verses 9 and 16, which are from the Old Testament. Verse 9 quotes from Isaiah 64:4, and verse 16 quotes from Isaiah 40.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Wisdom and foolishness<br><br>Throughout this chapter, Paul continues to speak of both wisdom and foolishness. Just as in chapter one, these words do not refer primarily to how much or how little education someone has. Rather, they refer to how well or how poorly someone plans actions and knows how the world works. Continue to use the words you chose in chapter one. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/wise]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/fool]])<br><br>### Power and weakness<br><br>Throughout this chapter, Paul continues to speak of both power and weakness. Just as in chapter one, these words primarily refer to how much influence and authority a person has and to how much they can accomplish. Someone who has “power” has much influence and authority and can accomplish many things. Someone who has “weakness” does not have much influence and authority and is not able to accomplish many things. Continue to use the words that you chose in chapter one. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/power]])<br><br>### The Spirit<br><br>Paul first mentions the “Spirit” in this chapter. In most places where this word appears, it refers to God’s Spirit (the Holy Spirit), who is the third person of the Trinity. However, in two places in this chapter, the word “spirit” refers to something else. First, “spirit of the world” in [2:12](../02/12.md) refers to a “spirit” that is not God’s Spirit and that originates from within the world. Paul says that this kind of “spirit” is not the kind that believers in Jesus have received. Second, the “spirit of a man” in [2:11](../02/11.md) refers to the non-physical part of a person. It does not refer to God’s Spirit or to something that God’s Spirit replaces. Sometimes Paul uses the adjective form “spiritual” ([2:13](../02/13.md); [2:15](../02/15.md)) and the adverb form “spiritually” ([2:14](../02/14.md)). Both of these forms also refer to God’s Spirit. If someone or something is “spiritual,” that means that the person or thing has or is characterized by God’s Spirit. If something is done “spiritually,” that means that it is done by the power of God’s Spirit. Once, Paul uses the word “natural” ([2:14](../02/14.md)), which is the opposite of “spiritual.” “Natural” means that the person or thing does not have and is not characterized by God’s Spirit. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/holyspirit]])<br><br>### The Mystery<br><br>Paul speaks of a “mystery” in [2:1](../02/01.md); [2:7](../02/07.md). This “mystery” is not some secret truth that is hard to understand and that only a few privileged individuals can learn about. Instead, it refers to God’s plans that once were unknown but are now known to all his people. As Paul has already stated in chapter one, these plans center around the cross, which seems to be foolishness. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/reveal]])<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### The deep things of God<br><br>In [2:10](../02/10.md), Paul says that the Spirit searches “the deep things of God.” Paul talks about God as if he were a well or a lake with parts that are deep down in order to identify things about God that humans cannot understand or find it difficult to understand. He does not mean that God is a being or location with deep parts. See the note on this verse for translation options.<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### The rulers of this age<br><br>In [2:6](../02/06.md); [2:8](../02/08.md), Paul speaks about “the rulers of this age.” This phrase refers to individuals who have power in the created world during the time between Christ’s first and second comings. While Paul does not state whether these individuals with power are humans or spiritual beings, he does say that they were the ones who crucified Jesus ([2:8](../02/08.md)). This suggests that they are humans, and they would be people like governors, emperors, and unfaithful religious leaders. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/ruler]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/age]])<br><br>### Positive and negative uses of “wisdom”<br><br>Just as in chapter one, Paul continues to speak about wisdom in both positive and negative ways. He uses the same words throughout the chapter, and he distinguishes between positive and negative meanings by connecting the words to different people or ideas. For example, he speaks of wisdom negatively when it is the wisdom of the world, or the wisdom of humans. However, he speaks of wisdom positively when it is wisdom from God or wisdom given by God. If possible, translate the negative and positive meanings of wisdom with the same word, just as Paul uses one word for both negative and positive. If you must use different words, use positive words for God’s wisdom and negative words for human wisdom.<br><br>### First person singular and plural<br><br>Paul uses the first person singular in [2:1–5](../02/01–05.md) because in these verses he speaks of his own time among the Corinthians. He switches to the first person plural in [2:6–16](../02/06–16.md) because in these verses he is speaking more generally about everyone who proclaims the Gospel as he does. In [2:6–16](../02/06–16.md), the first person plural sometimes includes the Corinthians and sometimes does not include the Corinthians. Throughout the chapter, the first person plural will include the Corinthians unless a note specifies that it does not include them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
1CO	2	1	pxmq	grammar-connect-words-phrases	κἀγὼ	1		Here, the word translated **And I** introduces how Paul himself fits into the pattern he introduced in the last chapter. Just as God chooses the weak and the foolish, Paul preaches the Gospel in weak and foolish ways. If this connection would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea with a word or phrase that introduces an example or a comparison. Alternate translation: “In the same way, I” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
1CO	2	1	qvj7	figs-gendernotations	ἀδελφοί	1	brothers	Although the word translated **brothers** is masculine, Paul is using it to refer to both men or women. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a non-gendered word or refer to both genders. Alternate translation: “brothers and sisters”(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
1CO	2	1	koh8	figs-explicitinfo	ἐλθὼν πρὸς ὑμᾶς…ἦλθον οὐ	1		Here, Paul twice says that he has **come** to them. This is a structure that makes sense in Paul’s language. However, if this repetition would be misunderstood in your language, you could: (1) translate the first **come** with a different word, such as “visit.” Alternate translation: “having visited you, did not come” (2) combine these two phrases. Alternate translation: “did not come to you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo]])
1CO	2	1	o0vw	grammar-connect-time-background	ἐλθὼν πρὸς ὑμᾶς	1		The phrase **having come to you** gives background information. It describes what happened before Paul **did not come with superiority of speech or of wisdom**. If this connection would be misunderstood in your language, you could clarify by using a word that introduces action that has already occurred. Alternate translation: “after I came to you” or “when I came to you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background]])
1CO	2	1	o3ks	figs-possession	ὑπεροχὴν λόγου ἢ σοφίας	1		Here, Paul uses the possessive form to describe **speech** and **wisdom** that have **superiority**. If the meaning of this form would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea by translating **superiority** as an adjective. Alternate translation: “superior speech or superior wisdom” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
1CO	2	1	ikmt	translate-unknown	ὑπεροχὴν λόγου ἢ σοφίας	1		The word translated **superiority** refers to how something or someone has more authority, skill, knowledge, or power than something or someone else. If the meaning of this word would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea with a comparable word or a short description. Alternate translation: “greatness of speech or of wisdom” or “speech or wisdom that was better than what others have” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	2	1	kxie	grammar-connect-time-simultaneous	καταγγέλλων ὑμῖν τὸ μυστήριον τοῦ Θεοῦ	1		The phrase **proclaiming to you the mystery of God** gives the situation in which Paul **did not come with superiority of speech or of wisdom**. If this connection would be misunderstood in your language, you could make it explicit by including a word that indicates that these things are happening at the same time. Alternate translation: “when I proclaimed to you the mystery of God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous]])
1CO	2	1	nam8	figs-possession	τὸ μυστήριον τοῦ Θεοῦ	1		Here, Paul uses the possessive form to describe a **mystery** that is: (1) revealed by God. Alternate translation: “the mystery given by God” or “the mystery from God” (2) about God. Alternate translation: “the mystery about God” or “the mystery concerning God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
1CO	2	2	a2g9	figs-hyperbole	οὐ…ἔκρινά τι εἰδέναι ἐν ὑμῖν, εἰ μὴ Ἰησοῦν Χριστὸν	1	I decided to know nothing … except Jesus Christ	Here, Paul speaks as if he decides to forget all his knowledge and become ignorant of everything except for **Jesus Christ**. This is an exaggeration that Paul uses to emphasize his focus on **Jesus Christ** as the one thing he wished to tell the Corinthians about. If this exaggeration would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a phrase that indicates that it is an exaggeration or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “I decided to speak among you only about Jesus Christ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
1CO	2	2	nk9r	grammar-connect-exceptions	οὐ…ἔκρινά τι εἰδέναι ἐν ὑμῖν, εἰ μὴ Ἰησοῦν Χριστὸν, καὶ τοῦτον ἐσταυρωμένον	1		If it would appear in your language that Paul makes a strong statement about knowing nothing and then contradicts it, you could reword this sentence so that there is no **except**. Alternate translation: “I decided that I would only know among you Jesus Christ and him crucified” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-exceptions]])
1CO	2	2	zvge	figs-activepassive	τοῦτον ἐσταυρωμένον	1		If you cannot use this form in your language, you could express the idea in active form, using a phrase such as “he died on the cross” or adding a vague subject. Alternate translation: “how they crucified him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1CO	2	3	xen3	grammar-connect-words-phrases	κἀγὼ	1		Here, the word translated **And I** is the same word Paul used to introduce [2:1](../02/01.md). It again introduces how Paul himself fits into the pattern he introduced in the last chapter. Just as God chooses the weak and the foolish, Paul himself was weak and foolish. If this connection would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea with a word or phrase that introduces an example or a comparison. Alternate translation: “Just as I did not use superior words and wisdom, I myself” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
1CO	2	3	s9lp		κἀγὼ…ἐγενόμην πρὸς ὑμᾶς	1	I was with you	Alternate translation: “And I remained with you”
1CO	2	3	e8li	figs-abstractnouns	ἐν ἀσθενείᾳ, καὶ ἐν φόβῳ, καὶ ἐν τρόμῳ πολλῷ,	1	in weakness	If you cannot use this form in your language, you could express the abstract nouns **weakness**, **fear**, and **trembling** with adjectives or verbs. Alternate translation: “as a weak, afraid, and frequently trembling person” or “while I ailed, feared, and often trembled” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1CO	2	4	lewv	figs-ellipsis	ὁ λόγος μου καὶ τὸ κήρυγμά μου, οὐκ ἐν πειθοῖς σοφίας λόγοις	1		Here, Paul does not use the verb **were** in his sentence. In English, this word is essential, so it has been included in the ULT. If you can translate this sentence without **were**, you could do so here. Otherwise, you could retain **were** as it appears in the ULT. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
1CO	2	4	g5my	figs-abstractnouns	ὁ λόγος μου καὶ τὸ κήρυγμά μου, οὐκ	1		If you cannot use this form in your language, you could express the ideas behind the abstract nouns **word** and **proclamation** with verbs. Alternate translation: “I spoke and proclaimed a message not” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1CO	2	4	m23e	figs-abstractnouns	ἐν πειθοῖς σοφίας λόγοις	1		If you cannot use this form in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **words** with a verb such as “speak” and the idea behind the abstract noun **wisdom** with an adverb such as “wisely.” Alternate translation: “based on speaking persuasively and wisely” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1CO	2	4	hl7e	figs-possession	σοφίας λόγοις	1		Here, Paul uses the possessive form to identify the **words** as containing **wisdom**. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea by translating **wisdom** with an adjective such as “wise.” Alternate translation: “wise words” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
1CO	2	4	chtx	figs-ellipsis	ἀλλ’ ἐν ἀποδείξει Πνεύματος καὶ δυνάμεως;	1		Here, Paul has omitted some words that may be necessary to make a complete thought in your language. If the sentence would be misunderstood without these words, you could add them here, supplying the idea from earlier in the verse. Alternate translation: “but my word and my proclamation were with a demonstration of the Spirit and of power” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
1CO	2	4	kgnb	figs-abstractnouns	ἐν ἀποδείξει Πνεύματος καὶ δυνάμεως	1		If you cannot use this form in your language, you could express the ideas behind the abstract nouns **demonstration** and **power** with verbs. Alternate translation: “based on demonstrating the Spirit and how he works powerfully” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1CO	2	4	qrfj	figs-possession	ἀποδείξει Πνεύματος καὶ δυνάμεως	1		Here, Paul uses the possessive form to describe a **demonstration** that: (1) comes from **the Spirit** and **power**. Alternate translation: “a demonstration by the Spirit and by power” (2) proves that the **Spirit** and **power** are present. Alternate translation: “a demonstration of the presence of the Spirit and of power” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
1CO	2	4	s83h	translate-unknown	ἀποδείξει	1		The word translated **demonstration** refers to proving or showing that something is true. If the meaning of this word would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable expression. Alternate translation: “a validation” or “a confirmation” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	2	4	s6h6	figs-hendiadys	Πνεύματος καὶ δυνάμεως	1		This phrase expresses a single idea by using two words connected with **and**. The word **Spirit** tells who is acting in **power**. If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this meaning with an equivalent phrase that does not use **and**. Alternate translation: “of the Spirit’s power” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
1CO	2	5	av3t	figs-idiom	ἡ πίστις ὑμῶν, μὴ ᾖ ἐν σοφίᾳ ἀνθρώπων, ἀλλ’ ἐν δυνάμει Θεοῦ	1		Here, the phrase translated **faith … in** refers to believing something (**faith**) based on (**in**) something else. It does not refer, as it does in many other places, to believing in or trusting in something. If the meaning of this phrase would be misunderstood in your language, you could use translate **in** with a word or phrase that indicates the basis of the **faith**. Alternate translation: “your faith might not be based on the wisdom of men but based on the power of God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1CO	2	5	ovoj	figs-activepassive	ἡ πίστις ὑμῶν, μὴ ᾖ	1		If you cannot use this form in your language, you could express the idea in active form by translating **faith** with a verb such as “trust” or “believe.” Alternate translation: “you might believe not” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1CO	2	5	rkoy	figs-possession	σοφίᾳ ἀνθρώπων	1		Here, Paul uses the possessive form to describe what **men** think is **wisdom**. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea by translating **men** with an adjective such as “human.” Alternate translation: “in human wisdom” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
1CO	2	5	cdw7	figs-gendernotations	ἀνθρώπων	1		Although the word translated **men** is masculine, Paul is using it to refer to anyone, whether man or woman. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a non-gendered word or refer to both genders. Alternate translation: “of people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
1CO	2	5	b29d	figs-possession	δυνάμει Θεοῦ	1		Here, Paul uses the possessive form to speak of **power** that **God** has and shows. If the meaning of this phrase would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea by translating **power** as a verb or adverb with **God** as the subject. Alternate translation: “God working powerfully” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
1CO	2	6	azm7	grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1	Now we do speak	Here, the word translated **Now** introduces a contrast with what Paul has said in [2:4–5](../02/4–5.md). In those verses, he said that he did not speak with **wisdom**. In this verse, however, he clarifies that he does **speak** with a kind of **wisdom**. If **Now** would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea by using a word that introduces a contrast. Alternate translation: “In spite of this,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
1CO	2	6	uena	figs-exclusive	λαλοῦμεν	1		Here, **we** refers to Paul and others like him who preach the Gospel. It does not include the Corinthians. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
1CO	2	6	uka3	figs-abstractnouns	σοφίαν	-1	speak wisdom	If you cannot use this form in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **wisdom** by using an adverb such as “wisely” or an adjective such as “wise.” Alternate translation: “wisely … the wise speech” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1CO	2	6	eq1q	figs-nominaladj	τοῖς τελείοις	1	the mature	Paul is using the adjective **mature** as a noun in order to describe a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate **mature** with a noun phrase or a relative clause. Alternate translation: “those who are mature” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
1CO	2	6	tm2e	figs-possession	σοφίαν δὲ, οὐ τοῦ αἰῶνος τούτου, οὐδὲ τῶν ἀρχόντων τοῦ αἰῶνος τούτου	1		Here, Paul uses the possessive form to describe **wisdom** that fits with the standards and values of **this age** and that **rulers of this age** value. If this form would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea by using verbal phrases. Alternate translation: “but not wisdom that fits with this age nor wisdom that the rulers of this age value” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
1CO	2	6	xn85	figs-ellipsis	σοφίαν δὲ, οὐ	1		Here, Paul omits some words that may be needed in your language to make this a complete thought. If so, you could supply words from early in the verse. Alternate translation: “but we do not speak wisdom” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
1CO	2	6	xydl	figs-possession	τῶν ἀρχόντων τοῦ αἰῶνος τούτου	1		Here, Paul uses the possessive form to describe **rulers** who are in power during **this age**. If this form would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea by using language about the time in which the rulers have power or the place in which they have power. Alternate translation: “of the rulers who have power now” or “of the rulers who control this world” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
1CO	2	6	endk	translate-unknown	τῶν ἀρχόντων τοῦ αἰῶνος τούτου	1		The **rulers of this age** could refer to: (1) humans who have power. Alternate translation: “of the people who rule this age” (2) spiritual beings that have power. Alternate translation: “of the spiritual powers that rule this age” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	2	6	tbnh	translate-unknown	τῶν καταργουμένων	1		Paul has already used the word translated **passing away** in [1:28](../01/28.md), where it is translated **bring to nothing**. Here, the word means that the **rulers** are becoming ineffective, useless, or irrelevant, which means that they will no longer have power. If possible, translate this word like you did in [1:28](../01/28.md). Alternate translation: “who are becoming ineffective” or “who are losing their power” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	2	7	l064	figs-exclusive	λαλοῦμεν…ἡμῶν	1		Here, the word **we** refers to Paul and anyone who preaches the Gospel. It does not include the Corinthians. However, the word **our** does include the Corinthians along with Paul. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
1CO	2	7	bsme	figs-possession	Θεοῦ σοφίαν	1		Here, Paul uses the possessive form to describe **wisdom** that **God** would consider to be true **wisdom**. This also means that the **wisdom** comes from **God**. If this form would be misunderstood in your language, you could clarify that the **wisdom** comes from **God**. Alternate translation: “the wisdom from God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
1CO	2	7	wy8u	figs-abstractnouns	σοφίαν	1		If you cannot use this form in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun wisdom by using an adverb such as “wisely” or an adjective such as “wise.” Alternate translation: “the wise message” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1CO	2	7	xbye	figs-explicitinfo	ἐν μυστηρίῳ τὴν ἀποκεκρυμμένην	1		Here, Paul uses both **has been hidden** and **in a mystery**. Both of these phrases refer to something that is secret. If using both of these phrases is redundant and would be misunderstood in your language, you could use only one. Alternate translation: “that has been hidden” or “that is a mystery” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo]])
1CO	2	7	fd3s	figs-activepassive	τὴν ἀποκεκρυμμένην	1		If you cannot use this form in your language, you could express the idea in active form, with God as the subject. Alternate translation: “that God has hidden” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1CO	2	7	ctb4	writing-pronouns	ἣν	1		The word translated **that** refers to **the wisdom**, not **a mystery**. If what **that** refers to would be misunderstood in your language, you could repeat **wisdom** here. If you use the following alternate translation, you may need to add a comma before it. Alternate translation: “the wisdom that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
1CO	2	7	k2ct	figs-idiom	πρὸ τῶν αἰώνων	1	before the ages	Paul uses the phrase translated **before the ages** to say that God **predestined** before he made anything. If the meaning of this phrase would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable idiom or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “before the beginning of time” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1CO	2	7	q2z9	grammar-connect-logic-goal	εἰς δόξαν ἡμῶν	1	for our glory	Here, the phrase translated **for our glory** introduces the purpose for which **God predestined** the **wisdom**. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a purpose. Alternate translation: “so that we might have glory” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
1CO	2	8	bw5i	writing-pronouns	ἣν	1		Just as in [2:7](../02/07.md), the word translated **which** refers to “the wisdom,” not to “a mystery.” If what **which** refers to would be misunderstood in your language, you could repeat “wisdom” here. Alternate translation: “the wisdom that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
1CO	2	8	imbk	figs-possession	τῶν ἀρχόντων τοῦ αἰῶνος τούτου	1		Just as in [2:6](../02/06.md), Paul uses the possessive form to describe **rulers** who are in power during **this age**. If this form would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea by using language about the time in which **the rulers** have power or the place in which they have power. Alternate translation: “of the rulers who have power now” or “of the rulers who control this world” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
1CO	2	8	ur15	grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1		The word translated **for** introduces Paul’s proof that **the rulers** did not understand. If the meaning of this word would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea using a word that customarily introduces proof or evidence. Alternate translation: “which is true because” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
1CO	2	8	ji1o	grammar-connect-condition-contrary	εἰ…ἔγνωσαν, οὐκ ἂν τὸν Κύριον τῆς δόξης ἐσταύρωσαν;	1		Here, Paul uses **if** to introduce a scenario that he knows is not true. He wants to point out that the **rulers** were the ones who **crucified** Jesus, and this proves that they did not understand God’s wisdom. If this form would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea by reversing the two clauses and making **they understood it** negative and **they would not have crucified the Lord of glory** positive. Alternate translation: “they crucified the Lord glory, which means that they did not understand it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-contrary]])
1CO	2	8	zc89	figs-possession	τὸν Κύριον τῆς δόξης	1	the Lord of glory	Here, Paul uses the possessive form to describe **the Lord** who has **glory**. If this form would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea by translating **glory** with an adjective or a relative clause. Alternate translation: “the Lord who has glory” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
1CO	2	9	fu1y	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	ἀλλὰ	1	Things that no eye … arisen, the things … who love him	The word translated **But** introduces a contrast with the hypothetical statement in [2:8](../02/08.md) about how the rulers would not have crucified the Lord if they had understood God’s wisdom. The **But** reminds the reader that this hypothetical statement is not true, and Paul wishes to introduce further statements about how people do not understand God’s wisdom. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could leave **But** untranslated or use a word or phrase that would signal that Paul is now longer speaking hypothetically. Alternate translation: “But no,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
1CO	2	9	wuar	figs-ellipsis	ἀλλὰ καθὼς γέγραπται	1		Here, Paul has omitted some words that may be necessary in your language to form a complete thought. If necessary, you can supply a summary from [2:8](../02/08.md) of what the rulers did not understand and how they acted. Alternate translation: “But the rulers did not understand, just as it is written” or “But the rulers did do these things, just as it is written” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
1CO	2	9	qcb2	writing-quotations	καθὼς γέγραπται	1		In Paul’s culture, **just as it is written** is a normal way to introduce a quotation from an important text, in this case, the Old Testament book written by Isaiah the prophet. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable phrase that indicates that Paul is quoting from an important text. Alternate translation: “as it can be read in the Old Testament” or “according to Isaiah the prophet” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
1CO	2	9	pt3m	figs-infostructure	ἃ ὀφθαλμὸς οὐκ εἶδεν, καὶ οὖς οὐκ ἤκουσεν, καὶ ἐπὶ καρδίαν ἀνθρώπου οὐκ ἀνέβη, ἃ ἡτοίμασεν ὁ Θεὸς τοῖς ἀγαπῶσιν αὐτόν	1		In this quotation, **What eye has not seen, and ear has not heard, and has not arisen in the heart of man** are the **things God has prepared**. If hearing **What eye has not seen, and ear has not heard, and has not arisen in the heart of man** before **God has prepared** would be misunderstood in your language, you could reverse the order. Alternate translation: “God has prepared for those who love him what eye has not seen, and ear has not heard, and has not arisen in the heart of man” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
1CO	2	9	j9ib	figs-synecdoche	ἃ ὀφθαλμὸς οὐκ εἶδεν, καὶ οὖς οὐκ ἤκουσεν, καὶ ἐπὶ καρδίαν ἀνθρώπου οὐκ ἀνέβη	1	Things that no eye has seen, no ear has heard, no mind has imagined	Here, the words **eye**, **ear**, and **heart** refer to the parts of the person that see, hear, and think. In each case, the word means that the whole person sees, hears, and thinks. If this way of speaking would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word that refers to a person as a whole instead of just a part of that person. Alternate translation: “What a person has not seen, and a person has not heard, and has not arisen when a person thinks” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
1CO	2	9	xe03	figs-idiom	ἐπὶ καρδίαν ἀνθρώπου οὐκ ἀνέβη	1		The phrase **heart of man** refers to the place where humans think. If something “arises” there, that means that a human has thought about that thing. If the meaning of **arisen in the heart of man** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable phrase or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “man has not thought about” or “man has not imagined” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1CO	2	9	pigi	figs-possession	καρδίαν ἀνθρώπου	1		Here, Paul uses the possessive form to describe a **heart** that belongs to a **man**. If this form would be misunderstood in your language, you could translate **man** with an adjective such as “human.” Alternate translation: “the human heart” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
1CO	2	9	yw0a	figs-gendernotations	ἀνθρώπου	1		Although the word translated **man** is masculine, Paul is using it to refer to anyone, whether man or woman. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a non-gendered word or refer to both genders. Alternate translation: “of people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
1CO	2	9	us5y	grammar-collectivenouns	ἀνθρώπου	1		Here, even though **man** is written in singular form, it refers to anyone who would be considered a **man**, that is, any human. If this form would be misunderstood in your language, you can make **man** plural. Alternate translation: “of men” or “of humans” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns]])
1CO	2	10	z472	grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1		The word translated **For** introduces an explanation of the last line of the quote from [2:9](../02/09.md): “these things God has prepared for those who love him.” Paul wants to explain that these are the things that **God has revealed** to those who believe. If the meaning of **For** would be misunderstood in your language, you could leave the word untranslated or use a word or phrase that introduces an explanation. Alternate translation: “In fact,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
1CO	2	10	hp6w	grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	2		Here, the word translated **For** introduces an explanation for why God’s revelation is made **to us through the Spirit**. It is because the **Spirit searches everything** and knows everything that is **revealed**. If this connection would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable word or phrase that introduces this kind of explanation. Alternate translation: “He works through the Spirit because” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
1CO	2	10	zccl	translate-unknown	ἐραυνᾷ	1		Here, the word translated **searches** refers to how someone can explore or know about something else. If the meaning of **searches** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use another word for “exploring” or “knowing.” Alternate translation: “comprehends” or “knows about” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	2	10	bhyv	translate-unknown	τὰ βάθη τοῦ Θεοῦ	1		The phrase **deep things of God** refers to things about God that are hard to understand or things about God that no one can fully comprehend. If this form would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable expression or state the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “secrets about God” or “things about God that no one knows” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	2	11	h4p8	figs-rquestion	τίς γὰρ οἶδεν ἀνθρώπων τὰ τοῦ ἀνθρώπου, εἰ μὴ τὸ πνεῦμα τοῦ ἀνθρώπου τὸ ἐν αὐτῷ?	1	For who knows a person’s thoughts except the spirit of the person in him?	Here, Paul uses question because he thinks that everyone will agree with him, for this information is common knowledge in his culture. He does not use a question because he is not sure about the answer. If using a question here would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea by using a form that presents information that everyone knows and agrees with. Alternate translation: “For it is a well-known fact that no one among men knows the things of a man except the spirit of the man that {is} within him.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
1CO	2	11	gw3u	grammar-connect-exceptions	τίς γὰρ οἶδεν ἀνθρώπων τὰ τοῦ ἀνθρώπου, εἰ μὴ τὸ πνεῦμα τοῦ ἀνθρώπου τὸ ἐν αὐτῷ? οὕτως καὶ τὰ τοῦ Θεοῦ οὐδεὶς ἔγνωκεν, εἰ μὴ τὸ Πνεῦμα τοῦ Θεοῦ.	1	no one knows the deep things of God except the Spirit of God	In both parts of this verse, Paul makes a negative claim and then gives an exception to that claim. If it would appear in your language that Paul is contradicting himself, you could use a different structure that also singles out one possibility and negates all other possibilities. Alternate translation: “For the spirit of the man that {is} within him is the only one among men that knows the things of a man, right? So also, the Spirit of God is the only one that knows the things of God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-exceptions]])
1CO	2	11	li8e	figs-gendernotations	ἀνθρώπων…ἀνθρώπου…τοῦ ἀνθρώπου τὸ ἐν αὐτῷ	1		Although the words translated **men**, **man**, and **him** are masculine, Paul is using them to refer to anyone, whether man or woman. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a non-gendered word or refer to both genders. Alternate translation: “among people … of a person … of the person that {is} within that person” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
1CO	2	11	lmzi	figs-genericnoun	ἀνθρώπου…τοῦ ἀνθρώπου τὸ ἐν αὐτῷ	1		Paul uses the word **man** to speak of people in general, not one specific person. If the meaning of **man** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a form that indicates people in general in your language. Alternate translation: “of a certain man … of that certain man that {is} within him” or “of men … of men that {is} within them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])
1CO	2	11	wfr2	figs-idiom	τίς…ἀνθρώπων	1		The phrase **who among men** is a way of asking about people or things that belong to a specific category. Paul means to ask if there are any **men** who can know **the things of a man**. He uses this phrase because God also **knows the things of a man**, so he must limit his question to only **men**. If this form would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea by using a phrase that asks about people or things, but only those that belong in a specific category. Alternate translation: “which man” or “out of all men, who” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1CO	2	11	mi27	figs-idiom	τὰ τοῦ ἀνθρώπου…τὰ τοῦ Θεοῦ	1		Here, Paul uses the phrases **the things of a man** and **the things of God** to refer to everything that makes up the person, including personality, thoughts, actions, desires, possessions, and many more similar categories. Paul is intentionally general and does not narrow down which of these categories he has in mind. If this form would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an expression that refers to all the aspects of a person that makes that person unique. Alternate translation: “all the details about a man … all the details about God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1CO	2	11	i47d	translate-unknown	τὸ πνεῦμα τοῦ ἀνθρώπου τὸ ἐν αὐτῷ	1	spirit of the person	The word translated **spirit** is the same word that Paul uses for the Holy **Spirit**. It refers to the interior life of a person, to the part of them that people cannot see, including their thoughts and desires. If possible, use the same word here that you will use later in the verse for the **Spirit**, since Paul is drawing an analogy between the human **spirit** and God’s **Spirit**. If you cannot use the word for God’s **Spirit** to describe a human being, you could: (1) refer simply to a human without specifying which part of the human **knows**. Alternate translation: “the man himself” (2) use an expression that refers to the interior life of a human. Alternate translation: “the consciousness of the man that {is} within him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	2	11	to3t	figs-idiom	τὸ πνεῦμα τοῦ ἀνθρώπου τὸ ἐν αὐτῷ	1		In this culture, people would speak of the non-physical part of human beings as if it were inside the physical part of human beings. Here, Paul speaks in this way when he says that the **spirit of the man** is **within him**. By using **within him**, Paul is identifying the **spirit** as the one that belongs to **the man**. It is not some other man’s **spirit**. If the meaning of **within him** would be misunderstood in your language, you could: (1) use a word or phrase that identifies that the **spirit** belongs to **the man** only. Alternate translation: “that man’s own spirit” (2) express the idea by using a phrase that describes where a human being’s non-physical part would be in your culture. Alternate translation: “the spirit of the man that permeates him” or “the spirit of the man that suffuses him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1CO	2	12	zbv8	grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1	General Information:	Here, the word translated **But** introduces the next part of Paul’s argument. If the meaning of **But** would be misunderstood in your language, you could leave it untranslated or use a word or phrase that signifies that the argument is moving on. Alternate translation: “Now” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
1CO	2	12	evts	figs-infostructure	ἡμεῖς…οὐ τὸ πνεῦμα τοῦ κόσμου ἐλάβομεν, ἀλλὰ τὸ Πνεῦμα τὸ ἐκ τοῦ Θεοῦ	1		If stating the negative before the positive would be misunderstood in your language, you could reverse the order of the **not** statement and the **but** statement. Alternate translation: “we received the Spirit who {is} from God, not the spirit of the world” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
1CO	2	12	emse	translate-unknown	τὸ πνεῦμα τοῦ κόσμου	1		The phrase **spirit of the world** could refer to: (1) a **spirit** that does not actually exist. In other words, Paul is saying that the Spirit they received did not come from the **world** but rather came from **God**. Alternate translation: “a spirit that comes from the world” (2) human ways of thinking and understanding, which could be called a **spirit**. In other words, Paul is saying that they did not receive human ways of thinking but rather ways of thinking that God’s Spirit brings. Alternate translation: “human ways of thinking” ((See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	2	12	ev7j	figs-possession	τὸ πνεῦμα τοῦ κόσμου	1		Here, Paul uses the possessive form to describe a **spirit** that comes from or has its source in **the world**. If this form would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word or phrase that indicates that **the world** is the source or origin of this **spirit**. Alternate translation: “the spirit from the world” or “the spirit that comes from the world” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
1CO	2	12	vw4v	figs-ellipsis	ἀλλὰ τὸ Πνεῦμα	1		Here, Paul omits some words that may be needed in your language to make a complete thought. If this shortened form would be misunderstood in your language, you could supply some words from earlier in the sentence. Alternate translation: “but we received the Spirit” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
1CO	2	12	w1qd	figs-activepassive	τὸ Πνεῦμα τὸ ἐκ τοῦ Θεοῦ	1		If you cannot use this form in your language, you could make God the subject of the **who** statement. Alternate translation: “the Spirit whom God sent” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1CO	2	12	n1c7	figs-activepassive	τὰ ὑπὸ τοῦ Θεοῦ χαρισθέντα ἡμῖν	1	freely given to us by God	If you cannot use this form in your language, you could express the idea in active form. Alternate translation: “the things that God has freely given to us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1CO	2	13	nan2	figs-exclusive	λαλοῦμεν	1		Here, the word **we** refers to Paul and others who proclaim the Gospel with him. It does not include the Corinthians. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
1CO	2	13	u797	figs-infostructure	οὐκ ἐν διδακτοῖς ἀνθρωπίνης σοφίας λόγοις, ἀλλ’ ἐν διδακτοῖς Πνεύματος	1	The Spirit interprets spiritual words with spiritual wisdom	If putting the negative statement before the positive statement would be misunderstood in your language, you could reverse them, putting **words** with the positive statement. Alternate translation: “in words taught by the Spirit, not in those taught by human wisdom” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
1CO	2	13	yg45	figs-activepassive	διδακτοῖς ἀνθρωπίνης σοφίας λόγοις	1	The Spirit interprets spiritual words with spiritual wisdom	If you cannot use this form in your language, you could express the idea in active form. Alternate translation: “words that human wisdom teaches” or “words that humans teach as wisdom” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1CO	2	13	ywbw	figs-activepassive	διδακτοῖς Πνεύματος	1		If you cannot use this form in your language, you could express the idea in active form. Alternate translation: “those that the Spirit teaches” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1CO	2	13	gueq	translate-unknown	πνευματικοῖς πνευματικὰ συνκρίνοντες	1		Here, the phrase **combining spiritual things with spiritual words** could mean: (1) that Paul and those with him interpret **spiritual things** and ideas with **spiritual words**. Alternate translation: “interpreting spiritual things with spiritual words” (2) that Paul and those with him explain **spiritual things** to **spiritual** people. Alternate translation: “explaining spiritual things to spiritual people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	2	13	kinz	grammar-connect-time-simultaneous	συνκρίνοντες	1		Here, the word translated **combining** introduces an action that takes place at the same time as when **we speak**. The idea is that **combining spiritual things with spiritual words** is the way that **we speak these things**. If this connection would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea by including a word or phrase that indicates that **combining** is the way in which **we speak**. Alternate translation: “by means of combining” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous]])
1CO	2	13	mnpq	translate-unknown	συνκρίνοντες	1		The word translated **combining** could mean: (1) interpreting or explaining an idea. Alternate translation: “interpreting” (2) putting two things together, either to compare or blend them together. Alternate translation: “comparing” or “compounding” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	2	14	i8jw	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	δὲ	1		The word translated **But** introduces a new part of Paul’s argument, and it also introduces a contrast with how Paul and those with him speak by the power of the Spirit in [2:13](../02/13.md). Unlike Paul and those with him, the **natural person** does not have the Spirit and does not use spiritual words. If the meaning of **But** would be misunderstood in your language, you could leave it untranslated or use a word that introduces a contrast. Alternate translation: “However,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
1CO	2	14	hq3u	translate-unknown	ψυχικὸς…ἄνθρωπος	1	unspiritual person	The phrase **the natural person** describes a person who does not have God’s Spirit. If the meaning of this phrase would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea by using a word or phrase that describes someone who has not received God’s Spirit. Alternate translation: “the person without the Spirit” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	2	14	cve2	figs-genericnoun	ψυχικὸς…ἄνθρωπος, οὐ δέχεται…αὐτῷ…οὐ δύναται	1	General Information:	Paul uses the words **person**, **him**, and **he** to speak of people in general, not one specific man. If the meaning of these words would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a form that indicates people in general in your language. Alternate translation: “any natural person does not receive … to him or her … he or she is not able” or “natural people do not receive … to them … they are not able” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])
1CO	2	14	vvju	figs-gendernotations	αὐτῷ…οὐ δύναται	1		Here, the words translated **him** and **he** are written in masculine form, but they refer to anyone, no matter what their gender might be. If the meaning of **he** and **him** would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea by using a word that does not have gender or you could use both genders. Alternate translation: “to that person … that person is not able” or “to him or her … he or she is not able” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
1CO	2	14	fye5	figs-activepassive	μωρία…αὐτῷ ἐστίν	1		If you cannot use this form in your language, you could reverse the structure and make **him** the subject of a verb such as “think” or “consider.” Alternate translation: “for he thinks that they are foolishness” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1CO	2	14	gwe3	figs-activepassive	πνευματικῶς ἀνακρίνεται	1	because they are spiritually discerned	If you cannot use this form in your language, you could express the idea in active form with vague or non-specific subject.

1CO	2	14	vznr		πνευματικῶς ἀνακρίνεται	1		Alternate translation: “they are discerned by the power of the Spirit” or “they are discerned by people who are indwelt by the Spirit”
1CO	2	15	w4q7	translate-unknown	ὁ…πνευματικὸς	1	the one who is spiritual	Here, Paul uses **the spiritual one** as the opposite of “the natural person” in [2:14](../02/14.md). The phrase **the spiritual one** describes a person who does have God’s Spirit. If the meaning of this phrase would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea by using a word or phrase that describes someone who has received God’s Spirit. Alternate translation: “the person with the Spirit” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	2	15	gcv7	figs-genericnoun	ὁ…πνευματικὸς ἀνακρίνει…αὐτὸς…ἀνακρίνεται	1		Paul uses the words **spiritual one** and **he himself** to speak of people in general, not one specific man. If the meaning of these words would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a form that indicates people in general. Alternate translation: “any spiritual person discerns … he himself or she herself” or “spiritual people discern … they themselves are discerned” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])
1CO	2	15	ap89	figs-hyperbole	τὰ πάντα	1		Here, Paul uses phrase translated **all things** as an exaggeration to emphasize that the **spiritual one** can discern God’s gifts and the message of the Gospel. He does not mean that every **spiritual** person is able to discern everything there is to know. If this exaggeration would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea by using a phrase such as “many things,” and express the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “many things indeed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
1CO	2	15	ji5n	figs-activepassive	αὐτὸς…ὑπ’ οὐδενὸς ἀνακρίνεται	1		If you cannot use this form in your language, you could express the idea in active form. Alternate translation: “no one discerns him himself” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1CO	2	15	ypl6	figs-gendernotations	αὐτὸς…ἀνακρίνεται	1		Here, the words translated **he himself** are written in masculine form, but they refer to anyone, no matter what their gender might be. If the meaning of **he himself** would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea by using a word that does not have gender or you could use both genders. Alternate translation: “that person is discerned” or “he himself or she herself is discerned” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
1CO	2	15	zg4b	figs-explicit	αὐτὸς…ὑπ’ οὐδενὸς ἀνακρίνεται	1		Here, Paul wishes to say that it is impossible for someone without the Spirit to properly understand or make judgments about the person who does have the Spirit. If this implication would be missed by your readers, you could make it more explicit that Paul speaking about the possibility of someone without the Spirit “discerning” someone with the Spirit. Alternate translation: “he himself cannot be discerned by anyone who is not spiritual” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	2	16	ye98	grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1		Here, the word translated **For** introduces proof from Scripture to support what Paul has said about the “natural person” and the “spiritual” person in [2:14–15](../02/14–15.md). If this connection would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word or phrase that indicates that Paul is introducing proof. Alternate translation: “You can tell that these things are true because” or “Indeed,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
1CO	2	16	tj79	writing-quotations	γὰρ	1		The word translated **For** is the only word that Paul has used to introduce this quotation from the Old Testament, in this case, from the book written by Isaiah the prophet. If introducing a quotation in this way would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable phrase that indicates that Paul is quoting from an important text. Alternate translation: “For, as it can be read in the Old Testament,” or “For, according to Isaiah the prophet,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
1CO	2	16	m4pu	figs-rquestion	τίς…ἔγνω νοῦν Κυρίου, ὃς συμβιβάσει αὐτόν?	1	For who can know the mind of the Lord, that he can instruct him?	Here, the passage that Paul quotes from the book of Isaiah uses a question to indicate that no human **has known the mind of the Lord**, and no human **will instruct him**. The question is not asking for information. Instead, it assumes that the answer is “no one,” and the author uses a question to make a negative claim that is stronger than a simple statement. If the question would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea with a strong negative statement. Alternate translation: “no one has known the mind of the Lord—no one will instruct him.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
1CO	2	16	wacc	figs-possession	νοῦν Κυρίου	1		Here, Paul uses the possessive form to describe a **mind** that the **Lord** has or uses. If it would be misunderstood that the **Lord** is one who is thinking with **the mind**, you could express the idea by using a verbal phrase. Alternate translation: “the thoughts that the Lord thinks” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
1CO	2	16	r18k	figs-metaphor	νοῦν Χριστοῦ ἔχομεν	1		Here, Paul speaks as if **we** are people who possess **the mind of Christ**. Paul means that **we** are able to understand what Christ thinks and share the same ways of thinking with him. He does not mean that we have taken Christ’s **mind** from him or that we no longer have our own **mind**. If “having someone else’s mind” would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea with a comparable metaphor or with a verb such as “share.” Alternate translation: “think the same thoughts as Christ does” or “share in the mind of Christ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	2	16	pr9b	figs-possession	νοῦν Χριστοῦ	1		Here, Paul uses the possessive form to describe a **mind** that **Christ** has or uses. If it would be misunderstood that **Christ** is one who is thinking with **the mind**, you could express the idea by using a verbal phrase. Alternate translation: “the thoughts that Christ thinks” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
1CO	3	intro	g6ku			0		# 1 Corinthians 3 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>2. Against divisions (1:10–4:15)<br>    * Paul identifies the divisions (3:1–5)<br>    * Farming metaphor (3:6–9a)<br>    * Building metaphor (3:9b–15<br>    * Temple metaphor (3:16–17)<br>    * Wisdom and folly (3:18–20)<br>    * All things are yours (3:21–23)<br><br>Some translations set quotations from the Old Testament farther to the right on the page to make them easier to read. The ULT does this with the quoted words of verses 19 and 20. Verse 19 quotes from Job 5:13, and verse 20 quotes from Psalm 94:11.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Fleshly people<br><br>In [3:1–4](../03/01–04.md), Paul calls the Corinthian believers “fleshly.” In [3:3](../03/03.md), he defines “fleshly” as “walking according to men.” The word “fleshly” thus refers to people who think and behave from a merely human point of view, without thinking and behaving from God’s perspective. The opposite of “fleshly” is “spiritual,” which refers to those who think and behave by the power of the Spirit (see [3:1](../0/01.md)). (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/flesh]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/spirit]])<br><br>### Fire and judgment<br><br>In Paul’s culture, fire was commonly associated with the day when God would come to judge everyone. Paul uses this association when he makes use of the metaphor of a building. When a building catches on fire, it shows how well it was build. Similarly, when the fire of God’s judgment comes, it will show who has taught the gospel correctly. Fire fits within the metaphor of a building, but it is not just a part of that metaphor. If it is possible, retain the language of fire for God’s judgment. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/judgmentday]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/fire]])<br><br>### Wisdom and Foolishness<br><br>Throughout this chapter, Paul continues to speak of both wisdom and foolishness. Just as in chapters one and two, these words do not refer primarily to how much or how little education someone has. Rather, they refer to how well or how poorly someone plans actions and knows how the world works. Continue to use the words you chose in chapters one and two. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/wise]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/fool]])<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Infants and food metaphor<br><br>In [3:1–2](../03/01–02.md), Paul speaks as if the Corinthians are infants who were, and still are, unable to eat any solid food but can only drink milk. By speaking about them as if they were infants, Paul wishes to tell the Corinthians that they are spiritually immature. They are immature enough that they can only drink milk. Paul uses “milk” to refer to the very basic teachings about Christ, while he uses “solid food” to refer to the more advanced teachings. In translating this metaphor, use words that identify what very small children can eat (milk) and what they cannot eat (solid food). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])<br><br>### Farming metaphor<br><br>In [3:6–9a](../03/06–09.md), Paul speaks as if he and Apollos were farmers. Paul first proclaimed the gospel to the Corinthians, so he is like a farmer who plants seeds. Apollos taught the Corinthians more about the gospel, so he is like a farmer who waters the plants when they start to grow. However, God is the one who makes seeds grow into plants and the one who enables believers to accept and learn more about the gospel. With this metaphor, Paul wishes to emphasize that he and Apollos are equal in that they both teach about the gospel. However, neither one of them is significant in comparison to God, who is the one who actually enables people to accept and believe in the gospel. If possible, preserve the farming metaphor, even if you need to adjust some of the details. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])<br><br>### Building metaphor<br><br>In [3:9b–15](../03/09–15.md), Paul speaks of the Corinthians as if they were a house. Paul is the one who laid the house’s foundation, because he was the one who first proclaimed the gospel to them. Other people, whom Paul does not name, build on the foundation. They are the ones who are teaching the Corinthians more, whether what they teach is correct or not. Paul then says that the building will catch on fire, and what each of these builders used to construct the house will become clear. If they built with durable materials, they will be rewarded, but if they built with materials that burn, they will suffer loss, and the builders themselves will barely escape from the fire. In speaking this way, Paul is warning those who teach more about the gospel that God himself will judge whether what they teach is correct or not. If it is incorrect, those teachers will lose everything and barely be saved themselves. If it is correct, God will honor and reward those teachers. If possible, preserve the building metaphor, even if you need to adjust some of the details. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])<br><br>### Temple metaphor<br><br>In [3:16–17](../03/16–17.md), Paul speaks as if the Corinthians were God’s temple. By speaking this way, he identifies the Corinthian believers as a place where God is specially present. Paul then notes that anyone who does anything to harm God’s temple will be punished by God. Since the Corinthians are like God’s temple, God will punish anyone who does anything to harm them, including if anyone tries to divide them up into different groups. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])<br><br>### Rhetorical questions<br><br>Paul asks many questions in this chapter ([3:3–5](../03/03–05.md); [16](../03/16.md)). He is not asking these questions because he wants the Corinthians to provide him with information. Rather, he is asking these questions because he wants the Corinthians to think about how they are acting and what they are thinking. The questions encourage them to think along with Paul. For ways to translate these questions, look for the notes on each verse that includes these kinds of questions. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Christ is God’s<br><br>In [3:23](../03/23.md), Paul says that “Christ is God’s.” He does not mean that Christ is a person who belongs to God, but is not God. Rather, he means that Christ is part of who God is. Christ belongs to the being of God. In your translation, you should to try to preserve this meaning. However, if possible, do not make your translation into a statement about the divinity of Christ, since that is not the main point that Paul is trying to make.
1CO	3	1	zfdg	grammar-connect-words-phrases	κἀγώ	1		The word translated **And I** is the same word that appears at the beginning of [2:1](../02/01.md). Just as there, Paul uses **And I** here to introduce how his own experience visiting the Corinthians fits into the general pattern he has outlined at the end of chapter 2. Here, however, his experience with the Corinthians is the opposite of what he would have liked. Therefore, the words **And I** introduce a contrast with what he said in [2:16](../02/16.md) about having the mind of Christ. If the meaning of **And I** would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea by using a word or phrase that introduces a specific example or a word or phrase that introduces a contrast. Alternate translation: “But I” or “As for me, I” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
1CO	3	1	r4iw	figs-gendernotations	ἀδελφοί	1	brothers	Although the word translated **brothers** is masculine, Paul is using it to refer to anyone, whether man or woman. If **brothers** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a non-gendered word or refer to both genders. Alternate translation: “brothers and sisters” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
1CO	3	1	jn0q	figs-infostructure	οὐκ ἠδυνήθην λαλῆσαι ὑμῖν ὡς πνευματικοῖς, ἀλλ’ ὡς σαρκίνοις, ὡς νηπίοις ἐν Χριστῷ.	1		If stating the negative before the positive would be misunderstood in your language, you could reverse the order of the **not** statement and the **but** statements. Alternate translation: “had to speak to you as to fleshly, as to infants in Christ, not as to spiritual” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
1CO	3	1	jx17	figs-nominaladj	πνευματικοῖς…σαρκίνοις	1	spiritual people	Paul is using the adjectives **spiritual** and **fleshly** as nouns in order to describe groups of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate these with noun phrases. Alternate translation: “to spiritual people … to fleshly people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
1CO	3	1	r5w5	figs-ellipsis	ἀλλ’ ὡς σαρκίνοις, ὡς νηπίοις	1	fleshly people	Here, Paul leaves out some words that might be required in your language to make a complete thought. If this form would be misunderstood in your language, you could supply the needed words from earlier in the sentence. Alternate translation: “but I spoke to you as to fleshly, I spoke to you as to infants” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
1CO	3	1	ja6t	figs-metaphor	νηπίοις ἐν Χριστῷ	1	as to little children in Christ	Here, Paul speaks as if the Corinthians were **infants**. He wants the Corinthians to think about how **infants** are immature, do not have much knowledge, and are unable to understand most things. By calling the Corinthians **infants in Christ**, he means that in their relationship with Jesus, they were immature, had little knowledge, and were unable to understand very much. If calling the Corinthians **infants** would be misunderstood in your language, you could a comparable metaphor or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “to beginners in Christ” or “to those who could understand very little about their faith in Christ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	3	1	m588	figs-metaphor	ἐν Χριστῷ	1		Paul uses the spatial metaphor **in Christ** to describe the union of believers with Christ. In this case, being **in Christ**, or being united to Christ, explains in what area of their lives they were like **infants**. They acted like **infants** in their relationship with Christ. If the meaning of **in Christ** would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea by referring to their “faith” in **Christ** or their “relationship” with **Christ**. Alternate translation: “in their faith in Christ” or “in their relationship with Christ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	3	2	vg2v	figs-metaphor	γάλα ὑμᾶς ἐπότισα, οὐ βρῶμα	1	I fed you milk, not solid food	Paul refers to **milk** because it is the food of “infants,” whom Paul already mentioned in [3:1](../03/01.md). The **milk** is the only thing that the “infants” can eat, and Paul thus uses **milk** to refer to the very simplest things that the Corinthians were able to understand about the Gospel. “Infants” do not eat **solid food**, because they are not yet able to properly chew or digest it. So, Paul uses **solid food** to refer to the more complex things about the Gospel that he could not teach the Corinthians because they were “infants,” that is, people who could not understand such complex teachings. If that metaphor about **milk** and **solid food** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “I taught you the basics, not the full picture” or “I taught you things that are easy to understand, not things that are hard to understand” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	3	2	fujt	figs-ellipsis	οὐ βρῶμα	1		Here, Paul has omitted some words that may be necessary to make a complete thought in your language. If the sentence would be misunderstood without these words, you could add a phrase such as “to eat.” Alternate translation: “not solid food to eat” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
1CO	3	2	d2x5	figs-ellipsis	οὔπω…ἐδύνασθε…οὐδὲ νῦν δύνασθε	1		Here, Paul has omitted some words that may be necessary to make a complete thought in your language. If the sentence would be misunderstood without these words, you could add them here, supplying the idea from earlier in the verse. Alternate translation: “you were not yet able to eat solid food … even now, you are not able to eat solid food” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
1CO	3	2	i3r5	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	ἀλλ’	1		The word translated **Indeed** functions to contrast the time when Paul visited the Corinthians with the time when Paul is writing this letter. He speaks of these two different times to say that the Corinthians could not to eat the **solid food** at either time. If the meaning of **Indeed** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word or phrase that contrasts two times or a word that introduces additional information. Alternate translation: “But” or “In fact” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
1CO	3	3	m712	figs-nominaladj	σαρκικοί	-1	still fleshly	Paul is using the adjective **fleshly** as a noun in order to describe a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this adjective with a noun phrase. Alternate translation: “fleshly people … fleshly people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
1CO	3	3	o618	figs-abstractnouns	ὅπου…ἐν ὑμῖν ζῆλος καὶ ἔρις	1		If you cannot use this form in your language, you could express the ideas behind the abstract nouns **jealousy** and **strife** by using verbs such as “being jealous” and “fighting.” Alternate translation: “where you are jealous and fight with one another” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1CO	3	3	s1uy	figs-metonymy	ὅπου	1		The word translated **where** often refers to space. However, here Paul uses it to refer to time. Instead of identifying a specific location, it identifies a specific time. If the meaning of **where** would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea by using a word that refers to time. Alternate translation: “when there is” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1CO	3	3	k5ll	figs-rquestion	οὐχὶ σαρκικοί ἐστε καὶ κατὰ ἄνθρωπον περιπατεῖτε?	1	are you not living according to the flesh, and are you not walking by human standards?	Paul does not ask this question because he is looking for information or for agreement or disagreement. Rather, he asks it to involve the Corinthians in what he is arguing. The question assumes that the answer is “yes.” If this question would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea with a statement that draws a conclusion from the **jealousy** and the **strife**. Alternate translation: “you are fleshly and walking according to men” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
1CO	3	3	oz5v	figs-hendiadys	καὶ	2		Here, Paul uses the word translated **and** to introduce a definition of what **fleshly** means. It means **walking according to men**. If you cannot use **and** to introduce a definition or explanation, you could use another word or phrase that does introduce a definition or explanation. If you use one of the following alternate translations, you may need to add a comma before it. Alternate translation: “that is, are you not” or “which means” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
1CO	3	3	as2u	figs-metaphor	κατὰ ἄνθρωπον περιπατεῖτε	1		Paul speaks of behavior in life as if it were **walking**. If **walking** would not be understood as a description of a person’s way of life in your language, you could express the idea with a comparable metaphor or non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “behaving as men do” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	3	3	ljri	figs-idiom	κατὰ ἄνθρωπον	1		Here, Paul speaks of behavior that is **according to men**. By using this phrase, he wishes to identify behaviors that people who think and act in only human ways do. These people do not have God’s Spirit, so they “walk” according to the values and goals of this world. If the phrase **according to men** would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea by using a word or phrase that refers to things and behaviors that people who do not believe value. Alternate translation: “according to what mere humans value” or “according to this world” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1CO	3	3	y8b4	figs-gendernotations	ἄνθρωπον	1		Although the word translated **men** is masculine, Paul is using it to refer to anyone, whether man or woman. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a non-gendered word or refer to both genders. Alternate translation: “humans” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
1CO	3	4	cidr	grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1		Here, the word translated **For** introduces further evidence for Paul’s argument that the Corinthians in acting in merely humans ways. If that meaning for **For** would be misunderstood in your language, you could leave **For** untranslated or express the idea using a word or phrase that introduces more evidence or examples. Alternate translation: “Indeed,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
1CO	3	4	g8zt	writing-pronouns	λέγῃ τις…ἕτερος	1		Here, Paul uses the pronouns **one** and **another** to give two examples of some people in the Corinthian church who are sayings these kinds of things. He does not mean that only two people are saying these things. He also does not mean that these are the only things that people in the church are saying. If the form that Paul uses would be misunderstood in your language, you could use words that introduce examples of a larger pattern, and you could add a phrase that indicates that the words **I am of Paul** and **I am of of Apollos** are two examples of the kinds of things that they are saying. Alternate translation: “some people among you say things like … other people among you say things like” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
1CO	3	4	rmtq	figs-quotations	ἐγὼ…εἰμι Παύλου…ἐγὼ Ἀπολλῶ	1		If you cannot use this form in your language, you could translate these statements as indirect quotes instead of as direct quotes. Alternate translation: “that he or she is of Paul … that he or she is of Apollos” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
1CO	3	4	g68p	figs-possession	ἐγὼ…εἰμι Παύλου…ἐγὼ Ἀπολλῶ	1		Just as in [1:12](../01/12.md), Paul uses the possessive form to indicate that people are claiming to be part of a specific leader’s group. If this form would be misunderstood in your language, you could express this idea with a word such as “belong” or “follow.” Alternate translation: “‘I follow Paul’ … ‘I follow Apollos’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
1CO	3	4	zsby	translate-names	Παύλου…Ἀπολλῶ	1		These are the names of two men. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
1CO	3	4	s96g	figs-rquestion	οὐκ ἄνθρωποί ἐστε?	1	are you not living as human beings?	Paul does not ask this question because he is looking for information or for agreement or disagreement. Rather, he asks it to involve the Corinthians in what he is arguing. The question assumes that the answer is “yes.” If this question would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea with a statement that draws a conclusion from what Paul says the Corinthians are saying. Alternate translation: “you are men” or “this shows that you are men” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
1CO	3	4	mmlq	figs-explicit	ἄνθρωποί	1		When Paul says that the Corinthians are **men**, he means that they are “only” or “merely” **men**. He is not identifying them as humans. Rather, he means that they are acting and speaking from “merely human” perspective rather than from God’s perspective, a perspective they can share if they have God’s Spirit. If the meaning of **men** would be misunderstood in your language, you could add a word or phrase that clarifies that **men** refers to a “merely human” view of the world. Alternate translation: “merely men” or “speaking from a human perspective” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	3	4	te5r	figs-gendernotations	ἄνθρωποί	1		Although the word translated **men** is masculine, Paul is using it to refer to anyone, whether man or woman. If **men** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a non-gendered word or refer to both genders. Alternate translation: “humans” or “men and women” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
1CO	3	5	typo	grammar-connect-words-phrases	οὖν	1		The word translated **then** introduces a further stage in Paul’s argument. He has argued in [3:3](../03/04.md) that **Paul** and **Apollos** should not be treated as leaders of groups. In this verse, he goes on to explain how he thinks that **Paul** and **Apollos** should be treated, which is as servants of Christ. Thus, the word translated **then** introduces who **Paul** and **Apollos** really are. If how **then** functions would be misunderstood in your language, you could leave it untranslated or use a word that introduces the next step in an argument. If you use the following alternate translation, you may need to add a comma before it. Alternate translation: “therefore,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
1CO	3	5	m463	figs-rquestion	τί οὖν ἐστιν Ἀπολλῶς? τί δέ ἐστιν Παῦλος? διάκονοι	1	Who then is Apollos? And who is Paul?	Here, Paul uses these questions to do two things. First, the questions imply that **Apollos** and **Paul** are not very important. Therefore, an implied answer to these questions would be that **Apollos** and **Paul** are “not very much.” Second, Paul uses the questions to introduce his own answer to these questions. After using the questions to imply that he and **Apollos** are not much, he then states that they are **servants**. If using questions in these ways would be misunderstood in your language, you could express them as a statement about the status of **Apollos** and **Paul** as **servants**, and you could use a word such as “only” or “merely” to express the idea that they are not very important. Alternate translation: “Apollos and Paul are merely servants” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
1CO	3	5	i9d0	translate-names	Ἀπολλῶς…Παῦλος	1		These are the names of two men. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
1CO	3	5	lq6n	figs-123person	ἐστιν Παῦλος?	1	And who is Paul?	In this verse, **Paul** speaks of himself in the third person. This could sound like he is speaking about a different **Paul** than himself. If this use of **Paul** would be misunderstood in your language, you could clarify that **Paul** is naming himself. Alternate translation: “am I, Paul” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
1CO	3	5	qmy2	figs-ellipsis	διάκονοι δι’ ὧν ἐπιστεύσατε	1	Servants through whom you believed	Here, Paul omits several words that may be required in your language to make a complete thought. If this phrase would be misunderstood in your language, you could include the words needed to make a complete thought, such as “we are” or “they are.” Alternate translation: “We are servants through whom you believed” or “They are servants through whom you believed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
1CO	3	5	edod	figs-explicit	διάκονοι δι’ ὧν ἐπιστεύσατε	1		When **Paul** says that he and **Apollos** are those **through whom** the Corinthians **believed**, he is implying that the Corinthians believed in someone other than **Paul** and **Apollos**. That is, they believed in Christ. If this implication about **whom** the Corinthians **believed** in would be misunderstood in your language, you could make it explicit by including what the Corinthians **believed** in, which is “Christ” and not **Apollos** or **Paul**. Alternate translation: “Servants through whom you believed in Christ” or “Servants through whom you believed in Christ, not in us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	3	5	h2jv	grammar-connect-words-phrases	καὶ…ὡς	1		Here, the words translated **even as** introduce the way in which **Apollos** and **Paul** act as **servants**. If this connection would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word or phrase that could introduce the ways in which **Apollos** and **Paul** asre servants. Alternate translation: “who do what” or “serving just as” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
1CO	3	5	f6wm	figs-ellipsis	καὶ ἑκάστῳ ὡς ὁ Κύριος ἔδωκεν	1	Servants through whom you believed, to each of whom the Lord gave tasks	Here, Paul omits what **the Lord gave** because it would be clear that he means that **the Lord gave** a specific job or task **to each one** of them. If **the Lord gave to each one** would be misunderstood in your language, you could add a word or phrase that indicates that **the Lord gave** a specific job or task. Alternate translation: “even as the Lord gave a task to teach one” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
1CO	3	5	e8tb	writing-pronouns	ἑκάστῳ	1		The word translated **to each one** directly refers back to **Apollos** and **Paul**. However, it also probably refers to everyone who serves the Lord. If you can refer to multiple individuals considered separately in your language, you could use that form here. Alternate translation: “to each and every one who serves him” or “per person” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
1CO	3	6	iah7	figs-exmetaphor	ἐγὼ ἐφύτευσα, Ἀπολλῶς ἐπότισεν, ἀλλὰ ὁ Θεὸς ηὔξανεν.	1	I planted	Paul speaks about the roles that God gave to him and to **Apollos** as if they were farmers who **planted** and **watered** their crops. The one who “plants” is the person who begins the farming process, just like Paul first introduced the Corinthians to the gospel. The one who “waters” is the person who continues the farming process by making sure the plants receive what they need to grow, just like **Apollos** continued to proclaim the gospel to the Corinthians. It is a well-known fact in Paul’s culture that plants grow because God enables them to do so, just like God enabled to the Corinthians to receive the gospel and learn more about God. If the way Paul uses farming language to describe how the Corinthians received the Gospel would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “I invested the money, Apollos managed the portfolio, but God gave the return on investment” or “I introduced you to the gospel, Apollos taught you more about the gospel, but God enabled you to believe” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])
1CO	3	6	ic6x	figs-ellipsis	ἐγὼ ἐφύτευσα, Ἀπολλῶς ἐπότισεν, ἀλλὰ ὁ Θεὸς ηὔξανεν.	1		Paul never states what it is that he **planted**, that **Apollos watered**, and that **God caused to grow**. He does not state what it is because he wishes to use a general statement about farming practices. If you need to state what is **planted** and **watered**, you could include a general word or words such as “seed,” “plant,” or “crop.” Alternate translation: “I planted the seeds, Apollos watered the plants, but God caused the them to grow” or “I planted the crop, Apollos watered it, but God caused it to grow” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
1CO	3	6	gyi5	translate-names	Ἀπολλῶς	1	Apollos watered	This is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
1CO	3	6	iq9n	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	ἐφύτευσα, Ἀπολλῶς ἐπότισεν, ἀλλὰ ὁ Θεὸς	1	but God gave the growth	Here, Paul uses **but** to contrast himself and **Apollos** with **God**. The point is that what he did and what **Apollos** did are at the same level of importance, but God’s work is the most important. Another way to understand this contrast is to notice that Paul and **Apollos** assist in the process of plants growing, but **God** is the only one who actually makes them grow. Again, the main point is that Paul and **Apollos** are simply “servants” of God ([3:5](../03/05.md)) in a process that God oversees. If **but** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word or phrase that puts Paul and **Apollos** together in contrast with **God**. Alternate translation: “planted, and Apollos watered. However, it was God who” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
1CO	3	7	g78n	grammar-connect-logic-result	ὥστε	1		Paul uses the word translated **so then** to introduce a conclusion or inference from what he said about watering, planting, and growth in [3:6](../03/06.md). Here, he wishes to explain that the difference between **God** who **causes the growth** and anyone who **plants** or **waters** is about their importance in the process. It is **God** who is important, because he is the only one who **causes the growth**, just as he stated in [3:6](../03/06.md). If that meaning of **so then** would be misunderstood in your language, you could a comparable word or phrase that introduces a conclusion or an inference. Alternate translation: “Therefore” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
1CO	3	7	c4wy	figs-exmetaphor	οὔτε ὁ φυτεύων ἐστίν τι, οὔτε ὁ ποτίζων, ἀλλ’ ὁ αὐξάνων, Θεός.	1		Paul now speaks in general about the tasks that God has given to those who proclaim the gospel. He continues to speak as if those who proclaim the gospel were farmers who planted and watered their crops. The **one who plants** is the person who begins the farming process, just like the person who first proclaims the gospel. The **one who waters** is the person who continues the farming process by making sure the plants receive what they need to grow, just like the person who continues to teach the gospel. It is a well-known fact in Paul’s culture that plants grow because God enables them to do so, just like God enables those who believe to receive the gospel and learn more about God. If the way Paul uses farming language to describe how people proclaim the gospel and how God enables others to receive it would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “neither the one who invests the money nor the one who manages the portfolio is anything, but God {is} the one who gives the return on investment” or “neither the person who introduces believers to the gospel nor the person who teaches believers more about the gospel is anything, but God {is} the one who enables believers to have faith” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])
1CO	3	7	dl3z	figs-genericnoun	ὁ φυτεύων…ὁ ποτίζων	1	neither he who plants is anything … but God is the one who causes the growth	When Paul speaks of **the one who plants**, he has himself in mind. When he speaks of **the one who waters**, he has Apollos in mind. This is clear from what he says in the last verse ([3:6](../03/06.md)). However, he is now speaking in more general terms. He does not mean just **one** person who does “planting” and one person who does “watering.” Rather, he wishes to refer to anyone who does either of these tasks. If the phrase **the one who** would not be understood to mean that in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to any person who does the task. Alternate translation: “any person who plants … any person who waters” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])
1CO	3	7	uutk	figs-ellipsis	ὁ φυτεύων…ὁ ποτίζων	1		Paul never states what it is that someone **plants** and that someone else **waters**. He does not state what it is because he wishes to use a general statement about farming practices. If you need to state what is planted and watered, you could include a general word or words such as “seed,” “plant,” or “crop.” Alternate translation: “the one who plants the seeds … the one who waters the plants” or “the one who plants the crop … the one who waters it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
1CO	3	7	jrb1	figs-hyperbole	τι	1		Here, the word translated **anything** is an exaggeration that emphasizes how unimportant the people who plant and water are. It is as if they are nothing, as if they do not exist. Paul does not mean that they do not exist. Instead, he uses this exaggeration to show how unimportant the people who plant and water are compared to God. If the meaning of **anything** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word or phrase that indicates “importance.” Alternate translation: “important” or “significant” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
1CO	3	7	hmk6	figs-ellipsis	ἀλλ’ ὁ αὐξάνων, Θεός.	1		Here, Paul does not directly finish the contrast between the people who plant and water and **God**. What he means is that **God** is the one who is important because he **causes the growth**. If the meaning of this contrast would be misunderstood in your language, you could supply the words that Paul omits, including a word or phrase about how God is “important.” Alternate translation: “but God, who is the one who causes the growth, is the important one” or “but God is the significant one because he causes the growth” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
1CO	3	7	c68g	figs-abstractnouns	αὐξάνων	1	but God is the one who causes the growth	If you cannot use this form in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **growth** with a verb such as “grow.” Alternate translation: “who makes it grow” or “who causes things to grow” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1CO	3	8	dmfs	grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1		Here, the word translated **Now** introduces the next step in Paul’s argument. If the meaning of **Now** would be misunderstood in your language, you could leave it untranslated or use a word or phrase that introduces the next step in an argument. Alternate translation: “Indeed,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
1CO	3	8	s16b	figs-exmetaphor	ὁ φυτεύων…καὶ ὁ ποτίζων, ἕν εἰσιν; ἕκαστος δὲ τὸν ἴδιον μισθὸν λήμψεται, κατὰ τὸν ἴδιον κόπον.	1	he who plants and he who waters are one	Here, Paul continues to speak as if those who proclaim the gospel were farmers who planted and watered their crops. The **one who plants** is the person who begins the farming process, just like the person who first proclaims the gospel. The **one who waters** is the person who continues the farming process by making sure the plants receive what they need to grow, just like the person who continues to teach the gospel. The **one who plants** and the **one who waters** will receive **wages** that match the kind of **labor** they did. In the same way, those who first proclaim the gospel and those who teach more about the gospel will receive rewards from God that match the task they accomplished. If the way Paul uses farming language to describe how people proclaim the gospel and how God rewards those who do so, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “the one who invests the money and the one who manages the portfolio are one, and each will receive his own paycheck according to his own job” or “the person who introduces believers to the gospel and the person who teaches believers more about the gospel are one, and each will receive his own reward from God according to his own task” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])
1CO	3	8	ydx8	figs-genericnoun	ὁ φυτεύων…ὁ ποτίζων	1		Just as in [3:7](../03/07.md), when Paul speaks of **the one who plants**, he has himself in mind. When he speaks of **the one who waters**, he has Apollos in mind. This is clear from what he says in [3:6](../03/06.md). However, he is now speaking in more general terms. He does not mean just **one** person who does “planting” and one person who does “watering.” Rather, he wishes to refer to anyone who does either of these tasks. If the phrase **the one who** would not be understood to mean that in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to any person who does the task. Alternate translation: “any person who plants … any person who waters” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])
1CO	3	8	fsj6	figs-ellipsis	ὁ φυτεύων…ὁ ποτίζων	1		Paul never states what it is that someone **plants** and that someone else **waters**. He does not state what it is because he wishes to use a general statement about farming practices. If you need to state what is planted and watered, you could include a general word or words such as “seed,” “plant,” or “crop.” Alternate translation: “the one who plants the seeds … the one who waters the plants” or “the one who plants the crop … the one who waters it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
1CO	3	8	za43	figs-metaphor	ἕν εἰσιν	1	are one	Paul here speaks as if the **one who plants** and the **one who waters** are the same person. He speaks in this way in order to: (1) show that the **one who plants** and the **one who waters** do the same kind of work with the same goal in mind. Alternate translation: “share a common goal” or “do the same kind of work” (2) state that the **one who plants** and the **one who waters** have equal status. Alternate translation: “are of equal importance” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	3	8	dfhn	figs-gendernotations	τὸν ἴδιον	-1		Here, the words translated **his** are written in masculine form, but they refer to anyone, no matter what their gender might be. If the meaning of **his** would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea by using a word that does not have gender or you could use both genders. Alternate translation: “his or her own … his or her own” or “that person’s own … that person’s own” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
1CO	3	9	vphl	grammar-connect-words-phrases	γάρ	1		Here, the word translated **For** introduces a summary statement that concludes the whole section in which Paul compares those who proclaim the gospel to farmers ([3:5–8](../03/05–08.md)). If this meaning of **For** would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea by using a word or phrase that introduces a summary statement. Alternate translation: “Thus,” or “In the end,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
1CO	3	9	gj26	figs-exclusive	ἐσμεν	1	we are brutally beaten	Here, **we** refers to Paul, Apollos, and others who proclaim the gospel. It does not include the Corinthians. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
1CO	3	9	r9sn	figs-possession	Θεοῦ…συνεργοί	1	God’s fellow workers	Here, Paul uses the possessive form to describe: (1) **fellow workers** who work for **God**. Alternate translation: “coworkers under God’s leadership” (2) **workers** who join **God** in God’s work. Alternate translation: “people who work with God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
1CO	3	9	iaan	figs-infostructure	Θεοῦ γεώργιον, Θεοῦ οἰκοδομή ἐστε.	1		Here, Paul switches from a metaphor about farming to a metaphor about building. He makes this switch without using any connecting words, and he makes the switch within one sentence. Consider whether your language would include the introduction of a new topic at the end of the previous section or at the beginning of a new section, and put **God’s building** where it would be understood as introducing a new section, including **you are** again if it would be necessary. Additionally, if beginning a new section without using a connecting word or phrase would be misunderstood in your language, you could use such a word or phrase here. Alternate translation: “you are God’s field. In fact, you are also God’s building” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
1CO	3	9	lqg1	figs-metaphor	Θεοῦ γεώργιον	1	God’s garden	Here, Paul concludes the farming metaphor he began in [3:6](../03/06.md). He identifies the Corinthians as a **field** that is owned by **God**. It is in this field that those who proclaim the gospel “plant” and “water” the crop. By calling the Corinthians a **God’s field**, Paul means to say that they belong to God and that they are the people among whom those who proclaim the gospel work. If the meaning of this metaphor would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “God’s portfolio” or “people who belong to God and among whom we work” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	3	9	l2fq	figs-exmetaphor	Θεοῦ οἰκοδομή	1	God’s building	Here, Paul introduces a new metaphor that compares the Corinthians to a building. This building belongs to God, and those who proclaim the gospel, including Paul, help to construct the building. He uses this metaphor and variations of it in [3:9–17](../03/09–17.md). Here, he calls the Corinthians **God’s building**, by which he means basically the same thing as when he calls them **God’s field**. They belong to God, and he and others who proclaim the gospel work among them. If the meaning of this metaphor would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “God’s movie” or “people who belong to God and among whom we work” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])
1CO	3	10	iln9	figs-activepassive	τοῦ Θεοῦ τὴν δοθεῖσάν μοι	1	According to the grace of God that was given to me	If you cannot use this form in your language, you could express the idea in active form. Alternate translation: “that God gave me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1CO	3	10	a69q	figs-exmetaphor	ὡς σοφὸς ἀρχιτέκτων θεμέλιον ἔθηκα, ἄλλος δὲ ἐποικοδομεῖ. ἕκαστος δὲ βλεπέτω, πῶς ἐποικοδομεῖ.	1	I laid a foundation	Paul began using the metaphor of a house in [3:9](../03/09.md). Here he continues that metaphor by speaking about himself as a **wise master builder** who lays **a foundation**. By speaking in this way, he means that he is the one who first introduced them to the gospel, just like a **master builder** first lays **a foundation**. He then speaks of people who build **on** that foundation. By speaking in this way, he means that others who proclaim more about the gospel can only do this by using and continuing from the good news that Paul already proclaimed. If this extended metaphor would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “I proposed an idea for a movie as a skilled script writer, and another is filming that movie, but let each person be careful how they film that movie” or “as a wise church planter, I first proclaimed the gospel to you, and another is teaching you more about that gospel, but let each one be careful how he teaches you more” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])
1CO	3	10	nw8f	figs-infostructure	ὡς σοφὸς ἀρχιτέκτων θεμέλιον ἔθηκα	1		The phrase **as a wise master builder** could describe: (1) the way in which Paul **laid a foundation**. If you use the following alternate translation, you may need to add a comma before it. Alternate translation: “I laid a foundation as a wise master builder” (2) the specific **grace** that God gave to Paul. Alternate translation: “to be a wise master builder, I laid a foundation” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
1CO	3	10	mpxl	translate-unknown	σοφὸς ἀρχιτέκτων	1		Here, the word translated **master builder** refers to the person who is in charge of an entire construction project, including designing it and making sure that the building is constructing according to the design. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable word or phrase. Alternate translation: “a wise architect” or “a wise construction manager” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	3	10	mqb8	writing-pronouns	ἄλλος…ἐποικοδομεῖ	1		Here, the word translated **another** refers to anyone who **is building on** the foundation, including Apollos. However, Paul does not mean to identify one specific person who **is building**. If it would be misunderstood that **another** refers to any builder, you could use a word or phrase that identifies any person who does a specific task. Alternate translation: “other people are building on it” or “someone else is building on it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
1CO	3	10	pwi7	figs-imperative	ἕκαστος…βλεπέτω	1	another is building on it	Here, Paul uses a third person imperative. If you have third person imperatives in your language, you could use one here. If you do not have third person imperatives, you could express the idea using a word such as “should.” Alternate translation: “each one should be careful” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
1CO	3	10	px9c	writing-pronouns	ἕκαστος	1	each man	Here, the word translated **each one** refers to any person who **builds** on the **foundation**. If the meaning of **each one** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word or phrase that identifies any person who falls into a certain category. Alternate translation: “every person who builds on it” or “each builder” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
1CO	3	10	krd6	writing-pronouns	ἐποικοδομεῖ	2		Here, the word translated **he** is written in masculine form, but it refers to anyone, no matter what their gender might be. If the meaning of **he** would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea by using a word that does not have gender or you could use both genders. Alternate translation: “he or she builds on it” or “each one builds on it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
1CO	3	11	m4j2	grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1		Here, the word translated **for** introduces the reason why the people who build on the foundation should “be careful how” they build “on it” ([3:10](../03/10.md)). They need to “be careful” because what they build must match the only **foundation** that exists, which is **Jesus Christ**. If **for** would not indicate this connection in your language, you could express the idea with a word that gives a reason or basis for a command. Alternate translation: “This is because” or “because” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
1CO	3	11	qd1o	figs-exmetaphor	θεμέλιον…ἄλλον οὐδεὶς δύναται θεῖναι, παρὰ τὸν κείμενον, ὅς ἐστιν Ἰησοῦς Χριστός.	1		In this verse, Paul continues the metaphor about houses by continuing to speak about a **foundation**. Here, he reminds the Corinthians that each house has only one **foundation**, and once that **foundation** has been **laid**, no one lays another **foundation** for the house. He speaks in this way to remind them that only one person can introduce them to the gospel, and anyone who tries to introduce them to another gospel is building a different house, not the same house. Paul then directly states that the **foundation** refers to the message about **Jesus Christ** that he preached to them. Paul speaks in this way to indicate that the message about **Jesus Christ** that he proclaimed to them should be the starting point and basis for everything else they learn about the gospel. If the meaning of this metaphor would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “no one can write a script other than the one that has already been written, that is, Jesus Christ” or “no one can first proclaim a gospel to you other than the one that I already proclaimed to you, which is Jesus Christ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])
1CO	3	11	jt2b	figs-activepassive	τὸν κείμενον	1	no one can lay a foundation other than the one that has been laid	If you cannot use this form in your language, you could express the idea in active form, with Paul as the person who is doing the “laying.” Alternate translation: “the one that I already laid” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1CO	3	11	yh1f		ὅς ἐστιν Ἰησοῦς Χριστός.	1		If you use the second alternate translation, you may need to add period before it. Alternate translation: “which is Jesus Christ” or “That foundation is Jesus Christ”
1CO	3	11	azm0	figs-metonymy	Ἰησοῦς Χριστός	1		Here, Paul uses the words translated **Jesus Christ** to refer to the message he proclaimed to them about **Jesus Christ**. If the meaning of **Jesus Christ** would be misunderstood in your language, you could include a word or phrase that refers to Paul’s message about **Jesus Christ**. Alternate translation: “the good news about Jesus Christ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1CO	3	12	nuza	grammar-connect-words-phrases	δέ	1		Here, the word translated **Now** introduces the next step in Paul’s argument. If the meaning of **Now** would be misunderstood in your language, you could leave it untranslated or use a word or phrase that introduces the next step in an argument. Alternate translation: “Indeed,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
1CO	3	12	nbu2	figs-exmetaphor	εἰ…τις ἐποικοδομεῖ ἐπὶ τὸν θεμέλιον χρυσόν, ἄργυρον, λίθους τιμίους, ξύλα, χόρτον, καλάμην	1	Now if anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, or straw	Here, Paul continues the metaphor about building a house. He compares those who teach more about the gospel with builders who construct a house on its foundation. These builders can use a variety of different materials to construct the house, and Paul lists six. The first three, **gold, silver, precious stones**, are more durable, while the last three, **wood, hay, straw**, are less durable. It is clear that Paul is interested in durability because of the next verse, where he states that all of these materials will be tested with fire ([3:13](../03/13.md)). By speaking this way, he indicates that those who proclaim more about the gospel can teach things that are more or less true and acceptable to God. If this metaphor would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “if anyone films the movie with expensive and sturdy cameras and film or with cheap and fragile cameras and film” or “if anyone teaches you more about the gospel with words that are acceptable to God or words that are not acceptable to God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])
1CO	3	12	f8oa	grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἰ…τις ἐποικοδομεῖ ἐπὶ τὸν θεμέλιον	1		Here, Paul uses a conditional **if**, but he does not think that this is a hypothetical situation or something that is likely not true. Instead, Paul thinks that people are “building” on the foundation, and he wants to talk about how they are doing so. Additionally, the “then” part of the **if** statement does not begin until the next verse. If this form and structure would be misunderstood in your language, you could rephrase the condition into a circumstance or an assumption. Alternate translation: “people build on the foundation, using” or “when anyone builds on the foundation” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
1CO	3	12	tzgf	translate-unknown	χρυσόν, ἄργυρον, λίθους τιμίους, ξύλα, χόρτον, καλάμην,	1		These six things are all materials that could be used in constructing buildings. The first three will survive if the building catches on fire, but the last three will not (for the fire, see [3:13–15](../03/13–15.md)). In your culture, you may not use all of these materials for constructing buildings. In that case, you could include just some of these materials or include materials that you do use for constructing buildings in your culture, making sure to include some materials will not burn up and others that will burn up.

The fire will test the quality of what each one had done	Here, Paul continues the metaphor about building a house. He speaks as if **the day** of God’s judgment is like a fire that **will test** the building and show what kind of building materials the builders used. Paul speaks in this way to illustrate how God’s judgment will reveal whether what those who proclaim more about the gospel teach is pleasing to him or not. If this metaphor would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “the work of each one will become evident, for opening night will display it; for opening night always draws critics, and the critics will test of what value is the work of each one” or “the truth of what each one has taught you will become evident, for God will show how true it is when he comes to judge everyone; when he comes, he will judge everyone, and his judgment will reveal whether what each person has taught is true or not” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])
1CO	3	13	wv4h	figs-synecdoche	ἑκάστου τὸ ἔργον	1		Here, Paul uses the word translated **work** to refer to the product or result of the **work**, not the action of “working.” If that meaning for **work** would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea with a word or phrase that refers to the product of the **work**. Alternate translation: “what each one has made” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
1CO	3	13	t2mk	figs-activepassive	ἑκάστου τὸ ἔργον φανερὸν γενήσεται	1	his work will be revealed	If your language does not use this form, you could express the idea using words such as “God will reveal.” Alternate translation: “God will reveal the work of each one” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1CO	3	13	mv14	figs-explicit	ἡ…ἡμέρα δηλώσει	1	for the daylight will reveal it	Here, Paul uses the word translated **day** in the same way the Old Testament uses it: to refer to an event in which God saves his people and punishes his enemies. Paul specifically refers to the event in which Jesus returns to judge everyone. If that meaning of **day** would be misunderstood in your language, you could include more words that clarify what Paul means by **day**. Alternate translation: “the day of Christ’s return will display” or “when Christ returns, he will display it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	3	13	lyny	figs-activepassive	ἐν πυρὶ ἀποκαλύπτεται	1		If your language does not use this form, you could express the idea in active form, with God as the subject. Alternate translation: “God reveals it in fire” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1CO	3	13	x48s	writing-pronouns	ἀποκαλύπτεται	1		Here, **it** refers to **the day**. It does not refer to the **work**. If the meaning of **it** would be misunderstood in your language, you clarify that **it** refers to **the day**. Alternate translation: “that day is revealed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
1CO	3	13	ozx6		ἀποκαλύπτεται	1		Here, Paul speaks as if the day **is revealed** right now. In his language, he can use the present tense to speak about the way in which something happens in general, even if it is not happening in the present moment. If this use of the present tense would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea by using the future tense. Alternate translation: “it will be revealed”

He means that a person’s **work** might remain, or it might not. He then specifies the result for each possibility. If this form would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the **if** statement by using a relative clause. Alternate translation: “Anyone whose work that he built will remain will receive a reward” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical]])
1CO	3	14	ygva	figs-exmetaphor	εἴ τινος τὸ ἔργον μενεῖ, ὃ ἐποικοδόμησεν, μισθὸν λήμψεται.	1		Here, Paul continues the metaphor about building a house. In this verse, he notes that builders whose structures survive a fire receive rewards. He speaks in this way to indicate that God will reward those who proclaim more about the gospel if God finds their teachings to be accurate and acceptable to him when he judges everyone. The **reward** includes public recognition and other blessings. If this metaphor would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “If anyone’s film that he created receives good reviews on opening night, he will receive an award” or “If anyone teaches you more about the gospel with words that are acceptable to God, he will be honored by God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])
1CO	3	14	iddt	figs-explicitinfo	τινος τὸ ἔργον…ὃ ἐποικοδόμησεν	1		Here, Paul speaks both of **work** and what **he built**. If using both of these terms would be misunderstood or redundant in your language, you could combine the ideas into one expression.

1CO	3	14	s4u3	figs-synecdoche	τὸ ἔργον	1	work remains	Here, Paul uses the word translated **work** to refer to the product or result of the **work**, not the action of “working.” If that meaning for **work** would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea with a word or phrase that refers to the product of the **work**. Alternate translation: “project” or “house” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

He means that a person’s work might remain, or it might not. He then specifies the result for each possibility. If this form would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the **if** statement by using a relative clause. Alternate translation: “Anyone whose work will be burned up will suffer loss” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical]])
1CO	3	15	ysjz	figs-exmetaphor	εἴ τινος τὸ ἔργον κατακαήσεται, ζημιωθήσεται; αὐτὸς δὲ σωθήσεται, οὕτως δὲ ὡς διὰ πυρός.	1		Here, Paul continues the metaphor about building a house. In this verse, he notes that builders whose structures do not survive a fire **suffer loss**. The builders themselves do not die, but they are in trouble, almost as if they were in the building and barely escaped as it burned to the ground. Paul speaks in this way to indicate that God will not reward those who proclaim more about the gospel if God finds their teachings to be inaccurate and unacceptable to him when he judges everyone. The **loss** includes lack of honor and rewards from God. However, those who proclaim more about God in inaccurate and unacceptable ways are not condemned to punishment by God. Instead, just like someone escaping from a burning building, they are just barely accepted by God. If this metaphor would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “If anyone’s film that he created receives bad reviews on opening night, he will lose money on the film, but he himself will not face financial ruin, but as though through bankruptcy” or “If anyone teaches you more about the gospel with words that are not acceptable to God, he will receive no honor or blessing when God judges everyone, but he himself will be accepted by God, although just barely” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])

Alternate translation: “anyone’s … he or she will suffer loss … he himself or she herself will be saved” or “people’s … they will suffer loss … they themselves will be saved” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
1CO	3	15	ups4	translate-unknown	ζημιωθήσεται	1	he will suffer loss	The phrase **he will suffer loss** expresses the opposite of “receiving a reward.” Instead of gaining honor and money, the person loses honor and money. If the phrase **he will suffer loss** would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea by using a phrase that refers to losing honor and money. Alternate translation: “he will lose honor and money” or “he will be deprived of any reward” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	3	15	w1zv	figs-activepassive	αὐτὸς δὲ σωθήσεται	1	but he himself will be saved	If your language does not use this form, you could express the idea in active form, with **he** saving **himself** or **he** not perishing.

1CO	3	16	uq2g	figs-rquestion	οὐκ οἴδατε ὅτι ναὸς Θεοῦ ἐστε, καὶ τὸ Πνεῦμα τοῦ Θεοῦ οἰκεῖ ἐν ὑμῖν?	1	Do you not know that you are God’s temple and that the Spirit of God lives in you?	Paul does not ask this question because he is looking for information or for agreement or disagreement. Rather, he asks it to involve the Corinthians in what he is arguing by reminding them of something that they should already know. The question assumes that the answer is “yes.” If this question would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea with an emphatic statement. Alternate translation: “you know that you are a temple of God, and you know that the Spirit of God lives in you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
1CO	3	16	yc1g	figs-exmetaphor	οὐκ οἴδατε ὅτι ναὸς Θεοῦ ἐστε, καὶ τὸ Πνεῦμα τοῦ Θεοῦ οἰκεῖ ἐν ὑμῖν?	1		Here, Paul develops the metaphor about constructing a building in a new way. First, he says that the Corinthians together are **a temple of God**, which is a specific type of building. The **temple of God** was the place where God was present in a special way. Paul is thus identifying the Corinthians as people among whom God is present in the same kind of special way. Second, he says that the Corinthians together are the house or city in which the **Spirit of God lives**. The house or city in which someone lives is where they are always present. Paul is thus saying that the Holy Spirit is always present with the Corinthians. If the meaning of Paul’s metaphors would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea in non-figurative language. Alternate translation: “Do you not know that you are the sacred shrine where God dwells, and you are the country in which the Spirit of God has residency?” or “Do you not know that God is present among you, and the Spirit of God is always with you?” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])

He notes that, because God’s temple is **holy**, God will **destroy** anyone who **destroys** the temple. He then again repeats that the Corinthians **are** the temple. By speaking in this way, Paul wishes to remind everyone among the Corinthian believers that “destroying” the unity of the believers is like “destroying” the **temple**, and God will act in response to this like he would if someone “destroyed” his **temple**. If this metaphor would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “If anyone desecrates God’s sacred shrine, God will punish that person. For the sacred shrine is holy, and you are God’s sacred shrine” or “If anyone divides the place of God’s presence, God will punish that person. For wherever God’s presence can be found is holy, and you are the place where God’s presence can be found” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])
1CO	3	17	pv8w	grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical	εἴ τις τὸν ναὸν τοῦ Θεοῦ φθείρει, φθερεῖ τοῦτον ὁ Θεός	1		Here, Paul uses **if** to introduce a true possibility. He means that a person might destroy God’s temple, or that person might not. He then specifies the result for if someone does destroy God’s temple. If this form would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the **if** statement by using a relative clause. Alternate translation: “God will destroy anyone who destroys the temple of God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical]])
1CO	3	17	vcuv	writing-pronouns	οἵτινές ἐστε ὑμεῖς	1		Here, the word translated **which** could refer to: (1) **the temple of God**. Alternate translation: “which temple you are” (2) **holy**. Alternate translation: “and you too are holy” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
1CO	3	18	glg8	figs-imperative	μηδεὶς ἑαυτὸν ἐξαπατάτω…μωρὸς γενέσθω	1	Let no one deceive himself	In this verse, Paul uses two third person imperative. If you have third person imperatives in your language, you could use them here. If you do not have third person imperatives, you could express the ideas using a word such as “should.” Alternate translation: “No one should deceive himself … he should become a ‘fool’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
1CO	3	18	s57s	figs-gendernotations	μηδεὶς ἑαυτὸν ἐξαπατάτω; εἴ τις δοκεῖ σοφὸς εἶναι ἐν ὑμῖν ἐν τῷ αἰῶνι τούτῳ, μωρὸς γενέσθω, ἵνα γένηται σοφός.	1		Here, the words translated **himself**, **he**, and **him** are written in masculine form, but they refer to anyone, no matter what their gender might be. If the meaning of **himself**, **he**, and **him** would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea by using words that do not have gender or you could use both genders. Alternate translation: “Let no one deceive himself or herself. If anyone among you thinks he or she is wise in this age, let him or her become a ‘fool,’ that he or she may become wise” or “Let no people deceive themselves. If any people among you think they are wise in this age, them become ‘fools,’ that they may become wise” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])

He means that a person might think that **he is wise**, or that person might not think this. He then specifies the result for if someone does think that **he is wise**. If this form would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the **if** statement by using a relative clause. Alternate translation: “Let whoever among you thinks he is wise in this age become a ‘fool’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical]])
1CO	3	18	p53y		ἐν τῷ αἰῶνι τούτῳ	1		Alternate translation: “according to the standards of this age”
1CO	3	18	s7xi	figs-irony	μωρὸς γενέσθω, ἵνα γένηται σοφός	1	let him become a “fool”	Here, Paul commands any **wise** person among the Corinthians to become a **fool**. He does not actually think that doing what he commands makes a person a **fool**, which is why **fool** appears in quotation marks. Rather, he knows that many will call doing what he commands becoming a **fool**. To make this clearer, he then says that becoming what many will call **a “fool”** will actually lead to becoming truly **wise**. If Paul’s use of the word **fool** would be misunderstood by your readers, you could use a form in your language that indicates that Paul is speaking from the perspective of other people. Alternate translation: “let him become a so-called ‘fool,’ that he may become truly wise” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])
1CO	3	18	pvt3	grammar-connect-logic-goal	ἵνα	1		Here, the word translated **that** introduces the goal or purpose for which a person should **become a “fool”**. If the meaning of **that** would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea with a word or phrase that introduces a goal or purpose. Alternate translation: “in order that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
1CO	3	19	m0gd	figs-possession	ἡ…σοφία τοῦ κόσμου τούτου	1		Here, Paul uses the possessive form to describe what **this world** considers to be **wisdom**. If **the wisdom of this world** would be not be understood in your language as **wisdom** from the perspective of **this world**, you could use a different form that makes this meaning clear. Alternate translation: “what this world considers to be wisdom” or “worldly wisdom” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
1CO	3	19	uqb3	figs-idiom	παρὰ τῷ Θεῷ	1		Here, Paul uses the phrase **with God** to identify God’s perspective. If **with God** would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea with a word or phrase that identifies that this is **foolishness** according to how God views the world. Alternate translation: “from God’s perspective” or “in God’s eyes” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1CO	3	19	ayvv	writing-quotations	γέγραπται γάρ	1		In Paul’s culture, **For it is written** is a normal way to introduce a quotation from an important text, in this case, the Old Testament book titled “Job.” If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable phrase that indicates that Paul is quoting from an important text. Alternate translation: “For it can be read in the Old Testament” or “For the book of Job says” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
1CO	3	19	zws3	figs-quotations	γέγραπται…ὁ δρασσόμενος τοὺς σοφοὺς ἐν τῇ πανουργίᾳ αὐτῶν	1	He catches the wise in their craftiness	If you cannot use this form in your language, you could translate these statements as indirect quotes instead of as direct quotes.

1CO	3	19	wxz2	figs-metaphor	δρασσόμενος τοὺς σοφοὺς ἐν τῇ πανουργίᾳ αὐτῶν	1		Here, Paul speaks as if God reaches out and grabs **the wise** as they act in **craftiness**. By speaking in this way, he means that even “crafty” or clever people cannot avoid God when he wishes to “catch” them. God is not deceived, and he can disrupt their clever plans. If **catches** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “interrupts the clever plans of the wise” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	3	19	j0ga	figs-nominaladj	τοὺς σοφοὺς	1		Paul is using the adjective **wise** as a noun in order to describe a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this adjective with a noun phrase. Alternate translation: “wise people” or “those who are wise” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
1CO	3	19	x6ts	figs-abstractnouns	τῇ πανουργίᾳ	1		If you cannot use this form in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **craftiness** by using a phrase such as “crafty plans” or “clever planning.” Alternate translation: “crafty plans” or “clever planning” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1CO	3	20	n5pu	writing-quotations	καὶ πάλιν	1		In Paul’s culture, **And again** is a normal way to introduce another quotation from an important text that supports the same point. In this case, Paul quotes from the Old Testament book titled “Psalms.” If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable phrase that indicates that Paul is introducing another quotation from an important text. Alternate translation: “It can be read in another place in the Old Testament” or “And the book of Psalms also says” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
1CO	3	20	la6x	figs-quotations	Κύριος γινώσκει τοὺς διαλογισμοὺς τῶν σοφῶν, ὅτι εἰσὶν μάταιοι	1	The Lord knows that the reasoning of the wise is futile	If you cannot use this form in your language, you could translate these statements as indirect quotes instead of as direct quotes. Alternate translation: “that the Lord knows the reasonings of the wise, that they are futile” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
1CO	3	20	gvyq	figs-explicitinfo	γινώσκει τοὺς διαλογισμοὺς τῶν σοφῶν, ὅτι εἰσὶν μάταιοι	1		If the form **the reasonings of the wise, that they** would be redundant in your language, you could express the idea without the redundant words. Alternate translation: “knows that the reasonings of the wise are futile” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo]])
1CO	3	20	ot38	figs-abstractnouns	τοὺς διαλογισμοὺς τῶν σοφῶν	1		If your language does not use this form, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **reasonings** with a verb such as “reason” or “plan.” Alternate translation: “the things that the wise reason” or “the things that the wise plan” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1CO	3	20	tlk9	figs-nominaladj	τῶν σοφῶν	1		Paul is using the adjective **wise** as a noun in order to describe a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this adjective with a noun phrase. Alternate translation: “of wise people” or “of those who are wise” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
1CO	3	20	kz2u		εἰσὶν μάταιοι	1	futile	Alternate translation: “they will come to nothing” or “they are worthless”
1CO	3	21	molu	figs-imperative	μηδεὶς καυχάσθω ἐν ἀνθρώποις	1		Here, Paul uses a third person imperative. If you have third person imperatives in your language, you could use one here. If you do not have third person imperatives, you could express the idea using a word such as “should.” Alternate translation: “no one should boast in men” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
1CO	3	21	xyti	figs-idiom	μηδεὶς καυχάσθω ἐν ἀνθρώποις	1		The phrase **boast in men** means that a person is boasting “about” humans. If **boast in** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word or phrase that clarifies that the “boasting” has **men** as its content. Alternate translation: “let no one boast about men” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1CO	3	21	k9i3	figs-explicit	ἐν ἀνθρώποις	1		The next verse makes it clear that here Paul specifically has leaders in mind. He wishes to tell the Corinthians that they should not boast about having a specific leader that they follow. If this meaning of **in men** would not be understood in your language, you could include some words that clarify that it refers to following leaders. Alternate translation: “in men that they follow” or “in men whose group they are part of” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	3	21	ogfq	figs-gendernotations	ἀνθρώποις	1		Although the word translated men is masculine, Paul is using it to refer to anyone, whether man or woman. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a non-gendered word or refer to both genders. Alternate translation: “in people” or “in men or women” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
1CO	3	21	g0hr	figs-explicit	πάντα…ὑμῶν ἐστιν	1		Here, **all things are yours** also implies that **boasting in men** is foolish. If the Corinthians have everything, then boasting about following a specific leader does not make sense. All the Corinthians have all the leaders, and much more beyond that (see [3:22](../03/22.md)). If it would be misunderstood in your language that **all things are yours** implies these conclusions, you could include a phrase that states these conclusions. Alternate translation: “all things are yours, including all leaders” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	3	22	lrlg	translate-names	Παῦλος…Ἀπολλῶς…Κηφᾶς	1		These are the names of three men. They are the same men who were mentioned in [1:12](../01/12.md) as leaders whom the Corinthians were claiming to follow. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
1CO	3	22	x1w6		εἴτε Παῦλος, εἴτε Ἀπολλῶς, εἴτε Κηφᾶς, εἴτε κόσμος, εἴτε ζωὴ, εἴτε θάνατος, εἴτε ἐνεστῶτα, εἴτε μέλλοντα;	1		Paul does not want his readers to think that this list tells the Corinthians everything that they have. Rather, he uses the list to give examples. If the use of this list would be misunderstood in your language, you could include a word or phrase that shows that the list gives examples. Alternate translation: “including Paul and Apollos and Cephas and the world and life and death and things present and things to come”
1CO	3	22	o3k5	figs-explicit	εἴτε ζωὴ, εἴτε θάνατος	1		When Paul says that **life** and **death** are theirs, he means that neither **life** nor **death** has control over the Corinthians. Rather, they have control over **life** and **death**. What this means is that they can live their lives without being afraid of what will happen while they are alive or afraid of losing their lives when they die. If the meaning of the **life** and **death** would be misunderstood in your language, you could add some words that clarify their meaning. Alternate translation: “or confidence in life or peace in death” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	3	22	pyir	figs-explicit	εἴτε ἐνεστῶτα, εἴτε μέλλοντα	1		Here, Paul refers to **things present** because it refers to what was happening at the time when Paul wrote this letter. On the other hand, **things to come** refers to what is going to happen in the future, specifically when Jesus comes back. The **things present** is the way the world works right now. The **things to come** is the way the world will work when Jesus returns. If the meaning of these phrases would be misunderstood in your language, you could add some words that clarify their meaning. Alternate translation: “or the current order or the order that Jesus will bring” or “or what happens now or what will happen soon” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	3	22	jt0x	figs-infostructure	πάντα ὑμῶν	1		Here, Paul uses the same phrase he used at the end of [3:21](../03/21.md): **all things are yours**. He repeats the phrase here to explain that the list provides examples of **all things** and also to introduce the point he is about to make in the next verse. Because **all things are yours** ends the list and also introduces the next idea, the ULT begins a new sentence with **all things are yours**. Use whatever form in your language most clearly identifies a conclusion that also introduces the next statement. Alternate translation: “Thus, all things are yours,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
1CO	3	23	nj48	figs-possession	ὑμεῖς…Χριστοῦ	1	you are Christ’s, and Christ is God’s	Here, Paul uses the possessive form to show the Corinthians that they belong to Christ. If the meaning of this form would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea by using a phrase such as “belong to” or a verb such as “has.” Alternate translation: “you belong to Christ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
1CO	3	23	dc6v	figs-possession	Χριστὸς…Θεοῦ	1		Here, Paul uses the possessive form to show the Corinthians that **Christ** belongs to who **God** is. If this form would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea by using a phrase such as “belongs to” or a verb such as “includes.” Alternate translation: “Christ belongs to God” or “who God is includes Christ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
1CO	4	intro	vg5z			0		# 1 Corinthians 4 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and Formatting<br><br>1. Against divisions (1:10–4:15)<br>    * God alone is judge (4:1–5)<br>    * Present weakness (4:6–15)<br>2. Against sexual immorality (4:16–6:20)<br>    * Paul’s planned visit (4:16–21)<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Judgment<br><br>In [4:3–5](../04/03.md), Paul refers to three different judgments. The first judgment is what humans think of each other, including what they think of Paul. The second is Paul’s own judgment of himself. The third is God’s judgment, which occurs when the Lord returns. Paul argues that the first two judgments are not important and carry no weight. Rather, the only judgment that matters is God’s judgment. Therefore, Paul argues that no one should issue a final verdict about anything until God has performed his judgment ([4:5](../04/05.md)). (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/discernment]])<br><br>### Pride<br><br>Paul mentions the Corinthians’ pride many times in this chapter. He speaks specifically of being “puffed up” ([4:6](../04/06.md); [4:18–19](../04/18.md)), and boasting ([4:7](../04/07.md)). In contrast, Paul describes himself and the other apostles as humble and weak ([4:9–13](../04/09.md)). By making this contrast, Paul wants the Corinthians to rethink their opinions about themselves. If the apostles, the leaders of the church, are weak and humble, they need to think again about whether they really are as great as they think they are.<br><br>### Word and power<br><br>In [4:19–20](../04/19.md), Paul contrasts “word” with “power.” This is common comparison in his culture that contrasts talk and deeds. Anyone can say they are capable of doing something, but only those with “power” can actually do what they claim. Paul introduces this contrast because he is coming to see if those who claim greatness (“word”) can do what they claim (“power”). He argues that “power” is what matters more than “word” because God’s kingdom is a matter of “power,” not “word.” It is about action, not just talk. If your language has a standard comparison between “talk” and “deeds,” you could use it in these verses.<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Paul as father<br><br>In [4:14–15](../04/14.md), Paul identifies the Corinthians as his children, which makes him their father. He became their father when he preached the gospel to them. Thus, he is their spiritual father, the one who helped bring them into the Christian life. In the metaphor, Paul does not specify who the mother is, and he does not intend his audience to make an inference as to who it might be. In [4:17](../04/17.md), Paul continues this metaphor by claiming Timothy as his spiritual child. If possible, use words in your language that do not always require biological relationships. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/father]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/children]])<br><br>### The spectacle<br><br>In [4:9](../04/09.md), Paul speaks of the “spectacle” that he and the other apostles participate in. The “spectacle” could be a victory parade in which Paul and the other apostles are prisoners who will be killed, or it could be a gladiatorial performance in an arena in which Paul and the other apostles are destined to die. See the notes on the verse for translation options. Whichever “spectacle” Paul refers to, he is presenting himself and the other apostles as people who are going to be humiliated and killed in public. With this metaphor he continues the theme of Christ working in power through his and others’ weakness. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])<br><br>### Irony<br><br>In [4:8](../04/08.md), Paul says that the Corinthians are satisfied, rich, and reigning. In the second half of the verse, however, he says that he “wishes” that they were actually reigning. The first part of the verse, then, presents how the Corinthians think about themselves. Paul speaks from their perspective in order to show them that their views are foolish and impossible. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])<br><br>### Rhetorical questions<br><br>In [4:7](../04/07.md) and [4:21](../04/21.md), Paul uses several questions. All the questions in these two verses are not seeking answers that provide information or further knowledge. Rather, all the questions are meant to make the Corinthians think about what they are thinking and doing. For translation options, see the notes on these two verses. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### “Not beyond what is written”<br><br>In [4:6](../04/06.md), Paul quotes a phrase: “Not beyond what is written.” This is not a quote from Scripture, and Paul does not say where the phrase comes from. However, the way he quotes it shows that both he and the Corinthians were familiar with this saying. Most likely, the phrase is a well-known proverb or wise saying that Paul uses to strengthen his argument. For the meaning of the phrase and translation options, see the notes on that verse.<br><br>### Paul’s coming<br><br>In [4:18–21](../04/18.md), Paul speaks many times about how he will “come” to them. He intends to visit them again, and he speaks in these verses about what his visit might be like. Use words in your language that refer to someone temporarily visiting someone else.
1CO	4	1	nkda	figs-explicitinfo	οὕτως ἡμᾶς λογιζέσθω ἄνθρωπος ὡς	1		If the form **In this manner let a man regard us: as** would be redundant in your language, you could express the idea without the redundant words. Alternate translation: “Let a man regard us as” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo]])
1CO	4	1	k1v5	figs-imperative	ἡμᾶς λογιζέσθω ἄνθρωπος	1	Connecting Statement:	Here, Paul uses a third person imperative. If you have third person imperatives in your language, you could use one here. If you do not have third person imperatives, you could express the idea using a word such as “should.” Alternate translation: “a man should regard us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
1CO	4	1	xt4u	figs-gendernotations	ἄνθρωπος	1		Although the word translated **man** is masculine, Paul is using it to refer to anyone, whether man or woman. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a non-gendered word or refer to both genders. Alternate translation: “man or woman” or “human” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
1CO	4	1	fk8c	figs-genericnoun	ἄνθρωπος	1		Paul uses the word **man** to speak of people in general, not one specific person. If the meaning of **man** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a form that indicates people in general in your language. Alternate translation: “everybody” or “any person” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])
1CO	4	1	px42	figs-exclusive	ἡμᾶς	1		Here, **us** refers to Paul, Apollos, and others who proclaim the gospel. It does not include the Corinthians. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
1CO	4	1	if6t	figs-possession	οἰκονόμους μυστηρίων Θεοῦ	1		Here, Paul uses the possessive form to describe **stewards** who are in charge of **the mysteries of God**. If this form would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “manage” or “oversee.” Alternate translation: “stewards who manage the mysteries of God” or “stewards who oversee the mysteries of God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
1CO	4	1	duab	figs-possession	μυστηρίων Θεοῦ	1		Here, Paul uses the possessive form to describe **mysteries** that are: (1) revealed by **God**.

1CO	4	2	th8e	grammar-connect-words-phrases	ὧδε λοιπὸν	1	what is required of stewards	Here, Paul uses the phrase **In this case** to introduce further information about what it means to be **stewards**. Since he is talking about himself and others who proclaim the gospel as **stewards**, it is important to understand what it is that **stewards** are **required** to do. If this connection would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces more information about a topic. Alternate translation: “Now” or “Speaking of stewards,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
1CO	4	2	de61	figs-explicit	ζητεῖται ἐν τοῖς οἰκονόμοις, ἵνα πιστός τις εὑρεθῇ	1		While Paul does not directly apply this sentence to himself and others who proclaim the gospel, it is clear that he intends the reader to apply it to him and these others. Paul then means that he and others who proclaim the gospel are required to do so faithfully by God. If this implication would not be understood by your readers, you could a word or phrase that makes it clear by identifying Paul as one of the stewards. Alternate translation: “it is required in stewards like us that we be found faithful” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	4	2	qek0	figs-activepassive	ζητεῖται	1		If your language does not use this form, you could express the idea in active form, with a vague subject or “masters” as the subject. Alternate translation: “people require” or “a master requires” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1CO	4	2	dpeo	figs-activepassive	πιστός τις εὑρεθῇ	1		If your language does not use this form, you could express the idea in active form, with a vague subject or “masters” as the subject.

1CO	4	2	yesr	writing-pronouns	τις	1		Here, Paul uses **one** to refer to any of the **stewards**.

1CO	4	3	t133		ἐμοὶ…ἐστιν	1		Alternate translation: “I consider it” or “from my perspective”
1CO	4	3	fspp	figs-idiom	εἰς ἐλάχιστόν ἐστιν	1		When Paul says that **it is a very small thing** for him to **be examined**, what he means is that their “examination” of him is unimportant to him. Whether they think he has been faithful or not does not matter to him at all. If the meaning of this phrase would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable idiom or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “it is no big deal” or “it has no significance” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1CO	4	3	k6nc	figs-activepassive	ὑφ’ ὑμῶν ἀνακριθῶ, ἢ ὑπὸ ἀνθρωπίνης ἡμέρας;	1	it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you	If your language does not use this form, you could express the idea in active form. Alternate translation: “you or a human court would examine me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1CO	4	3	l2tt	translate-unknown	ἀνθρωπίνης ἡμέρας	1		Here, the words translated **a human court** refer to an official legal proceeding where whether Paul was faithful or not could be judged by those in charge. Here, he uses the words primarily to refer to any people who are in charge of this legal proceeding. If this language would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to an official meeting to decide whether someone is innocent or guilty or a word or phrase that refers to who is in charge at such a meeting. Alternate translation: “a court of law” or “a human jury” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	4	3	skwh	grammar-connect-words-phrases	ἀλλ’	1		Here, the word translated **For** introduces an even stronger statement about how little Paul cares about being **examined** by humans. He cares so little that he does not even **examine** himself. If this connection would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word or phrase that normally introduces a further, stronger statement. Alternate translation: “Indeed,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
1CO	4	4	u9jd	figs-idiom	οὐδὲν…ἐμαυτῷ σύνοιδα	1	I am not aware of any charge being made against me	Paul says that he is **aware of nothing against** himself. By this, he means that he does not know about anything that could be used to accuse him. He is not aware of anything he has done wrong. If the meaning of this phrase would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable idiom or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “I have a clear conscience” or “I cannot think of any wrong things I have done” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1CO	4	4	h3wl	figs-activepassive	οὐκ ἐν τούτῳ δεδικαίωμαι;	1	that does not mean I am innocent.

Alternate translation: “what I am aware of” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
1CO	4	4	hjob	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	δὲ	1		Paul uses the word translated **but** to introduce a contrast with everyone else who might “examine” Paul (see [4:3–4](../04/03.md)). If this connection would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a contrast with several previous statements. Alternate translation: “Instead,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
1CO	4	4	f6bb		ὁ…ἀνακρίνων με Κύριός ἐστιν.	1		Alternate translation: “the Lord is the one who judges me”
1CO	4	5	qi3g	figs-explicitinfo	πρὸ καιροῦ…ἕως ἂν ἔλθῃ ὁ Κύριος	1	Therefore	If the form **before the time, until the Lord comes** contains redundant information that would be unnatural to state in your language, you could express the idea without the redundant words.

1CO	4	5	wl3i	figs-metaphor	ὃς καὶ φωτίσει τὰ κρυπτὰ τοῦ σκότους	1	He will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and reveal the purposes of the heart	Here, Paul speaks as if **the Lord** will bring a flashlight or torch when he comes, and he will use that torch or flashlight to shine **light** on things that are currently **hidden** in the **darkness**. By speaking in this way, Paul means that **the Lord** will reveal what no person knows right now. If the meaning of this phrase would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “who will both disclose what people do not know about” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	4	5	dcje	figs-possession	τὰ κρυπτὰ τοῦ σκότους	1		Here, Paul uses the possessive form to describe **things** that are **hidden** in **darkness**. If the **hidden things** would not be understood to be in **darkness** in your language, you could express the idea by using a word such “in” or “within.” Alternate translation: “the things hidden in darkness” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
1CO	4	5	ywuk	figs-abstractnouns	τὰ κρυπτὰ τοῦ σκότους	1		If your language does not use the abstract noun **darkness**, you could express the idea by using a word or phrase that describes something that cannot be seen because there is no light, such as “in shadow.” Alternate translation: “the hidden things in shadow” or “the things hidden where no light shines” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1CO	4	5	spwh	figs-possession	τὰς βουλὰς τῶν καρδιῶν	1		Here, Paul uses the possessive form to describe **purposes** that come from or are created in **the hearts**.

1CO	4	5	tgdg	translate-unknown	τὰς βουλὰς	1		Here, **purposes** refers to how humans have specific goals in mind and plan ways of attaining those goals.

1CO	4	5	tgox	figs-metonymy	τῶν καρδιῶν	1		In Paul’s culture, **hearts** are the places where humans think and plan. If that meaning of **hearts** would be misunderstood in your language, you could refer to the place where humans think in your culture or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “of the minds” or “that humans plan” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1CO	4	5	pw6r	figs-idiom	ὁ ἔπαινος γενήσεται ἑκάστῳ ἀπὸ τοῦ Θεοῦ	1		Here, Paul speaks as if **praise** were something that could **come** or travel from **God** to humans. Paul means that **God** is the source of the **praise** that **each one** will receive. If the meaning of this sentence would be misunderstood in your language, you could make **God** the person who gives the **praise**. Alternate translation: “God will give praise to each one” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1CO	4	5	kcya	figs-explicit	ὁ ἔπαινος γενήσεται ἑκάστῳ ἀπὸ τοῦ Θεοῦ	1		Here, Paul seems to say that every person will receive some **praise** from **God**. However, Paul does not mean this. Instead, he only gives the example of the person who has been faithful to God, not the example of the person who has not been faithful to God. If using only one example would be misunderstood in your language, you could clarify that this example is only about those who are faithful, or you could include the opposite example about those who have been unfaithful. Alternate translation: “the praise from God will come to each faithful one” or “the praise and blame from God will come to teach one” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	4	6	agfz	writing-pronouns	ταῦτα	1		The word translated **these things** refers back to everything Paul has said about himself and Apollos in [3:4–23](../03/04.md). If what **these things** refers to would be misunderstood in your language, you could clarify that it refers to what Paul has said about farming and building. Alternate translation: “what I have said about farming and building” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
1CO	4	6	ijn5	figs-gendernotations	ἀδελφοί	1	brothers	Although the word translated **brothers** is masculine, Paul is using it to refer to anyone, whether man or woman. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a non-gendered word or refer to both genders. Alternate translation: “brothers and sisters” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
1CO	4	6	xxp2	translate-names	Ἀπολλῶν	1		This is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
1CO	4	6	ymxi	figs-exclusive	ἡμῖν	1		Here, the word **us** refers to Paul and Apollos only. It does not include the Corinthians. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
1CO	4	6	ziz9	figs-quotations	μάθητε, τό μὴ ὑπὲρ ἃ γέγραπται	1	for your sakes	If you your language does not use this form, you could translate this statement as an indirect quote instead of as a direct quote. Alternate translation: “you might learn not to go beyond what is written” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
1CO	4	6	o02a	figs-explicit	τό μὴ ὑπὲρ ἃ γέγραπται,	1		Here, Paul quotes a short phrase that is not from the Old Testament but that would have been well-known to the Corinthians. The phrase **what is written** could refer to: (1) the Old Testament scriptures. Paul is telling the Corinthians that they should only act in ways that the Old Testament approves of. Alternate translation: “Not beyond what the scriptures say” (2) general principles of life that everyone knows about. Paul is telling the Corinthians that they should only act in ways that are generally approved and accepted. Alternate translation: “Not beyond proper standards” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	4	6	hk55	figs-infostructure	ἵνα	2		The statement introduced by **so that** could be the purpose of (1) learning that they should not go **beyond what is written**. Alternate translation: “with the goal that” (2) Paul applying **these things** to himself and Apollos. Alternate translation: “so that, in the end,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
1CO	4	6	e79m	figs-activepassive	μὴ εἷς…φυσιοῦσθε	1		If your language does not use this form, you could express the idea in active form, with **no one** as the subject and the object. Alternate translation: “no one would puff himself or herself up” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1CO	4	6	hjfu	writing-pronouns	τοῦ ἑνὸς…τοῦ ἑτέρου	1		The words translated **the one** and **the other** refer to any specific leaders the Corinthians might praise or blame. Perhaps Paul specifically has himself and Apollos in mind, but he intentionally uses words that would include any leader whom the Corinthians could praise or blame. If the meaning of **the one** and **the other** would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea by using a word or phrase that indicates that Paul is speaking generally of any leaders here. Alternate translation: “of any leader … any other leader” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
1CO	4	7	fnu3	figs-yousingular	σε…ἔχεις…ἔλαβες…ἔλαβες…καυχᾶσαι…λαβών	1	between you … do you have that you did not … you have freely … do you boast … you had not	In this verse, Paul uses the singular form for **you**. He does this in order to directly address each specific person among the Corinthian believers. In the next verse, he again uses the plural form of “you.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
1CO	4	7	gtb5	figs-rquestion	τίς…σε διακρίνει?	1	For who makes you superior?	Paul does not ask this question because he is looking for information. Rather, he asks it to involve the Corinthians in what he is arguing. The question assumes that the answer is “no one.” If this question would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea as an emphatic statement. Alternate translation: “there is no one who makes you superior.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
1CO	4	7	r6yw	figs-rquestion	τί…ἔχεις ὃ οὐκ ἔλαβες?	1	What do you have that you did not freely receive?	Paul does not ask this question because he is looking for information. Rather, he asks it to involve the Corinthians in what he is arguing. The question assumes that the answer is “nothing.” If this question would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea as an emphatic statement. Alternate translation: “there is nothing that you have that you did not receive.” or “you received everything that you have.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
1CO	4	7	eixw	grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἰ δὲ καὶ ἔλαβες	1		Paul is speaking as if “receiving it” were a hypothetical possibility, but he means that it is actually true. If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, and if your readers might misunderstand and think that what Paul is saying is not certain, then you can translate his words as an affirmative statement. Alternate translation: “And since you indeed received it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
1CO	4	7	e8l2	figs-rquestion	τί καυχᾶσαι ὡς μὴ λαβών?	1	why do you boast as if you had not done so?	Paul does not ask this question because he is looking for information. Rather, he asks it to involve the Corinthians in what he is arguing. Here, there is no answer to the question, since that is exactly Paul’s point. There is no reason for them to **boast**. If this question would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea as an imperative or a “should” statement. Alternate translation: “do not boast as if you did not receive it.” or “you should not boast as if you did not receive it.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
1CO	4	7	p0hg	writing-pronouns	ἔλαβες…λαβών	2		Here, both uses of **it** refer back to **what** the Corinthians **have**. If your language does not use **it** to refer to an unstated “thing,” you could use a word or phrase that does refer clearly back to **what** the Corinthians **have**. Alternate translation: “you received everything … you did … receive everything” or “you received what you have … you did … receive what you have” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
1CO	4	8	yp8s	figs-irony	ἤδη κεκορεσμένοι ἐστέ, ἤδη ἐπλουτήσατε, χωρὶς ἡμῶν ἐβασιλεύσατε	1	General Information:	With these statements, Paul is stating what he thinks the Corinthians would say about themselves. He does not mean that he believes that these things are true. If this form would be misunderstood in your language, you could include some words that clarify that Paul is speaking from the Corinthians’s perspective, such as “it is as if” or “you say.” Alternate translation: “Already it is as if you are satisfied! Already it is as if you have become rich! It is as if you began to reign apart from us” or “Already you say that you are satisfied! Already you say that you have become rich! You say that you have begun to reign apart from us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])
1CO	4	8	v77u	figs-metaphor	κεκορεσμένοι ἐστέ	1		Here, Paul speaks as if the Corinthians have had more than enough food to eat and beverages to drink. By this, he means that (they think that) they have so many spiritual blessings that there are no more that they can receive. If the meaning of **satisfied** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “you are stuffed with blessings” or “you have every spiritual gift” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	4	8	uc7s	figs-metaphor	ἐπλουτήσατε	1		Here, Paul speaks as if the Corinthians have become wealthy people. He speaks in this way to again emphasize that (they think that) they have more spiritual blessings than they need. If the meaning of **become rich** would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea with a comparable metaphor or non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “you have become fat” or “you have an excess of spiritual gifts” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	4	8	mpir	figs-exclusive	ἡμῶν…ἡμεῖς	1		Here, **us** and **we** refer to Paul and others who proclaim the gospel. It does not include the Corinthians. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
1CO	4	9	bb41	grammar-connect-words-phrases	γάρ	1	God has put us apostles on display	Here, the word translated **For** introduces evidence that Paul and the other apostles are not “reigning” right now. If this connection would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea by using a contrast word such as “rather” or use a word or phrase that indicates that this sentence provides evidence that Paul is not “reigning.” Alternate translation: “Rather,” or “You can tell we are not reigning, since” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
1CO	4	9	v0bg	translate-unknown	δοκῶ	1		Here, the word translated **I think** introduces Paul’s own opinion of what he and other **apostles** are meant to do and experience. If the meaning of **I think** would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea by using a word or phrase that introduces a person’s interpretation or opinion. Alternate translation: “in my opinion,” or “it seems to me that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	4	9	lz8v	figs-exclusive	ἡμᾶς…ἐγενήθημεν	1		Here, **we** and **us** refer to Paul and his fellow apostles. It does not include the Corinthians. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
1CO	4	9	vfq3	figs-metaphor	ἡμᾶς τοὺς ἀποστόλους ἐσχάτους ἀπέδειξεν, ὡς ἐπιθανατίους	1	has put us apostles on display	Here, Paul uses a metaphor that identifies himself and other apostles as those who receive public humiliation and are put to death. The metaphor itself: (1) could refer to a Roman gladiatorial contest. The apostles, then, would be **exhibited** in the arena as part of the **last** event. As those who are **sentenced to death**, they would then die in this last event. Alternate translation: “has exhibited us apostles in the last event of the gladiatorial games, in which we are destined to die” (2) could refer to a victory parade. The apostles, then, would be **exhibited** at the end of the parade, or **last**. As the **last** prisoners, they are **sentenced to death**, and will be killed soon after the parade ends. Alternate translation: “has exhibited us apostles at the end of the victory parade, in the place where prisoners who are sentenced to death march” (3) could be misunderstood in your language. If this is the case, you could express the idea in non-figurative language. Alternate translation: “has chosen us apostles to be humiliated, and we are destined to die” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	4	9	ayu9	translate-unknown	ἐσχάτους	1		The word translated **last of all** could identify: (1) the time when the **apostles** are **exhibited**, which would be as the last event held in the arena. Alternate translation: “at the end” (2) the place where the **apostles** are **exhibited**, which would be at the end of the victory parade. Alternate translation: “last in line” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	4	9	e4i1	figs-metaphor	θέατρον ἐγενήθημεν τῷ κόσμῳ, καὶ ἀγγέλοις καὶ ἀνθρώποις	1		Here, Paul speaks as if he and other apostles were part of a gladiatorial game or a theatrical show. He speaks in this way to show that the humiliation and death he and other apostles suffer happens in public, with everyone watching to see what happens. If this metaphor would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “we live in full view of the world—both of angels and of men” or “we undergo these things publicly, before the world—both angels and men” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	4	9	cqh4	figs-infostructure	τῷ κόσμῳ, καὶ ἀγγέλοις καὶ ἀνθρώποις	1	to the world—to angels, and to human beings	This structure could mean that: (1) Paul wants to define the **world** as **angels** and **men**. Alternate translation: “to the world, that is, both to angels and to men” (2) Paul is listing three different things. Alternate translation: “to the world, to angels, and to men.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
1CO	4	9	d8da	figs-gendernotations	ἀνθρώποις	1		Although the word translated **men** is masculine, Paul is using it to refer to anyone, whether men or women. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a non-gendered word or refer to both genders. Alternate translation: “to men and women” or “to people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
1CO	4	10	ds54	figs-ellipsis	ἡμεῖς μωροὶ διὰ Χριστόν, ὑμεῖς δὲ φρόνιμοι ἐν Χριστῷ; ἡμεῖς ἀσθενεῖς, ὑμεῖς δὲ ἰσχυροί; ὑμεῖς ἔνδοξοι, ἡμεῖς δὲ ἄτιμοι	1		In Paul’s language, he did not need to include the word translated **{are}**. However, many languages, including English, must add **{are}**, which is why the ULT includes it in brackets. If your language would not use **{are}** here, you could leave it unexpressed. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
1CO	4	10	johq	figs-exclusive	ἡμεῖς	-1		Here, the word **we** refers to Paul and the other “apostles.” It does not include the Corinthians. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
1CO	4	10	fkw2	figs-irony	ἡμεῖς μωροὶ…ἡμεῖς ἀσθενεῖς…ἡμεῖς…ἄτιμοι	1	We are fools … in dishonor	With these statements, Paul identifies what he and the other apostles are like from the perspective of this world. They are **fools**, **weak**, and **dishonored**. Paul does know that from God’s perspective they are actually “wise,” “strong,” and “honored.” However, he speaks from the perspective of this world to help the Corinthians change their thinking. Instead of wanting to be **wise**, **strong**, and **honored**, the Corinthians need to realize that following God will instead make them appear to this world as **fools**, **weak**, and **dishonored**. If the meaning of these statements would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word or phrase that clarifies that they are spoken from a different perspective. Alternate translation: “We {seem to be} fools … We {seem to be} weak … we {seem to be} dishonored” or “According to the world, we {are} fools … According to the word, we {are} weak … according to the world, we {are} dishonored’ (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])
1CO	4	10	ufj2	figs-irony	ὑμεῖς δὲ φρόνιμοι…ὑμεῖς δὲ ἰσχυροί…ὑμεῖς ἔνδοξοι	1		With these statements, Paul identifies what the Corinthians think about themselves. They think they are **wise**, **strong**, and **honored** from the perspective of this world. Paul contrasts what the Corinthians think about themselves and how he and other apostles look from the world’s perspective in order to make the Corinthians reconsider what they think about themselves. If these statements would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word or phrase that identifies that they are spoken from the perspective of the Corinthians. Alternate translation: “but you consider yourselves wise … but you consider yourselves strong … You consider yourselves honored” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])
1CO	4	10	wqh7	figs-metaphor	ἐν Χριστῷ	1	You are held in honor	Paul uses the spatial metaphor **in Christ** to describe the union of believers with Christ. In this case, being **in Christ**, or united to Christ, explains: (1) the means by which God has made the Corinthians **wise**. Alternate translation: “by means of your union with Christ” (2) the reason why God has made the Corinthians **wise**. Alternate translation: “because of your union with Christ Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	4	10	d1s9	figs-infostructure	ὑμεῖς ἔνδοξοι, ἡμεῖς δὲ ἄτιμοι.	1		Paul changes the order of the last item in the list, putting **You** in front of **we**. In his culture, this is one way to identify the last item in a list. If the change in order would be misunderstood in your language, you could change the order to match the order Paul uses for the first two items. Alternate translation: “We {are} dishonored, but you {are} honored” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
1CO	4	11	i298	figs-idiom	ἄχρι τῆς ἄρτι ὥρας	1	Up to this present hour	In Paul’s culture, the phrase **Up to this present hour** means that what Paul is about to say has been happening and continues to happen up to the time when he writes this letter. If this phrase would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable idiom or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “To this very day” “All the time we serve Christ,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1CO	4	11	k3f1	figs-exclusive	πεινῶμεν	1		Here, the word **we** refers to Paul and the other “apostles.” It does not include the Corinthians. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
1CO	4	11	hqco	translate-unknown	γυμνιτεύομεν	1		The word translated **are poorly clothed** means that the clothing is old and worn and barely covers a person’s body. If the meaning of **are poorly clothed** would be misunderstood in your language, use a word or phrase that identifies clothing that barely covers a person. Alternate translation: “are clothed in rags” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	4	11	jj2y	figs-activepassive	καὶ κολαφιζόμεθα, καὶ	1	we are brutally beaten	If your language does not use this form, you could express the idea in active form with a vague or indefinite subject. If you use the following alternate translation, you may need to add a comma before it. Alternate translation: “and people brutally beat us, and we” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1CO	4	11	yhf4	translate-unknown	ἀστατοῦμεν	1	we are homeless	The word translated **are homeless** means that Paul and the other apostles do not have a permanent residence or a house that they own. It does not mean that they never had a place to stay. If the meaning of **are homeless** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word or phrase that indicates that Paul and the other apostles do not have a permanent residence. Alternate translation: “do not own homes” or “are always on the move” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	4	12	exfo	figs-exclusive	ἰδίαις…εὐλογοῦμεν…ἀνεχόμεθα	1		Here, the words **our** and **we** refer to Paul and other “apostles.” They do not include the Corinthians. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
1CO	4	12	ushf	figs-doublet	κοπιῶμεν, ἐργαζόμενοι	1		Here, the words **working hard** and **working** mean basically the same thing. Paul uses both words to emphasize how **hard** he is working. If your language does not use repetition in this way, you could combine these words and indicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “are working very hard” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
1CO	4	12	e0mz	figs-idiom	ἐργαζόμενοι ταῖς ἰδίαις χερσίν	1		In Paul’s culture, the phrase **with our own hands** indicates that Paul and other apostles were doing manual labor. In fact, we know that Paul himself made tents (see [Acts 18:3](../act/018/03.md)), so that is probably the manual labor which he refers to here. If **with our hands** would not refer to manual labor in your language, you could use a comparable idiom or an expression that refers to manual labor. Alternate translation: “doing physically demanding work” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1CO	4	12	z6fg	grammar-connect-time-simultaneous	λοιδορούμενοι…διωκόμενοι	1		The phrases **Being reviled** and **being persecuted** identify the situations in which Paul and other apostles **bless** and **endure**. If this relationship would be misunderstood in your language, you could (1) include a word such as “when” to indicate that these actions happen at the same time. Alternate translation: “Any time we are reviled … any time we are persecuted” (2) include a word such as “although” to indicate that these actions are in contrast with each other. Alternate translation: “Although we are reviled … although we are persecuted” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous]])
1CO	4	12	n389	figs-activepassive	λοιδορούμενοι	1	When we are reviled, we bless	If your language does not use this form, you could express the idea in active form, with a vague or indefinite subject. Alternate translation: “Others reviling us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1CO	4	12	o7jz	translate-unknown	λοιδορούμενοι	1		Here, the word translated **Being reviled** refers to someone abusing another person with words. If that meaning for **Being reviled** would not be obvious in your language, you could use a word or phrase that does refer to using abusive words about another person. Alternate translation: “Being slandered” or “Being attacked verbally” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	4	12	l71q	figs-explicit	εὐλογοῦμεν	1		Here, Paul does not state whom or what they **bless**. He could mean that they **bless**: (1) the people who “revile” them. Alternate translation: “we bless in return” (2) God, even though they are suffering. Alternate translation: “we bless God anyway” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	4	12	kue7	figs-activepassive	διωκόμενοι	1	When we are persecuted	If your language does not use this form, you could express the idea in active form, with a vague or indefinite subject. Alternate translation: “Others persecuting us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1CO	4	13	xvn4	figs-exclusive	παρακαλοῦμεν…ἐγενήθημεν	1		Here, the word **we** refers to Paul and other “apostles.” It does not include the Corinthians. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
1CO	4	13	l3ns	grammar-connect-time-simultaneous	δυσφημούμενοι	1		The phrase **being slandered** identifies the situation in which Paul and other apostles **comfort**. If this relationship would be misunderstood in your language, you could (1) include a word such as “when” to indicate that these actions happen at the same time. Alternate translation: “Any time we are slandered” (2) include a word such as “although” to indicate that these actions are in contrast with each other. Alternate translation: “Although we are slandered” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous]])
1CO	4	13	a6hp	figs-activepassive	δυσφημούμενοι	1	When we are slandered	If your language does not use this form, you could express the idea in active form, with a vague or indefinite subject. Alternate translation: “others slandering us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1CO	4	13	p0fd	figs-simile	ὡς περικαθάρματα τοῦ κόσμου ἐγενήθημεν, πάντων περίψημα	1		Here, Paul says that he and other apostles are like **scum** and **refuse**, both of which are words that describe garbage. Paul speaks in this way to show that **the world** considers him and other apostles to be worthless, just like garbage is worthless and should be thrown away. If the meaning of this simile would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea with a comparable image or non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “We have no value according to the world’s perspective” or “We have become like a heap of garbage” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
1CO	4	13	uubg	figs-doublet	περικαθάρματα τοῦ κόσμου…πάντων περίψημα	1		Here, Paul uses two different words for garbage. The word **scum** refers to what people throw away after they clean something. The word **refuse** refers to dirt or filth that people wipe or scrub off an object. Paul uses two very similar words in order to emphasize that the world thinks that he and other apostles are like garbage. If your language does not use repetition in this way, you could combine these phrases. Alternate translation: “the filthy scum of all the world” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
1CO	4	13	gqxj	figs-possession	περικαθάρματα τοῦ κόσμου	1		Here, Paul uses the possessive form to describe what **the world** identifies as **scum**. If this form would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a short phrase to clarify that **scum** is what **the world** thinks he and other apostles are. Alternate translation: “what the world considers scum” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
1CO	4	13	flf9	figs-synecdoche	τοῦ κόσμου	1		When Paul uses **the world** in this context, he is not referring primarily to everything that God has made. Rather, he uses **the world** to refer to human beings who do not believe in Jesus. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an expression that refers to human beings in general. Alternate translation: “of human beings” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
1CO	4	13	ip6p	figs-possession	πάντων περίψημα	1		Here, Paul uses the possessive form to describe **refuse** that: (1) comes from **all things**. Alternate translation: “the refuse from all things” (2) **all** people consider to be garbage. Alternate translation: “what all people consider to be refuse” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
1CO	4	13	z4tt	figs-idiom	ἕως ἄρτι	1		Here, Paul ends this sentence in a similar way to how he began his sentence in [4:11](../04/11.md). In Paul’s culture, the phrase **even until now** means that what Paul speaks about has been happening and continues to happen up to the time when he writes this letter. If this phrase would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable idiom or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “to this very day” “all the time we serve Christ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1CO	4	14	k1at	figs-infostructure	οὐκ ἐντρέπων ὑμᾶς γράφω ταῦτα, ἀλλ’ ὡς τέκνα μου ἀγαπητὰ, νουθετῶ	1	I do not write these things to shame you, but to correct you	If putting the negative statement before the positive statement would be misunderstood in your language, you could reverse them. Alternate translation: “I correct {you} as my beloved children. I do not write these things as shaming you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
1CO	4	14	r9pj	grammar-connect-logic-goal	ἐντρέπων ὑμᾶς	1		Here, the phrase **as shaming you** introduces what Paul did **not write** to do. If **as shaming** would be understood as a purpose in your language, you could use a word or phrase that does clearly indicate purpose. Alternate translation: “in order to shame you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
1CO	4	14	nlzx	writing-pronouns	ταῦτα	1		The word translated **these things** refers back to what Paul has already written, focusing on [4:6–13](../04/06.md). If that meaning for **these things** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers back to what Paul has just finished writing. Alternate translation: “what I have said about us apostles and you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
1CO	4	14	t8jc	grammar-connect-logic-result	ὡς τέκνα μου ἀγαπητὰ	1	correct	Here, the phrase **as my beloved children** introduces (1) the reason why Paul corrects the Corinthians. Alternate translation: “because you are my beloved children” (2) the way in which he corrects the Corinthians. Alternate translation: “as a father corrects his beloved children, so” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
1CO	4	14	ruu5	figs-metaphor	τέκνα μου ἀγαπητὰ	1	my beloved children	Here, Paul speaks of the Corinthians as if they were his **beloved children**. He speaks in this way because he is their spiritual father, the one who first preached the good news to them. Also, he loves them in the same way a father loves his own children. If Paul calling the Corinthians his **beloved children** would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea with a comparable metaphor or non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “my beloved younger siblings” or “fellow believers whom I love” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	4	15	ur1i	grammar-connect-condition-contrary	ἐὰν…μυρίους παιδαγωγοὺς ἔχητε ἐν Χριστῷ	1		Here, Paul is making a conditional statement that sounds hypothetical, but he is already convinced that the condition is not true. He knows that the Corinthians do not have **myriads of guardians**, but he speaks in this way to emphasize that they have only one spiritual father, no matter how many **guardians** they have. Use a natural form in your language for introducing a condition that the speaker believes is not true. Alternate translation: “even if you somehow had myriads of guardians in Christ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-contrary]])
1CO	4	15	n8c1	figs-hyperbole	μυρίους παιδαγωγοὺς	1	ten thousand guardians	Here, **myriads of guardians** is an exaggeration that the Corinthians would have understood to mean a large number of **guardians**. If that would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to a large number. Alternate translation: “many guardians” or “a large number of guardians” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
1CO	4	15	nkcc	figs-metaphor	ἐν Χριστῷ	1		Here, Paul uses the spatial metaphor **in Christ** to describe the union of believers with Christ. In this case, being **in Christ**, or united to Christ, identifies: (1) that these **guardians** are helping the Corinthians in their union with Christ. Alternate translation: “who work to unite you more strongly to Christ” (2) the guardians as fellow believers in Jesus. Alternate translation: “who believe in Christ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	4	15	d25x	figs-ellipsis	οὐ πολλοὺς πατέρας	1		Here, Paul omits some words that may be essential in your language to create a complete thought. In English, these words are essential, so they have been included in the ULT in brackets. If you can translate this sentence without these words, you could do so here. Otherwise, you could retain these words as they appear in the ULT. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
1CO	4	15	yij4		οὐ πολλοὺς πατέρας	1		Alternate translation: “{you would have} only one father”
1CO	4	15	j01t	figs-exmetaphor	οὐ πολλοὺς πατέρας; ἐν γὰρ Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ διὰ τοῦ εὐαγγελίου, ἐγὼ ὑμᾶς ἐγέννησα.	1		Here, Paul speaks of himself as a “father” to the Corinthian believers. He became their father **through the gospel**, which means that he is their spiritual father. He is the one who preached the **gospel** to them when they became united to **Christ Jesus**, and that makes him the one who **fathered** them. If how Paul speaks about **fathers** would be misunderstood in your language, you could clarify that Paul refers to “spiritual” **fathers**. Alternate translation: “{you would} not {have} many spiritual fathers; for I fathered you spiritually in Christ Jesus through the gospel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])
1CO	4	15	m9ek	figs-metaphor	ἐν…Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ	2	I became your father in Christ Jesus through the gospel	Here, Paul uses the spatial metaphor **in Christ Jesus** to describe the union of believers with Christ. In this case, being **in Christ**, or united to Christ, explains: (1) that the Corinthians became united to Christ when Paul preached the good news to them. Alternate translation: “when you were united to Christ Jesus” (2) Paul is their father in the Christian family, the family that is united to Christ. Alternate translation: “in the Christian family” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	4	16	vkao	figs-abstractnouns	μιμηταί μου γίνεσθε	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **imitators**, you could express the idea by using a verbal such as “imitate.” Alternate translation: “imitate me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1CO	4	17	lrqn	writing-pronouns	διὰ τοῦτο	1		Here, **this** refers back to what Paul said in the previous verse about imitating him. If **this** would be misunderstood in your language, you could clarify that it refers back to the previous verse. Alternate translation: “For that reason” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
1CO	4	17	r7z7		ἔπεμψα	1		Sometimes, Paul uses the past tense **sent** with reference to the person who carries the letter to its destination. However, Paul later speak of Timothy visiting them as only a possibility (see [16:10](../16/10.md)). Therefore, the visit to which Paul refers here could: (1) have already happened by the time Paul is writing this letter. Timothy would be visiting the Corinthians while Paul is writing this letter, since Paul uses the future tense to refer to how Timothy **will remind** them of Paul’s ways. Alternate translation: “I have sent” (2) be when Timothy brings the letter to them, at which time he **will remind** them of his ways. Alternate translation: “I am sending”
1CO	4	17	hi7w	figs-metaphor	ὅς ἐστίν μου τέκνον, ἀγαπητὸν καὶ πιστὸν	1	my beloved and faithful child in the Lord	Here, Paul speaks of **Timothy** as if he were his own **child**. This continues the metaphor about Paul as a spiritual father from [4:15](../04/15.md). Paul is Timothy’s spiritual father, and Paul loves **Timothy** in the way a father loves his child. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea with a comparable metaphor or non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “who is my beloved and faithful spiritual child” or “whom I love and who is faithful” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	4	17	nwqz	figs-metaphor	ἐν Κυρίῳ	1		Here, Paul uses the spatial metaphor **in the Lord** to describe the union of believers with Christ. In this case, being **in the Lord**, or united to the Lord, identifies Timothy as someone who faithfully does what he is called to do in his union with **the Lord**. Alternate translation: “in his union with the Lord” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	4	17	oqd7	figs-metaphor	τὰς ὁδούς μου τὰς ἐν	1		Here, Paul speaks of how he lives and what he does as **my ways**, which refers to the paths that Paul walks on. This way of speaking is related to how Paul has already spoken of behavior as “walking” (see [3:3](../03/03.md)). The phrase **my ways** could identify: (1) how Paul thinks and lives. Alternate translation: “the way that I live in” (2) the principles that Paul follows concerning how to think and live. Alternate translation: “the principles that I follow in” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	4	17	cq9z	figs-metaphor	ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ	1		Here, Paul uses the spatial metaphor **in Christ Jesus** to describe the union of believers with Christ. In this case, being **in Christ Jesus**, or united to Christ Jesus, describes Paul’s **ways** as ways that are appropriate for those united to Christ Jesus. Alternate translation: “appropriate in union with Christ Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	4	17	j6gj	figs-explicit	καθὼς…διδάσκω	1		Here, Paul does not explicitly state what it is that he is teaching. From the previous words, however, it is clear that he teaches his **ways**, the same **ways** that Timothy will **remind** them about. If you need to clarify what Paul teaches, you could refer to the **ways** explicitly. Alternate translation: “the same ways that I teach” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	4	17	xs5y	figs-hyperbole	πανταχοῦ ἐν πάσῃ ἐκκλησίᾳ	1		Here, Paul speaks as if Paul has been **everywhere** and visited **every church**. The Corinthians would have understood this to refer to **everywhere** and **every church** that Paul has visited. If **everywhere** and **every church** would be misunderstood in your language, you could clarify that Paul refers to **every** place and church he has visited. Alternate translation: “everywhere I go and in every church that I visit” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
1CO	4	18	v4fn	grammar-connect-time-sequential	δέ	1	Now	Here, the word translated **Now** introduces a development in the argument. Paul starts addressing some of the Corinthians who are proud. If **Now** does not introduce a new part of the argument in your language, you could use a word or phrase that does do this. Alternate translation: “Moving on,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
1CO	4	17	wdug	figs-doublet	πανταχοῦ ἐν πάσῃ ἐκκλησίᾳ	1		Here, the words **everywhere** and **in every church** have very similar meanings. Paul repeats the idea to emphasize that he teaches the **ways** in every church, not just among the Corinthians. If your language does not use repetition in this way, you could combine the two phrases into one. Alternate translation: “in every church” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
1CO	4	18	th6i	writing-pronouns	τινες	1		The word **some** refers to **some** of the Corinthians. If the reference of **some** would be misunderstood in your language, you could clarify that it identifies **some** Corinthian believers. Alternate translation: “some from among you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
1CO	4	18	flbr	figs-activepassive	ἐφυσιώθησάν	1		If your language does not use this form, you could express the idea in active form, with “themselves” as the object. Alternate translation: “have puffed themselves up” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1CO	4	18	gap0	grammar-connect-condition-contrary	ὡς	1		Here, Paul speaks of him **not coming** as something that is a possibility. However, he is convinced that this is not true, since he will “come” to them. Use a natural form in your language for introducing a condition that the speaker believes is not true. Alternate translation: “as if” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-contrary]])
1CO	4	19	jdk5	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	δὲ	1	I will come to you	Here, **But** introduces a contrast with what some people are thinking in the previous verse, that is, that Paul is not going to visit them. In this verse, he says that he will visit them soon. Use a word or phrase in your language that introduces a strong contrast. Alternate translation: “Despite what they think,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
1CO	4	19	y1sl	figs-infostructure	ἐλεύσομαι…ταχέως πρὸς ὑμᾶς, ἐὰν ὁ Κύριος θελήσῃ	1		If your language would put the **if** statement first, you could rearrange these two clauses. Alternate translation: “if the Lord wills, I will come to you soon” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
1CO	4	19	eyq3	grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical	ἐὰν ὁ Κύριος θελήσῃ	1		Here, Paul says that he will only visit the Corinthians **if the Lord wills**. He is not sure whether the Lord will “will” or not. Use a form in your language that indicates a true hypothetical. Alternate translation: “only if the Lord wills, of course” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical]])
1CO	4	19	tdbk	figs-explicit	τὸν λόγον…τὴν δύναμιν	1		The contrast between **word** and **power** was well-known in Paul’s culture. The contrast states that people can say many things, but they cannot always do what they say they can. If your language has a way to express this contrast between “talk” and “action,” you could use it here. Alternate translation: “the talk … their deeds” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	4	19	kbp1	figs-metonymy	τὸν λόγον τῶν πεφυσιωμένων	1		Here, **word** figuratively represents what someone says in words. If **word** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “what these who have been puffed up say” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1CO	4	19	fz8n	figs-activepassive	τῶν πεφυσιωμένων	1		If your language does not use this form, you could express the idea in active form, with “themselves” as the object. Alternate translation: “of these people who have puffed themselves up” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1CO	4	19	m92u	figs-abstractnouns	τὴν δύναμιν	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **power**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “powerful.” Alternate translation: “how powerful they are” or “their powerful deeds” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1CO	4	20	iucw	figs-metaphor	οὐ…ἐν λόγῳ ἡ Βασιλεία τοῦ Θεοῦ, ἀλλ’ ἐν δυνάμει	1		Here, Paul speaks as if **the kingdom of God** exists **in**, not **word**, but **power**. By this, he means that **the kingdom of God** does not consist in what people say but in what they do. To say it another way, **word**, or what people say, by itself does not make people part of God’s kingdom. Rather, it takes God’s **power** working for and through people to make them part of God’s kingdom. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “the kingdom of God consists not in word but in power” or “the kingdom of God is not about word but about power” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	4	20	shgb	figs-abstractnouns	ἐν λόγῳ…ἀλλ’ ἐν δυνάμει	1		The contrast between **word** and **power** was well-known in Paul’s culture. The contrast states that people can say many things, but they cannot always do what they say they can. If your language has a way to express this contrast between “talk” and “action,” you could use it here. Alternate translation: “not in talk but in deeds” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	4	20	gfhp	figs-metonymy	λόγῳ	1		Here, **word** figuratively represents what someone says in words. If **word** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “what people say” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1CO	4	20	wzpo	figs-abstractnouns	δυνάμει	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **power**, you could express the idea another way. Alternate translation: “powerful deeds” or “what people powerfully do” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1CO	4	21	ix5g	figs-rquestion	τί θέλετε?	1	What do you want?	Paul asks the Corinthians **What** they **want** because he wants them to realize that their behavior will show him how to respond to them. He does not want the Corinthians to tell him all their desires. Rather, he presents two options in the rest of the verse, and the question **What do you want?** shows the Corinthians that they can choose between those two options by listening to Paul or choosing not to listen to him. If your language does not use a question to express this idea, you could translate the question in statement form. Alternate translation: “Depending on what you do, I will behave towards you in one of two ways.” or “How you respond to me will tell me how to respond to you.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
1CO	4	21	wv61	figs-rquestion	ἐν ῥάβδῳ ἔλθω πρὸς ὑμᾶς, ἢ ἐν ἀγάπῃ, πνεύματί τε πραΰτητος?	1	Shall I come to you with a rod or with love and in a spirit of gentleness?	Here, Paul uses a question to present the two options for how he could act toward the Corinthians when he “comes” to them. He asks a question for the same reason he asked the first question in this verse. He wants them to realize that how they choose to respond to him will dictate how he will act when he visits. If they do not listen to him, he will **come with a rod**. If they do listen, he will come **with love and a spirit of gentleness**. If your language does not use a question to express this idea, you could translate the question in statement form. Alternate translation: “I will either come to you with a rod or with love and a spirit of gentleness.” or “If you do not listen, I will come to you with a rod. If you do listen, I will come to you with love and a spirit of gentleness.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
1CO	4	21	bl1d	figs-metaphor	ἐν ῥάβδῳ	1		Paul speaks of coming **with a rod** as if he is going to physically beat the Corinthians to teach them to listen to him. This metaphor may continue the way in which he speaks of himself as a “father” in [4:14–15](../04/14.md), since fathers could punish their children physically **with a rod** if they did not obey. By speaking in this way, Paul thus refers to discipline or punishment, but the discipline he threatens will not be physical. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word or phrase that would describe discipline or punishment, or you could express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “to punish you” or “with a harsh rebuke” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	4	21	h4oj	figs-abstractnouns	ἐν ἀγάπῃ…τε	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **love**, you could express the idea by using an adverb such as “lovingly” or a verb such as “love.” Alternate translation: “shall I love you with” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1CO	4	21	u7b9	figs-possession	πνεύματί…πραΰτητος	1		Here, Paul uses the possessive form to describe a **spirit** that is characterized by **gentleness**. If your language would not use the possessive form to express that idea, you could express the idea by translating **gentleness** as an adjective, such as “gentle.” Alternate translation: “a gentle spirit” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
1CO	4	21	hpmb	translate-unknown	πνεύματί	1		Here, **spirit** does not refer to God’s Spirit, the Holy Spirit. Rather, it refers to Paul’s spirit. In Paul’s culture, **as spirit of** something is a way to describe a person’s attitude that is characterized by that thing. Here, then, Paul speaks about an attitude that is gentle. If **spirit** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word such as “attitude” to express the idea. Alternate translation: “an attitude” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	4	21	ix7l	figs-abstractnouns	πραΰτητος	1	of gentleness	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **gentleness**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “gentle.” Alternate translation: “that is gentle” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1CO	5	intro	vb3l			0		# 1 Corinthians 5 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>3. Against sexual immorality (4:16–6:20)<br>    * Paul condemns a sexually immoral man (5:1–5)<br>    * Passover festival metaphor (5:6–8)<br>    * Explanation of previous letter (5:9–13)<br><br>Some translations set quotations from the Old Testament farther to the right on the page to make them easier to read. The ULT does this with the quoted words of verse 13. Verse 13 quotes from Deuteronomy 17:7.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Sexual immorality<br><br>This chapter deals mostly with what Paul calls “sexual immorality” ([5:1](../05/01.md), [9–11](../05/9.md)). The word Paul uses for “sexual immorality” is a general term for sexual behavior that is considered improper. The specific type of “sexual immorality” that Paul addresses in this chapter is a man having sex with his step-mother. In some languages, there is a specific word for this. English uses the word “incest.” However, since Paul uses a general term and then brings up a specific situation, you also should use a general term for “sexual immorality” in this chapter. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/fornication]])<br><br>### Judgment<br><br>Paul refers to “judgment” or “judging” in [5:3](../05/03.md), [12–13](../05/12.md). “Judging” refers to deciding whether someone is guilty or innocent. Paul emphasizes in this chapter that Christians should “judge” other Christians in the proper setting (see [5:3–5](../05/03.md)). However, they do not need to “judge” people who are not Christians. Paul states that “judging” them is God’s responsibility ([5:12–13](../05/12.md)). (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/judge]])<br><br>### Excommunication<br><br>In [5:2](../05/02.md), Paul speaks about “removing” the person who committed the sexual sin from among the Corinthians, and he makes a similar command in [5:13](../05/13.md). The phrase “hand this man over to Satan” in [5:5](../05/05.md) has a similar meaning. Finally, when Paul tells them to “clean out the old yeast” ([5:7](../05/07.md)), this is a metaphor for the same action. Paul is commanding the Corinthians to stop including in their group the man who committed the sexual sin. It is not totally clear whether the man can be accepted back into the group if he stops committing the sin.<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Euphemisms<br><br>As is the case in many cultures, sexual behavior is a delicate topic. Paul thus uses euphemisms to avoid sounding crude or nasty. When he says that “someone has his father’s wife” ([5:1](../05/01.md)), this is a delicate way to refer to someone consistently having sex with his father’s wife, whether married or not. He later on calls this behavior “a deed” ([5:2](../05/02.md)) or “such a thing” ([5:3](../05/03.md)). These phrases are ways of referring back to the man having sex with his father’s wife without using crude words. If your language has similar euphemisms for delicately referring to sexual behavior, you could use them here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])<br><br>### Passover metaphor<br><br>In [5:6–8](../05/06.md), Paul speaks of “yeast” and “Passover.” Passover was Jewish festival in which the people celebrated how God delivered them from serving as slaves in Egypt. The Israelites sacrificed lambs and spread the blood on their doors, and they ate bread without yeast in it because they would have to leave quickly. Then, God sent a destroying angel who killed the firstborn child in every house that did not have blood on its door. When this happened, the ruler of Egypt told the Israelites to leave immediately. You can read about these events in [Exodus 12](../exo/12/01.md). Later generations of Israelites celebrated this day by removing the yeast from their houses and by sacrificing a lamb. Paul refers to this festival in these verses. He uses the festival of Passover as a metaphor to encourage the Corinthians to remove sinful people (“yeast”) from their group (“their house”). There is even a “Passover lamb,” who is Jesus himself. Since this metaphor is drawn from the Old Testament, you should preserve it in your translation. If necessary you can include a footnote that gives some extra information, or you could refer your readers to Exodus 12 if they have access to the book of Exodus. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/yeast]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/passover]], and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])<br><br>### Rhetorical questions<br><br>In [5:6](../05/06.md) and [5:12](../05/12.md), Paul uses rhetorical questions. He is not asking these questions because he wants the Corinthians to provide him with information. Rather, he is asking these questions because he wants the Corinthians to think about how they are acting and what they are thinking. The questions encourage them to think along with Paul. For ways to translate these questions, look for the notes on each verse that includes these kinds of questions. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])<br><br>### Present in spirit<br><br>In [5:3–4](../05/03.md), Paul speaks of being with the Corinthians “in spirit.” While this could be a reference to the Holy Spirit, who would connect Paul with the Corinthians, more likely Paul is referring to his own “spirit,” which refers to the aspect of Paul that can connect with the Corinthians even when he is not physically present. When he says that he is with them “in spirit,” that means that he is thinking about them and that they should act as they would if Paul was physically present. You could either use a comparable idiom in your language or explain in some other way what “spirit” means in these verses. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/spirit]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Structure of 5:3–5<br><br>In [5:3–5](../05/03.md), Paul uses a long and complicated sentence structure. In 5:3, he describes how he has “passed judgment” as if he were present. In 5:5, he tells them what the response to that judgment should be: “hand this man over to Satan.” In 5:4, then, he describes the situation in which they should hand the man over: they should be gathered together and acting with the authority of both Paul and Jesus. Finally, in 5:4, “in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ” could describe how Paul has “passed judgment” in 5:3, or it could describe how the Corinthians have “assembled” in 5:4. In order to translate these verses clearly, you may need to rearrange some clauses or add explanatory information that clarifies what Paul is saying. For more details and translation options, see the notes on those verses.<br><br>### Structure of 5:12–13<br><br>In [5:12–13](../05/13.md), Paul alternates between talking about judging “those outside” and “those inside.” If alternating between these two ideas would be confusing in your language, you could rearrange the clauses so that the verses deal with “those outside” first and then “those inside.” Here is an example of how you could do this: “For what to me to judge those outside? God will judge those outside. But do you not judge those inside? “Remove the evil from among yourselves.”
1CO	5	1	k55t	translate-unknown	ὅλως ἀκούεται	1		The word translated **actually** can: (1) emphasize that something is really true. Alternate translation: “It is really reported that” (2) emphasize that many people know about what is going on in the Corinthian church. Alternate translation: “It is everywhere reported that” or “It is reported by many people that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	5	1	wrj1	figs-activepassive	ὅλως ἀκούεται	1		Here, Paul intentionally uses a passive form to avoid stating who told him about the **sexual immorality**. If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea by making Paul the subject of a verb such as “learn” or by using a form that avoids naming a person. Alternate translation: “Some people have actually reported to me that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1CO	5	1	dlj2	figs-doublet	ἐν ὑμῖν πορνεία, καὶ τοιαύτη πορνεία ἥτις οὐδὲ ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσιν	1	which does not even exist among the Gentiles	Here, Paul repeats **sexual immorality** in order to emphasize how shocked and upset he is that people among the Corinthians are committing sexual sins. If your language does not use repetition in this way, you could combine these two statements and express Paul’s shock in another way. Alternate translation: “{there is} sexual immorality among you that even the Gentiles condemn” or “you overlook flagrant sexual immorality, a kind which even the Gentiles do not accept” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
1CO	5	1	bnnc	figs-explicit	ἥτις οὐδὲ ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσιν	1		While Paul does not explicitly say why this **immorality** is not **among the Gentiles**, the Corinthians would have understood him to mean that the **Gentiles** do not permit such behavior and prohibit it by law or social practice. If this information would not be implied in your language, you could include a word or phrase that indicates that Paul refers to the attitude of **Gentiles** towards this kind of **sexual immorality**. Alternate translation: “which even the Gentiles avoid” or “which even the Gentiles find shocking” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	5	1	q8p7	translate-unknown	τοῖς ἔθνεσιν	1		Here, Paul does not use **the Gentiles** primarily to refer to non-Jews, since there were non-Jewish members of the church. Rather, Paul uses **the Gentiles** to describe anyone who does not worship the true God. If **the Gentiles** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word or phrase that identifies those who do not worship or serve God. Alternate translation: “the pagans” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	5	1	b9xn		γυναῖκά τινα τοῦ πατρὸς ἔχειν	1	a man has his father’s wife	In Paul’s culture, if man **has** a woman, it refers to a long-term sexual relationship. Often this would be a marriage, but it could also be a sexual relationship without marriage. Here, it is not clear whether the person (**someone**) marries **his father’s wife** or not. What is clear is that he is in a long-term sexual relationship with **his father’s wife**. If possible use a word or phrase that indicates this kind of general relationship. Alternate translation: “someone is living with his father’s wife” or “someone is sleeping with his father’s wife” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
1CO	5	1	lxp1	translate-kinship	γυναῖκά…τοῦ πατρὸς	1	father’s wife	Here, **his father’s wife** identifies a woman who is married to a man’s father but who is not the man’s mother. If your language has a specific word for this relationship, you could use it here. If your language does not have a word for this relationship, you could describe the relationship with a phrase, much like the ULT does. Alternate translation: “his father’s wife who is not his mother” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship]])
1CO	5	2	idwe	figs-activepassive	ὑμεῖς πεφυσιωμένοι ἐστέ	1		If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form, with “yourselves” as the object. Alternate translation: “you puff yourselves up” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1CO	5	2	uwco	grammar-connect-logic-goal	ἵνα ἀρθῇ…ὁ, τὸ ἔργον τοῦτο ποιήσας	1		The word translated **so that** could introduce: (1) a purpose for the “mourning.” Alternate translation: “in order that the one who did this deed might be removed (2) a command. If you use the following alternate translation, you may need to add period before it. Alternate translation: “The one who did this deed should be removed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
1CO	5	2	rr93	figs-activepassive	ἵνα ἀρθῇ ἐκ μέσου ὑμῶν ὁ, τὸ ἔργον τοῦτο ποιήσας	1	The one who did this must be removed from among you	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form with the Corinthians as the subject. Alternate translation: “so that you remove the one who did this deed from among you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1CO	5	2	ffwt	figs-doublet	ὁ, τὸ ἔργον τοῦτο ποιήσας	1		In Paul’s culture, it was normal to use both **did** and **deed** to refer to performing an act. If your language would not use both **did** and **deed** here, you could express the idea with just one of these two words. Alternate translation: “the one who did this” or “the one who acted out this deed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
1CO	5	2	qwja	figs-idiom	ἀρθῇ ἐκ μέσου ὑμῶν	1		When someone is **removed from among** a group, it means that he or she is no longer part of the group. If your language has a specific word or phrase to describe expelling a member of a group, you could use it here. Alternate translation: “might be banned from your group” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1CO	5	3	rm6l	grammar-connect-logic-result	γάρ	1		Here, the word **For** introduces the reason why the man who has committed the sexual sin should be “removed from among you” ([5:2](../05/02.md)). The reason is because Paul has already **passed judgment** on him, and so the Corinthians should be enacting the punishment. Use a word or phrase in your language that introduces a reason. Alternate translation: “He should be removed since” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
1CO	5	3	u5a2	figs-idiom	ἀπὼν τῷ σώματι	1		In Paul’s culture, **being absent in body** is a figurative way to speak about not being present in person. If **being absent in the body** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable expression or translate the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “not being there with you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1CO	5	3	xm4e		παρὼν…τῷ πνεύματι	1	I am present in spirit	In Paul’s culture, **being present in spirit** is a figurative way to speak of thinking about and caring about that person. If **being present in spirit** would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea with a comparable metaphor or non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “still being connected to you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1CO	5	3	gfep		τῷ πνεύματι	1		Here, **spirit** could refer to: (1) Paul’s **spirit**, which would be the part of him that connects with the Corinthians across a distance. Alternate translation: “in my spirit” (2) the Holy Spirit, which connects Paul with the Corinthians, even though they are not physically together. Alternate translation: “in God’s Spirit” or “by the power of God’s Spirit”
1CO	5	3	ax3u		ἤδη κέκρικα…τὸν οὕτως τοῦτο κατεργασάμενον	1	I have already passed judgment on the one who did this	Here, Paul has **already passed judgment**, which means that he has declared the man to be guilty. Two verses down ([5:4](../05/04.md)), Paul specifies what the punishment that results from the **judgment** should be: the man should be “handed over to Satan.” Here, then, use a word or phrase that indicates a decision about guilt, not a punishment. Alternate translation: “have already judged the one who did such a thing to be guilty”
1CO	5	3	sac6	figs-abstractnouns	ἤδη κέκρικα	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **judgment**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “judge” instead of **passed judgment on**. Alternate translation: “have already judged” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1CO	5	3	v4o9	figs-euphemism	τὸν οὕτως τοῦτο κατεργασάμενον	1		Paul does not wish to repeat the ugly details of the man having sex with his stepmother. Instead, Paul uses general words to refer back to what he has already said about the man. If possible, preserve how Paul avoids repeating the details of the sin in your translation. You could use vague language like Paul does, or you could use a similar euphemism. Alternate translation: “the man who committed this sin” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
1CO	5	3	g8b6	grammar-connect-condition-contrary	ὡς παρὼν	1		Here, Paul makes a conditional statement that might sound hypothetical but that he knows is not true. He knows that he is not present with them, but he wants to emphasize that his **judgment** is just as effective **as if** he were **present**. Use a natural form in your language for introducing a condition that the speaker believes is not true. Alternate translation: “even though I am absent” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-contrary]])
1CO	5	4	xc3z	grammar-connect-time-simultaneous	συναχθέντων ὑμῶν καὶ τοῦ ἐμοῦ πνεύματος	1		The phrase **You and my spirit, having been assembled** gives the time and situation in which the Corinthians should “hand this man over to Satan” ([5:5](../05/05.md)). If this phrase would not indicate timing or a situation in your language, you could use a word or phrase that does indicate time or situation. Alternate translation: “One of the times when you and my spirit have been assembled” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous]])
1CO	5	4	m9yz	figs-activepassive	συναχθέντων	1	When you are assembled	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form by using a verb such as “gather together” or “meet.” Alternate translation: “meeting together” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1CO	5	4	t83d	figs-idiom	ἐν τῷ ὀνόματι τοῦ Κυρίου ἡμῶν, Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	in the name of our Lord Jesus	Acting **in the name of** a person means representing that person. Representatives, those who do anything **in the name of** someone else, act with the authority of the people they represent. If **in the name of** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable idiom for representing someone or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “as representatives of our Lord Jesus Christ” or “as people who act for our Lord Jesus Christ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1CO	5	4	fznv	figs-infostructure	ἐν τῷ ὀνόματι τοῦ Κυρίου ἡμῶν, Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ, συναχθέντων ὑμῶν καὶ τοῦ ἐμοῦ πνεύματος,	1		The phrase **in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ** could modify: (1) how Paul has “passed judgment” in [5:3](../05/03.md). Alternate translation: “I passed this judgment in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. You and my spirit, having been assembled,” (2) how they have **been assembled**. See ULT. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
1CO	5	4	rhdc	figs-idiom	καὶ τοῦ ἐμοῦ πνεύματος	1		Just as in [5:3](../05/03.md), Paul speaks of his “spirit.” Just as there, Paul’s **spirit** being **assembled** with them is a figurative way to speak of how Paul thinks about and cares about them. Here, it has the additional implication that what they do when **assembled** carries Paul’s own authority. If **my spirit** would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea with a comparable metaphor or non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “and my thoughts” or “with my authority” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1CO	5	4	ku2d		τοῦ ἐμοῦ πνεύματος	1		Here, **my spirit** could refer to: (1) Paul’s **spirit**, which would be the part of him that connects with the Corinthians across a distance. Alternate translation: “my own spirit” (2) the Holy Spirit, which connects Paul with the Corinthians, even though they are not physically together. Alternate translation: “my share of God’s Spirit” or “I, by the power of God’s Spirit”
1CO	5	4	jz43	figs-abstractnouns	σὺν τῇ δυνάμει τοῦ Κυρίου ἡμῶν Ἰησοῦ	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **power**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “empower” or “authorize.” Alternate translation: “as people who are empowered by our Lord Jesus” or “as people whom our Lord Jesus has empowered” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1CO	5	5	pqbs	figs-infostructure	παραδοῦναι τὸν τοιοῦτον	1		**hand this man over** identifies the punishment that goes with the verdict that Paul reached when he “judged” him ([5:3](../05/03.md)). If possible, express **hand this man over** as the result or the implication of Paul having “already judged” him. Alternate translation: “since I have declared this man guilty, hand him over” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
1CO	5	5	xcf6	figs-metaphor	παραδοῦναι τὸν τοιοῦτον τῷ Σατανᾷ	1	hand this man over to Satan	The phrase **hand** someone **over to** someone else refers to transferring a person from one authority to another. Here, then, Paul wants the Corinthians to transfer **this man** from under the authority of the church to under the authority of **Satan**. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea with a comparable idiom or non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “turn this man over to Satan” or “put this man under Satan’s authority” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	5	5	xmig	grammar-connect-logic-result	εἰς ὄλεθρον τῆς σαρκός	1		Here, **for** introduces the result of “handing this man over to Satan.” If **for** would not indicate result in your language, use a word or phrase that does introduce a result. Alternate translation: “with the result that his flesh is destroyed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
1CO	5	5	nq4y	translate-unknown	εἰς ὄλεθρον τῆς σαρκός	1	for the destruction of the flesh	This phrase could be a reference to the **destruction** of: (1) the parts of the **man** that are weak and sinful, which would indicate cleansing or sanctification. Alternate translation: “so that he will not continue to live sinfully” (2) the man’s physical body, which would indicate either be physical suffering or death. Alternate translation: “so that he suffers in his body” or “for the death of his body” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	5	5	jg1u	figs-possession	ὄλεθρον τῆς σαρκός	1		Here, Paul uses the possessive form to clarify that **destruction** will happen to **the flesh**. If your language does not use this form to express that idea, you could translate **destruction** with a verb such as “destroy.” Alternate translation: “destroying the flesh” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
1CO	5	5	nqn8	figs-abstractnouns	εἰς ὄλεθρον τῆς σαρκός	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **destruction**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “destroy.” Alternate translation: “to destroy the flesh” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1CO	5	5	tit6	grammar-connect-logic-goal	ἵνα	1		While **for the destruction of the flesh** is the result of the “handing over,” the words **so that** introduce the purpose of the “handing over.” Use a word or phrase in your language that introduces a purpose. Alternate translation: “in order that” or “with the goal that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
1CO	5	5	z2cl	figs-activepassive	τὸ πνεῦμα σωθῇ	1	so that his spirit may be saved on the day of the Lord	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form with God as the subject. Alternate translation: “God may save his spirit” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1CO	5	5	eibc	translate-unknown	τὸ πνεῦμα	1		Here, **spirit** refers to the parts of **this man** that are not **flesh**. Therefore, the **spirit** is not just the non-physical part of the person but rather a reference to the whole person apart from his or her sins and weaknesses. If that meaning of **spirit** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to the salvation of the whole person. Alternate translation: “he” or “his soul” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	5	5	ny5b	figs-explicit	ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τοῦ Κυρίου	1		Here, Paul uses the words translated **day of the Lord** in the same way the Old Testament uses them: to refer to an event in which God saves his people and punishes his enemies. Paul specifically refers to the event in which Jesus returns to judge everyone. If that meaning of **day of the Lord** would be misunderstood in your language, you could include more words that clarify what Paul means by **day**. Alternate translation: “on the day when the Lord returns” or “when the Lord comes to judge everyone” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	5	6	h2hk		οὐ καλὸν τὸ καύχημα ὑμῶν	1	Your boasting is not good	Alternate translation: “Your boasting is bad”
1CO	5	6	mucf	figs-explicit	μικρὰ ζύμη, ὅλον τὸ φύραμα ζυμοῖ	1		In [5:6–8](../05/6.md), Paul speaks about **yeast** and “dough.” Verses 7–8 clarify that Paul is thinking about the “Passover.” In this Jewish festival, people would remove all the **yeast** from their houses and only bake dough that was not fermented (“unleavened bread”). See [Exodus 12:1–28](../exo/12/01.md). In this verse, then, the **yeast** does not represent a good thing. Rather, it is supposed to be removed from the house, but any **yeast** that is left will still “leaven” a whole loaf. If your language would not consider **yeast** to be a bad thing when mixed into dough, you could include a word or phrase that indicates that the **yeast** is not wanted in the dough. Alternate translation: “a little yeast leavens a whole loaf that is meant to be unleavened” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	5	6	n9w0	figs-rquestion	οὐκ οἴδατε ὅτι μικρὰ ζύμη, ὅλον τὸ φύραμα ζυμοῖ?	1		Paul does not ask this question because he is looking for information or for agreement or disagreement. Rather, he asks it to involve the Corinthians in what he is arguing by reminding them of something that they should already know. The question assumes that the answer is “yes.” If this question would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea with an emphatic statement. Alternate translation: “you know that a little yeast leavens the whole loaf” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
1CO	5	6	ng4m	figs-exmetaphor	μικρὰ ζύμη, ὅλον τὸ φύραμα ζυμοῖ	1	Do you not know that a little yeast leavens the whole loaf?	Here, the word translated **yeast** refers to anything that is added to bread dough to make it ferment and rise. This could be **yeast** itself or dough that is already fermented (“leaven”). Paul here uses this metaphor to indicate that, just like even a little bit of **yeast** will “leaven” **the whole loaf**, so a little bit of sin, or one person who sins, will affect the whole church. Therefore, the Corinthians believers should not “boast,” since the one person who is sinning among them denigrates the whole church. Since this metaphor is based on material from the Old Testament, you should try to preserve the form in your language. You could use a simile, or if necessary, you could use a comparable metaphor. Alternate translation: “sin is like yeast: a little yeast leavens the whole loaf” or “a bad apple spoils the whole barrel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])
1CO	5	7	b8fi	figs-explicit	ἐκκαθάρατε τὴν παλαιὰν ζύμην, ἵνα ἦτε νέον φύραμα, καθώς ἐστε ἄζυμοι. καὶ γὰρ τὸ Πάσχα ἡμῶν ἐτύθη, Χριστός	1		Just as in [5:6](../05/06.md) and [5:8](../05/08.md), Paul is thinking about the Jewish festival of **Passover**. During this festival, people would remove all the **yeast** from their houses and only bake **unleavened bread**, that is, bread that is not fermented. Additionally, a **lamb** would be sacrificed and eaten. The **lamb** would remind the people about how God had delivered them from slavery in the land of Egypt. See [Exodus 12:1–28](../exo/12/01.md). If your readers would not infer this information, you could include a footnote that explains **Passover** and how it relates to **yeast** and a **Lamb**. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	5	7	mpra	figs-exmetaphor	ἐκκαθάρατε τὴν παλαιὰν ζύμην, ἵνα ἦτε νέον φύραμα, καθώς ἐστε ἄζυμοι	1		Here, Paul speaks about Jews would **clean out the old yeast** during the festival of Passover and only bake with **unleavened bread**. Just like in [5:6](../05/06.md), he compares sin to **yeast**. By speaking in this way, he urges the Corinthians to **clean out** the person who is sinning. Then, they will be like **new dough**, like **unleavened bread**, that is, without sin. Since this metaphor is based on material from the Old Testament, you should try to preserve the form in your language. You could use a simile, or if necessary, you could use a comparable metaphor. Alternate translation: “Clean out the old yeast, that is, sin, so that you may be new dough, just as you are unleavened bread” or “Clean out the bad apple so that you may be a fresh barrel, just as you are fresh apples” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])
1CO	5	7	z7vq	translate-unknown	καθώς ἐστε ἄζυμοι	1		When Paul says that they **are unleavened bread**, this means that they are danger of encountering the **yeast**, that is, sin. This is why they must **clean out the old yeast**. If they remain **unleavened** by avoiding contact with **old yeast**, they will be **new dough**. If **you are unleavened bread** would be misunderstood in your language, you could clarify that Paul calls them this because it shows that **yeast** is a threat to them. Alternate translation: “for you are currently unleavened bread” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	5	7	x3pt	grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1		Here, Paul introduces the reason why his metaphor about **yeast** is appropriate. **Christ** is like the **Passover lamb**. Since Christ has **been sacrificed** like that **lamb**, the Corinthians are supposed to live as if it is **Passover**. This means avoiding sin in their group. If this connection would be misunderstood in your language, you could make it more explicit. Alternate translation: “You should act like people observing Passover because” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
1CO	5	7	ret3	figs-explicit	καὶ…τὸ Πάσχα ἡμῶν ἐτύθη, Χριστός	1	Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed	When God delivered the Jewish people from Egypt, he required them to sacrifice a lamb and spread its blood on their doors. God did not harm anyone who had the blood on their door, but the firstborn son of anyone who did not have the blood on their door died. Because of this, the **lamb** that was sacrificed at **Passover** represented God delivering the Jewish people by accepting the **lamb**’s death in place of the firstborn son. See [Exodus 12:1–28](../exo/12/01.md). The implication here is that **Christ**’s death also functioned in this way, in place of those whom he delivers. If this implication would be misunderstood by your readers, you could add a footnote explaining the function of the **lamb** at **Passover**. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	5	7	qhrz	figs-exmetaphor	καὶ…τὸ Πάσχα ἡμῶν ἐτύθη, Χριστός	1		Here, Paul compares **Christ** to the **Passover lamb**, since both died to save someone else. Since this metaphor is based on material from the Old Testament, you should try to preserve the form in your language, or you could use a simile. Alternate translation: “Christ, who is like our Passover lamb, has also been sacrificed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])
1CO	5	7	yzjl	figs-activepassive	καὶ…τὸ Πάσχα ἡμῶν ἐτύθη, Χριστός	1		Paul intentionally does not state who **sacrificed** the **Passover lamb**, who is **Christ**. If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in another way. If possible, do not state who **sacrificed** **Christ**. Alternate translation: “Christ, our Passover lamb, has also died as a sacrifice” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1CO	5	8	ouhj	figs-explicit	ὥστε ἑορτάζωμεν, μὴ ἐν ζύμῃ παλαιᾷ, μηδὲ ἐν ζύμῃ κακίας καὶ πονηρίας, ἀλλ’ ἐν ἀζύμοις εἰλικρινείας καὶ ἀληθείας.	1		Just as in [5:6–7](../05/6.md), here Paul speaks about **yeast** and “dough.” In this Jewish **festival** of Passover, people would remove all the **yeast** from their houses and only bake dough that was not fermented (**unleavened bread**). See [Exodus 12:1–28](../exo/12/01.md). Here, then, the **yeast** is what is meant to be removed, and the **unleavened bread** is what is meant to be eaten. If your readers would not understand this background, you could include a footnote that gives extra information. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	5	8	donb	figs-exmetaphor	ὥστε ἑορτάζωμεν, μὴ ἐν ζύμῃ παλαιᾷ, μηδὲ ἐν ζύμῃ κακίας καὶ πονηρίας, ἀλλ’ ἐν ἀζύμοις εἰλικρινείας καὶ ἀληθείας.	1		Here, Paul finishes the metaphor about **yeast** and Passover that he began in [5:6](../06/06.md). Paul encourages the Corinthians to **celebrate the festival** by getting rid of the **old yeast**. He then identifies that the **yeast** stands for **evil and wickedness**, while the **unleavened bread** that they are supposed to eat stands for **sincerity and truth**. With this metaphor Paul exhorts the Corinthians to expel the man who has sinned from their group, just as one would remove yeast from one’s house during the **festival**. Since this metaphor is based on material from the Old Testament, you should try to preserve the form in your language. You could use a simile, or you could include a footnote that explains the metaphor. Alternate translation: “So then, we should be like those who celebrate the festival, not with old yeast, nor with yeast of evil and wickedness, but with unleavened bread of sincerity and truth” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])
1CO	5	8	hoew	figs-explicit	ἑορτάζωμεν	1		Because of what Paul has said in [5:7](../05/7.md), this **festival** must be the festival connected with Passover. If your readers would not understand this from the context, you could include the name “Passover” here. Alternate translation: “we might celebrate the Passover festival” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	5	8	ph92	figs-doublet	μὴ ἐν ζύμῃ παλαιᾷ, μηδὲ ἐν ζύμῃ κακίας καὶ πονηρίας	1		Here, Paul repeats **yeast** in order to define what he means by **old yeast**. If your language does not use repetition in this way, you could combine the two phrases and introduce the definition in another way. Alternate translation: “not with old yeast, which is evil and wickedness” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
1CO	5	8	xvx4	figs-possession	ζύμῃ κακίας καὶ πονηρίας	1		Here, Paul uses the possessive from to identify the **yeast** as **evil and wickedness**. If your language does not use this form for that idea, you could express the idea by using a word or phrase that renames or identifies something. Alternate translation: “yeast, that is, evil and wickedness” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
1CO	5	8	fo1r	figs-abstractnouns	κακίας καὶ πονηρίας	1		If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **evil** and **wickedness**, you could express the ideas by using adjectives that describe actions or “behavior.” Alternate translation: “of evil and wicked behavior” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1CO	5	8	ymus	figs-doublet	κακίας καὶ πονηρίας	1		Here, the words **evil** and **wickedness** mean almost the same thing. The word **evil** refers to something that is morally “bad,” while the word **wickedness** refers to something that is characterized by “vice.” If your language does not have two words that are this similar, you could express the idea with one word. Alternate translation: “of evil” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
1CO	5	8	viwj	figs-possession	ἀζύμοις εἰλικρινείας καὶ ἀληθείας	1		Here, Paul uses the possessive from to identify the **unleavened bread** as **sincerity and truth**. If your language does not use this form for that idea, you could express the idea by using a word or phrase that renames or identifies something. Alternate translation: “unleavened bread, that is, sincerity and truth” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
1CO	5	8	olbn	figs-abstractnouns	εἰλικρινείας καὶ ἀληθείας	1		If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **sincerity** and **truth**, you could express the ideas by using adjectives that describe actions or “behavior.” Alternate translation: “of sincere and true behavior” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1CO	5	8	mybu	translate-unknown	εἰλικρινείας	1		The word **sincerity** identifies people who act with only one intention or goal. They do not say or pretend one thing while doing something else. If this word would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea by using a word or phrase that identifies someone who acts honestly and with one goal in mind. Alternate translation: “of integrity” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	5	9	mcrl	figs-explicit	ἔγραψα ὑμῖν ἐν τῇ ἐπιστολῇ	1		Here, Paul refers to a letter that he wrote and sent to the Corinthians before he began this letter. The phrase does not refer to this letter but to a previous letter. If **I wrote to you in my letter** would be misunderstood by your readers, you could include a word that clarifies that **the letter** is one that Paul has already sent. Alternate translation: “I already wrote to you in my previous letter” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	5	9	le8i	translate-unknown	συναναμίγνυσθαι	1		The word translated **to associate with** often refers to two groups of people meeting together. The idea here is that **sexually immoral people** should not be a part of the Corinthians’ group. If **to associate with** does not have this meaning in your language, you could express the idea by using a word that refers to including people in one’s group. Alternate translation: “to consistently meet with” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	5	10	vkid	grammar-connect-words-phrases	οὐ πάντως	1		Paul uses the words translated **by no means** to introduce a clarification about what he wrote to them previously ([5:9](../05/09.md)). When he told “not to associate with sexually immoral people,” he did not mean **people of this world**. Rather, as the next verse clarifies, he meant fellow believers. If **by no means** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a qualification to a previous statement. Alternate translation: “not that you should not associate at all with” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
1CO	5	10	pgwb	translate-unknown	τοῦ κόσμου τούτου	1		The phrase **of this world** clarifies that the **immoral people** are not part of the church. If this phrase would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable phrase that identifies the **immoral people** as unbelievers. Alternate translation: “who do not believe” or “who are not part of the church” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	5	10	grud	figs-nominaladj	τοῖς πλεονέκταις	1		Paul is using the adjective **greedy** as a noun in order to describe a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this with a noun phrase. Alternate translation: “greedy people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
1CO	5	10	taf5	translate-unknown	ἅρπαξιν	1	the greedy	Here, **swindlers** identifies people who take money from others dishonestly. If **swindlers** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word that refers to such people. Alternate translation: “thieves” or “embezzlers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	5	10	m59j	grammar-connect-condition-contrary	ἐπεὶ ὠφείλετε ἄρα ἐκ τοῦ κόσμου ἐξελθεῖν	1	you would need to go out of the world	Here, Paul draws the logical conclusion from what he did not mean in his letter. Thus, while Paul does not think that the basis for the exhortation is true, he does think that this is the logical result of that basis. He gives this exhortation to show that it is absurd, since they cannot **go out from the world**. Therefore, the basis for this exhortation is also absurd. If **since then** in your language would not introduce a result from a reason that Paul thinks is not true, you could use a word or phrase that would introduce such an idea. Alternate translation: “If that were what I had meant, then you would need to go out from the world” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-contrary]])
1CO	5	10	egcx	translate-unknown	ἐκ τοῦ κόσμου ἐξελθεῖν	1		This phrase is not a euphemism for dying. Instead, Paul is saying that the Corinthians would need to travel off earth to get away from the **immoral people of this world**. In his culture and time, this was impossible. If **go out from the world** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to traveling off earth. Alternate translation: “to leave earth” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	5	11	nys9		νῦν δὲ ἔγραψα ὑμῖν	1		Here, Paul speaks about: (1) the letter he is writing **now**, in contrast to the letter he already wrote ([5:9](../05/09.md)). He uses the past tense **wrote** because the “writing” will be in the past when the letter is read to the Corinthians. Use the tense that would be appropriate in your language for this situation. Alternate translation: “But now I have written to you” (2) the letter he already wrote, but he wants them to understand it correctly **now**. Alternate translation: “But what I really wrote to you was”
1CO	5	11	mi6t	translate-unknown	συναναμίγνυσθαι	1		The word translated **to associate with** often refers to two groups of people meeting together. The idea here is that **sexually immoral** people who claim to belong to the Corinthians’ group should not be considered part of the group. If **to associate with** does not have this meaning in your language, you could express the idea by using a word that refers to including people in one’s group. Alternate translation: “to consistently meet with” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	5	11	cyrp	figs-distinguish	ἐάν τις ἀδελφὸς ὀνομαζόμενος	1		Here, **who is called a brother** distinguishes **anyone** from the people mentioned in the last verse. Paul did not require the Corinthians **not to associate** with those people, but he does require them **not to associate** with any person **who is called a brother**. Use a construction in your language that indicates that Paul is distinguishing, not informing. Alternate translation: “any person called a brother” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish]])
1CO	5	11	w9w8	figs-activepassive	ὀνομαζόμενος	1	anyone who is called	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form with “you” or “the brother” as the subject. Alternate translation: “who calls himself” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1CO	5	11	b4us	figs-gendernotations	ἀδελφὸς	1	brother	Although the word translated **brother** is masculine, Paul is using it to refer to a man or a woman. If **brother** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a non-gendered word or refer to both genders. Alternate translation: “a brother or a sister” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
1CO	5	11	xob7	translate-unknown	λοίδορος	1		Here, **verbally abusive** describes someone who shows anger by using vicious words to attack others. Use a word in your language that describes this kind of person. Alternate translation: “vocally vicious” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	5	11	ypib	translate-unknown	ἅρπαξ	1		Here, **swindler** identifies a person who takes money from others dishonestly. If **swindler** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word that refers to such people. Alternate translation: “a thief” or “an embezzler” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	5	11	fq7j	figs-explicit	τῷ τοιούτῳ μηδὲ συνεσθίειν	1		In Paul’s culture, to **eat with** someone meant that you accepted them into your social group. Here, he wants the Corinthians not to accept such people into their group. If “eating with” someone does not signify accepting them in your culture, you may need to make that idea explicit. Alternate translation: “Do not even include such a person in your group’s meals” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	5	12	kj1x	grammar-connect-logic-result	γάρ	1		Here, **For** introduces further reasons why Paul wants the Corinthians to focus on “judging” fellow believers but not **those outside**. These reasons continue into the next verse ([5:13](../05/13.md)). If this connection would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word or phrase that would introduce further reasons. Alternate translation: “Further,” or “For more proof,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
1CO	5	12	xeu7	figs-rquestion	τί…μοι τοὺς ἔξω κρίνειν?	1	how am I involved with judging those who are outside the church?	Here, Paul asks **what to me to judge those outside**, but he is not really asking for information. Rather, the question assumes that the answer is “nothing” or “it does not matter to me,” and Paul uses the question to involve the Corinthians in what he is arguing. If this question would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea with a strong negative statement. Alternate translation: “it is nothing to me to judge those outside” or “it is not my business to judge those outside” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
1CO	5	12	jmxt	figs-ellipsis	τί…μοι	1		Here, Paul omits some words that may be required in your language to make a full sentence. You could supply words such as “is it” or “does it matter” to complete the thought. Alternate translation: “what is it to me” or “what does it matter to me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
1CO	5	12	n6on	figs-123person	μοι	1		Here, Paul speaks of himself only, but he wants the Corinthians to have the same opinion that he has. If **to me** would cause your readers to misunderstand this point, you could include the Corinthians in this question as well. Alternate translation: “to us” or “to you and me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
1CO	5	12	ncl1	figs-idiom	τοὺς ἔξω…τοὺς ἔσω	1		The phrase **those outside** identifies people who do not belong to the group of believers in Corinth. The phrase **those inside** identifies the opposite: people who do belong to the group of believers in Corinth. If these phrases would be misunderstood in your language, you could use words or phrases that refer to people who belong to and do not belong to a specific group. Alternate translation: “the outsiders … the insiders” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1CO	5	12	m4s6	figs-rquestion	οὐχὶ τοὺς ἔσω ὑμεῖς κρίνετε?	1	Are you not to judge those inside?	Paul does not ask this question because he is looking for information. Rather, he asks it to involve the Corinthians in what he is arguing. The question assumes that the answer is “yes.” If this question would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea with a strong affirmation or statement of obligation. Alternate translation: “But you should judge those inside” or “You do indeed judge those inside” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
1CO	5	13	hvo1	figs-pastforfuture	κρίνει	1		Here, the word translated **judges** makes a general statement about what God does. The present tense does not mean that God is currently passing final judgment on **those outside** and will not do so in the future. Rather, Paul has the final judgment in mind. If the present tense of **judges** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use the future tense here. Alternate translation: “will judge” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture]])
1CO	5	13	z45o	figs-idiom	τοὺς…ἔξω	1		The phrase **those outside** identifies people who do not belong to the group of believers in Corinth. If this phrase would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refer to people who do not belong to a specific group. Alternate translation: “the outsiders” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1CO	5	13	kx9j	writing-quotations	ἐξάρατε τὸν πονηρὸν ἐξ ὑμῶν αὐτῶν	1		Here, Paul quotes a command from the Old Testament book named Deuteronomy. If your readers would not recognize this command as a quotation, you could introduce it in the same way that you have already introduced quotations from the Old Testament (see [1:31](../01/31.md)). Alternate translation: “As it can be read in the Old Testament, ‘Remove the evil from among yourselves’” or “According to the book of Deuteronomy, ‘Remove the evil from among yourselves’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
1CO	5	13	al7v	figs-quotations	ἐξάρατε τὸν πονηρὸν ἐξ ὑμῶν αὐτῶν	1		If you cannot use this form in your language, you could translate this command as an indirect quote instead of as a direct quote. Alternate translation: “The scripture says that you should remove the evil from among yourselves” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
1CO	5	13	h6ry	figs-nominaladj	τὸν πονηρὸν	1		Paul is using the adjective **evil** as a noun in order to describe a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this with a noun phrase. Alternate translation: “people who are evil” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
1CO	6	intro	s6hb			0		# 1 Corinthians 6 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and Formatting<br><br>3. Against sexual immorality (4:16–6:20)<br>      * Against public lawsuits (6:1–8)<br>      * Sins and salvation (6:9–11)<br>      * Flee from sexual immorality (6:12–20)<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Lawsuits<br><br>In [6:1–8](../06/01.md), Paul speaks about believers taking other believers to court in lawsuits. Paul critiques them for taking their disputes before unbelievers rather than settling them within the church. By the end of the section, Paul says that lawsuits themselves are a “complete defeat” of believers. Paul’s point is that believers will judge angels and the world, so they are quite able to resolve disputes within the church. Therefore, believers should never take other believers to court. In this section, use words and language that describe legal matters in your language. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/judge]])<br><br>### Sexual immorality<br><br>In [6:12–20](../06/12.md), Paul discusses “sexual immorality.” This phrase refers generally to any kind of improper sexual activity, and Paul does speak generally in this section. He mentions particularly having sex with prostitutes, but the commands he gives apply to all kinds of sexual activity. The Corinthians seemed to think that they could do whatever they wanted with their bodies, including having sex with anyone. Paul responds that their bodies are united to Christ, and any sexual activity they participate in needs to fit with their union with Christ. Use general words for improper sexual activity in this section. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/fornication]])<br><br>### Redemption<br><br>In [6:20](../06/20.md), Paul tells the Corinthians that they have been “bought with a price.” He does not state what the price is or whom God bought the Corinthians from. However, it is clear that Paul is speaking about what we call “redemption” here. Paul thinks of the Corinthians as slaves up for sale, and God buys them from their previous owner by paying a price. The previous owner can be understood as sin, death, and evil powers, while the price is Jesus the Son dying for believers. You should not include all these implications in your translation, but you should use words that can be interpreted in this way. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/redeem]])<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### “Members” of Christ or of a prostitute<br><br>In [6:15–17](../06/15.md), Paul speaks of a person’s connection to Christ and to a prostitute with the language of “members” and “joining.” When he refers to “members,” he is speaking as if the believer were either a body part of Christ or a body part of a prostitute. He shows how bad it is to be “joined” with a prostitute by speaking as if someone cut a body part off of Christ and attached it to a prostitute instead. That is how closely a person is joined either to Christ or to a prostitute. If possible, preserve the body parts language here. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/member]])<br><br>### Body as temple<br><br>In [6:19](../06/19.md), Paul speaks as if believers’s bodies were temples of the Holy Spirit. Sometimes he speaks as if the church as a whole is a temple, but here he means that individual believers are all temples. A temple is where a god is specially present, so Paul means that the Holy Spirit is specially present in believers’s bodies. If possible, preserve this metaphor since it connects to themes throughout the whole Bible. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])<br><br>### Rhetorical questions<br><br>In [6:1–7](../06/01.md), [9](../06/09.md), [15–16](../06/15.md), [19](../06/19.md), Paul uses rhetorical questions. He is not asking these questions because he wants the Corinthians to provide him with information. Rather, he is asking these questions because he wants the Corinthians to think about how they are acting and what they are thinking. The questions encourage them to think along with Paul. For ways to translate these questions, look for the notes on each verse that includes these kinds of questions. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])<br><br>## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter<br><br>### Words for homosexual behavior<br><br>In [6:9](../06/09.md), Paul refers to “male prostitutes” and “those who practice homosexuality.” In Paul’s culture, these words refer to both participants in homosexual activity. The words “male prostitutes” refers to those who are penetrated during sexual activity, while “those who practice homosexuality” refer to those who do the penetrating during sexual activity. If your culture has specific words to describe these things, you can use them here. If your culture does not have such specific words, you can use general phrases like the ULT does, or you could combine the two phrases into one phrase that identifies homosexual activity. <br><br>### Quoting the Corinthians<br><br>In [6:12–13](../06/12.md), Paul quotes words that the Corinthians have said or that they wrote to him. The ULT indicates these words by putting quotation marks around them. Use a natural way in your language to indicate that an author is quoting someone else. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])<br>
1CO	6	1	gmy5	figs-rquestion	τολμᾷ τις ὑμῶν, πρᾶγμα ἔχων πρὸς τὸν ἕτερον, κρίνεσθαι ἐπὶ τῶν ἀδίκων, καὶ οὐχὶ ἐπὶ τῶν ἁγίων?	1	does he dare to go … saints?	Paul does not ask this question because he is looking for information. Rather, he asks it to involve the Corinthians in what he is arguing. Here, the answer to the question is “they are, but they should not.” Paul asks to question to get the Corinthians to realize how bad going **to court before the unrighteous** is. If this question would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea with a “should” statement or a statement of fact. Alternate translation: “Some of you actually dare, having a dispute with another, to go to court before the unrighteous, and not before the saints.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
1CO	6	1	q5d3	translate-unknown	τολμᾷ	1	dispute	The word translated **Do … dare** refers to having confidence or boldness when one should not have confidence or boldness. Use a word or phrase in your language that indicates improper confidence. Alternate translation: “Do … have the audacity” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	6	1	qi57	grammar-connect-time-simultaneous	πρᾶγμα ἔχων πρὸς τὸν ἕτερον	1		The phrase **having a dispute with another** provides the situation in which they are going **to court**. If this connection would be misunderstood in your language, you could make it explicit. Alternate translation: “if you have a dispute with another” or “whenever you have a dispute with another” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous]])
1CO	6	1	jsgt	figs-explicit	τὸν ἕτερον	1		Here, **another** identifies the other person as a fellow believer. If this would be misunderstood in your language you could add a word or phrase that identifies **another** as a believer. Alternate translation: “another believer” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	6	1	umgg	figs-idiom	κρίνεσθαι ἐπὶ…ἐπὶ	1		The phrase **to go to court before** refers to settling a lawsuit or other legal dispute **before** a judge. If **go to court before** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable idiom that refers to setting a dispute in a court of law. Alternate translation: “to resolve your lawsuit in the presence of … in the presence of” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1CO	6	2	r8sj	grammar-connect-words-phrases	ἢ	1		The word **Or** introduces an alternate to what Paul speaks about in [6:1](../06/01.md). They currently think that going to court in public is fine. Paul gives the true alternative: they **will judge the world** and thus should not need to take their quarrels and lawsuits anywhere else. If **Or** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word that signifies a contrast or gives an alternative. Alternate translation: “Rather,” or “On the other hand,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
1CO	6	2	i1m5	figs-rquestion	ἢ οὐκ οἴδατε ὅτι οἱ ἅγιοι τὸν κόσμον κρινοῦσιν?	1	Or do you not know that the believers will judge the world?	Paul does not ask this question because he is looking for information. Rather, he asks it to involve the Corinthians in what he is arguing. The question assumes that the answer is “yes.” If this question would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea with a strong affirmation. Alternate translation: “You already know that the saints will judge the world.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
1CO	6	2	i67f	figs-rquestion	ἀνάξιοί ἐστε κριτηρίων ἐλαχίστων?	1	If then, you will judge the world, are you not able to settle matters of little importance?	Paul does not ask this question because he is looking for information. Rather, he asks it to involve the Corinthians in what he is arguing. The question assumes that the answer is “no.” If this question would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea with a strong negative or positive statement. Alternate translation: “you are definitely not unworthy of the smallest cases” or “you are definitely worthy of the smallest cases (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
1CO	6	2	py6h	grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἰ ἐν ὑμῖν κρίνεται ὁ κόσμος	1		Paul is speaking as if **the world is judged by you** were a hypothetical possibility, but he means that it is actually true. If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, and if your readers might misunderstand and think that what Paul is saying is not certain, then you can translate his words as an affirmative statement. Alternate translation: “because the world is judged by you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
1CO	6	2	yq8e	figs-activepassive	ἐν ὑμῖν κρίνεται ὁ κόσμος	1		If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form. Alternate translation: “you judge the world” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1CO	6	2	jqvf	figs-pastforfuture	κρίνεται	1		Here, the word translated **is judged** makes a general statement about what **you**, that is, the **saints**, do. The present tense does not mean that the **saints** are currently passing final judgment will not do so in the future. Rather, Paul uses the present tense to state a general fact about the **saints**. The judgment itself will occur in the future. If the present tense of **is judged** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use the future tense here. Alternate translation: “will be judged” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture]])
1CO	6	2	stvc	figs-idiom	ἀνάξιοί…κριτηρίων ἐλαχίστων	1		Here, to be **unworthy of** something means that one is not capable of doing that thing or is not qualified to do it. If **unworthy of** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable idiom or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “unqualified concerning the smallest cases” “not able to judge the smallest cases” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1CO	6	2	dmi6	translate-unknown	κριτηρίων ἐλαχίστων	1		The word translated **cases** could refer to: (1) legal disputes that are resolved in a court of law. Alternate translation: “of the smallest legal disputes” (2) the court of law that decides the legal dispute. Alternate translation: “of the lowest courts of law” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	6	3	us55	figs-rquestion	οὐκ οἴδατε ὅτι ἀγγέλους κρινοῦμεν,	1	Do you not know that we will judge the angels?	Paul does not ask this question because he is looking for information. Rather, he asks it to involve the Corinthians in what he is arguing. The question assumes that the answer is “yes.” If this question would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea as an emphatic statement. Alternate translation: “Surely you know that we will judge angels.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
1CO	6	3	x6h3	figs-rquestion	μήτι γε βιωτικά?	1	How much more, then, can we judge matters of this life?	Paul does not ask this question because he is looking for information. Rather, he asks it to involve the Corinthians in what he is arguing. The question assumes that the reader agrees. If this question would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea as an emphatic statement. Alternate translation: “How much more the matters of this life!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
1CO	6	3	hxzn	figs-ellipsis	μήτι γε βιωτικά	1		Here, Paul omits some words that may be required in your language to make a full sentence. You could supply words such as “can we judge” or “are we able to judge” to complete the thought. Alternate translation: “How much more can we judge the matters of this life” or “How much more are we able to judge the matters of this life” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
1CO	6	3	h3z0	grammar-connect-logic-result	μήτι γε	1		Here, Paul’s argument assumes that judging **angels** is a greater and more difficult thing than judging **the matters of this life**. The phrase **How much more** implies that people who can do a great and difficult thing like judging **angels** can easily do a less impressive and easier thing like judging **the matters of this life**. If **How much more** does not express that connection in your language, you could use a word or phrase that does express that connection. Alternate translation: “If we can do that, can we not judge” or “Should it not be easy, then, to judge” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
1CO	6	3	h374	translate-unknown	βιωτικά	1	matters of this life	Here, the word translated **the matters of this life** refers to anything that is a part of people’s ordinary or daily lives. Paul uses the word to identify the lawsuits among the Corinthians as simply matters of ordinary life and insignificant in comparison with something like judging **angels**. If **the matters of this life** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to features of daily or regular life. Alternate translation: “what happens in our daily lives” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	6	4	xn32	grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical	βιωτικὰ…κριτήρια ἐὰν ἔχητε	1	If then you have to make judgments that pertain to daily life	Here, Paul uses **if** to introduce a true possibility. He means that they might **have legal disputes**, or they might not **have legal disputes**. He then specifies the result for if they do **have legal disputes**. If this form would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the **if** statement by introducing it with a word such as “whenever” or “when.” Alternate translation: “when you have legal disputes about things of this life” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical]])
1CO	6	4	v80t	translate-unknown	κριτήρια…ἔχητε	1		The word translated cases could refer to: (1) legal disputes that are resolved in a court of law.

1CO	6	4	vw5t	figs-rquestion	τοὺς ἐξουθενημένους ἐν τῇ ἐκκλησίᾳ, τούτους καθίζετε?	1	If then you have to make judgments that pertain to daily life, why do you lay such cases as these before those who have no standing in the church?	Paul does not ask this question because he is looking for information. Rather, he asks it to involve the Corinthians in what he is arguing. The question assumes that the answer is “there is no good reason.” If this question would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea as an emphatic statement or a command. Alternate translation: “do not appoint as judges those who are of no account in the church!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
1CO	6	4	e791	translate-unknown	τοὺς ἐξουθενημένους ἐν τῇ ἐκκλησίᾳ	1	why do you lay such cases as these before those who have no standing in the church?	Here, those **who are of no account in the church** could be: (1) people who are not members of the church in Corinth. Alternate translation: “who do not believe” (2) people who are members of the church in Corinth but whom other believers do not respect. Alternate translation: “whom the fellow believers do not respect” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	6	5	dvq3	writing-pronouns	λέγω	1		The phrase **I say this** could refer: (1) to what Paul has already said, probably all of [6:1–4](../06/01.md). Alternate translation: “I say those things” (2) to what Paul is saying throughout this whole section ([6:1–8](../06/01.md)).

1CO	6	5	xnd7	figs-idiom	πρὸς ἐντροπὴν ὑμῖν	1		Here, **to your shame** means that the things that Paul has said should make the Corinthians feel **shame**. If **to your shame** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable idiom or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “to embarrass you” or “to make you feel ashamed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1CO	6	5	ebh6	figs-abstractnouns	πρὸς ἐντροπὴν ὑμῖν λέγω	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **shame**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “shame.” Alternate translation: “to shame you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1CO	6	5	hk4q	figs-idiom	οὕτως οὐκ ἔνι…οὐδεὶς σοφὸς	1		The phrase **{Is it} thus {that} there is not any wise man** identifies a situation in which no **wise man** can be found. If this phrase would be confusing or misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable expression that identifies a situation in which there are no wise people. Alternate translation: “Is there not a man wise man” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1CO	6	5	fue4	figs-rquestion	οὕτως οὐκ ἔνι ἐν ὑμῖν οὐδεὶς σοφὸς, ὃς δυνήσεται διακρῖναι ἀνὰ μέσον τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ αὐτοῦ?	1	Is there no one among you wise enough to settle a dispute between brothers?	Paul does not ask this question because he is looking for information. Rather, he asks it to involve the Corinthians in what he is arguing, specifically by making them feel ashamed. The question assumes that the answer is “there should be.” If this question would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea with a “should” statement or introduce a statement with “surely.” Alternate translation: “You should have a wise man among you who will be able to discern between his brothers.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
1CO	6	5	xma9	figs-gendernotations	οὐκ ἔνι…σοφὸς…αὐτοῦ	1		Although the words translated **wise man** and **his** are masculine, Paul is using them to refer to anyone, whether man or woman. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a non-gendered word or refer to both genders. Alternate translation: “there are not any wise people … their” or “there is not any wise man or woman … his or her” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
1CO	6	5	l1hd	figs-gendernotations	τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ	1	brothers	Although the word translated **brothers** is masculine, Paul is using it to refer to anyone, whether man or woman. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a non-gendered word or refer to both genders. Alternate translation: “brothers and sisters” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
1CO	6	5	o28z	translate-unknown	διακρῖναι ἀνὰ μέσον	1		The phrase **to discern between** refers to making decisions about disputes between people. If this phrase would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea with a word or phrase that refers to deciding which party is in the right in a dispute. Alternate translation: “to judge between” or “to settle disputes between” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	6	6	m7ls	figs-rquestion	ἀδελφὸς μετὰ ἀδελφοῦ κρίνεται, καὶ τοῦτο ἐπὶ ἀπίστων?	1	But brother goes to court against brother, and this before unbelievers!	Paul does not ask this question because he is looking for information. Rather, he asks it to involve the Corinthians in what he is arguing. The question assumes that there is verbal answer. Rather, the question is supposed to make the Corinthians answer by feeling ashamed. If this question would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea with statement that expresses shock or condemnation. Alternate translation: “brother really goes to court against brother, and this before unbelievers!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
1CO	6	6	fyq8	figs-gendernotations	ἀδελφὸς…ἀδελφοῦ	1		Although the words translated **brother** are masculine, Paul is using these words to refer to any believer, whether man or woman. If **brother** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use non-gendered words or refer to both genders. Alternate translation: “a brother or sister … a brother or sister” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
1CO	6	6	dv5g	figs-ellipsis	καὶ τοῦτο ἐπὶ ἀπίστων	1		In this clause, Paul has omitted some words that might be necessary to make a complete thought in your language. If this sentence would be misunderstood in your language, you could include what action is happening. Alternate translation: “and they do this before unbelievers” or “and they go to court before unbelievers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
1CO	6	7	kvva	figs-infostructure	ἤδη μὲν οὖν ὅλως ἥττημα ὑμῖν ἐστιν, ὅτι κρίματα ἔχετε μεθ’ ἑαυτῶν	1		Here, Paul gives the reason for the **defeat** after he mentions the **defeat**. If your language would state the reason first, you could reverse the order of these clauses. Alternate translation: “Therefore, since you have lawsuits among yourselves, this is indeed already a complete defeat for you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
1CO	6	7	topu		ἤδη…ὅλως ἥττημα ὑμῖν	1		Here, **already** refers to how the Corinthians do not suffer **defeat** in the court of law but rather before that, when the dispute begins. If **already** would be misunderstood in your language, you could clarify that the time in view is before the legal dispute is decided. Alternate translation: “a complete defeat for you even before you enter the court of law”
1CO	6	7	ugf7		ἤδη μὲν οὖν ὅλως ἥττημα ὑμῖν ἐστιν	1		Alternate translation: “Therefore, you are indeed already completely defeated”
1CO	6	7	lvc1	figs-metaphor	ὅλως ἥττημα	1		Here, **complete defeat** refers to total failure in attempting to accomplish some goal. The **defeat** does not require an opponent, since one can suffer **defeat** because of other obstacles. If **complete defeat** would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea with a comparable metaphor or non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “a total derailing” or “a total failure” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	6	7	tn9m	figs-rquestion	διὰ τί οὐχὶ μᾶλλον ἀδικεῖσθε? διὰ τί οὐχὶ μᾶλλον ἀποστερεῖσθε?	1	Why not rather suffer the wrong? Why not rather allow yourselves to be cheated?	Paul does not ask these questions because he is looking for information. Rather, he asks them to involve the Corinthians in what he is arguing. The questions assume that the reader agrees that it would be better to **be wronged** and **cheated**. If these questions would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the ideas as emphatic comparisons. Alternate translation: “It would be better to be wronged! It would be better to be cheated!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
1CO	6	7	ruiy	figs-doublet	διὰ τί οὐχὶ μᾶλλον ἀδικεῖσθε? διὰ τί οὐχὶ μᾶλλον ἀποστερεῖσθε?	1		Here, Paul repeats his first question with almost exactly the same words. He does this to emphasize the point he is making. If this repetition would be misunderstood in your language, you could combine the questions and express the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “Why not rather be wronged or cheated?” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
1CO	6	7	i5n5	figs-activepassive	ἀδικεῖσθε	1		If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form with a “fellow believer” as the subject. Alternate translation: “let a fellow believer wrong you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1CO	6	7	vpy9	figs-activepassive	ἀποστερεῖσθε	1		If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form with a “fellow believer” as the subject. Alternate translation: “let a fellow believer cheat you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1CO	6	8	yfos	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	ἀλλὰ	1		Here, **But** introduces a contrast with what Paul wants them to do, which is to “be wronged” and “cheated” rather than take a fellow believer to court. Here, Paul says that they do the exact opposite. Rather than “be wronged” and “cheated,” they actually **wrong** and **cheat** fellow believers. If this connection would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea with a phrase that clarifies what Paul is contrasting. Alternate translation: “But instead of being wronged and cheated,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
1CO	6	8	ixb9	figs-ellipsis	καὶ τοῦτο ἀδελφούς	1		In this clause, Paul has omitted some words that might be necessary to make a complete thought in your language. If this phrase would be misunderstood in your language, you could include what action is happening. Alternate translation: “and you do this to your brothers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
1CO	6	8	kk7b	figs-gendernotations	ἀδελφούς	1	your own brothers	Although the word translated **brothers** is masculine, Paul is using this word to refer to any believer, whether man or woman. If **brothers** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a non-gendered word or refer to both genders. Alternate translation: “to your brothers and sisters” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
1CO	6	9	i2ln			0		In [6:9–10](../06/09.md), Paul lists people who do things that are unrighteous. Many of these words are the same words he used in the similar lists in [5:10–11](../05/10.md). It may be helpful to refer to how you translated the words there.
1CO	6	9	ojaf	grammar-connect-words-phrases	ἢ	1		The word **Or** introduces Paul’s question as an alternative to “wronging and cheating brothers” in [6:7](../06/07.md). If they do indeed **know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God**, they not be “wronging and cheating brothers.” Paul uses the word **Or** to show that these two things are not compatible. If **Or** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces an alternative. Alternate translation: “Against that,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
1CO	6	9	h17l	figs-rquestion	οὐκ οἴδατε ὅτι ἄδικοι Θεοῦ Βασιλείαν οὐ κληρονομήσουσιν?	1	Or do you not know that	Paul does not ask this question because he is looking for information. Rather, he asks it to involve the Corinthians in what he is arguing. The question assumes that the answer is “yes, we know.” If this question would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea with a strong affirmation. Alternate translation: “surely you know that the unrighteous will not enter the kingdom of God.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
1CO	6	9	slcx	figs-nominaladj	ἄδικοι	1		Paul is using the adjective **unrighteous** as a noun in order to describe a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this with a noun phrase. Alternate translation: “people who are unrighteous” or “unrighteous people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
1CO	6	9	t1rt	figs-metaphor	οὐ κληρονομήσουσιν	1	will inherit	Here, Paul speaks of the **kingdom of God** as if it were property that a parent could pass on to their child when the parent dies. Here, Paul uses the word **inherit** to refer to being able to live in the **kingdom of God**. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “will not live in” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	6	9	eywd	figs-activepassive	μὴ πλανᾶσθε	1		If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form by using a verb such as “gather together” or “meet.” Alternate translation: “When you meet together” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1CO	6	9	vtlq	figs-nominaladj	πόρνοι	1		Paul is using the adjective phrase **sexually immoral** as a noun in order to describe a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this with a noun phrase. Alternate translation: “people who are sexually immoral” or “sexually immoral people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
1CO	6	9	h2na	translate-unknown	οὔτε μαλακοὶ, οὔτε ἀρσενοκοῖται,	1	male prostitutes, those who practice homosexuality	The word translated **male prostitutes** identifies men who are penetrated during sexual acts with other men. The word translated **those who practice homosexuality** identifies men who penetrate other men during sexual acts. Your language may have specific words for these behaviors. If so, you could use them here. If your language does not have specific words for these behavior, you could either use descriptive phrases, or you could combine the two words and refer to homosexual activity in general. Alternate translation: “nor bottoms nor tops” or “nor men who practice homosexuality” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	6	9	blc7	figs-abstractnouns	ἀρσενοκοῖται	1	male prostitutes	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **homosexuality**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “homosexual,” or you could use a descriptive phrase. Alternate translation: “those who are homosexual” or “those who have same-sex intercourse” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1CO	6	10	zzb5	figs-nominaladj	πλεονέκται	1		Paul is using the adjective **greedy** as a noun in order to describe a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this with a noun phrase. Alternate translation: “people who are greedy” or “greedy people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
1CO	6	10	bgj9	translate-unknown	λοίδοροι	1	the greedy	Here, **slanderers** is the same word that is translated “verbally abusive” in [5:11](../05/11.md). It describes someone who shows anger by using vicious words to attack others. Use a word in your language that describes this kind of person. Alternate translation: “vocally vicious people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	6	10	yzdx	translate-unknown	ἅρπαγες	1		Here, **swindlers** is the same word that is translated “swindler” in [5:11](../05/11.md). It identifies a person who takes money from others dishonestly. If **swindlers** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word that refers to such people. Alternate translation: “embezzlers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	6	10	h6aa	figs-metaphor	κληρονομήσουσιν	1		Here, Paul speaks of the **kingdom of God** as if it were property that a parent could pass on to their child when the parent dies. Here, Paul uses the word **inherit** to refer to being able to live in the **kingdom of God**. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “will live in” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	6	11	j49p	writing-pronouns	ταῦτά	1		Here, **that** refers to the list of unrighteous behaviors that Paul gave in [6:9–10](../06/09.md). Paul identifies **some** of the Corinthians as people who behaved in those ways. If **that** would be misunderstood in your language, you could more clearly refer back to the list of unrighteous behaviors. Alternate translation: “those kinds of people {are what}” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
1CO	6	11	pxp6	figs-doublet	ἀλλὰ ἀπελούσασθε, ἀλλὰ ἡγιάσθητε, ἀλλὰ ἐδικαιώθητε	1		Here Paul repeats **but you were** in order to emphasize the contrast between what the Corinthians **were** and what they have now experienced. If your language does not use repetition in this way, you could use one **but you were** and express the strong contrast in another way. Alternate translation: “But now you have been washed, sanctified, and justified” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
1CO	6	11	v5yq	figs-activepassive	ἀπελούσασθε…ἡγιάσθητε…ἐδικαιώθητε	1	you have been cleansed	If your language does not use these passive forms, you could express the ideas in active form with “God” as the subject. Alternate translation: “God washed you … God sanctified you … God justified you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1CO	6	11	rri7	figs-metaphor	ἀπελούσασθε	1		Here, Paul speaks as if the Corinthians had been **washed** with water. By speaking in this way, Paul emphasizes that they have been cleansed from sin, just like washing with water cleanses a person from dirt. Paul may have baptism in mind. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “you were washed clean” or “you were purified” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	6	11	s55x	figs-idiom	ἐν τῷ ὀνόματι τοῦ Κυρίου Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ	When something is done **in the name of** a person, it is done with the authority or power of that person. Here the cleansing, sanctification, and justification are done with the authority or power of Jesus, since they are done **in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ**. If **in the name of** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable idiom or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “with the power of the Lord Jesus Christ” or “by the authority of the Lord Jesus Christ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1CO	6	11	gzrh	figs-possession	τῷ Πνεύματι τοῦ Θεοῦ ἡμῶν	1		Here Paul uses the possessive form to identify the **Spirit** as **our God**, that is, as the Holy Spirit. He does not mean that the **Spirit** is something that belongs to **our God**. If your language would not use that form to identify the **Spirit** as **our God**, you could use a word or phrase that does identify the **Spirit** as **our God** or the “Holy Spirit.” Alternate translation: “the Spirit who is our God” or “the Holy Spirit, our God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
1CO	6	12	c3bs	figs-doublet	πάντα μοι ἔξεστιν, ἀλλ’ οὐ πάντα συμφέρει. πάντα μοι ἔξεστιν, ἀλλ’ οὐκ ἐγὼ ἐξουσιασθήσομαι ὑπό τινος.	1		Here Paul repeats **Everything is lawful for me** to make two separate comments on the statement. By repeating **Everything is lawful for me**, Paul emphasizes his qualifications or objections to this statement. If your language does not use repetition in this way, you could state **Everything is lawful for me** once and include both comments after that. Alternate translation: ““Everything is lawful for me,’ but not everything is beneficial, and I will not be mastered by anything” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
1CO	6	12	sw2e	writing-quotations	πάντα μοι ἔξεστιν, ἀλλ’	-1	Connecting Statement:	In this verse, Paul twice quotes what some people in the Corinthian church are saying. The ULT indicates that these claims are quotations by using quotation marks. If your readers would misunderstood **Everything is lawful for me** and think that Paul is claiming this, you could clarify that some of the Corinthians are saying this, and Paul is saying the words that occur after **but**. Alternate translation: “You say, ‘Everything is lawful for me,’ but I respond that … You say, ‘Everything is lawful for me,’ but I respond that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
1CO	6	12	r4mx	figs-explicit	πάντα	-1	Everything is lawful for me	Here, **everything** refers to any action or behavior that one might pursue. If **everything** would be misunderstood in your language, you could clarify that Paul is referring to any action or behavior. Alternate translation: “Every behavior … every behavior … Every behavior” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	6	12	y6kn	figs-explicit	συμφέρει	1		Here Paul does not say to whom **everything** is not **beneficial**. He means that **everything** is not **beneficial** to the person or people who say that **Everything is lawful** for them. If your language would include for whom **everything** is not **beneficial**, you could include a phrase such as “for you” here. Alternate translation: “is beneficial for you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	6	12	c8vz	figs-activepassive	οὐκ ἐγὼ ἐξουσιασθήσομαι ὑπό τινος	1	I will not be mastered by any of them	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form. Alternate translation: “nothing will master me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1CO	6	12	p0d8	translate-unknown	οὐκ…ἐξουσιασθήσομαι ὑπό	1		Here, **be mastered** refers to being under the authority of something else. Paul here means that some things, when a person habitually does them, begin to have power or control over that person. Here, then, he wishes to tell the Corinthians that, while such things might be **lawful**, they should avoid doing these things because they will **be mastered** by these things. If **be mastered** would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea by using words that refer to “power” or “control.” Alternate translation: “will not be controlled by” or “will not be under the power of” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	6	13	jz55	writing-quotations	τὰ βρώματα τῇ κοιλίᾳ, καὶ ἡ κοιλία τοῖς βρώμασιν;…δὲ	1	“Food is for the stomach, and the stomach is for food,” but God will do away with both of them	In this verse, Paul quotes what some people in the Corinthian church are saying, just like he did in [6:12](../06/12.md). The ULT indicates that this claim is a quotation by using quotation marks. If your readers would misunderstood **Food {is} for the stomach, and the stomach for food** and think that Paul is claiming this, you could clarify that some of the Corinthians are saying this, and Paul is saying the words that occur after **but**. Alternate translation: “You say, ‘Food {is} for the stomach, and the stomach for food,’ but I respond that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
1CO	6	13	gt0n	figs-ellipsis	τὰ βρώματα τῇ κοιλίᾳ, καὶ ἡ κοιλία τοῖς βρώμασιν…τὸ…σῶμα οὐ τῇ πορνείᾳ, ἀλλὰ τῷ Κυρίῳ, καὶ ὁ Κύριος τῷ σώματι	1		In these two sentences, Paul omits **is** multiple times. If your language does not need to state **is** to express the idea, you could omit **is** throughout these two sentences. If your language does need to state **is** to express the idea, you could: (1) include **is** the first time it is needed in each sentence. See the ULT. (2) include **is** every time it is needed. Alternate translation: “Food {is} for the stomach, and the stomach {is} for food … the body {is} is not for sexual immorality, but {is} for the Lord, and the Lord {is} for the body” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
1CO	6	13	uc1v	translate-unknown	καταργήσει	1	do away with	Here, **will do away with** refers to making something ineffective, useless, or irrelevant. What Paul means is that God will make **food** and **the stomach** unimportant and without function. If **will do away with** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word or phrase that indicates that a God has acted so that **food** and **the stomach** are no longer important, useful, or effective. Alternate translation: “will render ineffective” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	6	13	scrh	writing-pronouns	καὶ ταύτην καὶ ταῦτα	1		Here, **this** refers to **stomach**, and **those** refers to **food**, since **food** is plural here. If what **this** and **those** refer to would be misunderstood in your language, you could use the names **stomach** and **food** instead. Alternate translation: “both stomach and food” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
1CO	6	13	pd10	grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	2		Here, **Now** introduces a development based on what Paul has said about **food** and **the stomach**. While **food** is indeed **for the stomach**, the **body** is not **for sexual immorality**. Paul agrees with the Corinthians about **food** and **the stomach**, but he disagrees that **sexual immorality** and **the body** should be understood in the same way. Instead, **the body** exists **for the Lord**. Paul further explains in the next verse ([6:14](../06/14.md)) that, unlike **food** and **the stomach**, God will not **do away with** the **body**, since we will be resurrected. If **Now** would not introduce a difference between **the stomach** and **the body**, you could use a word or phrase that does introduce such a contrast. Alternate translation: “On the other hand,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
1CO	6	13	r1co	writing-pronouns	τῇ πορνείᾳ	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **immorality**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “immoral.” Alternate translation: “for what is sexually immoral” or “sexually immoral behavior” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1CO	6	13	d9q7	figs-explicit	τῷ Κυρίῳ	1		Here Paul means that the **body** is meant to serve and please **the Lord**. If **for the Lord** would be misunderstood in your language, you could include a verbal phrase that indicates that the **body** should serve **the Lord**. Alternate translation: “it is intended to please the Lord” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	6	13	zpx9	figs-explicit	ὁ Κύριος τῷ σώματι	1		Here, **the Lord for the body** expresses the idea that: (1) the **Lord** works for the human **body** and not just the human “soul” or non-physical part. Alternate translation: “the Lord works for the body” (2) the **Lord** is human now and in a **body**, which would explain why Paul speaks about the resurrection of the **Lord** in the next verse. Alternate translation: “the Lord is in a human body” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	6	14	tayy	grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1		Here, **Now** introduces one way in which “the Lord is for the body” (). Human bodies are important and are not for sexual immorality because God will raise those who believe to new life, and this includes human bodies. If **Now** would not introduce a further development of the argument in your language, you could use a word or phrase that does function in this way. Alternate translation: “Further,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
1CO	6	14	ev9l	figs-idiom	τὸν Κύριον ἤγειρεν, καὶ ἡμᾶς ἐξεγερεῖ	1	raised the Lord	Paul uses the words **raised** and **raise up** to refer to someone who had died coming back to life. If your language does not use these words to describe coming back to life, you could use a comparable idiom or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “restored the Lord to life and will also restore us to life” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1CO	6	14	jvng		ἤγειρεν…ἐξεγερεῖ	1		Here, **raised** and **raise up** have the same meaning. Paul uses a slightly different word for variety or because he is referring to the future. In your translation, you could use the same word for **raised** and **raise up**. Alternate translation: “raised … will … raise”
1CO	6	14	wgh4	figs-abstractnouns	διὰ τῆς δυνάμεως αὐτοῦ	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **power**, you could express the idea by using an adverb such as “powerfully” or an adjective such as “powerful.”  Alternate translation: “by working powerfully” or “by his powerful action” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1CO	6	15	gt2x	figs-metaphor	μέλη Χριστοῦ…τὰ μέλη τοῦ Χριστοῦ…πόρνης μέλη	1	Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ?	Here, Paul speaks as if the Corinthians were **members**, which are body parts, that belong to **Christ** or to a **prostitute**. He speaks in this way to indicate how closely joined the Corinthians are to **Christ** or to a **prostitute**. This union is as close as the union between a finger and the body to which it belongs. If your readers would misunderstand this figure of speech, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “united to Christ … people who are united to Christ … unite with a prostitute” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	6	15	io5p	figs-rquestion	οὐκ οἴδατε, ὅτι τὰ σώματα ὑμῶν μέλη Χριστοῦ ἐστιν?	1		Paul does not ask this question because he is looking for information. Rather, he asks it to involve the Corinthians in what he is arguing. The question assumes that the answer is “yes, we know.” If your readers would misunderstand this question, you could express the idea with a strong affirmation. Alternate translation: “You should know that your bodies are members of Christ.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
1CO	6	15	agvy	figs-metaphor	ἄρας…τὰ μέλη τοῦ Χριστοῦ	1		Here Paul speaks about **taking away the members of Christ** as if he could remove a body part from **Christ**, like cutting off a finger. He speaks in this way to show how bad it is to remove a person from union with **Christ**. It is as bad as cutting a finger, arm, or leg off a person’s body. If your readers would misunderstand this figure of speech, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “having removed people from union with Christ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	6	15	f4vd	figs-rquestion	ἄρας…τὰ μέλη τοῦ Χριστοῦ, ποιήσω πόρνης μέλη?	1	Shall I then take away the members of Christ and join them to a prostitute? May it not be!	Paul does not ask this question because he is looking for information. Rather, he asks it to involve the Corinthians in what he is arguing. The question assumes that the answer is “no, you should not.” If your readers would misunderstand this question, you could express the idea with a strong negation. Alternate translation: “I should never take away the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
1CO	6	15	h21r	figs-123person	ποιήσω	1	Shall I then take away the members of Christ and join them to a prostitute? May it not be!	Here Paul speaks in the first person because he is using himself as an example. If your readers would misunderstand why Paul uses the first person here, you could include a word or phrase that clarifies that Paul is treating himself as an example, or you could use a form that would naturally provide an example in your language. Alternate translation: “should I, for example, make them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
1CO	6	15	kmt2	figs-idiom	μὴ γένοιτο	1	May it not be!	Here, **May it never be!** gives Paul’s own response to his question. The phrase is one of the strongest negatives Paul could use. Use a strong word or phrase that answers a question with a no. Alternate translation: “Never!” or “Absolutely not!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1CO	6	16	seg6	figs-rquestion	ἢ οὐκ οἴδατε ὅτι ὁ κολλώμενος τῇ πόρνῃ, ἓν σῶμά ἐστιν?	1	Do you not know that … her?	Paul does not ask this question because he is looking for information. Rather, he asks it to involve the Corinthians in what he is arguing. The question assumes that the answer is “yes, we know.” If this question would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea as an emphatic statement. Alternate translation: “You know for sure that the one who is joined to the prostitute is one body.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
1CO	6	16	zcgg	figs-euphemism	ὁ κολλώμενος τῇ πόρνῃ	1	Do you not know that … her?	Here, being **joined to the prostitute** is a euphemism for having sex with a **prostitute**. Paul uses this euphemism in order to be polite. He also picks this specific euphemism because it can also refer to being **joined** to someone without sexual implications. He uses the phrase in this way in the next verse to speak about union with Christ ([6:17](../06/17.md)). If your readers would misunderstand **joined to the prostitute**, you could use a similar polite euphemism in your language. If possible, use a euphemism that can also work to describe the non-sexual union with Christ in the next verse. Alternate translation: “the one who lives with the prostitute” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
1CO	6	16	z54k	figs-activepassive	ὁ κολλώμενος τῇ πόρνῃ	1	he who is joined to a prostitute becomes one flesh with her	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Paul implies that the person did it to himself. Alternate translation: “the one who joins himself to the prostitute” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1CO	6	16	w1am	figs-genericnoun	τῇ πόρνῃ	1	he who is joined to a prostitute becomes one flesh with her	Jesus is speaking of prostitutes in general, not of one particular **prostitute**. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could use a phrase that refers in general to “prostitutes.” Alternate translation: “to any prostitute” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])
1CO	6	16	up28	figs-ellipsis	ἓν σῶμά ἐστιν	1	he who is joined to a prostitute becomes one flesh with her	Here Paul is pointing out that the **one who is joined** and the **prostitute** make up **one body** together. He is not arguing that the **one who is joined** by himself is **one body**. If your readers would misunderstand this point, you could include some words that Paul implies. Alternate translation: “is one body with her” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
1CO	6	16	fioa	figs-metaphor	ἓν σῶμά ἐστιν	1	he who is joined to a prostitute becomes one flesh with her	Here Paul is speaking as if the **one who is joined** and the **prostitute** together share **one body** when they have sex. He speaks in this way to emphasize the unity that these two people have when they have sex, which is as close as if they had only one body. If your readers would misunderstand this figure of speech, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “shares all things with her” or “is united to her” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	6	16	m2gm	writing-quotations	γάρ, φησίν,	1	he who is joined to a prostitute becomes one flesh with her	In Paul’s culture, **For it says** is a normal way to introduce a quotation from an important text, in this case, the Old Testament book titled “Genesis” (see [Genesis 2:24](gen/02/24.md)). If your readers would misunderstand this, you could use a comparable phrase that indicates that Paul is quoting from an important text. Alternate translation: “For it can be read in the Old Testament” or “For the book of Genesis says” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
1CO	6	16	vv2n	figs-quotations	ἔσονται…φησίν, οἱ δύο εἰς σάρκα μίαν	1	he who is joined to a prostitute becomes one flesh with her	If you do not use this form in your language, you could translate these statements as indirect quotes instead of as direct quotes. Alternate translation: “it says that the two will become as one flesh” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
1CO	6	16	ks89	figs-explicit	ἔσονται…οἱ δύο εἰς σάρκα μίαν	1	he who is joined to a prostitute becomes one flesh with her	The passage that Paul quotes here comes from the book of Genesis. The story is about God creating Adam and Eve, the first man and woman. When God brings Eve, the woman, to the man named Adam, the narrative comments that this is why “a man will leave his father and his mother, and he will cling to his wife, and they will become one flesh” ([Genesis 2:24](gen/02/24.md)). Paul quotes the end of this sentence here. If your readers would misunderstand what this quote refers to, you could include a footnote explaining the context. Additionally, you could clarify what the word **two** refers to. Alternate translation: “A man and a woman will become as one flesh” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	6	17	zyjd	figs-metaphor	ὁ…κολλώμενος τῷ Κυρίῳ	1	he who is joined to the Lord becomes one spirit with him	Here, being **joined to the Lord** refers to what Paul elsewhere describes as being “in Christ” or “united to Christ.” Paul uses this specific phrase because he used it in the last verse to refer to union with a “prostitute” (see [6:16](../06/16.md)). If your readers would misunderstand **joined to the Lord**, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea non-figuratively. If possible, use the same words you that you used in the last verse for “joined to the prostitute.” Alternate translation: “the one who lives with the Lord” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	6	17	c2tb	figs-activepassive	ὁ…κολλώμενος τῷ Κυρίῳ	1	he who is joined to the Lord becomes one spirit with him	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Paul implies that the person did it to himself. Alternate translation: “the one who joins himself to the Lord” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1CO	6	17	z273	figs-ellipsis	ἓν πνεῦμά ἐστιν	1	he who is joined to the Lord becomes one spirit with him	Here Paul is pointing out that the **one who is joined** and the **Lord** make up **one spirit** together. He is not arguing that the **one who is joined** by himself is **one spirit**. If your readers would misunderstand this point, you could include some words that Paul implies. Alternate translation: “is one spirit with him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
1CO	6	17	vv1s	figs-metaphor	ἓν πνεῦμά ἐστιν	1	he who is joined to the Lord becomes one spirit with him	Here Paul is speaking as if the **one who is joined** and the **Lord** together share **one spirit** when the **one who is joined** believes in the **Lord**. He speaks in this way to emphasize the unity between a believer and Jesus, which is as close as if they had only one spirit. If your readers would misunderstand this figure of speech, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “shares all things with him spiritually” or “is spiritually united to him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	6	17	kt2x		πνεῦμά	1	he who is joined to the Lord becomes one spirit with him	Here, **spirit** could refer to: (1) a person’s **spirit** in contrast to his or her “body.” While a prostitute and a man can have “one body” ([6:16](../06/16.md)), which is a physical union, the Lord and a believer can have **one spirit**, which is a spiritual union. Alternate translation: “spiritually” (2) the Holy Spirit, who unites the Lord and the believer. Alternate translation: “in the Holy Spirit”
1CO	6	18	ex92	figs-metaphor	φεύγετε	1	Flee from	Here Paul wants the Corinthians to avoid **sexual immorality** as urgently as if it were an enemy or danger that they might **flee from**. If your readers would misunderstand this figure of speech, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “Carefully stay away from” or “Fight against” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	6	18	nhpq	figs-abstractnouns	τὴν πορνείαν	1	Flee from	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **immorality**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “immoral.” Alternate translation: “what is sexually immoral” or “sexually immoral behavior” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1CO	6	18	sc9d	grammar-connect-exceptions	πᾶν ἁμάρτημα ὃ ἐὰν ποιήσῃ ἄνθρωπος ἐκτὸς τοῦ σώματός ἐστιν, ὁ δὲ πορνεύων εἰς τὸ ἴδιον σῶμα ἁμαρτάνει	1	immorality! Every other sin that a person commits is outside the body, but	If it would appear in your language that Paul was making a statement here and then contradicting it, you could reword this to avoid using exception language. Alternate translation: “Almost every sin that a man might commit is outside the body, but the one who is sexually immoral sins against his own body” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-exceptions]])
1CO	6	18	dfck	figs-gendernotations	ἄνθρωπος…τὸ ἴδιον	1	immorality! Every other sin that a person commits is outside the body, but	Although **man** and **his** are masculine, Paul is using these words to refer to anyone, whether man or woman. If your readers would misunderstand **man** and **his**, you could use non-gendered words or refer to both genders. Alternate translation: “a man or woman … his or her own” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
1CO	6	18	jr46	figs-metaphor	ἐκτὸς τοῦ σώματός ἐστιν	1	sin that a person commits	Here, Paul speaks as if sins were located **outside the body**. By speaking in this way, he means that most sins do not affect the **body** the way **sexual immorality** does. If your readers would misunderstand this figure of speech, you could express the idea non-figuratively or with a comparable metaphor. Alternate translation: “does not directly affect the body” or “is apart from the body” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	6	19	i5bt	grammar-connect-words-phrases	ἢ	1	Do you not know … God? … that you are not your own?	The word **Or** introduces an alternate to what Paul speaks about in [6:18](../06/18.md). Some people are indeed “sinning against their bodies.” Paul gives the correct alternative: they should **know** that their bodies are “temple” of the **Holy Spirit**. If your readers would misunderstood **Or**, you could use a word that signifies a contrast or gives an alternative. Alternate translation: “Rather,” or “On the other hand,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
1CO	6	19	qy5j	figs-rquestion	ἢ οὐκ οἴδατε ὅτι τὸ σῶμα ὑμῶν, ναὸς τοῦ ἐν ὑμῖν Ἁγίου Πνεύματός ἐστιν, οὗ ἔχετε ἀπὸ Θεοῦ?	1	Do you not know … God? … that you are not your own?	Paul does not ask this question because he is looking for information. Rather, he asks it to involve the Corinthians in what he is arguing. The question assumes that the answer is “yes, we know.” If your readers would misunderstand this question, you could express the idea with a strong affirmation. Alternate translation: “You certainly know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit in you, whom you have from God.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
1CO	6	19	bb35	grammar-collectivenouns	τὸ σῶμα ὑμῶν	1	your body	The word **body** is a singular noun that refers to multiple “bodies.” Paul makes this clear by using a plural **your**. If your language does not use singular nouns in that way, you can use a different expression. Alternate translation: “each of your bodies” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns]])
1CO	6	19	d2mc	figs-metaphor	ναὸς τοῦ ἐν ὑμῖν Ἁγίου Πνεύματός	1	temple of the Holy Spirit	Here, Paul speaks of the relationship between the believer and the **Holy Spirit** as if the believer were a **temple** and the **Holy Spirit** were the god that dwelled in that temple. In Paul’s culture, deities had specific temples, and they would be specially present to their worshipers in those temples. Paul applies this thinking to believers. Each believer is a **temple**, and the **Holy Spirit** is **in** each believer. This means that the Holy Spirit is specially present with each believer. This is a significant metaphor in the Bible, so if possible, preserve the metaphor or express the idea by using a simile. Alternate translation: “is a temple in which the Holy Spirit dwells” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	6	19	cg8m		οὗ ἔχετε ἀπὸ Θεοῦ	1	temple of the Holy Spirit	Alternate translation: “whom God has given to you”
1CO	6	20	vzz8	figs-metaphor	ἠγοράσθητε…τιμῆς	1	For you were bought with a price	Here Paul speaks if the Corinthians were slaves whom God had **bought with a price** from someone else. Paul is speaking of what we often call “redemption.” The **price** is Christ’s death on the cross, which “redeems” believers from sin and evil powers. This is an important biblical metaphor, so if possible preserve the metaphor or express it as an analogy. Alternate translation: “you were bought with a price, which is the Messiah’s death” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	6	20	qv47	figs-activepassive	ἠγοράσθητε…τιμῆς	1	For you were bought with a price	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Paul implies that “God” did it. Alternate translation: “God bought you with a price” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1CO	6	20	y7fe		ἐν τῷ σώματι ὑμῶν	1	Therefore	Alternate translation: “with your body” or “with what you do with your body”
1CO	7	intro	a25m			0		# 1 Corinthians 7 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and Formatting<br><br>4. On abstinence (7:1–40)<br>      * Directions on sex in marriage (7:1–7)<br>      * Directions on marriage and divorce (7:8–16)<br>      * Believers should remain as God called them (7:17–24)<br>      * Benefit of staying as one is, whether single or married (7:25–35)<br>      * Exceptions for engaged Christians and widows (7:36–40)<br><br>## Special Concepts in this Chapter<br><br>### The letter from the Corinthians to Paul<br><br>In [7:1](../07/01.md), Paul says that the Corinthians wrote to him. In fact, the second half of the verse is probably a quote from their letter to Paul. To show this, the ULT puts the quotation inside quotation marks. We do not know what else the letter included about marriage and sex. In the rest of the chapter, though, Paul responds to what they wrote to him.<br><br>### Sex and marriage<br><br>Throughout this chapter, Paul speaks at length about sex and marriage. While he does not argue this here, he assumes that sex should only happen within a marriage. This is clear when he makes lack of sexual self-control a good reason to get married in [7:9](../07/09.md). Further, he has four categories of people in mind: those who have never gotten married, those who are engaged to be married, those who are no longer married (whether through divorce or death of a spouse), and those who are currently married. Whether your language has more or fewer categories for marital status, make the distinctions between these four categories as clear as possible.<br><br>### Sanctification of unbelieving spouse and children<br><br>In [7:12–16](../07/12.md), Paul addresses Christian men and women who have an unbelieving spouse. He specifically argues that they should stay together unless the unbelieving spouse wishes to leave the marriage. He argues that they should stay together because the unbelieving spouse and the children are “sanctified” by the believing spouse. By “sanctified,” Paul does not mean that the unbelieving spouse and the children are considered to be Christians whom God will save. Rather, “sanctified” identifies the unbelieving spouse and the children as appropriate family for the believing spouse. In other words, having an unbelieving spouse does not make one’s marriage and children improper before God. Instead, God “sanctifies” them. If your language has a way to refer to an improper or unacceptable marriage, you might be able to use those kinds of words here.<br><br>### Divorce<br><br>In this passage, Paul uses a number of words and phrases to refer to what we call divorce: “being separated” ([7:10–11](../07/10.md)), “divorce” ([11–13](../07/11.md)), “departing” ([15](../07/15.md)), and “being released” ([27](../07/27.md)). In Paul’s culture, the rules for divorce were different in different places, and some divorces would have been more formal and legal than others. Additionally, in many places both men and women could divorce a spouse, but in a few places only men could divorce their wives. If Paul’s language would be understood in your language, you should try to preserve the different words and phrases he uses. If you need to make his language more consistent, use a word or phrase that refers generally to ending a marriage. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/divorce]])<br><br>### The “virgin”<br><br>In [7:25–38](../07/25.md), Paul refers repeatedly to “virgins.” With this word, he identifies a woman who has never been married. The word does not necessarily mean that the woman has never had any sexual experiences. When Paul identifies the virgin as “his virgin,” he refers either to a woman who is engaged to be married to a man or to a daughter who is under the authority of her father (see the last section in this introduction). In your language, use a word or phrase that refers to a woman who has never been married.<br><br>### The “coming distress”<br><br>In [7:26](../07/26.md), Paul speaks of the “coming distress.” This is trouble, persecution, or difficulties that affect the Corinthian church and perhaps all churches. When Paul says that the distress is “coming,” he could mean that it has already begun to happen and will continue to happen. It is more likely, however, that “coming” means that the distress is about to begin. Because of this “distress,” Paul thinks that believers are better off not getting married. It is unclear what Paul thought about the length of this “distress.” Is the “distress” still happening in the present day? It is better not to clarify the answer to this in your translation, since Paul does not give any hints. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/trouble]])<br><br>### Calling<br><br>Paul refers consistently to a “calling” and to “being called” in [7:17–24](../07/17.md). Throughout this section, “being called” refers to God’s action to save a person. Paul speaks about a person’s situation when they “were called” as a “calling” in [7:20](../07/20.md), while in other places he specifies what that situation might be: married or unmarried, circumcised or uncircumcised, slave or free. The point Paul wishes to make is that God’s “call” does not require one to change one’s situation. Rather, God’s “call” is for people to serve him in the situation they are in. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/call]])<br><br>## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter<br><br>### Euphemisms for having sex<br><br>In the first half of this chapter, Paul uses many euphemisms for having sex: “touching a woman” ([7:1](../07/01.md)), “duty” ([3](../07/03.md)), not “depriving each other” ([5](../07/05.md)), and being “together again” ([5](../07/05.md)). In most cases, he speaks in this way to be polite and avoid offending those who would read the letter. When this is true, you can translate Paul’s language with any polite way of referring to having sex in your language. However, the euphemism “duty” in ([7:3](../07/03.md)) particularly emphasizes that married couples are required to have sex. If your language has a euphemism that emphasizes “duty,” you could use it in that verse. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])<br><br>### Redemption<br><br>Just as in [6:20](../06/20.md), in [7:23](../07/23.md) Paul tells the Corinthians that they have been “bought with a price.” He does not state what the price is or whom God bought the Corinthians from. However, it is clear that Paul is speaking about what we call “redemption” here. Paul thinks of the Corinthians as slaves up for sale, and God buys them from their previous owner by paying a price. The previous owner can be understood as sin, death, and evil powers, while the price is Jesus the Son dying for believers. You should not include all these implications in your translation, but you should use words that can be interpreted in this way. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/redeem]])<br><br>### Those who have … should be as those who do not have …<br><br>In [7:29–31](../07/29.md), Paul emphasizes that those who have or do something “should be as those” who do not have or do that thing. He emphasizes this by giving a list of five examples. Paul’s point is that actions or things related to this world should not define who Christians are. He backs this up in [7:31](../07/31.md) by stating that “the present form of this world is passing away.” Therefore, those who weep should act like those who do not weep, and those who are married should act like those who are not married. Neither weeping nor marriage should have an impact on who the Christian is and on what the Christian does. None of these five things, which stand for everything in the “present form of this world,” are significant for one’s relationship to God as a Christian. If possible, preserve the strong contrasts, which almost sound like contradictions. These strong contrasts are an essential part of Paul’s argument.<br><br>### Rhetorical questions<br><br>Paul uses rhetorical questions in [7:16](../07/16.md). He asks these questions to involve the Corinthians in his argument and to force them to think about what he is saying. He again uses rhetorical questions in [7:18](../07/18.md), [21](../07/21.md), [27](../07/27.md). He asks these questions for a different reason: to identify those to whom his statements apply. If possible, you should preserve these questions. However, if your language does not use rhetorical questions, see the notes on each question for other translation possibilities. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])<br><br>## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter<br><br>### Translating gendered words<br><br>In much of this chapter, Paul uses masculine and feminine words to identify when he is addressing men and when he is addressing women. Unlike in most of the previous chapters, then, you should intentionally preserve most of the gendered language in this chapter. The notes will identify any cases of gendered language that refer to all people. If there is no note, assume that the gendered language is functioning to distinguish between genders.<br><br>### Who speaks, Paul or the Lord?<br><br>Throughout this chapter, Paul uses a number of phrases to indicate whose authority lies behind the commands he gives. First, he marks [7:10–11](../07/10.md) as something that the Lord, not him, has spoken. Of course, he himself is speaking, but he is summarizing the Lord’s teaching on divorce. Therefore, “not I, but the Lord” in [7:11](../07/11.md) is Paul’s way of indicating that he is summarizing teaching directly from the Lord. Second, he marks [7:12–16](../07/12.md) as something he commands. Therefore, by using “I, not the Lord” in [7:12](../07/12.md), he indicates that he gives the commands that follow on his own authority as an apostle. He is not saying that these commands are not as authoritative or important as those in [7:10–11](../07/10.md). Third, Paul introduces [7:25–40](../07/25.md) by stating that again he does “not have a command from the Lord,” but that he gives “an opinion” that God has made “trustworthy.” He concludes the section by stating that he has given his “judgment,” and he has the “Spirit of God” ([7:40](../07/40.md)). This is a slightly weaker claim to authority than he made in [7:12](../07/12.md): these are his “opinion” or “judgment.” However, Paul also claims that God has made him “trustworthy” and given him the Spirit, so these verses should not be taken simply as Paul’s private opinion. Rather, Paul himself already provides exceptions and qualifications in this section because he is less confident. Do not translate what Paul says as if it is advice from anyone. Instead, this whole chapter carries apostolic authority.<br><br>### Father or fiancé in [7:36–38](../07/36.md)?<br><br>In this verses, Paul repeatedly refers to “he” or “him.” He does not state who this man is, but the man has a “virgin.” There are two common ways to understand these verses. First, and more likely, the man is engaged to “his virgin,” and Paul is giving him instructions on whether to get married or not. Second, and less likely, the man is the father of the daughter (“his virgin”), and Paul is giving him instructions on whether to give his daughter in marriage or not. If a specific translation choice follows one of these interpretations instead of the other, the notes on these verses will point out whether it matches the “fiancé interpretation” or the “father interpretation.”
1CO	7	1	y4lx	grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1	Now	Here, **Now** introduces a new topic in the letter. Paul begins to discuss things that the Corinthians asked him about in a letter. If **Now** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a new topic. Alternate translation: “Next,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
1CO	7	1	jq21	figs-explicit	ὧν ἐγράψατε	1	the issues you wrote about	The phrase **what you wrote** implies that the Corinthians had previously written a letter to Paul in which they asked him questions. Paul now begins to answer those questions. If **what you wrote** would not imply that the Corinthians had already written a letter to Paul, you could make this explicit. Alternate translation: “what you wrote to me in your letter” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	7	1	erl5	figs-explicit	ἐγράψατε, καλὸν ἀνθρώπῳ, γυναικὸς μὴ ἅπτεσθαι	1	“It is good for a man not to touch a woman.”	Here Paul could be (1) quoting what the Corinthians said in their letter so that he can respond to it, much like he did in [6:12–13](../06/12.md). Alternate translation: “you wrote: you say, ‘It is good for a man not to touch a woman.’” (2) expressing his own views about men and women. Alternate translation: “you wrote: It is true that it is good for a man not to touch a woman” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	7	1	inrh		καλὸν ἀνθρώπῳ, γυναικὸς μὴ ἅπτεσθαι;	1		Alternate translation: “When a man does not touch a woman, that is good”
1CO	7	1	cm7y	figs-explicit	ἀνθρώπῳ, γυναικὸς	1	for a man	While the words **man** and **woman** could refer specifically to “husband” and “wife,” Paul is quoting a more general statement here that refers to men and women in general. If **man** and **woman** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use words that refer more specifically to the sex of the people involved. Alternate translation: “for a male … a female” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	7	1	z9j5	figs-genericnoun	ἀνθρώπῳ, γυναικὸς	1		Here, Paul refers to **man** and **woman** in the singular, but he is speaking generically of all any **man** and any **woman**. If your language does not use the singular form to refer to people in general, you could use a form that does refer generically to people in your language. Alternate translation: “for men … women” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])
1CO	7	1	mx7w	figs-euphemism	ἀνθρώπῳ, γυναικὸς μὴ ἅπτεσθαι	1	not to touch a woman	Here, **for a man** to **touch a woman** is a euphemism for having sex. This is a general statement about having sex, although Paul primarily speaks about sex within marriage in the verses that follow. The Corinthians used this euphemism in their letter to Paul in order to be polite. If **for a man not to touch a woman** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a similar polite euphemism in your language. Alternate translation: “for a man not to sleep with a woman” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
1CO	7	2	c3uq	grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1	But because	Here, **But** introduces the qualifications Paul wishes to give for the statement in the previous verse: “{It is} good for a man not to touch a woman.” Paul wishes to give qualifications whether that statement is from the Corinthians or is Paul’s own statement. Use a word or phrase in your culture that introduces qualifications to a claim. Alternate translation: “However,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
1CO	7	2	fys4	figs-abstractnouns	διὰ…τὰς πορνείας	1	But because of temptations for many immoral acts, each	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **immorality**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “immoral.” Alternate translation: “because people are immoral” or “because of immoral behavior” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1CO	7	2	ktqd	figs-metonymy	διὰ…τὰς πορνείας	1		Here, **immorality** refers to how people desire to commit **immorality** and do commit **immorality**. Paul does not refer to **immorality** in the abstract. If **immorality** would be misunderstood in your language, you could include a word or phrase that refers to “temptation” or “behavior.” Alternate translation: “because of the temptation of immorality” or “because people act immorally” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1CO	7	2	r822	figs-imperative	ἕκαστος τὴν ἑαυτοῦ γυναῖκα ἐχέτω, καὶ ἑκάστη τὸν ἴδιον ἄνδρα ἐχέτω	1		Here Paul uses two third person imperatives. If you have third person imperatives in your language, you could use them here. If you do not have third person imperatives, you could express the idea by using a word such as “should” or “allow.” Alternate translation: “allow each man to have his own wife, and allow each woman to have her own husband” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
1CO	7	2	j4wc	figs-idiom	ἕκαστος τὴν ἑαυτοῦ γυναῖκα ἐχέτω, καὶ ἑκάστη τὸν ἴδιον ἄνδρα ἐχέτω	1		The phrases “to have a wife” and “to have a husband” refer primarily to the ongoing state of being married, which includes continuing to have sex. However, the idiom primarily emphasizes remaining in a state of marriage with one’s current spouse. If “to have a wife or husband” would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable idiom or refer directly to staying married. Alternate translation: “let each man continue in marriage with his own wife, and let each woman continue in marriage with her own husband” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1CO	7	3	he0c	figs-genericnoun	τῇ γυναικὶ ὁ ἀνὴρ…ἡ γυνὴ τῷ ἀνδρί	1		Here Paul refers to **the husband** and **the wife** in the singular, but he is speaking generically about any **husband** and **wife**. If your language does not use the singular form to refer to people in general, you could use a form that does refer generically to people in your language. Alternate translation: “each husband … to his wife … each wife … to her husband” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])
1CO	7	3	xv9s	figs-imperative	ὁ ἀνὴρ…ἀποδιδότω	1		Here Paul uses a third person imperative. If you have third person imperatives in your language, you could use one here. If you do not have third person imperatives, you could express the idea using a word such as “should” or “must.” Alternate translation: “A husband should give” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
1CO	7	3	mj8l	figs-euphemism	τῇ γυναικὶ ὁ ἀνὴρ τὴν ὀφειλὴν ἀποδιδότω	1	sexual rights	Here Paul uses **duty** to refer to married couples having sex. He uses this word to be polite and also because he wishes to emphasize that having sex is an obligation for married couples. If **duty** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable euphemism or refer directly to how married couples “should” have sex. Alternate translation: “Let the husband fulfill his sexual obligations to the wife” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
1CO	7	3	vhv1	figs-ellipsis	ὁμοίως…καὶ ἡ γυνὴ τῷ ἀνδρί	1	likewise the wife to her husband	Here Paul omits some words that may be required in your language to make a full sentence. You could supply words from the first half of the verse to complete the thought. Alternate translation: “likewise let the wife also give to the husband the duty” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
1CO	7	4	px2s	figs-genericnoun	ἡ γυνὴ…ὁ ἀνήρ…ὁ ἀνὴρ…ἡ γυνή	1		Just as in [7:3](../07/03.md), Paul here refers to **the husband** and **the wife** in the singular, but he is speaking generically about any **husband** and **wife**. If your language does not use the singular form to refer to people in general, you could use a form that does refer generically to people in your language. Alternate translation: “each wife … her husband {does} … each husband … his wife {does}” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])
1CO	7	4	a7nb	figs-abstractnouns	τοῦ ἰδίου σώματος οὐκ ἐξουσιάζει	-1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **authority**, you could express the idea by using a verb or verbal phrase such as “control” or “claim as one’s own.” Alternate translation: “does not control her own body … does not control his own body” or “does not claim her body as her own … does not claim his body as his own” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1CO	7	4	sspg	figs-ellipsis	ὁ ἀνήρ…ἡ γυνή	1		In both these places, Paul omits some words that may be required in your language to make a full sentence. You could supply words from the first half of each statement in order to complete the thought, as the ULT does. Alternate translation: “the husband has authority over her body … the wife has authority over his body” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
1CO	7	5	qq7u	figs-euphemism	μὴ ἀποστερεῖτε ἀλλήλους	1	Do not deprive each other	Here Paul omits a direct reference to having sex in order to be polite. The Corinthians would have understood him to mean that they should not **deprive each other** of having sex. If your readers also would understand this, you can express the idea the same way Paul did. If your readers would not understand this, you may need to include a word or phrase that politely refers to having sex. Alternate translation: “Do not deprive each other of sleeping together” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
1CO	7	5	wzeh	grammar-connect-exceptions	μὴ ἀποστερεῖτε ἀλλήλους, εἰ μήτι ἂν ἐκ συμφώνου	1		If it would appear in your language that Paul was making a statement here and then contradicting it, you could reword this to avoid using an exception clause. Alternate translation: “You should deprive each other only in one situation: by mutual agreement” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-exceptions]])
1CO	7	5	cnr5	figs-abstractnouns	ἐκ συμφώνου	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **agreement**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “agree.” Alternate translation: “when you both agree” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1CO	7	5	d3cr	figs-idiom	πρὸς καιρὸν	1		Here, **for a season** identifies a short, undefined period of time. The word **season** does not refer to winter or summer. If **for a season** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers vaguely to a short time. Alternate translation: “for a short period of time” “for a brief time” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1CO	7	5	gh0e	grammar-connect-logic-goal	ἵνα	1		Here, **so that** introduces the purpose for which the Corinthians can **deprive each other**. In other words, it gives the purpose for the **except** statement. If what **so that** refers back to would be misunderstood in your language, you could clarify that it explains why the Corinthians can **deprive each other**. If you use the following alternate translation, you may need to add period before it. Alternate translation: “You may deprive each only so that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
1CO	7	5	uq6x	translate-unknown	σχολάσητε τῇ προσευχῇ	1	so that you may devote yourselves to prayer	Here, **devote yourselves** refers to making time to focus on something specific. Paul argues that the only time to avoid having sex with one’s spouse is so that both one and one’s spouse have extra time to focus on praying to God. If **devote yourselves** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable expression. Alternate translation: “you may make more time for prayer” or “you may spend more time in prayer” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	7	5	nww5	figs-abstractnouns	τῇ προσευχῇ	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **pray**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “praying.” Alternate translation: “to praying” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1CO	7	5	s1ya	figs-euphemism	ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτὸ ἦτε	1	come together again	Here, **be together again** is a polite way to refer to having sex. If **be together again** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable phrase that politely refers to having sex. Alternate translation: “sleep together” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
1CO	7	5	mdj0	grammar-connect-logic-goal	ἵνα	2		Here, **so that** introduces the purpose for which (1) the Corinthians need quickly to **be together again**. It is because Satan will **tempt** them unless they are **together**. If you use the following alternate translation, you may need to add period before it. Alternate translation: “Be together again soon so that” (2) the Corinthians should not **deprive each other**. If you use the following alternate translation, you may need to add period before it. Alternate translation: “The point of not depriving each other is so that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
1CO	7	5	md2z	grammar-connect-logic-result	διὰ	1		Here, **because** introduces the reason why (1) **Satan** may **tempt** them. If you use the following alternate translation, you may need to add a comma before it. Alternate translation: “which he would do because of” (2) they should soon **be together again**. If you use the following alternate translation, you may need to add period before it. Alternate translation: “You should do this because of” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
1CO	7	5	ii8n	figs-abstractnouns	διὰ τὴν ἀκρασίαν ὑμῶν	1	because of your lack of self-control	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **self-control**, you could express the idea by using a verbal phrase such as “cannot restrain.” Alternate translation: “because you cannot restrain yourselves” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1CO	7	6	wrma	writing-pronouns	τοῦτο	1		Here, **this** could refer to (1) what Paul has said about the one situation in which they can “deprive each other” in [7:5](../07/05.md). Alternate translation: “this about when you can deprive each other” (2) what Paul has said about how married couples should regularly have sex in [7:2–5](../07/02.md). Alternate translation: “this about being married” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
1CO	7	6	hprb	figs-infostructure	κατὰ συνγνώμην, οὐ κατ’ ἐπιταγήν	1		If your language would express the negative statement before the positive, you could reverse the order of these two phrases. Alternate translation: “not as a command but as a concession” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
1CO	7	6	ncig	translate-unknown	συνγνώμην	1		Here, **a concession** is something that one allows even though one does not entirely agree with it. Usually, the **concession** is made because one wishes to avoid antagonizing the person one is dealing with. If **concession** would be misunderstood here, you could express the idea by using a comparable word or phrase. Alternate translation: “a compromise” or “an allowance” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	7	6	zsy3	figs-abstractnouns	κατὰ συνγνώμην, οὐ κατ’ ἐπιταγήν	1		If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **concession** and **command**, you could express the idea by using verb such as “concede” and “command.” Alternate translation: “because I concede it, not because I command it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1CO	7	7	b7xz	grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1		Here, **But** introduces a contrast with everything that Paul has said in [7:1–6](../07/01.md). In those verses, he speaks about how believers should act when they are already married. Now, however, he begins to talk about getting married, and he says that he wishes that people stayed unmarried like he does. The **But** introduces a new stage in the argument that deals with getting married. If **But** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a new but related topic. Alternate translation: “Now” or “Moving on,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
1CO	7	7	rbe7	figs-explicit	εἶναι ὡς καὶ ἐμαυτόν	1	were as I am	When Paul wrote this letter, he was not married, and as far as we know he was never married. When Paul says that he wishes that all people were **even as myself**, he is referring to how he is unmarried. If **to be even as myself** would be misunderstood in your language, you could include the fact that Paul is not married. Alternate translation: “to be unmarried as I am” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	7	7	mlsi	figs-gendernotations	ἀνθρώπους…ἴδιον	1		Although **men** and **him** are masculine, Paul is using these words to refer to anyone, whether man or woman. If **men** and **him** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use non-gendered words or refer to both genders. Alternate translation: “men and women … his or her own” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
1CO	7	7	zima	figs-metaphor	χάρισμα	1		Here Paul speaks about the way of life that God has called each person to live in as if it were a **gift** that each person receives from God. By using **gift**, Paul emphasizes that the person receives the **gift** freely from God and that the **gift** is a good thing. If **gift** would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea non-figuratively or with a comparable metaphor. Alternate translation: “blessing” or “calling” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	7	7	w9ld	figs-ellipsis	ὁ μὲν οὕτως, ὁ δὲ οὕτως	1	But each one has his own gift from God. One has this kind of gift, and another that kind	Here Paul omits some words that may be necessary in your language to make a complete thought. If your language needs more words, you could include a phrase such as “acts in” or “live in.” Alternate translation: “one indeed acts in this way, and another acts in that way” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
1CO	7	8	y6lc	translate-unknown	τοῖς ἀγάμοις	1		Here, **unmarried** could refer to (1) people who are not currently married, whether they never have been married or are no longer married. Alternate translation: “to those without spouses” (2) men whose wives have died, which pairs well with **widows**. Alternate translation: “to the widowers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	7	8	n401	figs-nominaladj	τοῖς ἀγάμοις	1		Paul is using the adjective **unmarried** as a noun in order to describe a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate **unmarried** with a noun phrase or a relative clause. Alternate translation: “to those who are unmarried” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
1CO	7	8	s7s9	translate-unknown	ταῖς χήραις	1		Here, **widows** refers specifically to women whose husbands have died. It does not refer to men whose wives have died. Alternate translation: “to women who are widowed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	7	8	f43d	grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical	ἐὰν	1		Here, Paul uses **if** to introduce a true possibility. He means that people might **remain** as Paul is or they might not. He specifies that it is **good** if they do **remain**. If this form would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the **if** statement by using a relative clause. Alternate translation: “whenever” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical]])
1CO	7	8	r27x	figs-explicit	μείνωσιν ὡς κἀγώ	1	it is good	Just as in [7:7](../07/07.md), Paul again assumes that his readers know that he is unmarried. When Paul says that it is good for **the unmarried** and **the widows** to **remain as I also am**, he is referring to how he is unmarried. If **remain as I also am** would be misunderstood in your language, you could include the fact that Paul is not married. Alternate translation: “remain without a spouse as I also am” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	7	9	o4j5	grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical	εἰ…οὐκ ἐνκρατεύονται, γαμησάτωσαν	1		Here, Paul uses **if** to introduce a true possibility. He means that people might **have self-control** or they might not. Here he gives instructions for if they **do not have self-control**. If this form would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the **if** statement by using a relative clause. Alternate translation: “whoever does not have self-control should marry” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical]])
1CO	7	9	bxa2	figs-abstractnoun	οὐκ ἐνκρατεύονται	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **self-control**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “self-controlled” or a verbal phrase such as “control themselves.” Alternate translation: “they are not self-controlled” or “they do not control themselves” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1CO	7	9	jy8g	figs-imperative	γαμησάτωσαν	1		Here, Paul uses a third person imperative. If you have third person imperatives in your language, you could use one here. If you do not have third person imperatives, you could express the idea using a word such as “let” or “should,” as the ULT does. Alternate translation: “let them marry” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
1CO	7	9	ty79	figs-metaphor	πυροῦσθαι	1	to burn with desire	Here, **to burn** is a way to refer to sexual desire. Paul uses **burn** because he represents the desire as hard to fight and as something that consumes a person like fire consumes a building. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea with a comparable metaphor or by including a reference to sexual desire. Alternate translation: “to burn with desire” or “to lust after someone” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	7	10	gxni	figs-nominaladj	τοῖς…γεγαμηκόσιν	1		Paul is using the adjective **married** as a noun in order to describe a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate **married** with a noun phrase or a relative clause. Alternate translation: “to those who are married” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
1CO	7	10	zwgk	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	οὐκ ἐγὼ, ἀλλὰ ὁ Κύριος	1		Here Paul clarifies that he is not the authority behind this command. It is **the Lord** who is the authority here. Paul specifically has in mind what **the Lord** said about marriage and divorce while he was on earth (see [Mark 10:5–12](mrk/10/05.md)). If **not I, but the Lord** would be misunderstood in your language, you could either identify that it is not Paul “alone” who gives the command, or you could clarify that Paul is referring to what **the Lord** said. Alternate translation: “not I alone, but the Lord also” or “and here I refer to what the Lord said” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
1CO	7	10	ywsy	figs-genericnoun	γυναῖκα ἀπὸ ἀνδρὸς	1		Here Paul is speaking of wives and husbands in general, not just of one **wife** and **husband**. If **wife** and **husband** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable way to refer generically to wives and husbands. Alternate translation: “each wife … from her husband” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])
1CO	7	10	hc5p	figs-idiom	ἀπὸ…μὴ χωρισθῆναι	1	should not separate from	Here, **to be separated from** is technical language for ending a marriage before death. The phrase does not distinguish between “separation” and “divorce.” If possible, use a similar general phrase in your language. Alternate translation: “is not to divorce or separate from” or “it not to break up with” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1CO	7	10	h049	figs-activepassive	μὴ χωρισθῆναι	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “is not to separate” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1CO	7	11	wtbo	figs-infostructure	ἐὰν δὲ καὶ χωρισθῇ, μενέτω ἄγαμος ἢ τῷ ἀνδρὶ καταλλαγήτω	1		The ULT puts this clause in parentheses because it is a qualification of what Paul said in [7:11](../07/11.md) and because one can read [7:10–11](../07/10.md) smoothly together without this clause. In this clause, Paul issues commands about what the wife is supposed to do if the divorces her husband despite what Paul has said. Use a form in your language that would indicate a qualification or a parenthesis. Alternate translation: “if she is separated despite what I have said, let her remain unmarried, or let her be reconciled to the husband” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
1CO	7	11	r5oz	figs-genericnoun	χωρισθῇ…τῷ ἀνδρὶ…ἄνδρα…γυναῖκα	1		Here Paul is speaking of wives and husbands in general, not just of one **wife** and **husband**. If **wife** and **husband** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable way to refer generically to wives and husbands. Alternate translation: “one of the wives might be separated … to her husband … each husband … his wife” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])
1CO	7	11	pqr9	grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical	ἐὰν δὲ καὶ χωρισθῇ, μενέτω	1		Here, Paul uses **even if** to introduce a true possibility. He means that a wife **might be separated** or she might not. He then specifies the result for if **she** is **separated**. If this form would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the if statement by introducing it with a word such as “whenever” or with a relative clause. Alternate translation: “but let whichever wife might be separated remain” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical]])
1CO	7	11	phpw	figs-activepassive	χωρισθῇ	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “she separates” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1CO	7	11	lj79	figs-ellipsis	χωρισθῇ	1		Here Paul omits some words that might be needed in your language to make a complete thought. Paul omits them because he already used them in [7:10](../07/10.md) and he assumes his audience will infer them from there. If you need to include these words, you can insert the words “from her husband.” Alternate translation: “she might be separated from her husband” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
1CO	7	11	tvo2	figs-imperative	μενέτω ἄγαμος ἢ τῷ ἀνδρὶ καταλλαγήτω	1		Here Paul uses two third person imperatives. If you have third person imperatives in your language, you could use them here. If you do not have third person imperatives, you could express the idea by using a word such as “should” or “must.” Alternate translation: “she must remain unmarried, or she must be reconciled to the husband” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
1CO	7	11	lxf7	figs-activepassive	τῷ ἀνδρὶ καταλλαγήτω	1	be reconciled to her husband	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “let her reconcile with the husband” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1CO	7	11	k7ju		ἄνδρα γυναῖκα μὴ ἀφιέναι	1		Alternate translation: “a husband should not divorce a wife”
1CO	7	12	k9yd		τοῖς…λοιποῖς	1	agrees	Here, **the rest** could refer to (1) people in other situations than those already named, particularly those who are married to an unbelieving spouse. Alternate translation: “to the rest of those who are married” (2) everything else Paul is about to say. Alternate translation: “about other situations”
1CO	7	12	xn88	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	ἐγώ, οὐχ ὁ Κύριος	1		Here **I, not the Lord** is the opposite of what Paul said in [7:10](../07/10.md). Paul wishes to clarify that he is the authority behind this command. Of course, **the Lord** made him an apostle and gave him authority, but he wants the Corinthians to know that he is speaking out of that authority here and not referring to what **the Lord** said while he was on earth. If **I, not the Lord** would be misunderstood in your language, you could either identify that it is Paul “alone” who gives the command, or you could clarify that **the Lord** did not say anything about this topic. Alternate translation: “I alone” or “on my own authority, since the Lord did not speak about this topic” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
1CO	7	12	rrfp	grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical	εἴ τις ἀδελφὸς γυναῖκα ἔχει ἄπιστον, καὶ αὕτη συνευδοκεῖ οἰκεῖν μετ’ αὐτοῦ, μὴ ἀφιέτω	1		Here, Paul uses **if** to introduce a true possibility. He means that a **brother** might have **an unbelieving wife**, and she might agree **to live with him**, or this situation might not happen. He then specifies the result for if this situation does happen. If this form would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the **if** statement by introducing it with a word such as “whenever” or by using a relative clause. Alternate translation: “but let any brother who has an unbelieving wife who agrees to live with him not divorce” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/fgrammar-connect-condition-hypothetical]])
1CO	7	12	ae1u	figs-idiom	οἰκεῖν μετ’ αὐτοῦ	1		Here, **to live with him** refers to staying married. If **to live with him** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable idiom that refers to staying married. Alternate translation: “to stay with him” or “to remain married to him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1CO	7	12	jej3	figs-imperative	μὴ ἀφιέτω αὐτήν	1		Here Paul uses a third person imperative. If you have third person imperatives in your language, you could use one here. If you do not have third person imperatives, you could express the idea using a word such as “must” or “should.” Alternate translation: “he must not divorce her” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
1CO	7	13	gtxx	grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical	γυνὴ εἴ τις ἔχει ἄνδρα ἄπιστον, καὶ οὗτος συνευδοκεῖ οἰκεῖν μετ’ αὐτῆς, μὴ ἀφιέτω	1		Here, Paul uses **if** to introduce a true possibility. He means that a **woman** might have **an unbelieving husband**, and he might agree **to live with her**, or this situation might not happen. He then specifies the result for if this situation does happen. If this form would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the **if** statement by introducing it with a word such as “whenever” or by using a relative clause. Alternate translation: “but let any woman who has an unbelieving husband who agrees to live with her not divorce” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical]])
1CO	7	13	q39l	figs-idiom	οἰκεῖν μετ’ αὐτῆς	1		Here, **to live with her** refers to staying married. If **to live with her** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable idiom that refers to staying married. Alternate translation: “to stay with her” or “to remain married to her” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1CO	7	13	fsbq	figs-imperative	μὴ ἀφιέτω τὸν ἄνδρα	1		Here Paul uses a third person imperative. If you have third person imperatives in your language, you could use one here. If you do not have third person imperatives, you could express the idea using a word such as “must” or “should.” Alternate translation: “she must not divorce the husband” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
1CO	7	14	hv30	grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1		Here, **For** introduces the reason or basis for Paul’s commands in [7:12–13](../07/12.md). When one spouse is not a believer, Paul wants them to stay together, and the reason is that the unbelieving spouse is **sanctified**. If **For** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces the basis for a command. Alternate translation: “You should do this because” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
1CO	7	14	k0qs	figs-genericnoun	ὁ ἀνὴρ ὁ ἄπιστος ἐν τῇ γυναικί…ἡ γυνὴ ἡ ἄπιστος ἐν τῷ ἀδελφῷ	1		Here Paul is speaking of wives and husbands in general, not just of one **wife** and **husband**. If **wife** and **husband** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable way to refer generically to wives and husbands. Alternate translation: “any unbelieving husband … through his wife … any unbelieving wife … through her husband” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])
1CO	7	14	l84p	figs-activepassive	ἡγίασται…ὁ ἀνὴρ ὁ ἄπιστος ἐν τῇ γυναικί; καὶ ἡγίασται ἡ γυνὴ ἡ ἄπιστος ἐν τῷ ἀδελφῷ	1	For the unbelieving husband is set apart because of his wife	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Paul implies that “God” did it. Alternate translation: “God sanctifies the unbelieving husband through the wife, and God sanctifies the unbelieving wife through the brother” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1CO	7	14	b9rb	translate-unknown	ἡγίασται	-1		Here, **sanctified** is a reference to purity. It does not mean that the **unbelieving husband** or **unbelieving wife** is considered to be a believer. Rather, Paul’s point is that believing spouse is not made unclean by the unbelieving spouse. Just the opposite: the marriage is clean and pure because of the believing spouse. If **sanctified** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word or phrase that identifies an acceptable or pure marriage partner. Alternate translation: “is made clean … is made clean” or “is considered an acceptable spouse … is considered an acceptable spouse” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	7	14	i1x4	figs-explicit	τῷ ἀδελφῷ	1	the brother	Here, **the brother** refers to a believing man, in this case the believing husband. If **the brother** would be misunderstood in your language, you could clarify that **the brother** is the **unbelieving wife**’s spouse. Alternate translation: “the husband” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	7	14	x9vy	figs-explicit	ἐπεὶ ἄρα τὰ τέκνα ὑμῶν ἀκάθαρτά ἐστιν	1		Here, **Otherwise** refers to what the situation would be like if what Paul has just said were not true. Paul does not actually think that **your children are unclean**, but that would be true if he was wrong about the unbelieving spouse being **sanctified**. If **Otherwise** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a form that refers to a situation that the author thinks is not true. Alternate translation: “If that were not so, your children would be unclean” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-contrary]])
1CO	7	14	iy14	figs-123person	ὑμῶν	1		Here, **your** refers to anyone among the Corinthians who has an unbelieving spouse. Thus, it refers back to **the wife** and **the brother**. If your language would not use **your** in this situation, you could use **their** instead. Alternate translation: “their” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
1CO	7	14	qtbz	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	νῦν δὲ ἅγιά ἐστιν	1		Here, **but now** provides the contrast with **Otherwise your children are unclean**. The word **now** does not refer to time but rather identifies that what Paul has said about the unbelieving spouse being **sanctified** really is true. If **now** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word or phrase that identifies that what Paul has said is true. Alternate translation: “but since the unbelieving spouse is sanctified, they are holy” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
1CO	7	14	fmu5	translate-unknown	ἀκάθαρτά…ἅγιά	1	they are set apart	Here, **holy** is a reference to purity, and **unclean** is a reference to impurity. The word **holy** does not mean that the **children** are considered to be believers. Rather, Paul’s point is that the **children** are not made **unclean** by having an unbelieving parent. Just the opposite: the **children** are clean and pure because of the believing parent. If **unclean** and **holy** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use words or phrases that identify the **children** as those born in a “clean” or “honorable” way. Alternate translation: “not pure … pure” or “dishonored … honorable” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	7	15	rdwy	grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical	εἰ…ὁ ἄπιστος χωρίζεται, χωριζέσθω	1		Here, Paul uses **if** to introduce a true possibility. He means that **the unbeliever** might depart, or he or she might not. He then specifies the result for if **the unbeliever departs**. If this form would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the **if** statement by using a relative clause. Alternate translation: “whichever unbeliever departs, let him go” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical]])
1CO	7	15	qjmw	figs-idiom	εἰ…ὁ ἄπιστος χωρίζεται, χωριζέσθω	1		Here, **departs** refers breaking the marriage, that is, leaving the spouse. The phrase **let him go** refers to allowing the spouse to break the marriage or leave. If these words would not refer to breaking a marriage or getting divorced in your language, you could use a comparable expression. Alternate translation: “if the unbeliever wants a divorce, let him divorce you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1CO	7	15	t5tf	figs-gendernotations	ὁ ἄπιστος…χωριζέσθω	1		Although **him** is masculine, Paul is using it to refer back to **the unbeliever**, which could refer to either a man or a woman. If **him** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a non-gendered word or refer to both genders. Alternate translation: “the unbeliever … let him or her go” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
1CO	7	15	uefj	figs-genericnoun	ὁ ἄπιστος…ὁ ἀδελφὸς ἢ ἡ ἀδελφὴ	1		Here Paul is speaking of unbelievers, brothers, and sisters in general and not of just one **unbeliever**, **brother**, or **sister**. If these words would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable way to refer generically to unbelievers, brothers, and sisters. Alternate translation: “one of the unbelievers … the brother or the sister involved” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])
1CO	7	15	h9qc	figs-imperative	χωριζέσθω	1		Here, Paul uses a third person imperative. If you have third person imperatives in your language, you could use one here. If you do not have third person imperatives, you could express the idea using a word such as “should” or “allow.” Alternate translation: “allow him to go” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
1CO	7	15	jef4	figs-metaphor	οὐ δεδούλωται ὁ ἀδελφὸς ἢ ἡ ἀδελφὴ	1	In such cases, the brother or sister is not bound to their vows	Here, **bound** could refer to (1) the marriage with an unbelieving spouse. Paul is saying that the **brother or the sister** does not need to try to preserve the marriage. They are not **bound** to the unbeliever but can accept the divorce. Alternate translation: “the brother or the sister is not bound to the unbeliever” (2) the rules that Paul laid out for staying with a spouse in [7:10–13](../07/10.md). Paul is saying that **the brother or the sister** does not have to follow those rules about staying with a spouse, and perhaps he is even saying that they can marry someone else. Alternate translation: “the brother or the sister is not bound to remain unmarried” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	7	15	v76o	figs-explicit	ὁ ἀδελφὸς ἢ ἡ ἀδελφὴ	1	In such cases, the brother or sister is not bound to their vows	Here Paul uses **brother** and **sister** to identify the people involved as believers of both genders. The people he refers to are **brother** and **sister** of the Corinthian believers, not of the **unbeliever**. Rather, **the brother or the sister** is married to the **unbeliever**. If **the brother or the sister** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to believing husbands and wives. Alternate translation: “the believing husband or wife” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	7	15	q6k2	figs-activepassive	οὐ δεδούλωται ὁ ἀδελφὸς ἢ ἡ ἀδελφὴ	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Paul implies that “the marriage” does not bind the **brother** or **sister**. Alternate translation: “the brother or the sister is free” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1CO	7	15	z5nz	grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	2		Here, **but** introduces how Paul wants the Corinthians to act in general. Whether their spouse leaves or not, they should act in **peace**. If **but** would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea by using a word or phrase that introduces a general principle. If you use the following alternate translation, you may need to add period before it. Alternate translation: “In every case,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
1CO	7	15	tli3	figs-abstractnoun	εἰρήνῃ	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **peace**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “peaceful” or an adverb such as “peaceably.” Alternate translation: “act peaceably” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1CO	7	16	l559	figs-yousingular	οἶδας…τὸν ἄνδρα σώσεις…οἶδας…τὴν γυναῖκα σώσεις	1	do you know, woman … you will save your husband … do you know, man … you will save your wife	Here Paul addresses specific individuals within the Corinthian church. Because of this, **you** in this verse is always singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
1CO	7	16	h5td	figs-rquestion	τί…οἶδας, γύναι, εἰ τὸν ἄνδρα σώσεις? ἢ τί οἶδας, ἄνερ, εἰ τὴν γυναῖκα σώσεις?	1	how do you know, woman, whether you will save your husband?	Paul does not ask these questions because he is looking for information. Rather, he asks them to involve the Corinthians in what he is arguing. The questions assume that the answer is “we do not know for sure.” Paul could be using these questions to show the Corinthians that (1) they should have little confidence about unbelieving spouses becoming Christians. The questions thus support how Paul allows divorces initiated by an unbelieving spouse in [6:21](../07/15.md). Alternate translation: “it is unlikely, woman, that you will save the husband. And it is unlikely, man, that you will save the wife.” (2) show the Corinthians that they should have much confidence about unbelieving spouses becoming Christians. The questions thus support how Paul says that the unbelieving spouse is “holy” in [7:14](../07/14.md). Alternate translation: “it is likely, woman, that you will save the husband. And it is likely, man, that you will save the wife.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
1CO	7	16	nd1k	figs-infostructure	τί γὰρ οἶδας, γύναι, εἰ…τί οἶδας, ἄνερ, εἰ	1	how do you know, man, whether you will save your wife?	Here, **woman** and **man** are direct addresses to people in the audience. If your language would put these words someone else in the sentence, you could move them to where they sound natural. Alternate translation: “For woman, how do you know whether… man, how do you know whether” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
1CO	7	16	dbz6		τί…οἶδας, γύναι, εἰ τὸν ἄνδρα σώσεις? ἢ τί οἶδας, ἄνερ, εἰ τὴν γυναῖκα σώσεις?	1	how do you know, man, whether you will save your wife?	Here Paul directly addresses a **woman** and a **man** in the audience. The Corinthians would have understood him to mean a **woman** or **man** in their group who was married to an unbelieving spouse. If **woman** or **man** would be misunderstood in your language, you express the direct address in a different way. Alternate translation: “how does any woman know whether she will save the husband? Or how does any man know whether he will save the wife?”
1CO	7	16	b5zw	figs-genericnoun	γύναι…τὸν ἄνδρα…ἄνερ…τὴν γυναῖκα	1	how do you know, man, whether you will save your wife?	Here, Paul refers to **woman**, **husband**, **man**, and **wife** in the singular, but he is speaking generically of any person who fits into these categories. If your language does not use the singular form to refer to people in general, you could use a form that does refer generically to people in your language. Alternate translation: “each of you women … your husband … each of you men … your wife” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])
1CO	7	16	jt3c	figs-metonymy	σώσεις	-1	how do you know, man, whether you will save your wife?	Here Paul speaks of husbands or wives leading their spouses to faith in Jesus as “saving” them. By this, Paul means that the **woman** or **man** is the means by which God will **save** the **husband** or **wife**. If **you will save** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to leading someone towards “salvation,” that is, helping them to believe in Jesus. Alternate translation: “God will use you to save … God will use you to save” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1CO	7	17	ivee	grammar-connect-words-phrases	εἰ μὴ	1	each one	Here, **However** acknowledges the exception about “walking” **as the Lord has assigned to each one** that he just included: if an unbelieving spouse wishes to divorce a believing spouse, that is permissible. Paul acknowledges this exception but wishes to emphasize the main point: the believers should remain in the state they are in. If **However** would not have the meaning of acknowledging an exception to a claim, you could use a word or phrase that does do so. Alternate translation: “In every other case” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
1CO	7	17	l5lu	figs-infostructure	ἑκάστῳ ὡς ἐμέρισεν ὁ Κύριος, ἕκαστον ὡς κέκληκεν ὁ Θεός, οὕτως περιπατείτω	1	each one	If your language would state the command to **walk** before explaining how to **walk**, you could rearrange these clauses so that they read more naturally. Alternate translation: “let each one walk as the Lord has assigned to each one, as God has called each one” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
1CO	7	17	ya76	figs-ellipsis	ὡς ἐμέρισεν ὁ Κύριος	1	each one	Here, Paul omits some words that might be needed in your language to make a complete sentence. If necessary, you could include what it is that **the Lord has assigned** by using a word such as “task” or “position.” Alternate translation: “as the Lord has assigned a position” or “as the Lord has assigned a task” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
1CO	7	17	hl43	figs-metaphor	περιπατείτω	1	each one	Paul speaks of behavior in life as if it were “walking.” If **let him walk** would not be understood as a description of a person’s way of life in your language, you could express the idea non-figuratively or with a comparable metaphor. Alternate translation: “let him live his life” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	7	17	c7b9	figs-imperative	περιπατείτω	1	each one	Here, Paul uses a third person imperative. If you have third person imperatives in your language, you could use one here. If you do not have third person imperatives, you could express the idea using a word such as “should” or “must.” Alternate translation: “he must walk” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
1CO	7	17	o6v2	figs-gendernotations	περιπατείτω	1	each one	Here, **he** is written in masculine form, but it refers to anyone, no matter what their gender might be. If the meaning of **he** would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea by using a word that does not have gender or you could use both genders. Alternate translation: “let him or her walk” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
1CO	7	17	iid2		καὶ οὕτως ἐν ταῖς ἐκκλησίαις πάσαις διατάσσομαι	1	I direct in this way in all the churches	Alternate translation: “This is what I require from all the churches”
1CO	7	18	zo3j	figs-gendernotations	μὴ ἐπισπάσθω…μὴ περιτεμνέσθω	1	Was anyone called when he was circumcised?	Here Paul is speaking of male circumcision only. Therefore, the masculine words in this verse should be retained in translation if possible. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
1CO	7	18	unc4	figs-rquestion	περιτετμημένος τις ἐκλήθη? μὴ ἐπισπάσθω	1	Was anyone called when he was circumcised?	Paul does not ask this question because he is looking for information. Rather, he asks it to identify people who fit into the situation he describes. If someone answered “yes” to this question, then the following command applies to them. If this question would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a different way to identify to whom the command applies. Alternate translation: “If anyone was called, having been circumcised, let him not be uncircumcised.” or “Some of you were called, having been circumcised. If that is you, do not be uncircumcised.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
1CO	7	18	gpav	figs-activepassive	τις ἐκλήθη…κέκληταί τις	1	Was anyone called when he was circumcised?	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Paul implies that “God” did it. Alternate translation: “Did God call anyone … Did God call anyone” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1CO	7	18	xt7p	figs-activepassive	περιτετμημένος	1	Was anyone called when he was circumcised?	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, use an indefinite or vague subject. Alternate translation: “someone having circumcised them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1CO	7	18	tkn4	translate-unknown	μὴ ἐπισπάσθω	1	Was anyone called when he was circumcised?	To **be uncircumcised** refers to a physical procedure by which one could make one’s penis appear to have a foreskin, even though one had been circumcised. If your language has a word for this procedure, you could use it here. If your language does not have such a word, you could use a phrase that identifies this procedure. Alternate translation: “Let him not hide his circumcision” or “Let him not undo his circumcision” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	7	18	cejz	figs-imperative	μὴ ἐπισπάσθω…μὴ περιτεμνέσθω	1	Was anyone called when he was circumcised?	In this verse, Paul uses two third person imperative. If you have third person imperatives in your language, you could use them here. If you do not have third person imperatives, you could express the ideas using a word such as “should” or “must.” Alternate translation: “He must not be uncircumcised … he must not be circumcised” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
1CO	7	18	uwuw	figs-activepassive	μὴ ἐπισπάσθω…μὴ περιτεμνέσθω	1	Was anyone called when he was circumcised?

1CO	7	18	fqv6	figs-rquestion	ἐν ἀκροβυστίᾳ κέκληταί τις? μὴ περιτεμνέσθω	1	Was anyone called in uncircumcision?	Paul does not ask this question because he is looking for information. Rather, he asks it to identify people who fit into the situation he describes. If someone answered “yes” to this question, then the following command applies to them. If this question would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a different way to identify to whom the command applies. Alternate translation: “If anyone was called in uncircumcision, let him not be circumcised.” or “Some of you were called in uncircumcision.

1CO	7	18	a8g3	figs-abstractnouns	ἐν ἀκροβυστίᾳ	1	Was anyone called in uncircumcision?

1CO	7	19	oajz	figs-hyperbole	ἡ περιτομὴ οὐδέν ἐστιν, καὶ ἡ ἀκροβυστία οὐδέν ἐστιν	1	Was anyone called in uncircumcision?	Here Paul says that both **Circumcision** and **uncircumcision** are **nothing**. He does not mean that **Circumcision** and **uncircumcision** do not exist. Rather, the Corinthians would have understand him to mean that **Circumcision** and **uncircumcision** do not have value or importance. If **nothing** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable figure of speech or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “Circumcision has no value, and uncircumcision has no value” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
1CO	7	19	focy	figs-parallelism	ἡ περιτομὴ οὐδέν ἐστιν, καὶ ἡ ἀκροβυστία οὐδέν ἐστιν	1	Was anyone called in uncircumcision?	Here Paul repeats **is nothing** for rhetorical effect. The repetition makes his argument sound stronger. If your language does not use repetition in this way, you could combine the two clauses and make the claim sound strong by using some other method. Alternate translation: “Neither circumcision nor uncircumcision is anything”” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
1CO	7	19	eku9	figs-abstractnouns	ἡ περιτομὴ…ἡ ἀκροβυστία	1	Was anyone called in uncircumcision?

1CO	7	19	nc2u	figs-ellipsis	τήρησις ἐντολῶν Θεοῦ	1	Was anyone called in uncircumcision?	Here Paul omits some words that may be necessary in your language to complete the thought. If your language does require more words, you could infer them from the first half of the verse. Alternate translation: “observance of the commandments of God is everything” or “observance of the commandments of God is important” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
1CO	7	19	vx9p	figs-abstractnouns	τήρησις ἐντολῶν	1	Was anyone called in uncircumcision?

If your language would structure this sentence in a different way, you could rearrange the elements so that they sound more natural. Paul has arranged the elements to emphasize **in the calling in which he was called**, so retain the emphasis on this element if possible. Alternate translation: “Let each one remain in the calling in which he was called” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])

1CO	7	20	hrqk	figs-metaphor	ἐν ταύτῃ μενέτω	1	in the calling … he should remain	Here, **remain in** refers to faithfully serving God in a specific situation. In other words, Paul does not want them to try to change their social and economic situation. Instead, they should serve God in the situation in which God **called** them. If **remain in** would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea non-figuratively or with a comparable metaphor. Alternate translation: “let him live his life in that” or “let him be content in that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	7	21	ag5a	figs-yousingular	ἐκλήθης…σοι…δύνασαι	1	Were you … called you? Do not be … you can become	Here Paul addresses specific individuals within the Corinthian church. Because of this, **you** in this verse is always singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
1CO	7	21	nli9	figs-rquestion	δοῦλος ἐκλήθης? μή σοι μελέτω	1	Were you a slave when God called you? Do not be concerned	Paul does not ask this question because he is looking for information.

If this question would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a different way to identify to whom the command applies. Alternate translation: “If you were called as a slave, let it not be a concern to you.” or “Some of you were called as slaves. If that is you, let it not be a concern to you.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
1CO	7	21	emau	figs-activepassive	ἐκλήθης	1	Were you a slave when God called you?

1CO	7	21	l8qt	figs-imperative	μή σοι μελέτω	1	Were you a slave when God called you? Do not be concerned	Here, Paul uses a third person imperative. If you have third person imperatives in your language, you could use one here. If you do not have third person imperatives, you could express the idea using a word such as “should,” or you could rephrase the imperative. Alternate translation: “Do not be concerned about it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])

Do not be concerned	Here, Paul uses **if** to introduce a true possibility. He means that a person might be **able to become free**, or that person might not. He then specifies the result for if someone is **able to become free**. If this form would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the **if** statement by using a relative clause. Alternate translation: “indeed whoever is able to become free should take advantage of it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical]])
1CO	7	21	h7e1		χρῆσαι	1	Were you a slave when God called you? Do not be concerned	Alternate translation: “use the opportunity that you have”
1CO	7	22	mgt6	grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	the Lord’s freeman	Here, **For** provides support for the claim that Paul made at the beginning of the previous verse that those who are slaves should not be concerned by that ([7:21](../07/21.md)). If this connection would be misunderstood in your language, you could make what **For** supports explicit. Alternate translation: “Do not be concerned about being a slave because” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
1CO	7	22	l6vq	figs-activepassive	ὁ…ἐν Κυρίῳ κληθεὶς…ὁ…κληθεὶς	1	the Lord’s freeman	If your language does not use the passive form in these ways, you could express the ideas in active form or in other ways that are natural in your language.

1CO	7	22	gy9z	figs-metaphor	ἐν Κυρίῳ	1	the Lord’s freeman	Here Paul uses the spatial metaphor **in the Lord** to describe the union of believers with Christ. In this case, being **in the Lord**, or united to the Lord, identifies the person **who was called** as someone who is united to the **Lord**. Alternate translation: “to be united to the Lord” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	7	22	ie5k	figs-possession	ἀπελεύθερος Κυρίου	1	the Lord’s freeman	Here Paul uses the possessive form to describe someone who is a **freedman** in the perspective of **the Lord**. In other words, while the person may be a slave in terms of human thinking, that person is a **freedman** before **the Lord**. If your language you would not use the possessive form to express that idea, you could express the idea by speaking about the Lord’s “perspective” or “sight.” Alternate translation: “is a freedman in the Lord’s eyes” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
1CO	7	22	npb1	figs-possession	δοῦλός…Χριστοῦ	1	the Lord’s freeman	Here Paul uses the possessive form to describe someone who is a **slave** who belongs to **Christ**. In other words, while the person may be free in terms of human thinking, that person is a **slave** in relationship to **Christ**. If your language you would not use the possessive form to express that idea, you could express the idea by using a phrase such as “belonging to.” Alternate translation: “a slave who belongs to Christ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
1CO	7	23	m53p	figs-activepassive	τιμῆς ἠγοράσθητε	1	You have been bought with a price	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Paul implies that “God” did it. Alternate translation: “God bought you with a price” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1CO	7	23	sgft	figs-metaphor	τιμῆς ἠγοράσθητε	1	You have been bought with a price	Here Paul speaks if the Corinthians were slaves whom God had **bought with a price** from someone else. Paul is speaking of what we often call “redemption.” The **price** is Christ’s death on the cross, which “redeems” believers from sin and evil powers. This is an important biblical metaphor, so if possible preserve the metaphor or express it as an analogy. Alternate translation: “you were bought with a price, which is the Messiah’s death” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	7	23	pe5g	figs-metaphor	μὴ γίνεσθε δοῦλοι ἀνθρώπων	1	You have been bought with a price	Here Paul uses **slaves** as a description of anyone who follows and obeys someone else. Paul wants the Corinthians, whether they are **slaves** or “freedmen” in social and economic terms, to only obey and serve God, not **men**. If **slaves** would be misunderstood in your language, you could clarify that Paul has “serving” and “obeying” in mind. Alternate translation: “do not obey men” or “do not serve mere humans” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	7	23	pjgp	figs-gendernotations	ἀνθρώπων	1	You have been bought with a price	Although the word translated **men** is masculine, Paul is using it to refer to anyone, whether man or woman. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a non-gendered word or refer to both genders. Alternate translation: “of people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
1CO	7	24	jio8			0	General Information	This verse is very similar to [7:20](../07/20.md).
1CO	7	24	s3ms	figs-infostructure	ἕκαστος ἐν ᾧ ἐκλήθη…ἐν τούτῳ μενέτω παρὰ Θεῷ.	1	Brothers	The order of elements in this sentence might be confusing in your language. If your language would structure this sentence in a different way, you could rearrange the elements so that they sound more natural. Paul has arranged the elements to emphasize **each one in that which he was called**, so retain the emphasis on this element if possible. Alternate translation: “let each one remain with God in that which he was called” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
1CO	7	24	yrp9		ἐν ᾧ ἐκλήθη	1	Brothers	Alternate translation: “in that which God gave to him” or “in what he received from God”
1CO	7	24	qu1l	figs-gendernotations	ἐκλήθη, ἀδελφοί…μενέτω	1	Brothers	Although **brothers**, **he**, and **him** are masculine, Paul is using these words to refer to any believer, whether man or woman. If **brothers**, **he**, and **him** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use non-gendered words or refer to both genders. Alternate translation: “brothers and sisters … he or she was called, let him or her remain” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
1CO	7	24	c83e	figs-activepassive	ἐκλήθη	1	was called	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Paul implies that “God” did it. Alternate translation: “God called him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1CO	7	24	ghrk	figs-imperative	μενέτω	1	was called	Here, Paul uses a third person imperative. If you have third person imperatives in your language, you could use one here. If you do not have third person imperatives, you could express the idea using a word such as “should” or “must.” Alternate translation: “he must remain” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
1CO	7	24	wix0	figs-metaphor	ἐν τούτῳ μενέτω παρὰ Θεῷ	1	was called	Here, **remain with God in that** refers to faithfully serving God in a specific situation. In other words, Paul does not want them to try to change their social and economic situation. Instead, they should serve God in the situation in which God called them. If **remain with God in that** would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea non-figuratively or with a comparable metaphor. Alternate translation: “let him live his life with God in that” or “let him be content serving God in that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	7	25	ag3x	grammar-connect-words-phrases	περὶ δὲ	1	Now concerning those who never married, I have no commandment from the Lord	Just as in [7:1](../07/01.md), **Now concerning** introduces a new topic that Paul wishes to address. Likely, the topics that he introduces in this way are what the Corinthians wrote to him about. Translate **Now concerning** here as you did in [7:1](../07/01.md). Alternate translation: “Next, about” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
1CO	7	25	f71a	translate-unknown	ἐπιταγὴν Κυρίου οὐκ ἔχω	1	Now concerning those who never married, I have no commandment from the Lord	Here Paul wishes to clarify that he is speaking out of the authority that he has as an apostle. He is not referring to anything that the Lord said while he was on earth, unlike what Paul did in [7:10](../07/10.md). If **I do not have a command of the Lord** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use the language of “authority” or “quotation.” Alternate translation: “I do not quote from the Lord” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	7	25	q3k1	figs-abstractnouns	ἐπιταγὴν Κυρίου	1	Now concerning those who never married, I have no commandment from the Lord	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **command**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “command.” Alternate translation: “anything that the Lord commanded” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1CO	7	25	vaa4	translate-unknown	γνώμην…δίδωμι	1	I give my opinion	Here **I give an opinion** identifies that Paul is speaking from his own knowledge and authority. He wants the Corinthians to take this as strong advice, not as a command from God. If **I give an opinion** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word or phrase that indicates that what Paul says is not as strong as a command. Alternate translation: “I give my own view” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	7	25	iuyv	figs-abstractnouns	γνώμην…δίδωμι	1	I give my opinion	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **opinion**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “think.” Alternate translation: “I say what I think” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1CO	7	25	qqz7	figs-activepassive	ἠλεημένος ὑπὸ Κυρίου	1	as one who, by the Lord’s mercy, is trustworthy	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must express who did the action, Paul states that “the Lord” did it. Alternate translation: “one to whom the Lord has given mercy” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1CO	7	25	lyqi	figs-abstractnouns	ἠλεημένος ὑπὸ Κυρίου	1	as one who, by the Lord’s mercy, is trustworthy	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **mercy**, you could express the idea by using a adverb such as “mercifully” or an adjective such as “merciful.” Alternate translation: “having received what the Lord has mercifully done to make me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1CO	7	26	zf3o	grammar-connect-words-phrases	οὖν	1	as one who, by the Lord’s mercy, is trustworthy	Here, **Therefore** does not refer back to how Paul has received mercy from God. Rather, **Therefore** introduces the “opinion” that Paul said he was going to “give” ([725](../07/25.md)). If **Therefore** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a statement that one has already spoken about. Alternate translation: “Here is my opinion:” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
1CO	7	26	hq08	figs-doublet	τοῦτο καλὸν ὑπάρχειν διὰ τὴν ἐνεστῶσαν ἀνάγκην, ὅτι καλὸν	1	as one who, by the Lord’s mercy, is trustworthy	Here Paul repeats **good** because in his language it was a natural way to remind the reader that he had already said **this is good**. If your language would not use repetition in this way, you could use only one **good**. Alternate translation: “that, because of the coming distress, {it is} good” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
1CO	7	26	kqxa	figs-infostructure	τοῦτο καλὸν ὑπάρχειν διὰ τὴν ἐνεστῶσαν ἀνάγκην, ὅτι καλὸν ἀνθρώπῳ τὸ οὕτως εἶναι	1	as one who, by the Lord’s mercy, is trustworthy	Here Paul interrupts his sentence to include the reason why he thinks that this is **good** advice. He does this to emphasize **the coming distress**. If Paul’s structure would be misunderstood in your language, you could rearrange the sentence and represent the emphasis on **the coming crisis** in another way. Alternate translation: “that it is good for a man to remain as he is. This is because of the coming distress” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
1CO	7	26	lvoc	translate-unknown	τὴν ἐνεστῶσαν ἀνάγκην	1	as one who, by the Lord’s mercy, is trustworthy	Here, **coming** could refer to (1) something that is about to happen.

1CO	7	26	ikl6	figs-gendernotations	ἀνθρώπῳ…τὸ οὕτως	1	as one who, by the Lord’s mercy, is trustworthy	Here, the words translated **man** and **he** are written in masculine form, but they refer to anyone, no matter what their gender might be. If the meaning of **man** and **he** would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea by using words that do not have gender or you could use both genders. Alternate translation: “for a person … as he or she is” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
1CO	7	26	r3xs		τὸ οὕτως εἶναι	1	as one who, by the Lord’s mercy, is trustworthy	Alternate translation: “to stay in the position he is in”
1CO	7	27	a77x	figs-yousingular	δέδεσαι…λέλυσαι	1	General Information:	Here Paul addresses specific individuals within the Corinthian church. Because of this, **you** in this verse is always singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
1CO	7	27	k9td	figs-rquestion	δέδεσαι γυναικί? μὴ ζήτει…λέλυσαι ἀπὸ γυναικός? μὴ ζήτει	1	Are you married to a wife? Do not	Paul does not ask these questions because he is looking for information. Rather, he asks them to identify people who fit into the situations he describes. If someone answered “yes” to one of these questions, then the following command applies to that person. If these questions would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a different way to identify to whom the command applies. Alternate translation: “If you are bound to a woman, do not seek … If you are released from a woman, do not seek” or “Some of you are bound to a woman. If that is you, do not seek … Some of you are released from a woman. If that is you, do not seek” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

1CO	7	27	cgc7	figs-activepassive	μὴ ζήτει λύσιν. λέλυσαι ἀπὸ γυναικός	1	Do not seek a divorce	If your language does not use the passive form in these ways, you could express the ideas in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the actions, Paul implies that either **you** or a “judge” did it. Alternate translation: “Do not seek to break up. Do you have no woman” or “Do not seek for a judge to release you. Has a judge released you from a woman” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1CO	7	27	d79c	figs-idiom	μὴ ζήτει γυναῖκα	1	do not seek a wife	Here, to **seek a woman** refers to searching for a **woman** to marry.

1CO	7	28	hi7o	figs-yousingular	γαμήσῃς, οὐχ ἥμαρτες	1	I want to spare you from this	Here Paul addresses specific men within the Corinthian church. Because of this, **you** here is singular. The **you** at the end of the verse is plural because it has both the men and the women in mind. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
1CO	7	28	c66v	grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical	ἐὰν…καὶ γαμήσῃς, οὐχ ἥμαρτες	1	I want to spare you from this	Here, Paul uses **if** to introduce a true possibility. He means that a man might **marry**, or a man might not. He then specifies the result for if the man does **marry**. If this form would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the **if** statement by using a relative clause. Alternate translation: “whichever man does indeed marry has not sinned” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical]])
1CO	7	28	ad8m	grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical	ἐὰν γήμῃ ἡ παρθένος, οὐχ ἥμαρτεν	1	I want to spare you from this	Here, Paul uses **if** to introduce a true possibility.

The phrase does not refer to marital problems or fights with one’s spouse. Rather, it refers to extra **distress** that married people will experience while suffering under persecution and troubles. If **distress in the flesh** would be misunderstood in your language, refer to how you translated “the coming distress” in [7:26](../07/26.md) and make the connection to that phrase clear. Alternate translation: “will experience the distress in the flesh that I have already said is coming” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

1CO	7	29	oq9f	writing-pronouns	τοῦτο…φημι	1	The time is short	Here, **this** refers forward to what Paul is about to say. Paul refers to what he will say before he says it in order to emphasize what he is about to say. If your language would not use **this** to refer to something that will soon be said, you could use a word or phrase that does introduces something about to be said and express the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “listen to what I am about to say” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
1CO	7	29	dv1e	figs-gendernotations	ἀδελφοί	1	The time is short	Although **brothers** is masculine, Paul is using it to refer to any believer, whether man or woman.

1CO	7	29	r594	figs-metaphor	ὁ καιρὸς συνεσταλμένος ἐστίν	1	The time is short	When **time is shortened**, an event at the end of that **time** is about to happen.

Paul omits these words because he stated them in the last verse, and the Corinthians would have understood them from that verse. If your language does need these words, you could supply “should be as those” from [7:29](../07/29.md). Alternate translation: “those who weep should as those not weeping; and those who rejoice should be as those not rejoicing; and those who buy should be as those not possessing” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
1CO	7	30	qziw	figs-ellipsis	οἱ ἀγοράζοντες, ὡς μὴ κατέχοντες	1	those who weep	Here Paul omits what the people **buy** and are **possessing**.

1CO	7	31	rhoz	figs-ellipsis	οἱ χρώμενοι τὸν κόσμον, ὡς μὴ καταχρώμενοι	1	those using the world	Here Paul omits some words that may be needed in your language to complete the thought. Paul omits these words because he stated them in [7:29](../07/29.md), and the Corinthians would have understood them from that verse.

1CO	7	32	t4ab	translate-unknown	ἀμερίμνους…μεριμνᾷ	1	free from worries	Here, **free from concern** and **concerned** are opposites. They both refer to consistently thinking about and worrying about things. Paul wishes the Corinthians to think and worry about as few things as possible. In line with that, the only thing the **unmarried man** thinks and cares about is **the things of the Lord**. If **concern** and **concerned** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to thinking and worrying consistently about something. Alternate translation: “free from worry … is worried about” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	7	32	f569	figs-genericnoun	ὁ ἄγαμος	1	concerned about	Here Paul refers to **The unmarried man** in the singular, but he is speaking generically about any **unmarried man**.

1CO	7	36	t87y			0	he is acting improperly toward	This verse has two primary interpretations: (1) the fiancé interpretation, which suggests that the verse is about a man who is engaged to marry a woman. In this case, Paul is saying that the man should marry his fiancée if he thinks he is acting improperly and if she is of a certain age. (2) the father interpretation, which suggests that the verse is about a father who has a daughter. In this case, Paul is saying that the father should allow his daughter to get married if he thinks he is acting improperly and if the daughter is of a certain age. In the notes that follow, I will identify which choices match with which of these two major options.

It is as if they are standing **firm** in a specific location. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea non-figuratively or with a comparable metaphor. Alternate translation: “who settles on a decision” or “firmly decides” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	7	37	uthl	figs-metonymy	ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ αὐτοῦ…ἐν τῇ ἰδίᾳ καρδίᾳ	1		In Paul’s culture, the **heart** is the place where humans think and plan.

The Corinthians would have inferred from the verse that Paul means that keeping **his own virgin** is what he does **well**. If this inference would be misunderstood in your language, you could clarify what is done **well**. Alternate translation: “he is right to do this” or “this is a good choice” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
1CO	7	37	mebk	figs-pastforfuture	ποιήσει	1		Here Paul uses the future tense to identify something that is true in general.

1CO	7	39	d413	figs-metaphor	δέδεται ἐφ’	1	A wife is bound for as long as her husband lives	Here, **bound** refers to the legal and moral obligation to remain married. This obligation is strong enough that Paul can speak about it as if it were a rope that **bound** the man and the woman together. If **bound** would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea non-figuratively or with a comparable metaphor. Alternate translation: “is required to stay with her husband” or “is spoken for” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	7	39	jhq4	figs-activepassive	γυνὴ δέδεται	1	A wife is bound for as long as her husband lives	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Paul implies that ethics or laws did it. Alternate translation: “A wife must remain married” or “God’s law binds a wife” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1CO	7	39	ms7z	grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical	ἐὰν…κοιμηθῇ ὁ ἀνήρ, ἐλευθέρα ἐστὶν	1	for as long as … lives	Here Paul uses **if** to introduce a true possibility. He means that **the husband** might ide, or he might not. He then specifies the result for if **the husband dies**. If this form would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the **if** statement by using a relative clause. Alternate translation: “any wife whose husband dies is free” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical]])
1CO	7	39	f1dy	grammar-connect-exceptions	ἐλευθέρα ἐστὶν ᾧ θέλει γαμηθῆναι, μόνον ἐν Κυρίῳ	1	whomever she wishes	If it would appear in your language that Paul was making a statement here and then contradicting it, you could reword this to avoid using an this form.

1CO	7	40	pse4	figs-explicit	οὕτως μείνῃ	1	lives as she is	Here Paul is referring back to wife whose husband had died from the previous verse ([7:39](../07/39.md)). By **remain as she is**, Paul means “remain unmarried after her husband died.” If **remain as she is** would be misunderstood in your language, you clarify that the wife from the previous verse is in view. Alternate translation: “she remains unmarried” or “she does not marry again” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	7	40	hd7f	figs-explicit	κἀγὼ, Πνεῦμα Θεοῦ ἔχειν	1	happier	This could mean that (1) Paul thinks his **judgment** is backed up by **the Spirit of God**. Alternate translation: “I have the Spirit of God supporting my judgment” (2) Paul wishes to say that he has the **Spirit of God** as much as the Corinthians do.

On food (8:1–11:1)<br>      * The truth about food and idols (8:1–6)<br>      * Respecting the “weak” (8:7–13)<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Things sacrificed to idols<br><br>In Paul’s culture, animals were often sacrificed to the gods. After the animal was slaughtered, the people who were participating in the worship would eat parts of the animal. In fact, for most people who were not wealthy, participating in worship with a sacrifice was one of the few situations in which they could eat meat. Throughout this chapter, Paul explains how the Corinthians should think about eating or not eating this meat. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/falsegod]])<br><br>### The “weak”<br><br>In [8:9](../08/09.md), [11](../08/11.md), Paul speaks about the “weak,” and in [8:7](../08/07.md), [10](../08/10.md), [12](../08/12.md), he mentions a “weak conscience,” which is the conscience of the “weak.” The “weak” person or conscience considers eating things sacrificed to idols to be sinful and participation in idolatry. Perhaps “weak” was a word that the Corinthians were using for fellow believers who were not comfortable eating food sacrificed idols. Paul urges the Corinthians to respect these “weak” people, even if it means never eating meat again. While Paul never uses the word “strong” in this section, the “strong would probably be those who are comfortable eating meat sacrificed to an idol. <br><br>### Knowledge<br><br>Paul refers to “knowledge” in [8:1](../08/01.md), [7](../08/7.md), [10–11](../08/10.md) and to “knowing” in [8:2–4](../08/02.md). Throughout the chapter, the one who has “knowledge” is contrasted with the one who is “weak.” In [8:4–6](../08/04.md), Paul explains what this “knowledge” is about: while other people may name many gods and many lords, believers know that there is only one God and one Lord. Because of this “knowledge,” eating food sacrificed to idols has no significance, since there is only one God and Lord. Paul, however, urges the Corinthians to respect those who do not fully comprehend this “knowledge.” (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/know]])<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Building up<br><br>In [8:1](../08/01.md), Paul contrasts what “knowledge” does (“puffs up”) with what love does (“builds up”). “Building up” in this verse refers to helping other Christians grow in their knowledge of God and care for each other. In [8:10](../08/10.md), however, “building up” has a negative connotation. In this verse, the conscience of the “weak” is “built up,” which means that the “weak” person eats food sacrificed to idols despite his or her conscience says. “Building up” in this verse refers to strengthening a conscience so that one is able to do what one is uncomfortable with. <br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Other “gods” and “lords”<br><br>In [8:4–5](../08/04.md), Paul states that an idol is “nothing.” However, he also acknowledges that there are many so-called “gods” and “lords.” In [10:20–21](../10/20.md), Paul will make his point more clearly: those who sacrifice to idols are actually sacrificing to demons. So, Paul denies the existence of other “gods,” but he thinks that the idols do represent something: demons. In this chapter, you could clarify that Paul is speaking about what other people call “gods” and “lords.” (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/falsegod]])<br>
1CO	8	1	cep1	grammar-connect-words-phrases	περὶ δὲ	1	Now about	Just as in 7:1, **Now about** introduces a new topic that Paul wishes to address. Likely, the topics that he introduces in this way are what the Corinthians wrote to him about. Translate **Now about** here as you translated “now concerning” in [7:1](../07/01.md), [7:25](../07/25.md). Alternate translation: “Next, about” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
1CO	8	1	g5t3	translate-unknown	τῶν εἰδωλοθύτων	1	food sacrificed to idols	Here Paul speaks about animals that are slaughtered, offered to a god, and then eaten. For many people in Paul’s culture, this was the only meat that was available for them to eat. In many cases, people would eat this meat at a god’s temple or shrine. However, sometimes the meat could be sold to people, who would then eat it in their homes. In the next few chapters, Paul will speak about whether and how Christians should eat or not eat this meat. If your language has a specific word or phrase for meat from an animal that has been offered to a god, you could use it here. If your language does not have such a word, you could use a descriptive phrase. Alternate translation: “meat from animals sacrificed to idols” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	8	1	beh8	figs-activepassive	τῶν εἰδωλοθύτων	1	food sacrificed to idols	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, you could use a vague or indefinite subject. Alternate translation: “the things that people have sacrificed to idols” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1CO	8	1	vk06	figs-explicit	οἴδαμεν ὅτι πάντες γνῶσιν ἔχομεν	1	food sacrificed to idols	Here Paul could be (1) expressing his own view about **knowledge**. Alternate translation: “We know that we all indeed have knowledge” (2) quoting what the Corinthians said in their letter so that he can respond to it, much like he did in [6:12–13](../06/12.md); [7:1](../07/01.md). Alternate translation: “you wrote, ‘we know that we all have knowledge.’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	8	1	a6hi	figs-explicit	πάντες γνῶσιν ἔχομεν	1	food sacrificed to idols	Here Paul does not specify what the **knowledge** is about. It becomes clear in [8:4–6](../08/4.md) that Paul is speaking about **knowledge** about other gods, specifically knowing that there is only one God and that other gods do not really exist. If possible, do not give further explanation of **knowledge** here, since Paul explains himself later on in the chapter. If you must specify what the **knowledge** is about, you could clarify that it is about the **idols** or the topic of **things sacrificed to idols**. Alternate translation: “we all have knowledge about idols” or “we all have knowledge about this issue” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	8	1	ytrf	figs-abstractnouns	πάντες γνῶσιν ἔχομεν…ἡ γνῶσις	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **knowledge**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “know.” Alternate translation: “we all know things. Knowing things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1CO	8	1	yw8s	figs-abstractnouns	ἡ δὲ ἀγάπη	1	but love builds up	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **love**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “love.” Alternate translation: “but loving other believers” or “but loving action” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1CO	8	1	an8s	figs-metaphor	ἀγάπη οἰκοδομεῖ	1	love builds up	Paul here speaks as if believers were a building that one **builds up**. With this metaphor, he emphasizes that **love** helps other believers become stronger and more mature, just like building a house makes it strong and complete. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea non-figuratively or with a comparable metaphor. Alternate translation: “love enables other believers to grow” or “love edifies” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	8	2	egjr	grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical	εἴ τις δοκεῖ ἐγνωκέναι τι, οὔπω ἔγνω	1	thinks he knows something	Here Paul uses **if** to introduce a true possibility. He means that someone might think **he knows something**, or that person might not. He then specifies the result for if the person does think **he knows something**. If this form would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the **if** statement by using a relative clause or by introducing the sentence with “whenever.” Alternate translation: “Anyone who thinks he knows something does not yet know” or “Whenever anyone thinks he knows something, he does not yet know” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical]])
1CO	8	2	qbh9	figs-gendernotations	ἐγνωκέναι…οὔπω ἔγνω…δεῖ	1	thinks he knows something	Although **he** is masculine, Paul is using it to refer to anyone, whether man or woman. If **he** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a non-gendered word or refer to both genders. Alternate translation: “he or she knows … he or she does not yet know … he or she ought” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
1CO	8	3	qsa7	grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical	εἰ…τις ἀγαπᾷ τὸν Θεόν, οὗτος ἔγνωσται	1	that person is known by him	Just as in the last verse, here Paul uses **if** to introduce a true possibility. He means that someone might love **God**, or that person might not. He then specifies the result for if the person does love **God**. If this form would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the **if** statement by using a relative clause or by introducing the sentence with “whenever.” Alternate translation: “anyone who loves God is known” or “whenever anyone loves God, that one is known” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical]])
1CO	8	3	etd6	figs-activepassive	οὗτος ἔγνωσται ὑπ’ αὐτοῦ	1	that person is known by him	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “he knows that one” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1CO	8	3	lnwx	writing-pronouns	οὗτος…αὐτοῦ	1	that person is known by him	Here, **that one** refers back to **anyone**, and **him** refers back to **God**. If these pronouns would be misunderstood in your language, you could clarify what they refer to. Alternate translation: “that person … God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
1CO	8	4	v4gx	grammar-connect-words-phrases	περὶ	1	General Information:	Here Paul repeats **about** from [8:1](../08/01.md) to let his readers know that he is going to speak directly about **things sacrificed to idols** again. If the repetition of the phrase from [8:1](../08/01.md) would be misunderstood in your language, you could clarify that Paul is returning to the topic he introduced there. Alternate translation: “returning to” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
1CO	8	4	bgd2	figs-possession	τῆς βρώσεως…τῶν εἰδωλοθύτων	1	General Information:	Here Paul uses the possessive form to speak about **eating** meat **sacrificed to idols**. If your language does not use this form to express that meaning, you could express the idea by using a verbal phrase. Alternate translation: “eating things sacrificed to idols” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
1CO	8	4	wkep	translate-unknown	τῶν εἰδωλοθύτων	1	General Information:	Here, **the things sacrificed to idols** refers to meat that has been offered to an idol. Translate this phrase the same way you did in [8:1](../08/01.md). Alternate translation: “of meat from animals sacrificed to idols” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	8	4	mbqo	figs-activepassive	τῶν εἰδωλοθύτων	1	General Information:	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, you could use a vague or indefinite subject. Alternate translation: “of the things that people have sacrificed to idols” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1CO	8	4	y3ee	figs-explicit	οἴδαμεν ὅτι οὐδὲν εἴδωλον ἐν κόσμῳ, καὶ ὅτι οὐδεὶς Θεὸς εἰ μὴ εἷς	1	We know that an idol in this world is nothing and that there is no God but one	Here Paul could be (1) expressing his own view about **an idol** and **God**. Alternate translation: “We know that an idol in the world indeed {is} nothing that {there is} indeed no God except one” (2) quoting what the Corinthians said in their letter so that he can respond to it, much like he did in [6:12–13](../06/12.md); [7:1](../07/01.md). If you chose this option in [8:1](../08/01.md), you should also choose it here. Alternate translation: “you wrote, ‘we know that an idol in the world {is} nothing’ and, ‘{there is} no God except one’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	8	4	g67g	figs-metaphor	οὐδὲν εἴδωλον ἐν κόσμῳ	1		Here Paul says that **an idol** is **nothing** in order to emphasize that idols are not really gods. He is not saying that images or statues do not exist. If **nothing** would be misunderstood in your language, you could clarify that Paul is speaking about how **an idol** does not have the power or existence of the true God. Alternate translation: “an idol in the world {is} not really a god” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	8	4	w8ar	grammar-connect-exceptions	οὐδεὶς Θεὸς εἰ μὴ εἷς	1		If it would appear in your language that Paul was making a statement here and then contradicting it, you could reword this to avoid using an exception clause. Alternate translation: “{there is} only one God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-exceptions]])
1CO	8	4	tx5b	figs-explicit	εἰ μὴ εἷς	1		Here Paul does not directly quote from the Old Testament, but he uses words that would make any reader who is familiar with the Old Testament think about [Deuteronomy 6:4](deu/06/04.md), which says that “the Lord is one.” If your readers would not make this connection, you could include a footnote or a brief reference to Deuteronomy. Alternate translation: “except one, as the Scripture says” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	8	5	s77m	grammar-connect-condition-contrary	καὶ…εἴπερ	1	so-called gods	Here, **even if** introduces a possibility that Paul does not believe to be true. In other words, Paul does not think that there are **many gods** and **many lords**. He does think that people speak about **many gods** and **many lords**. Thus, his main point is that, no matter how many **gods** and **lord** other people talk about, believers only acknowledge one God and one Lord ([8:6](../08/206md)). If **even if** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a natural form in your language for introducing a condition that the speaker believes is not true. Alternate translation: “although it might be that” or “while some people claim that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-contrary]])
1CO	8	5	sl8j		εἰσὶν λεγόμενοι θεοὶ	1	so-called gods	Alternate translation: “people name many ‘gods’”
1CO	8	5	x4ob	figs-merism	θεοὶ, εἴτε ἐν οὐρανῷ εἴτε ἐπὶ γῆς	1	so-called gods	Paul speaks figuratively, using **heaven** and **earth** in order to include them and everything in between. By speaking in this way, he includes every place that God created. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “gods in all parts of creation” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
1CO	8	5	l7ib	figs-irony	θεοὶ πολλοὶ καὶ κύριοι πολλοί	1	many “gods” and many “lords.”	Here Paul acknowledges that there are **many “gods”** and **“lords”**. He implies that **so-called** from earlier in the verse also applies here, so the ULT has put quotation marks around **gods** and **lords** to indicate that these are the names people use. Paul himself does not believe that what people call **gods** and **lords** really are those things; rather, [10:20–21](../10/20.md) suggests that Paul thinks these **gods** and **lords** are actually demons. If what Paul means by **“gods”** and **“lords”** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a form that indicates that Paul is speaking from someone else’s perspective. Alternate translation: “many so-called gods and many so-called lords” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])
1CO	8	6	y6hq	figs-explicit	ἡμῖν εἷς Θεὸς	1	Yet for us there is only one God	In this verse, Paul does not directly quote from the Old Testament, but he uses words that would make any reader who is familiar with the Old Testament think about [Deuteronomy 6:4](deu/06/04.md), just like he did in [8:4](../08/04.md). The Old Testament passage says, “The Lord is our God, the Lord is one.” If your readers would not make this connection, you could include a footnote or a brief reference to Deuteronomy. Alternate translation: “we accept from the Scriptures that {there is} one God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	8	6	sv67	guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	ὁ Πατὴρ	1	Yet for us there is only one God	**Father** is an important title that describes one person in the Trinity. If you use the following alternate translation, you may need to add a comma before it. Alternate translation: “that is, the Father” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
1CO	8	6	x3d6	figs-explicit	ἐξ οὗ τὰ πάντα	1	Yet for us there is only one God	Here Paul emphasizes that **God the Father** created all things and is their ultimate source. If **from whom {are} all things** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a phrase that identifies **God the Father** as the creator of everything that exists. Alternate translation: “who is the creator of the world” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	8	6	vw06	figs-explicit	ἡμεῖς εἰς αὐτόν	1	Yet for us there is only one God	Here Paul emphasizes that the purpose for which **we** exist is to serve and honor God. If **for whom we {are}** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a phrase that identifies **God the Father** as the goal or purpose of Christian life. Alternate translation: “whom we are to serve” or “whom we worship” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	8	6	cokf	figs-explicit	δι’ οὗ τὰ πάντα	1	Yet for us there is only one God	Here Paul emphasizes that the **Lord Jesus Christ** is the agent through whom **God the Father** created all things. If **through whom all things {are}** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a phrase that identifies the **Lord Jesus Christ** as the agent in the creation of everything that exists. Alternate translation: “through whom God the Father created all things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	8	6	jsqb	figs-explicit	ἡμεῖς δι’ αὐτοῦ	1	Yet for us there is only one God	Here Paul could be expressing the idea (1) that **we** exist because of what Christ has done by creating and then saving us. Alternate translation: “through whom we live” (2) that **we** have been saved and given new life by Christ. Alternate translation: “through whom we have new life” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	8	7	th5p	figs-metaphor	οὐκ ἐν πᾶσιν ἡ γνῶσις	1	General Information:	Here Paul speaks as if **everyone** were a container in which **knowledge** could be stored, but some people do not have **knowledge** stored in them. He speaks in this way to show that not everyone understands what he has just said about how God the Father and Jesus are the only God and Lord. If your readers would misunderstand the idea that **knowledge** is **not in** someone, you could use a comparable phrase. Alternate translation: “not everyone knows this” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	8	7	v7lt	figs-idiom	τῇ συνηθείᾳ…τοῦ εἰδώλου	1	everyone … some	The Corinthians would have understood **the custom of the idols** to refer to regular practices associated with worshiping **idols**, including eating meat **sacrificed to idols**. If your readers would misunderstand **the custom of the idols**, you could refer to worshiping idols “regularly.” Alternate translation: “regularly involved in worshiping idols” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1CO	8	7	heud	figs-abstractnouns	τῇ συνηθείᾳ…τοῦ εἰδώλου	1	everyone … some	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **custom**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “used to” or “accustomed.” Alternate translation: “accustomed to idols” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1CO	8	7	e737	figs-explicit	ἕως ἄρτι	1	everyone … some	Here, **now** refers to the time since these people became believers. Paul means that these people worshiped idols until they became Christians, not until the time he writes this letter. If your readers would misunderstand **until now**, you could clarify that Paul is referring to when these people first believed in Jesus. Alternate translation: “until they believed in Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	8	7	jdnr	translate-unknown	εἰδωλόθυτον	1	everyone … some	Here, the **things sacrificed to idols** refers to meat that has been offered to an idol. Translate this phrase the same way you did in [8:1](../08/01.md). Alternate translation: “meat from animals sacrificed to idols” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	8	7	pdev	figs-activepassive	εἰδωλόθυτον	1	everyone … some	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, you could use a vague or indefinite subject. Alternate translation: “things that people have sacrificed to idols” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1CO	8	7	o04n	grammar-connect-time-simultaneous	ὡς εἰδωλόθυτον ἐσθίουσιν	1	everyone … some	This phrase could refer to: (1) whenever the people that Paul is talking about eat **things sacrificed to idols**. Alternate translation: “happen to eat things sacrificed to idols” (2) how the people that Paul is talking about think that the **things sacrificed to idols** actually belongs to another god. Alternate translation: “eat meat as if it really were sacrificed to idols” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous]])
1CO	8	7	xl4f	grammar-collectivenouns	ἡ συνείδησις αὐτῶν	1	everyone … some	The word **conscience** is a singular noun that refers to all **their** consciences. If your language does not use singular nouns in that way, you can use a different expression. Alternate translation: “each of their consciences” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns]])
1CO	8	7	pbyx	figs-metaphor	ἀσθενὴς οὖσα	1	everyone … some	Here, **weak** identifies a **conscience** easily leads a person to feel guilty. A **weak** conscience condemns some things that are probably acceptable before God. If your readers would misunderstand **weak**, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “being sensitive” or “which often condemns them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	8	7	ba7e	figs-activepassive	ἡ συνείδησις αὐτῶν ἀσθενὴς οὖσα μολύνεται	1	is defiled	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Luke implies that “they” did it. If you use the following alternate translation, you may need to add a comma before it. Alternate translation: “their conscience being weak, they defile it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1CO	8	8	ii4m	figs-personification	βρῶμα…ἡμᾶς οὐ παραστήσει τῷ Θεῷ	1	food will not present us to God	Here Paul speaks as if **food** were a person who could **bring us near to God**. By speaking in this way, Paul discusses whether food can make our relationship with God stronger or not. Just like a person who cannot **bring us near** to someone so that we can know that person better, so food cannot make our relationship with God any stronger. If your readers would misunderstand this figure of speech, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “food will not make our relationship with God any stronger” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
1CO	8	8	yzt9	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	οὔτε ἐὰν μὴ φάγωμεν, ὑστερούμεθα; οὔτε ἐὰν φάγωμεν, περισσεύομεν	1	food will not present us to God	Here, Paul contrasts “eating” and “not eating” while negating both sides of the contrast. If your language does not use this form, you could express the idea with two negative clauses. Alternate translation: “we are not made to lack if we do not eat, and we do not abound if we eat” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
1CO	8	8	wp5k	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	οὔτε ἐὰν μὴ φάγωμεν, ὑστερούμεθα; οὔτε ἐὰν φάγωμεν, περισσεύομεν	1	food will not present us to God	Here Paul uses **if** twice to introduce true possibilities. He means that a person might **not eat**, or that person might **eat**. He specifies the result for each option. If your readers would misunderstand this form, you could express the **if** statements by introducing them with a word such as “whenever” or by using relative clauses. Alternate translation: “neither are we made to lack whenever we do not eat, nor do we abound whenever we eat” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical]])
1CO	8	8	x91v	figs-explicit	ὑστερούμεθα…περισσεύομεν	1	We are not worse if we do not eat, nor better if we do eat it	Here Paul does not specify what **we** might **lack** or **abound** in. If possible, do not specify this is in your translation. If you must clarify what we might **lack** or **abound**, Paul implies that it is God’s “favor” or “grace.” Alternate translation: “are we made to lack God’s grace … we abound in God’s grace” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	8	8	ciez	figs-explicit	μὴ φάγωμεν…φάγωμεν	1	We are not worse if we do not eat, nor better if we do eat it	Here Paul states a general principle, and he does not clarify what kinds of **food** he has in mind. If possible, do not specify what **we eat** in your translation. If you must clarify what **we eat**, you could include a vague or generic reference to “certain kinds of food.” Alternate translation: “we do not eat specific kinds of food … we eat specific kinds of food” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	8	9	ns0y	figs-explicit	ἡ ἐξουσία ὑμῶν αὕτη	1	those who are weak	Here Paul implies that their **authority** is over “food” as mentioned in the last verse ([8:8](../08/08.md)). The point is that food has no **authority** over believers, whether to make them more or less “near to God.” Instead, believers have **authority** over food and can thus eat whatever they want. If your readers would misunderstand what **authority** refers to here, you could clarify that it refers to **authority** over “food.” Alternate translation: “this authority of yours over food” or “this authority of yours concerning eating” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	8	9	vu0y	figs-abstractnouns	ἡ ἐξουσία ὑμῶν αὕτη	1	those who are weak	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **authority**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “rule” or “manage” and include “food” or “eating” as the object. Alternate translation: “how you rule over food” or “how you manage your eating (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1CO	8	9	loo1		ἡ ἐξουσία ὑμῶν αὕτη	1	those who are weak	Alternate translation: “this authority that you have”
1CO	8	9	f3ds	figs-metaphor	τοῖς ἀσθενέσιν	1	those who are weak	Much like in [8:7](../08/07.md), **weak** identifies a person who easily feels guilty. A **weak** person thinks some things are wrong that are probably acceptable before God. If your readers would misunderstand **weak**, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “for the sensitive” or “for those who often condemn themselves” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	8	9	deu5	figs-nominaladj	τοῖς ἀσθενέσιν	1	those who are weak	Paul is using the adjective **weak** as a noun in order to describe a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this with a noun phrase. Alternate translation: “people who are weak” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
1CO	8	10	usg7	grammar-connect-condition-fact	ἐὰν…τις ἴδῃ	1	sees the one who has	Paul is speaking as if this were a hypothetical possibility, but he means that it will happen at some point. If your language does not state something as a condition if it will happen, and if your readers might misunderstand and think that what Paul is saying might not happen, then you could introduce the clause by using a word such as “when” or “after”. Alternate translation: “whenever someone might see” or “after someone sees” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
1CO	8	10	a7qn	figs-explicit	γνῶσιν	1	sees the one who has	Here Paul does not specify what the **knowledge** is about. However, it is clear from [8:4–6](../08/04.md) that Paul is speaking about **knowledge** about other gods, specifically knowing that there is only one God and that other gods do not really exist. If you must specify what the knowledge is about, you could clarify that it is about the idols or the topic of things sacrificed to idols. Alternate translation: “knowledge about idols” or “knowledge about this issue” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	8	10	v611	figs-abstractnouns	τὸν ἔχοντα γνῶσιν	1	sees the one who has	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **knowledge**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “know.” Alternate translation: “the person who knows” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1CO	8	10	xhn9	translate-unknown	κατακείμενον	1	sees the one who has	In Paul’s culture, people ate lying down on their side (**reclining**). If your readers would misunderstand **reclining to eat**, you could use a word or phrase that describes the normal position for eating in your culture or indicate that the person is about to eat. Alternate translation: “about to eat” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	8	10	ph53	figs-rquestion	οὐχὶ ἡ συνείδησις αὐτοῦ ἀσθενοῦς ὄντος οἰκοδομηθήσεται, εἰς τὸ τὰ εἰδωλόθυτα ἐσθίειν	1	sees the one who has	Paul does not ask this question because he is looking for information. Rather, he asks it to involve the Corinthians in what he is arguing. The question assumes that the answer is “yes, it will be built up.” If your readers would misunderstand this question, you could express the idea with a strong affirmation. Alternate translation: “his conscience, being weak, will surely be built up so as to eat the things sacrificed to idols.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
1CO	8	10	i6ej	figs-gendernotations	αὐτοῦ	1	his … conscience	Here, **his** is written in masculine form, but it refers to anyone, no matter what their gender might be. If your readers would misunderstand **his**, you could express the idea by using a word that does not have gender or you could use both genders. Alternate translation: “his or her” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
1CO	8	10	x5pa	figs-metaphor	οἰκοδομηθήσεται	1	built up so as to eat	Here, Paul speaks as if **his conscience** were a structure that could be **built up**. By speaking in this way, he means that the **conscience** becomes more confident or stronger, just a like a structure is stronger after it is **built up**. If your readers would misunderstand this figure of speech, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “will … become stronger” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	8	10	t5ae	figs-activepassive	οὐχὶ ἡ συνείδησις αὐτοῦ ἀσθενοῦς ὄντος οἰκοδομηθήσεται	1	built up so as to eat	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Paul implies that seeing the person with knowledge eating in an idol’s temple did it. Alternate translation: “will this not build up his conscience, which is weak,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1CO	8	10	ohzy	figs-metaphor	ἀσθενοῦς ὄντος	1	built up so as to eat	Here, **weak** identifies a **conscience** that easily leads a person to feel guilty. A **weak** conscience condemns some things that are probably acceptable before God. If your readers would misunderstand **weak**, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “being sensitive” or “which often condemns him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	8	10	mdqc	translate-unknown	τὰ εἰδωλόθυτα	1	built up so as to eat	Here, **the things sacrificed to idols** refers to meat that has been offered to an idol. Translate this phrase the same way you did in [8:1](../08/01.md). Alternate translation: “meat from animals sacrificed to idols” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	8	10	a7s8	figs-activepassive	τὰ εἰδωλόθυτα	1	built up so as to eat	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, you could use a vague or indefinite subject. Alternate translation: “the things that people have sacrificed to idols” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1CO	8	11	g5tn	figs-activepassive	ἀπόλλυται…ὁ ἀσθενῶν ἐν τῇ σῇ γνώσει, ὁ ἀδελφὸς, δι’ ὃν Χριστὸς ἀπέθανεν	1	the one who is weak … is destroyed	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Paul implies that “you” or “your knowledge” did it. Alternate translation: “you, through your knowledge, destroy the one who is weak, the brother for whom Christ died,” or “your knowledge destroys the one who is weak, the brother for whom Christ died (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1CO	8	11	x6jd	figs-genericnoun	ὁ ἀσθενῶν…ὁ ἀδελφὸς	1	the one who is weak … is destroyed	Jesus is speaking of those who are weak and brothers in general, not of one particular person **who is weak** who is one particular **brother**. If your language does not use the singular form to refer to people in general, you could express the idea in a form that is more natural in your language. Alternate translation: “each one who is weak, who is a brother” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])
1CO	8	11	zy3t	figs-activepassive	ὁ ἀσθενῶν	1	the one who is weak … is destroyed	Much like in [8:9](../08/09.md), **one who is weak** identifies a person who easily feels guilty. A **weak** person thinks some things are wrong that are probably acceptable before God. If your readers would misunderstand **weak**, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “the one who is sensitive” or “the one who often condemns himself or herself” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	8	11	xs2l	figs-gendernotations	ὁ ἀδελφὸς	1	the one who is weak … is destroyed	Although the word translated **brother** is masculine, Paul is using this word to refer to any believer, whether man or woman. If **brother** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a non-gendered word or refer to both genders. Alternate translation: “the brother or sister” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
1CO	8	11	ez6t	figs-yousingular	σῇ	1	your knowledge	Here Paul addresses specific individuals within the Corinthian church. Because of this, **your** in this verse is singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
1CO	8	11	gwc9	figs-explicit	γνώσει	1	your knowledge	Here Paul does not specify what the **knowledge** is about. However, just as in [8:10](../08/10.md) it is clear that Paul is speaking about knowledge about other gods, specifically knowing that there is only one God and that other gods do not really exist. If you must specify what the **knowledge** is about, you could clarify that it is about the idols or the topic of things sacrificed to idols. Alternate translation: “knowledge about idols” or “knowledge about this issue” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	8	11	f6bg	figs-abstractnouns	ἐν τῇ σῇ γνώσει	1	your knowledge	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **knowledge**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “know.” Alternate translation: “through what you know” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1CO	8	12	azal	writing-pronouns	οὕτως	1	your knowledge	Here, **thus** refers back to the series of actions and results in [8:10–11](../08/10.md). If your readers would misunderstand what **thus** refers to, you could clarify that it refers to the previous two verses. Alternate translation: “through your knowledge” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
1CO	8	12	d8ni	grammar-connect-time-simultaneous	οὕτως…ἁμαρτάνοντες εἰς τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς, καὶ τύπτοντες αὐτῶν τὴν συνείδησιν ἀσθενοῦσαν, εἰς Χριστὸν ἁμαρτάνετε	1	your knowledge	Here Paul means that whenever the Corinthians “sin against” and “wound” their **brothers**, they at the same time **sin against Christ**. If your readers would misunderstand the relationship between **sinning against your brothers and wounding their weak consciences** and **sin against Christ**, you could clarify that they happen at the same time. Alternate translation: “any time you thus sin against your brothers and wound their weak consciences, you at the same time sin against Christ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous]])
1CO	8	12	i5f6		καὶ τύπτοντες	1	your knowledge	Alternate translation: “by wounding” or “because you wound”
1CO	8	12	o0w5	figs-gendernotations	τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς	1	your knowledge	Although the word translated **brothers** is masculine, Paul is using it to refer to anyone, whether man or woman. If your readers would misunderstand **brothers**, you could use a non-gendered word or refer to both genders. Alternate translation: “your brothers and sisters” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
1CO	8	12	ti84	figs-metaphor	τύπτοντες αὐτῶν τὴν συνείδησιν ἀσθενοῦσαν	1	your knowledge	Here Paul speaks as if **consciences** were a body part that could be “wounded.” By speaking in this way, he emphasizes that the Corinthians who have knowledge are hurting the **weak consciences** of other believers as surely as if they had “wounded” their arms or bodies. If your readers would misunderstand **wounding their weak consciences**, you could clarify that Paul means that the Corinthians who have knowledge are “hurting” **weak consciences** or making the **weak consciences** “feel guilty.” Alternate translation: “hurting their weak consciences” or “making their weak consciences feel guilty” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	8	12	x857	figs-metaphor	τὴν συνείδησιν ἀσθενοῦσαν	1	your knowledge	Here, **weak** identifies **consciences** that easily lead people to feel guilty. **Weak consciences** condemn some things that are probably acceptable before God. If your readers would misunderstand **weak**, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “sensitive consciences” or “consciences, which often condemn them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	8	13	i8tb	figs-personification	βρῶμα σκανδαλίζει τὸν ἀδελφόν μου	1	Therefore	Here, **food** is spoken of figuratively as though it were a person who could cause someone **to stumble**. Paul speaks in this way to emphasize that the **food** is the key issue that leads to “stumbling.” If this might be confusing for your readers, you could clarify that the person that eats the food causes someone **to stumble**. Alternate translation: “how I eat causes my brother to stumble” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
1CO	8	13	seua	figs-123person	εἰ βρῶμα σκανδαλίζει τὸν ἀδελφόν μου, οὐ μὴ φάγω κρέα εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα	1	Therefore	Here Paul uses the first person in order to use himself as an example for the Corinthians to follow. If your readers would misunderstand that this is why Paul uses the first person, you could clarify that Paul is offering himself as an example. Alternate translation: “if food causes my brother to stumble, I for one will certainly not ever eat meat” or “take me as an example: if food causes my brother to stumble, I will certainly not ever eat meat” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
1CO	8	13	vf92	grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἰ βρῶμα σκανδαλίζει τὸν ἀδελφόν μου	1	if food causes to stumble	Paul is speaking as if this were a hypothetical possibility, but he means that it will happen at some point. If your language does not state something as a condition if it will happen, and if your readers might misunderstand and think that what Paul is saying might not happen, then you could introduce the clause by using a word such as “in cases where” or “since.” Alternate translation: “because food causes my brother to stumble” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
1CO	8	13	eyrr	figs-gendernotations	τὸν ἀδελφόν	-1	Therefore	Although the word translated **brother** is masculine, Paul is using it to refer to anyone, whether man or woman. If your readers would misunderstand **brother**, you could use a non-gendered word or refer to both genders. Alternate translation: “brother or sister … brother or sister” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
1CO	8	13	ucfd	figs-genericnoun	τὸν ἀδελφόν μου	-1	Therefore	Paul is speaking of “brothers” in general, not of one particular **brother**. If your readers would misunderstand **my brother**, you could use a word or phrase that refers to “brothers” in general. Alternate translation: “any brother of mine … any brother of mine” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])
1CO	8	13	ra1m	figs-doublenegatives	οὐ μὴ	1	Therefore	The words translated **certainly not** are two negative words. In Paul’s culture, two negative words made the statement even more negative. English speakers would misunderstand two negatives, so the ULT expresses the idea with one strong negative. If your language can use two negatives as Paul’s culture did, you could use a double negative here. If your language does not use two negatives in this way, you could translate with one strong negative, as the ULT does. Alternate translation: “by no means” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
1CO	8	13	k5oj	figs-explicit	κρέα	1	Therefore	Throughout this section, the “things sacrificed to idols” refers primarily to **meat**, and eating this kind of **meat** was one of the only ways for most people to eat **meat** at all. Paul here is stating that he will give up **meat** in general, whether it is sacrificed to idols or not. He implies that he does this so that fellow believers, who do not know whether the **meat** has been sacrificed to idols or not, will not stumble. If your readers would misunderstand the implications here, you can make them explicit. Alternate translation: “meat, even if it has not been sacrificed to idols” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	9	intro	z8d4			0		# 1 Corinthians 9 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>5. On food (8:1–11:1)<br>      * Paul claims being an apostle (9:1–2)<br>      * Paul defends supporting himself (9:3–15)<br>      * Paul explains why he supports himself (9:16–23)<br>      * Paul the athlete (9:24–27)<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Receiving support from the church<br><br>Throughout the chapter, and especially in [9:1–18](../09/01.md), Paul defends why he does not ask for or receive financial support from the Corinthians. From what he says in [9:3](../09/03.md), it seems that some people were “examining” Paul, and they thought that how Paul supported himself was not appropriate behavior for an apostle. These people thought that if Paul were really an apostle, he would require support from the churches to whom he preached. The fact that Paul did not require this support suggested to these people that Paul did not really have authority. Paul in response argues that he could require support if he wanted to, but he thinks that working to support himself helps him proclaim the gospel better. Throughout the chapter, you can use words that refer to how churches support their leaders financially. <br><br>### The “right”<br><br>In [9:4–6](../09/04.md), [12](../09/12.md), and [18](../09/18.md), Paul speaks about a “right” that he and others have. This “right” can be to travel with a wife, to eat and to drink, and most importantly, to receive support from the Corinthians. Paul uses the word “right” to indicate that he is able to require financial support and other help from the Corinthians. However, he also states that he does use this “right” because he thinks that he is serving God better without making use of it. In your translation, use a word or phrase that indicates that Paul and the others have the authority and the ability to do and require certain things. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/authority]])<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Rhetorical questions<br><br>In [9:1](../09/01.md), [4–13](../09/04.md), [18](../09/18.md), [24](../09/24.md), Paul uses rhetorical questions. He is not asking these questions because he wants the Corinthians to provide him with information. Rather, he is asking these questions because he wants the Corinthians to think about how they are acting and what they are thinking. The questions encourage them to think along with Paul. For ways to translate these questions, look for the notes on each verse that includes these kinds of questions. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])<br><br>### Farming metaphor<br><br>In [9:9–11](../09/09.md), Paul applies an Old Testament law about farming to himself and others who proclaim the gospel. In [9:11](../09/11.md), he speaks about “sowing spiritual things,” by which he means proclaiming the gospel. When he and others “sow spiritual things,” they should be able to “reap material things,” by which he means financial support. If possible, preserve the farming metaphor here since it is related to the Old Testament law. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])<br><br>### Athletic metaphors<br><br>In [9:24–27](../09/24.md), Paul uses several metaphors that are based on athletes and athletic competitions. Paul speaks about “running a race” and how the winner receives a “wreath,” which was a crown made out of leaves. He also speaks about “boxing” and how a good boxer does not “box the air.” Finally, he refers to how athletes in general must exercise “self-control” as they train. Paul uses these athletic metaphors to indicate how he and all believers need to focus on the goal, which is the reward that God has promised. To reach this goal, believers must exercise “self-control,” just as athletes do. The point is for believers to live their lives so that they receive the reward from God, just like athletes focus completely on trying to win the prize, the “wreath.” Paul uses these metaphors across several verses, and they are very important for his argument. If possible, preserve the metaphors in your translation. If necessary, you could express them as analogies. See the notes on these verses for translation possibilities. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### “I became (as) …”<br><br>In [9:20–22](../09/20.md), Paul explains how he has “become as a Jew,” “as under the law,” “as without the law,” and “weak.” What Paul means is that he acts like these four groups of people when he is with them. He does this because he wishes to “gain” all these people for Christ. When you translate these verses, use a phrase that indicates that Paul is acting like a specific kind of person. <br><br>### Paul’s use of [Deuteronomy 25:4](deu/25/04.md)<br><br>In [9:9](../09/09.md), Paul quotes from [Deuteronomy 25:4](deu/25/04.md), which forbids a farmer from “muzzling an ox” while it threshes grain. Paul then explains to the Corinthians that God does not care about oxen but is speaking for “us” ([9:9–10](../09/09.md)). What he means is that the law should not primarily be applied to “oxen” but rather to those who proclaim the gospel. He is not saying that God does not have any concern for oxen. When you translate these verses, focus on maintaining the strength of Paul’s argument, but if possible allow the reader to see that God does also care for “oxen.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])<br>
1CO	9	1	mdm4	figs-rquestion	οὐκ εἰμὶ ἐλεύθερος? οὐκ εἰμὶ ἀπόστολος? οὐχὶ Ἰησοῦν τὸν Κύριον ἡμῶν ἑόρακα? οὐ τὸ ἔργον μου ὑμεῖς ἐστε ἐν Κυρίῳ?	1	Am I not free?	Paul does not ask these questions because he is looking for information. Rather, he asks them to involve the Corinthians in what he is arguing. The questions assume that the answer to all of them is “yes.” If your readers would misunderstand these questions, you could express the ideas with strong affirmations. Alternate translation: “I certainly am free. I certainly am an apostle. I have certainly seen Jesus our Lord. You are certainly my work in the Lord.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
1CO	9	1	ctp3	figs-explicit	ἐλεύθερος	1	Am I not free?	Here, **free** could mean that Paul is **free** to: (1) eat whatever he wants. This connects this question with chapter 8. Alternate translation: “free to eat whatever I wish” (2) receive financial support from the believers he serves. This connects this question with the first half of this chapter. Alternate translation: “free to receive support from you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	9	1	dbp9	figs-abstractnouns	τὸ ἔργον μου	1	Am I not an apostle?	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **work**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “labor.” Alternate translation: “whom I labor for” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1CO	9	1	l6sq	figs-abstractnouns	τὸ ἔργον μου	1	Am I not an apostle?	Here, **work** refers to the result of the **work**. If your readers would misunderstand **work**, you could clarify that what the **work** produced is the focus here. Alternate translation: “the result of my work” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1CO	9	1	re1t	figs-metaphor	ἐν Κυρίῳ	1	Have I not seen Jesus our Lord?	Here Paul uses the spatial metaphor **in the Lord** to describe the union of believers with Christ. In this case, being **in the Lord**, or united to the Lord, describes the **work** as what Paul does because of his union with the Lord. Alternate translation: “in union with the Lord” or “that I perform because I am united to the Lord” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	9	2	j6qz	grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical	εἰ ἄλλοις οὐκ εἰμὶ ἀπόστολος, ἀλλά γε	1	you are the proof of my apostleship in the Lord	Here Paul uses **if** to introduce a true possibility. He means that **others** might think he is **not an apostle**, or those people might think he is an apostle. He then specifies the result for if the **others** think that he is **not an apostle**. If this form would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the **if** statement by introducing the statement with “perhaps.” Alternate translation: “Perhaps I am not an apostle to others, but at least” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical]])
1CO	9	2	j4k8	figs-abstractnouns	ἡ…σφραγίς μου τῆς ἀποστολῆς, ὑμεῖς ἐστε	1	you are the proof of my apostleship in the Lord	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **proof**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “prove” or “show.” Alternate translation: “you prove my apostleship” or “you show that I am an apostle” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1CO	9	2	y2nh	figs-possession	ἡ…σφραγίς μου τῆς ἀποστολῆς	1	you are the proof of my apostleship in the Lord	Here Paul uses the possessive form to speak about a **proof** that shows his **apostleship**. If your language does not use this form to express that meaning, you could express the idea by using a verbal phrase. Alternate translation: “what proves my apostleship” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
1CO	9	2	gxhr	figs-abstractnouns	μου τῆς ἀποστολῆς	1	you are the proof of my apostleship in the Lord	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **apostleship**, you could express the idea by using a verbal phrase such as “I am an apostle.” Alternate translation: “that I am an apostle” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1CO	9	2	z5sb	figs-metaphor	ἐν Κυρίῳ	1	you are the proof of my apostleship in the Lord	Here Paul uses the spatial metaphor **in the Lord** to describe the union of believers with Christ. In this case, being **in the Lord**, or united to the Lord, describes the **proof** that the Corinthians provide as something that happens in union with the Lord. Alternate translation: “in union with the Lord” or “as you are united to the Lord” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	9	3	yb0x	figs-metaphor	ἡ ἐμὴ ἀπολογία τοῖς ἐμὲ ἀνακρίνουσίν	1	This is my defense … me:	Here Paul uses language that would normally be used in the legal courts. The **defense** is what the person accused would say to prove their innocence. Those **who examine** are the ones who are in charge of the court and make the decisions about who is guilty and who is innocent. Paul uses this metaphor to explain that he is defending himself against people who have accused him of acting wrongly. If your readers would misunderstand the legal metaphor, you could express the idea non-figuratively or with a comparable metaphor. Alternate translation: “My answer to those who accuse me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	9	3	ktze	figs-abstractnouns	ἡ ἐμὴ ἀπολογία τοῖς	1	This is my defense … me:	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **defense**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “defend.” Alternate translation: “What I say to defend myself against those” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1CO	9	3	l2n5	figs-explicit	τοῖς ἐμὲ ἀνακρίνουσίν	1	This is my defense … me:	Here Paul does not state how **those who examine** him think he has acted wrongly. The previous verse suggests that it relates to his “apostleship” ([6:21](../06/21.md)). Paul intentionally does not state the “charge” against him, so leave it unstated if possible. If you must state what the “charge” against Paul is, you could clarify that it relates to whether he is truly an apostle or not. Alternate translation: “to those who examine me about my apostleship” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	9	3	b17x	writing-pronouns	αὕτη	1	This is my defense … me:	Here, **this** refers to what Paul is about to say, most likely including everything in the rest of this chapter. If your readers would misunderstand **this**, you could use a normal form in your language to speak about what you are about to say. Alternate translation: “what I am about to say” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
1CO	9	4	mr4g	figs-rquestion	μὴ οὐκ ἔχομεν ἐξουσίαν φαγεῖν καὶ πεῖν?	1	Do we not have the right to eat and drink?	Paul does not ask this question because he is looking for information. Rather, he asks it to involve the Corinthians in what he is arguing.

1CO	9	4	ninf	figs-doublenegatives	μὴ οὐκ	1	Do we not have the right to eat and drink?	The words translated **certainly not** are two negative words. In Paul’s culture, two negative words made the statement even more negative. English speakers would misunderstand two negatives, so the ULT expresses the idea with one strong negative. If your language can use two negatives as Paul’s culture did, you could use a double negative here.

1CO	9	4	i6tk	figs-metonymy	φαγεῖν καὶ πεῖν	1	we … have	Here, **to eat and to drink** refers not primarily to the physical process of “eating” and “drinking.” Rather, the phrase refers primarily to what is needed **to eat and to drink**, that is, food and drink. Paul is saying that he and Barnabas have **the right** to receive food and drink so that they can **eat** and **drink**. If your readers would misunderstand **to eat and to drink**, you could clarify that Paul refers to “food” and “drink.” Alternate translation: “to food to eat and beverages to drink” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1CO	9	4	e45j	figs-explicit	φαγεῖν καὶ πεῖν	1	we … have	Although Paul does not explicitly say this, he implies that **we** have the **right** to receive the food and drink from the Corinthians.

Even though **Cephas** was one of the **apostles**, Paul mentions him separately to emphasize him as an example. He has already used Cephas as an example earlier in the letter (see [1:12](../01/12.md); [3:22](../03/22.md)). Perhaps the Corinthians were comparing **Cephas** and Paul.

These were Jesus’ younger brothers. They were sons of Mary and Joseph. Since the Father of Jesus was God, and their father was Joseph, they were actually his half-brothers.

The word **Or** introduces an alternate to what Paul asked in [9:4–5](../09/04.md). Paul already spoke about what he thinks is true: he and Barnabas do “have the right” to receive food and drink, and they “have the right” to travel with a wife. Here Paul gives the incorrect alternative: they alone do not **have the right not to work**. He introduces this incorrect alternate to show that his earlier statements must be true. If your readers would misunderstood **Or**, you could use a word that signifies a contrast or gives an alternative. Alternate translation: “Otherwise, would it not be true that only Barnabas and I do not have” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])

Paul does not ask this question because he is looking for information. Rather, he asks it to involve the Corinthians in what he is arguing. The question assumes that the answer is “no, you do have the right.” If your readers would misunderstand this question, you could express the idea with a strong statement.

1CO	9	6	j84g	figs-doublenegatives	οὐκ ἔχομεν ἐξουσίαν μὴ ἐργάζεσθαι	1	Or is it only Barnabas and I who do not have the right not to work?	Paul here includes **not** twice. In his culture, two negative words made the statement even more negative. English speakers can understand two negatives here, so the ULT expresses the idea with both. If your language can use two negatives as Paul’s culture did, you could use a double negative here. If your language does not use two negatives in this way, you could translate with one negative and express the other negative by stating the opposite. Alternate translation: “do … lack the right not to work” or “do … not have the right to refrain from working” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])

Paul does not ask these questions because he is looking for information. Rather, he asks them to involve the Corinthians in what he is arguing. The questions assume that the answer to all of them is “no one.” If your readers would misunderstand these questions, you could express the ideas with strong negations. Alternate translation: “No one serves as a soldier at any time at his own expense. No one plants a vineyard and does not eat its fruit. No one shepherds a flock and does not drink from the milk of the flock.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
1CO	9	7	zh5m	figs-gendernotations	ἰδίοις	1	Who plants a vineyard and does not eat its fruit?	Here, **his** is masculine because most soldiers in Paul’s culture were male. However, Paul is not emphasizing the gender of soldiers here. If your readers would misunderstand **his**, you could use a non-gendered word or refer to both genders. Alternate translation: “his or her own” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
1CO	9	7	r1ih	translate-unknown	ἰδίοις ὀψωνίοις	1	Or who tends a flock and does not drink milk from it?	Here, **expense** refers to the cost of food, weapons, and lodging for a solider to “serve.” Paul’s point is that soldiers do not pay these costs. Rather, the one who controls the army pays these costs. If your readers would misunderstand **expense**, you could clarify that it refers to the costs of maintaining an army. Alternate translation: “by paying for his own cost of living” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

The question assumes that the answer is “no, you are not.” If your readers would misunderstand this question, you could express the idea with a strong negation. If you do so, you will need to separate the first half of the verse from the second half. Alternate translation: “I am not saying these things according to men.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
1CO	9	8	igpe	figs-gendernotations	ἄνθρωπον	1	Am I not saying these things according to human authority?	Although the word translated **men** is masculine, Paul is using it to refer to any humans, whether men or women. If your readers would misunderstand **men**, you could use a non-gendered word or refer to both genders. Alternate translation: “men and women” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
1CO	9	8	drqe	figs-gendernotations	κατὰ ἄνθρωπον	1	Am I not saying these things according to human authority?	Here, Paul speaks **saying** things **according to men**. By using this phrase, he wishes to identify arguments that people who think and act in only human ways make. If the phrase **according to men** would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea by using a word or phrase that refers to what people who do not believe say and argue. Alternate translation: “according to what mere humans argue” or “according to this world” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1CO	9	8	tdze	writing-pronouns	ταῦτα	-1	Am I not saying these things according to human authority?

If your readers would misunderstand **these things**, you could use a word or phrase that clearly refers back to what has already been said.

1CO	9	8	ou7a	grammar-connect-words-phrases	ἢ	1	Or does not the law also say this?	The word **or** introduces an alternate to what Paul says in the first half of the verse. Paul could be **saying these things according to men**. However, with **or** he introduces what he thinks is actually true: **the law also** says **these things**. If your readers would misunderstood **or**, you could use a word that signifies a contrast or gives an alternative. If you use the following alternate translation, you may need to end the first half of the sentence with its own question mark. Alternate translation: “Instead,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
1CO	9	8	vy1n	figs-rquestion	ἢ καὶ ὁ νόμος ταῦτα οὐ λέγει?	1	Or does not the law also say this?	Paul does not ask this question because he is looking for information.

If you do so, you will need to separate the second half of the verse from the first half.

1CO	9	8	spqj	translate-unknown	ὁ νόμος	1	Or does not the law also say this?	Here, **the law** refers specifically to the first five books of the Old Testament, often called the Pentateuch. Often, these books are called “the law of Moses.” Make sure your readers can tell that Paul is referring to this specific **law** here. Alternate translation: “the Pentateuch” or “Moses’ law” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	9	9	lf1q	writing-quotations	ἐν γὰρ τῷ Μωϋσέως νόμῳ, γέγραπται	1	Do not put a muzzle on	In Paul’s culture, **For it is written** is a normal way to introduce a quotation from an important text. In this case, Paul clarifies that the quote comes from **the law of Moses**. It is specifically from [Deuteronomy 25:4](deu/25/04.md). If your readers would misunderstand how Paul introduces the quotation, you could use a comparable phrase that indicates that Paul is quoting from an important text. Alternate translation: “For it can be read in the law of Moses” or “For the book of Deuteronomy in the law of Moses says” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
1CO	9	9	fks6	figs-quotations	Μωϋσέως…οὐ φιμώσεις βοῦν ἀλοῶντα	1	Do not put a muzzle on	If your language does not use this form, you could translate the command as an indirect quote instead of as a direct quote.

1CO	9	9	h2d3	figs-yousingular	οὐ φιμώσεις	1	Do not put a muzzle on	The command from **the law of Moses** is addressed to specific individuals. Because of this, the command is addressed to “you” in the singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
1CO	9	9	kvxh	translate-unknown	οὐ φιμώσεις βοῦν ἀλοῶντα	1	Do not put a muzzle on	In Paul’s culture, farmers often would make **oxen** walk or “tread” on harvested wheat to separate the kernels of grain from the wheat stalks. Some people would **muzzle an ox** while it is **treading out grain** in order to keep the **ox** from eating the **grain**. The point of the command is that the **ox** should be allowed to eat what it is working to produce: the **grain**. If your readers would not understand what this command is about, you could include a footnote explaining the context or add a short clarifying phrase. Alternate translation: “Do not muzzle an ox to keep it from eating the grain it is treading out” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

Alternate translation: “God does not care about the oxen.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
1CO	9	9	pdqe	figs-hyperbole	μὴ τῶν βοῶν μέλει τῷ Θεῷ?	1	Is it really the oxen that God cares about?	Here Paul speaks as if God has no concern or interest in **oxen**. The Corinthians would have understood him to mean that the primary intent of the command he quotes is not about caring for oxen but rather caring for something or someone else. He specifies what the primary intent of the command is in the next verse: it is **for our sake** ([9:9](../09/09.md)). If your readers would misunderstand what Paul is arguing here, you could soften Paul’s question so that it argues that the command is not “primarily” or “mostly” about **oxen**. If possible, however, maintain the strength of Paul’s statement, since he offers an explanation in the next verse. Alternate translation: “God does not mostly care about the oxen, does he” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

The word **Or** introduces an alternate to what Paul says at the end of the previous verse ([9:9](../09/09.md)). In that verse, he has argued that “God does not care about the oxen.” Since that is not true, the **or** introduces what Paul thinks is actually true: the law is **entirely for our sake**. If your readers would misunderstood **Or**, you could use a word that signifies a contrast or gives an alternative. Alternate translation: “On the other hand,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])

1CO	9	10	b1tg	writing-pronouns	λέγει	1	Or is he speaking entirely for our sake?	Here, **he** refers back to “God” in [9:9](../09/09.md). Paul assumes that God is the one who is **speaking** in the passage he quoted in the last verse. If your readers would misunderstand **he**, you could clarify that it refers to God speaking the “law of Moses.” Alternate translation: “is God speaking” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
1CO	9	10	f8f4	figs-exclusive	δι’ ἡμᾶς	-1	for our sake	Here, **our** could refer to (1) everyone who believes, including the Corinthians.

1CO	9	10	pas5	figs-ellipsis	ἐπ’ ἐλπίδι	1	for our sake	Here Paul does not mention what the **hope** expects because he states it at the end of the verse: **sharing the harvest**. If your readers would misunderstand that **sharing the harvest** is what the **hope** expects here, you could state it explicitly. Alternate translation: “in hope of sharing the harvest” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
1CO	9	10	q1q2	figs-ellipsis	ὁ ἀλοῶν ἐπ’ ἐλπίδι	1	for our sake	Here Paul omits some words that your language may require to make a complete thought. Paul omits these words because he stated them explicitly in the previous clause (**ought to plow**). If your language does need these words, you can supply them from that clause. Alternate translation: “the one who threshes ought to thresh in hope” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

In this verse, Paul applies the farming language he used in [9:9–10](../09/09.md). When he and Barnabas “sow,” they should also “reap” the harvest. Paul clarifies that what they **sowed** was **spiritual things**, which means the good news. The **material things** that they can **reap** are money and support from the Corinthians. If your reader would misunderstand this application of the farming language, you could use analogies to clarify what Paul is referring to or express the idea non-figuratively.

1CO	9	12	cr62	figs-abstractnouns	τῆς ὑμῶν ἐξουσίας μετέχουσιν…ἡμεῖς…τῇ ἐξουσίᾳ ταύτῃ	1	If others exercised this right	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **right**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “able to.” If you do so, you may need to express an object, which here is receiving financial support. Alternate translation: “were able to require financial support from you, {are} we … being able to require financial support from you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1CO	9	12	lld4	figs-rquestion	οὐ μᾶλλον ἡμεῖς?	1	If others exercised this right over you, should we not even more?	Paul does not ask this question because he is looking for information. Rather, he asks it to involve the Corinthians in what he is arguing. The question assumes that the answer is “yes, you do.” If your readers would misunderstand this question, you could express the idea with a strong affirmation. Alternate translation: “we certainly do even more.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
1CO	9	12	po30	figs-ellipsis	οὐ μᾶλλον ἡμεῖς	1	If others exercised this right over you, should we not even more?	Here Paul omits some words that may be required in your language to make a complete thought. If your language needs theses words, you could supply them from the first half of the sentence. Alternate translation: “{do} we not share the right even more” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
1CO	9	12	ybwy	figs-exclusive	ἡμεῖς…ἐχρησάμεθα…στέγομεν…δῶμεν	1		Here, **we** refers to Paul and Barnabas. It does not include the Corinthians. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
1CO	9	12	nr6u	figs-explicit	πάντα στέγομεν	1	others	Here Paul refers to what he and Barnabas had to “endure” because they did not **take advantage** of receiving financial aid from the Corinthians. They had to work to support themselves, and they probably had to go without as much food and supplies as they would have liked. Some of the hardships that Paul and Barnabas endured appear in [4:10–13](../04/10.md). If your readers would misunderstand **endured everything**, you could make what **everything** refers to more explicit. Alternate translation: “we endured serving without financial support” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	9	12	q7vj	figs-idiom	μή τινα ἐνκοπὴν δῶμεν τῷ εὐαγγελίῳ	1	this right	In Paul’s culture, to **give** a **hindrance** means to “hinder” or to “block” something. Paul means that he would rather “endure everything” than hinder **the gospel**. If your readers would misunderstand **give any hindrance**, you could express the idea in a form that is more natural in your language. Alternate translation: “we might not hinder the gospel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1CO	9	12	prci	figs-abstractnouns	μή τινα ἐνκοπὴν δῶμεν τῷ εὐαγγελίῳ	1	this right	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **hindrance**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “hinder.” Alternate translation: “we might not hinder the gospel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1CO	9	13	slf9	figs-rquestion	οὐκ οἴδατε ὅτι οἱ τὰ ἱερὰ ἐργαζόμενοι, τὰ ἐκ τοῦ ἱεροῦ ἐσθίουσιν; οἱ τῷ θυσιαστηρίῳ παρεδρεύοντες, τῷ θυσιαστηρίῳ συνμερίζονται?	1	Do you not know that those who serve in the temple eat from the things of the temple	Paul does not ask this question because he is looking for information. Rather, he asks it to involve the Corinthians in what he is arguing. The question assumes that the answer is “yes, we know.” If your readers would misunderstand this question, you could express the idea with a strong affirmation. Alternate translation: “You know that those working in the temple eat from the things of the temple; those serving at the altar partake from the altar.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
1CO	9	13	pq05	figs-explicit	οἱ τὰ ἱερὰ ἐργαζόμενοι	1	Do you not know that those who serve in the temple eat from the things of the temple	Here, **those working in the temple** refers to any person whose job takes place in or around the temple. Paul may specifically have the “Levites” or other “temple servants” in mind. If your readers would misunderstand **those working in the temple**, you could use a word or phrase in your language that refers generally to anyone whose job is **in the temple**. Alternate translation: “the temple servants” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	9	13	ergc	translate-unknown	τὰ ἐκ τοῦ ἱεροῦ	1	Do you not know that those who serve in the temple eat from the things of the temple	Here, to eat **from the things of the temple** means that these people eat some of the food that people donate to the **temple** or offer to God in **the temple**. If **the things of the temple** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to what people have offered or given to **the temple**. Alternate translation: “from what people give to the temple” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	9	13	omzu		οἱ τῷ θυσιαστηρίῳ παρεδρεύοντες	1	Do you not know that those who serve in the temple eat from the things of the temple	Here, **those serving at the altar** could be: (1) a specific group within **those working in the temple**, specifically the priests who work at the altar. Alternate translation: “particularly, those serving at the altar” (2) another way to speak about **those working in the temple**. Paul repeats himself to clarify exactly what eating **from the things of the temple** means. Alternate translation: “that is, those serving at the altar”
1CO	9	13	fxxi	figs-explicit	οἱ τῷ θυσιαστηρίῳ παρεδρεύοντες	1	Do you not know that those who serve in the temple eat from the things of the temple	Here, **those serving at the altar** refers to the specific people who offered sacrifices on **the altar**. Paul may specifically have in mind the “priests.” If your readers would misunderstand **those serving at the altar**, you could use a word or phrase for the people who have the closest contact with the deity and offer any sacrifices to that deity. Alternate translation: “the priests” or “those who serve the most sacred things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	9	13	lqar	translate-unknown	τῷ θυσιαστηρίῳ συνμερίζονται	1	Do you not know that those who serve in the temple eat from the things of the temple	Here, to **partake from the altar** means that these people offer part of a sacrifice on the altar, but they also eat part of that sacrifice. If to **partake from the altar** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to eating part of what people offer to their god. Alternate translation: “eat part of what is sacrificed on the altar” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	9	14	g5i8	figs-explicit	ὁ Κύριος διέταξεν	1	get their living from the gospel	Here Paul refers to how Jesus said that a “worker deserves wages” when he sent people to proclaim the good news. See the saying in [Matthew 10:10](mat/10/10.md) and [Luke 10:7](luk/10/7.md). If your readers would misunderstand what Paul is saying here, you could include a footnote to explain the reference to what Jesus said. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	9	14	tuiy	figs-idiom	ἐκ…ζῆν	1	get their living from the gospel	Here, **to live from** identifies how a person supported themselves and acquired food and other necessities. For example, **to live from** carpentry would mean that the person makes money to pay for food and housing by doing carpentry. If your readers would misunderstand **to live from**, you could use a word or phrase in your language that refers to how a person makes a living or supports themselves. Alternate translation: “to support themselves on” or “to receive their income from” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1CO	9	14	rj38	figs-metonymy	τοῦ εὐαγγελίου	1	get their living from the gospel	Here, **the gospel** refers to: (1) the job or occupation of proclaiming **the gospel**. Alternate translation: “preaching the gospel” (2) the people who hear and believe in **the gospel**. Alternate translation: “those who believe the gospel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1CO	9	15	fs7a	translate-unknown	οὐ κέχρημαι	1	these rights	Here, **taken advantage of** refers to “making use of” a resource or “requiring” a specific behavior. If your readers would misunderstand **taken advantage of**, you could use a comparable phrase. Alternate translation: “have not made use of” or “have not required you to provide” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	9	15	j8zn	figs-doublenegatives	οὐ κέχρημαι οὐδενὶ	1	these rights	Here Paul uses two negative words: “have not taken advantage of none.” In Paul’s culture, two negative words made the statement even more negative. English speakers would misunderstand these two negatives, so the ULT expresses the idea with one strong negative. If your language can use two negatives as Paul’s culture did, you could use a double negative here. If your language does not use two negatives in this way, you could translate with one strong negative, as the ULT does. Alternate translation: “have by no means taken advantage of” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
1CO	9	15	wese	writing-pronouns	τούτων	1	these rights	Here, **these things** could refer to: (1) the “right” or “rights” that Paul has to financial support from the Corinthians. Alternate translation: “of these rights” (2) all the reasons he has given in [9:6–14](../09/06.md) for why those who proclaim the gospel can receive financial support. Alternate translation: “of these reasons” or “of these arguments” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
1CO	9	15	u9my	figs-pastforfuture	οὐκ ἔγραψα	1	these rights	Here Paul refers to 1 Corinthians itself, the letter he is currently writing. Use whatever tense in your language would be appropriate to refer to the letter itself. Alternate translation: “I have not written” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture]])
1CO	9	15	ygaz	writing-pronouns	ταῦτα	1	these rights	Here Paul refers to what he has already written, especially to [9:6–14](../09/06.md). Use a form in your language that refers back to things that have just been said. Alternate translation: “those things” or “what I have just written” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
1CO	9	15	vf7d	writing-pronouns	οὕτως γένηται	1	these rights	Here, **thus** refers to receiving financial support from the Corinthians. If your readers would misunderstand **thus**, you could use a word or phrase that more clearly refers to receiving financial support. Alternate translation: “these things might be done” or “support might be given” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
1CO	9	15	sy42	figs-activepassive	γένηται ἐν ἐμοί	1	so that this might be done for me	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who does the action, Paul implies that “you,” the Corinthians, would do it. Alternate translation: “you might do for me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1CO	9	15	fd69	figs-metaphor	τὸ καύχημά μου…κενώσει	1	deprive me of my boasting	Here Paul speaks as if a **boast** was a container that someone could make **empty**. By speaking in this way, Paul means that someone could take away what he boasts about. If your readers would misunderstand **make my boast empty**, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “will remove my reason for boasting” or “will deflate my boast” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	9	15	rl1y	figs-abstractnouns	τὸ καύχημά μου	1	deprive me of my boasting	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **boast**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “boast.” Alternate translation: “what I boast about” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1CO	9	16	lq4l	figs-infostructure	ἐὰν…εὐαγγελίζωμαι, οὐκ ἔστιν μοι καύχημα, ἀνάγκη γάρ μοι ἐπίκειται	1	this necessity was placed upon me	If your language would normally put the reason before the result, you could rearrange the order of these clauses. Alternate translation: “because compulsion is placed on me, there is nothing for me to boast about if I proclaim the gospel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
1CO	9	16	xpve	grammar-connect-condition-fact	ἐὰν	1	this necessity was placed upon me	Paul is speaking as if “proclaiming” **the gospel** were a possibility, but he means that he actually does. If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, and if your readers might misunderstand and think that what Paul is saying is not certain, then you can translate his words as an affirmative statement. Alternate translation: “when” or “whenever” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
1CO	9	16	ecw2	figs-activepassive	ἀνάγκη…ἐπίκειται	1	this necessity was placed upon me	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Paul implies that “God” did it. Alternate translation: “God placed compulsion” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1CO	9	16	qyp0	figs-abstractnouns	ἀνάγκη…μοι ἐπίκειται	1	this necessity was placed upon me	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **compulsion**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “compel” and rephrase the clause. Alternate translation: “I am compelled to do so” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])<br>
1CO	9	16	eimr	figs-metaphor	ἀνάγκη…μοι ἐπίκειται	1	this necessity was placed upon me	Here Paul speaks as if **compulsion** were a physical object that someone had **placed upon** him. By speaking in this way, he means that he is required to do something. If your readers would misunderstand this figure of speech, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “I am commanded to do so” or “I have an obligation” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	9	16	l7as	figs-idiom	οὐαὶ…μοί ἐστιν	1	woe be to me if	Here, **woe be to me** expresses what Paul thinks would happen to him if he ever were to stop preaching the gospel. He would experience **woe**, with the implication that this **woe** will come from God. If your readers would misunderstand **woe be to me**, you could use a word or phrase that expresses the expectation of bad things to come. Alternate translation: “bad things will happen to me” or “God will punish me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1CO	9	16	p1sa	grammar-connect-condition-contrary	ἐὰν μὴ εὐαγγελίζωμαι	1	woe be to me if	Paul is making a conditional statement that sounds hypothetical, but he is already convinced that the condition is not true. He knows that he does indeed **preach the gospel**. Use a natural form in your language for introducing a condition that the speaker believes is not true. Alternate translation: “whenever I stop preaching the gospel, which I will never do” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-contrary]])
1CO	9	17	d7l9	grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical	εἰ…ἑκὼν τοῦτο πράσσω…εἰ…ἄκων	1	if I do this willingly	Here Paul uses **if** to introduce two possibilities. He means that he might **do this willingly**, or he might do it **unwillingly**. He specifies a result for each option, but he implies that he does it **unwillingly** (see the “compulsion” in [9:16](../09/16.md)). If your readers would misunderstand this form, you could express the **if** statements in a natural way in your language, such as by introducing them with “whenever.” Alternate translation: “were I to do this willingly … were it unwillingly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical]])
1CO	9	17	jtwy	writing-pronouns	τοῦτο πράσσω	1	if I do this willingly	Here, **this** refers back to “preaching the gospel” in [9:16](../09/16.md). If your readers would misunderstand **this**, you could clarify what it refers to. Alternate translation: “I preach the gospel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
1CO	9	17	x6s9	translate-unknown	ἑκὼν…ἄκων	1	if I do this willingly	Here, **willingly** means that someone does something because they choose to, while **unwillingly** means that someone has to do something whether they choose to or not. If your readers would misunderstand **willingly** and **unwillingly**, you could express the idea by using two contrasting words that refer to whether someone chooses to do something or not. Alternate translation: “because I choose to … I do not choose to do it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	9	17	gkxi	figs-abstractnouns	μισθὸν ἔχω	1	if I do this willingly	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **reward**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “reward” or “compensate.” Alternate translation: “I am compensated for it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1CO	9	17	gteh	figs-infostructure	εἰ δὲ ἄκων, οἰκονομίαν πεπίστευμαι.	1	But if not willingly	This sentence could: (1) include both the “if” and the “then” statements and explain how Paul preaching the gospel is “unwilling.” He did not choose this **stewardship**, and so he does it **unwillingly**. However, the reason he does preach the gospel is because he has **been entrusted with** that **stewardship**. Alternate translation: “But if unwillingly, I do this because I have been entrusted with a stewardship” (2) express the “if” statement for the question (the “then” statement) at the beginning of the next verse ([9:18](../09/18.md)). The word **unwillingly** would modify **entrusted**, and you would need to connect the end of this verse and the beginning of the next verse with a comma, dropping the capitalization on “What.” Alternate translation: “But I have been unwillingly entrusted with a stewardship,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
1CO	9	17	t8pm	figs-ellipsis	εἰ δὲ ἄκων	1	But if not willingly	Here Paul omits some words that your language may require to make a complete thought. Paul omits these words because he stated them explicitly in the previous clause (**I do this**). If your language does need these words, you can supply them from that clause. Alternate translation: “But if I do this unwillingly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
1CO	9	17	xa5p	figs-activepassive	πεπίστευμαι	1	I have been entrusted with a stewardship	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Paul implies that “God” did it. Alternate translation: “God has entrusted me with” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1CO	9	17	kjgf	figs-abstractnouns	οἰκονομίαν	1	I have been entrusted with a stewardship	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **stewardship**, you could express the idea by using a phrase with a verb such as “oversee” or “do.” Alternate translation: “something to do” or “a task to oversee” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1CO	9	18	lg51	figs-rquestion	τίς οὖν μού ἐστιν ὁ μισθός?	1	What then is my reward?	Paul does not ask this question because he is looking for information. Rather, he asks it to involve the Corinthians in what he is arguing. The question assumes that the following words are the answer. If your readers would misunderstand this question, you could express the idea by using a construction that introduces what follows as the **reward**. Alternate translation: “This, then, is my reward:” or “Here, then, is my reward:” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
1CO	9	18	pfw2	figs-abstractnouns	μού…ὁ μισθός	1	What then is my reward?	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **reward**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “reward” or “compensate.” Alternate translation: “how God rewards me” or “how God compensates me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1CO	9	18	ia5x	grammar-connect-time-simultaneous	εὐαγγελιζόμενος ἀδάπανον, θήσω	1	That when I preach, I may offer the gospel without charge	Here, **proclaiming the gospel without charge** describes how Paul wishes to **offer** the gospel. The phrase **proclaiming the gospel without charge** could: (1) provide the means by which Paul **might offer**. Alternate translation: “by proclaiming the gospel without charge, I might offer” (2) give the situations in which Paul “offers” the gospel without taking **advantage of** his **right**. Alternate translation: “whenever I proclaim the gospel without charge, I offer” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous]])
1CO	9	18	o3ju	translate-unknown	ἀδάπανον	1	That when I preach, I may offer the gospel without charge	Here, **without charge** means that something is free to the person who receives it. Paul is stating that the **gospel** is “free” or “at no cost” for those whom he preaches to. If your readers would misunderstand **without cost**, you could use a word or phrase that indicates that something is “free” or “without cost.” Alternate translation: “freely” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	9	18	dln7	figs-idiom	θήσω τὸ εὐαγγέλιον	1	offer the gospel	Here, to **offer the gospel** means to tell people about the gospel so that they have the chance to believe in it. If your readers would misunderstand **offer the gospel**, you could use a comparable phrase. Alternate translation: “I might present the gospel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1CO	9	18	ft7p	translate-unknown	καταχρήσασθαι τῇ ἐξουσίᾳ μου	1	offer the gospel	Here, **to take advantage** of something means to use that thing for one’s own benefit. Here Paul could use the word: (1) negatively, which would mean that Paul does not want to abuse his **right**. Alternate translation: “to abuse my right” or “to exploit my right” (2) positively, which would mean that Paul does not want to make use of the **right**, even though it would be fine to do so. Alternate translation: “”to make use of my right” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	9	18	fn7i	figs-abstractnouns	τῇ ἐξουσίᾳ μου	1	so not take full use of my right in the gospel	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **right**, you could express the idea by using a verbal phrase such as “are able to” or “can require.” Alternate translation: “of what I can require” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1CO	9	18	ziyb	figs-metaphor	ἐν τῷ εὐαγγελίῳ	1	so not take full use of my right in the gospel	Here Paul speaks as if his **right** were inside **the gospel**. He speaks in this way in order to show that he only has the **right** because of his work for **the gospel**. If your readers would misunderstand this figure of speech, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “by the gospel” or “that comes from the gospel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	9	19	of7z	grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1	I am free from all	Here, **For** introduces verses [19–23](../09/19.md). Paul is drawing an inference from what he said in [9:18](../09/18.md) about offering the gospel “without charge.” Since he offers the gospel without charge, he is **free from all**. In this and the following verses, Paul will explain what he does as someone who is **free from all** and how this is beneficial or a “reward.” If your readers would misunderstand **For**, you could use a word or phrase that introduces an explanation or further development. Alternate translation: “” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
1CO	9	19	b83w	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	ὢν	1	I am free from all	Here, **being** introduces a phrase that: (1) contrasts with **I enslaved myself**. Alternate translation: “although I am” (2) gives the reason why Paul can “enslave himself.” Alternate translation: “because I am” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
1CO	9	19	s48l	figs-metaphor	ἐλεύθερος…ὢν ἐκ πάντων, πᾶσιν ἐμαυτὸν ἐδούλωσα	1	I am free from all	Here Paul uses the language of slavery and freedom to describe how he proclaims the gospel. Since he does not charge money when he proclaims the gospel, he is **free**. No person employs him or tells him what to do. However, Paul decides to serve others, to “enslave himself,” by doing what others think is right. In this way, he acts like a slave, who has to do what his master requires. If your readers would misunderstand the slavery and freedom metaphor, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “not having to obey all, I choose to obey all” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	9	19	gv2u	figs-explicit	πάντων, πᾶσιν	1	I am free from all	Here, the Corinthians would have understood **all** to refer specifically to people. If your readers would misunderstand **all**, you could include a word or phrase that clarifies that Paul is speaking about “people.” Alternate translation: “all people … to all people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	9	19	xlhn	translate-unknown	κερδήσω	1	I am free from all	Here, to **gain** someone means to help them to believe in the Messiah. Once people believe, they belong to Christ and his church, and so the person who preached the gospel to them “gained” them as a new part of the church. If your readers would misunderstand **gain**, you could express the idea non-figuratively or with a comparable phrase. Alternate translation: “I might convert” or “I might gain for Christ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	9	19	mms9	figs-explicit	τοὺς πλείονας	1	I might gain even more	Here Paul is speaking about how “enslaving himself” **to all** gains **more** than if he did not “enslave himself” in this way. He refers specifically to people here, just like **all** refers to people. If your readers would misunderstand **even more things**, you could clarify that Paul is referring to gaining **more** people than if he did not “enslave himself.” Alternate translation: “even more people” or “more people in this way” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	9	20	hh8t		ἐγενόμην…ὡς Ἰουδαῖος	1	I became like a Jew	Alternate translation: “I practiced Jewish customs”
1CO	9	20	g1ig	translate-unknown	κερδήσω	-1	I became like a Jew	Just as in [9:19](../09/19.md), to **gain** someone means to help them to believe in the Messiah. Translate this word the same way you did in [9:19](../09/19.md). Alternate translation: “to convert” or “to gain for Christ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	9	20	s9tu	figs-metaphor	ὑπὸ νόμον	-1	I became like one under the law	Here Paul speaks about those who think that they need to obey the law as if they were physically **under the law**. By speaking as if **the law** were on top of these people, Paul emphasizes how **the law** controls their lives. If your readers would misunderstand **under the law**, you could use a word or phrase that refers to the obligation to obey **the law**. Alternate translation: “who keep the law … one who keeps the law … one who keeps the law … who keep the law” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	9	20	buuw	figs-ellipsis	ὑπὸ νόμον, ὡς ὑπὸ νόμον	1	I became like one under the law	Here Paul omits some words that your language may require to make a complete thought. Paul omits these words because he stated them explicitly in the previous clause (**I became**). If your language does need these words, you can supply them from that clause.

1CO	9	20	fhhp	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	μὴ ὢν	1	I became like one under the law	Here, **not being** introduces a phrase that contrasts with *as under the law**. If your readers would misunderstand **not being**, you could add words that introduce a contrast. Alternate translation: “although I am not” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
1CO	9	20	d330	figs-infostructure	νόμον, μὴ ὢν αὐτὸς ὑπὸ νόμον, ἵνα τοὺς ὑπὸ νόμον κερδήσω	1	I became like one under the law	Here, **in order to win those under the law** is the purpose for which Paul acts like a person **under the law**. The phrase **not being under the law myself** indicates that Paul realizes that he is not actually **under the law**. If your language would put the purpose immediate after what leads to that purpose, you could rearrange these two clauses. Alternate translation: “the law in order to win those under the law, not being under the law myself” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
1CO	9	21	vjuq	translate-unknown	τοῖς ἀνόμοις…ἄνομος…τοὺς ἀνόμους	1	outside the law	Here, **without the law** refers to people who do not have **the law** that Moses wrote down. These people are not Jews, but Paul is not saying that they are disobedient. Rather, Paul is emphasizing **the law** that Moses wrote down here, which is why he uses this language rather than referring to “Gentiles” or “non-Jews.” If your readers would misunderstand **without the law**, you could express the idea by clarifying that Paul is referring to people who do not have the law of Moses. Alternate translation: “To those without Moses’ law … without Moses’ law … those without Moses’ law” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	9	21	htnr	figs-ellipsis	ὡς ἄνομος	1	outside the law	Here Paul omits some words that your language may require to make a complete thought. Paul omits these words because he stated them explicitly in the previous verses (**I became** in [9:20](../09/20.md)). If your language does need these words, you can supply them from that clause. Since English needs these words, the ULT has supplied them in brackets. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

If your readers would find this structure confusing, you can rearrange the clauses so that the purpose comes immediately after **without the law**, or you can mark the statements in the middle as parenthetical, like the ULT does. Alternate translation: “so that I might win those without the law. Now I am not without the law of God, but under the law of Christ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
1CO	9	21	hzib	figs-possession	ἄνομος Θεοῦ	1	outside the law	Here Paul uses the possessive form to state that: (1) he is **not without the law** that **God** has given. Paul distinguishes between the **law** that Moses wrote down and God’s **law** in general. Alternate translation: “without any law from God” (2) he is **not** someone who is disobedient (**without the law**) towards **God**. Paul is distinguishing between people who do not have the **law** that Moses wrote down and people who disobey God.

1CO	9	21	qtu7	figs-metaphor	ἔννομος Χριστοῦ	1	outside the law	Much like in [9:20](../09/20.md), Paul speaks about those who think that they need to obey **the law** as if they were physically **under the law**. By speaking as if **the law** were on top of these people, Paul emphasizes how **the law** controls their lives. If your readers would misunderstand **under the law**, you could use a word or phrase that refers to the obligation to obey **the law of Christ**.

1CO	9	22	dd4r	figs-nominaladj	τοῖς ἀσθενέσιν…τοὺς ἀσθενεῖς	1	outside the law	Paul is using the adjective **weak** as a noun in order to describe a group of people.

By this, he means that he himself is the means by which God will save **some**. If your readers would misunderstand how Paul says that can **save some**, you could use a word or phrase that refers to leading someone towards “salvation,” that is, helping them to believe in Jesus.

If your readers would misunderstand **partaker**, you could use a comparable word or phrase that indicates that Paul is a “participator” or “sharer” in the **gospel**.

Paul does not ask this question because he is looking for information. Rather, he asks it to involve the Corinthians in what he is arguing. The question assumes that the answer is “yes, we know.” If your readers would misunderstand this question, you could express the idea with a strong statement. Alternate translation: “You certainly know that in a race all those who are running run, but only one receives the prize.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
1CO	9	24	mq1d	figs-exmetaphor	οἱ ἐν σταδίῳ τρέχοντες, πάντες μὲν τρέχουσιν, εἷς δὲ λαμβάνει τὸ βραβεῖον? οὕτως τρέχετε, ἵνα καταλάβητε	1	run	Here Paul begins using athletic metaphors, metaphors he will use throughout [9:24–27](../09/24.md). In this verse, he focuses on footraces. In his culture, only the runner who finished first would receive **the prize**. The **prize** might be many things, but often it was a “wreath” of leaves (see [9:25](../09/25.md)). Paul’s point is that the runner who wished to win had to work and train hard to be the best. Paul wants the Corinthians to approach their Christian lives with this mindset, the mindset of a successful athlete. Translate this verse in a way that clearly connects the Christian life to a footrace. Alternate translation: “only one runner receives the prize after a race? You should live your lives like a runner who focuses on receiving the prize” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])

1CO	9	24	mh8z	translate-unknown	βραβεῖον	1	So run in such a way that you might obtain it	Here, **prize** refers to what a runner would receive after winning the race. In Paul’s culture, this would often be a “wreath” of leaves ([9:25](../09/25.md)) and sometimes money. Use a word in your culture that refers generally to what an athlete receives after winning a contest. Alternate translation: “trophy” or “reward” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	9	25	l334	translate-unknown	πᾶς…ὁ ἀγωνιζόμενος	1	a wreath that is perishable … one that is imperishable	Here, **everyone competing in the games** refers generally to any athlete who participates in a competition, not just runners as in the last verse. Use a word or phrase in your language that refers to athletes who compete in any sport or competition. Alternate translation: “every competitor in athletic competitions” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translatve/translate-unknown]])
1CO	9	25	mypo	translate-unknown	ἐγκρατεύεται	1	a wreath that is perishable … one that is imperishable	Here Paul specifically has in mind the way an athlete only eats certain foods, trains their body in difficult ways, and behaves differently than most other people. All of this requires **self-control**. He implies at the end of the verse that **we** too must exercise **self-control**. If possible, use a word or phrase that refers to athletic training but that can be applied to the Christian life as well. Alternate translation: “disciplines themselves” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	9	25	rqey	figs-ellipsis	ἐκεῖνοι μὲν οὖν ἵνα	1	a wreath that is perishable … one that is imperishable	Here Paul omits some words that may be required in your language to make a full sentence. If your language needs these words, you could supply them from the first sentence in the verse. Since English needs these words, the ULT has supplied them in brackets. Alternate translation: “They therefore {exercise self-control} in order that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
1CO	9	25	s0n2	figs-explicit	φθαρτὸν στέφανον	1	a wreath that is perishable … one that is imperishable	Here, the **wreath** refers to a crown made out of leaves gathered from a plant or a tree. This **wreath** was given to an athlete who won a contest as a symbol of their victory. Since the **wreath** was made out of leaves, it was **perishable**. If your readers would misunderstand **perishable wreath**, you could express the idea by using a word or phrase that refers to what a winning athlete receives while still emphasizing that this prize is **perishable**. Alternate translation: “a breakable medal” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	9	25	w421	figs-ellipsis	ἡμεῖς…ἄφθαρτον	1	a wreath that is perishable … one that is imperishable	Here Paul omits some words that may be required in your language to make a full sentence. If your language needs these words, you could supply them from earlier in the verse. Alternate translation: “we {do it in order that we might receive} an imperishable one” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
1CO	9	25	bfe4	figs-metaphor	ἄφθαρτον	1	a wreath that is perishable … one that is imperishable	Here Paul speaks of a **wreath** that is **imperishable** that believers will **receive**. He speaks of what God will give to believers as a **wreath** in order to emphasize that Christians will receive something like the honor and glory that a successful athlete receives, but that it will be better because it will be **imperishable**. If your readers would misunderstand this figure of speech, you could express the idea non-figuratively or with an analogy. Alternate translation: “an imperishable reward that is like a wreath” or “an imperishable prize” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	9	26	k64n	figs-exmetaphor	ἐγὼ…οὕτως τρέχω, ὡς οὐκ ἀδήλως; οὕτως πυκτεύω, ὡς οὐκ ἀέρα δέρων	1	I do not run without purpose or box by beating the air	Here, Paul uses two different athletic metaphors, the first from footraces and the second from boxing. Both metaphors emphasize how Paul remains focused on his goal. As a runner, he has a **purpose**, which is reaching the finish line as fast as possible. As a boxer, he does not box **the air** but rather focuses on striking his opponent. If your readers would misunderstand these figures of speech, you could express the ideas non-figuratively or by using analogies. Alternate translation: “I focus on the goal, much like a runner focuses on the finish line and a boxer focuses on striking the opponent” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])
1CO	9	26	m7gf	figs-infostructure	οὕτως…ὡς οὐκ ἀδήλως; οὕτως…ὡς οὐκ ἀέρα δέρων	1		In both halves of this verse, Paul introduces how he “runs” or “fights” with the word **thus**, and then he explains more clearly how he “runs” or “fights.” If your readers would find this confusing, you could introduce how Paul “runs” or “fights” more naturally. Alternate translation: “not as without purpose … not as boxing the air” or “as one who is not without purpose … as one who is not boxing the air” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
1CO	9	26	muuc	figs-litotes	ὡς οὐκ ἀδήλως	1		Here Paul uses a figure of speech that expresses a strong positive meaning by using a negative word together with a word that is the opposite of the intended meaning. If this is confusing in your language, you can express the meaning positively. Alternate translation: “as with purpose” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
1CO	9	26	k69i	figs-idiom	ὡς οὐκ ἀέρα δέρων	1		Here Paul refers to a boxer who hits **the air** instead of the opponent. This kind of boxer does not succeed. If your readers would misunderstand **boxing the air**, you could use a phrase that refers to a boxer who often misses his punches. Alternate translation: “not as missing my punches” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1CO	9	27	pma2	figs-metaphor	ὑπωπιάζω μου τὸ σῶμα	1		Here, Paul uses words that continue the boxing metaphor from [9:26](../09/26.md). He says, “I give my body a black eye.” Paul’s point is that he controls or rules over his **body**, just like boxers control or rule over any opponents that they have punched in the face. He does not mean that he physically hurts his body. Since this language would be misunderstood in English, the ULT has expressed the idea non-figuratively. You could also express the idea non-figuratively, or you could use a comparable metaphor. Alternate translation: “I rule my body” or “I take control of my body” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	9	27	whfp	figs-synecdoche	μου τὸ σῶμα, καὶ δουλαγωγῶ	1		Here Paul uses **my body** to refer to himself as a whole. He does not mean that his non-physical part “subdues” and “enslaves” his physical part. Rather, he means that he “subdues” and “enslaves” himself. If your readers would misunderstand **my body**, you could express the idea by using a natural way in your language to refer to oneself. Alternate translation: “myself and enslave myself” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
1CO	9	27	n001	figs-metaphor	δουλαγωγῶ	1		Here, Paul speaks as if he were “enslaving” his **body**. He speaks in this way to again emphasize that he controls and rules over himself. If your readers would misunderstand **enslave**, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “control it” or “govern it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	9	27	tyca	grammar-connect-time-sequential	μή πως ἄλλοις κηρύξας	1		Here, **having preached to others** could identify: (1) what Paul has done before he **might be disqualified**. Alternate translation: “lest, after having preached to others” (2) a contrast a with how he **might be disqualified**. Alternate translation: “lest, although I have preached to others” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
1CO	9	27	blb7	figs-metaphor	αὐτὸς ἀδόκιμος γένωμαι	1	I myself may not be disqualified	Here, **disqualified** continues the athletic imagery. An athlete who is **disqualified** is unable to win the competition and receive the prize. Paul speaks in this way to emphasize that he wants to be able to receive a reward from God. If your readers would misunderstand this figure of speech, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “I myself might not reach the goal” or “I myself might fail to please God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	9	27	s3sd	figs-activepassive	αὐτὸς ἀδόκιμος γένωμαι	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Paul implies that “God” did it. Alternate translation: “God might disqualify even me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1CO	10	intro	abcd			0		# 1 Corinthians 10 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n5. On food (8:1–11:1)\n      * Warning from Israelite history (10:1–12)\n      * Encouragement and command (10:13–14)\n      * The Lord’s Supper and food offered to idols (10:15–22)\n      * Both freedom and care for others (10:23–11:1)\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### The Exodus and wilderness journey\n\nIn the first half of this chapter, Paul consistently refers to the narrative about how God rescued the Israelites from Egypt and led them through the wilderness so that they could take possession of the land he had promised to give them. He mentions multiple stories from this narrative. God led the Israelites by appearing as a pillar of cloud, and he made a path through the sea for them (see [Exodus 13:17–14:31](exo/13/17.md)). God miraculously provided them with food while they were traveling through the desert (see [Exodus 16](exo/16/01.md)), and he also provided water from a rock for them to drink (see [Exodus 17:1–7](exo/17/01.md) and [Numbers 20:2–13](num/29/02.md)). Despite this, the Israelites often grumbled against God and against their leaders, so God punished them by letting them die in the wilderness (see [Numbers 14:20–35](num/14/20.md)). The Israelites also worshiped other gods (see [Exodus 32:1–6](exo/32/01.md)) and committed sexual immorality (see [Numbers 25:1–9](num/25/01.md)), so God again punished them. Other times when the Israelites complained about their leaders, God sent snakes (see [Numbers 21:5–6](num/21/05.md)) or a plague ([Numbers 16:41–50](num/16/41.md)) to kill them. Paul’s point here is that God acted to save the Israelites, but when they disobeyed or grumbled, God punished them. Paul wants the Corinthians to understand this as a warning to them as well. They should not be like the Israelites. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/promisedland]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/desert]])\n\n### “Spiritual”\n\nIn [10:3–4](../10/03.md), Paul states that the Israelites ate “spiritual food” and drank “spiritual drink” from a “spiritual rock.” By “spiritual,” Paul could be referring to the action of God’s Spirit, who provided the food and drink from the rock. By using “spiritual,” Paul could also be identifying the “food,” “drink,” and “rock” as prefigurations or types of the Lord’s Supper, which he discusses later in the chapter. Or, he could simply want the reader to think of the Lord’s Supper without drawing any direct connection. Consider the theology of the group you are translating for to decide exactly how to express “spiritual” here. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/spirit]])\n\n### The Lord’s Supper\n\nIn [10:16–17](../10/16.md), [21](../10/21.md), Paul refers to the Lord’s Supper. He describes the unity that comes with the Lord and with other believers when believers partake of the “cup” and the “table,” that is, the bread and the wine. He then argues that this unity means that participating in the Lord’s Supper is incompatible with participating in meals that unite one to idols, or rather, to the demons that the idols represent. In these verses, use words and phrases that fit with how your language talks about the Lord’s Supper. \n\n### Things sacrificed to idols\n\nIn Paul’s culture, animals were often sacrificed to the gods. After the animal was slaughtered, the people who were participating in the worship would eat parts of the animal. Other times, some of the meat would be sold in the market, as Paul implies in [10:25](../10/25.md). For most people who were not wealthy, participating in worship with a sacrifice or buying sacrificed meat in the market were two of the few situations in which they could eat meat. Throughout this chapter, Paul continues to explain how the Corinthians should think about eating or not eating this meat. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/falsegod]])\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Rhetorical questions\n\nIn [10:16](../10/16.md), [18–19](../10/18.md), [22](../10/22.md), [29–30](../10/29.md), Paul uses rhetorical questions. He is not asking these questions because he wants the Corinthians to provide him with information. Rather, he is asking these questions because he wants the Corinthians to think about how they are acting and what they are thinking. The questions encourage them to think along with Paul. For ways to translate these questions, look for the notes on each verse that includes these kinds of questions. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])\n\n### “That rock was Christ”\n\nIn [10:4](../10/04.md), Paul states that the “rock” from which the Israelites received water “was Christ.” This metaphor can be interpreted in two major ways: (1) Paul could be saying that Christ was the one who made the rock provide the Israelites with water. (2) Paul could be saying that the rock provided water for the Israelites like Christ provides salvation for those who believe in him. (3) Paul could be saying that Christ was somehow present in or with the rock itself. Since Paul’s sentence allows for a number of interpretations, if possible you should also allow for a number of interpretations with your translation. Also, consider the theology of the group you are translating for to decide exactly how to express “that rock was Christ.”\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Quoting the Corinthians\n\nIn [10:23](../10/23.md), Paul quotes words that the Corinthians have said or that they wrote to him. The ULT indicates these words by putting quotation marks around them. Use a natural way in your language to indicate that an author is quoting someone else. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])\n\n### Are [10:28–29a](../10/28.md) a parenthesis?\n\nIn [10:25–27](../10/25.md), Paul tells the Corinthians that they can eat any food from the marketplace or in someone’s home without asking about whether it was sacrificed to an idol. Everything belongs to God, so whether it was sacrificed or not does not matter. However, in [10:28–29a](../10/28.md), Paul gives an exception: if someone tells you directly that the food was sacrificed to an idol, you should not eat it for the sake of the person who told you. Immediately after, however, in [10:29b](../10/29.md), he asks a question that implies that one’s freedom should be constrained by some other person’s ideas about right and wrong. This does not seem to fit with the exception Paul has given in [10:28–29a](../10/28.md). Most likely, Paul means [10:28–29a](../10/28.md) to be understood as a side note, and [10:29b](../10/29.md) follows directly from [10:27](../10/27.md). In order to indicate this, the UST puts parentheses around [10:28–29a](../10/28.md). Consider using a natural way in your language to indicate a side note or a digression from the main argument. \n

What Paul says in these verses explains what he said the previous verse about how he and other believers should work hard not to be “disqualified” ([9:27](../09/27.md)). The Israelites whom God took out of Egypt were “disqualified,” and believers should work not to be like them. If your readers would misunderstand **For**, you could use a word or phrase that introduces an example or support. Alternate translation: “Here is an example:” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
1CO	10	1	navn	figs-litotes	οὐ θέλω…ὑμᾶς ἀγνοεῖν	1	our fathers	Here Paul uses a figure of speech that expresses a strong positive meaning by using a negative word together with a word that is the opposite of the intended meaning. If this is confusing in your language, you can express the meaning positively. Alternate translation: “I want you to know” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
1CO	10	1	hhts	figs-gendernotations	ἀδελφοί…οἱ πατέρες	1	our fathers	Although the words **brothers** and **fathers** are masculine, Paul is using them to refer to both men and women. If your readers would misunderstand **brothers** and **fathers**, you could use non-gendered words or refer to both genders. Alternate translation: “brothers and sisters … fathers and mothers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
1CO	10	1	mnri	translate-kinship	οἱ πατέρες ἡμῶν	1	our fathers	Here, **our fathers** refers to the Israelites who were slaves in Egypt and whom God rescued. Not all the Corinthians were descended from these Israelites. However, Paul can still refer to the Israelites as their **fathers** because he thinks that all Christians have been included in the family of Abraham, the ancestor of the Israelites. Preserve the family language in your translation. Alternate translation: “our forefathers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship]])
1CO	10	1	v4c6	figs-explicit	πάντες ὑπὸ τὴν νεφέλην ἦσαν, καὶ πάντες διὰ τῆς θαλάσσης διῆλθον	1	passed through the sea	In this verse, Paul refers to the story of when God brought the Israelites out of Egypt. For this story, see especially [Exodus 13:17–14:31](exo/13/17.md). God appeared to the Israelites as a pillar of cloud and fire, and he led them and protected them with this pillar of cloud and fire. To get out of Egypt, God led them to a sea called the “Red Sea” or the “Sea of Reeds.” When the king of Egypt came to take the Israelites back to Egypt, God worked through Moses to separate the water of the sea and make a path for the Israelites to travel through. When the king of Egypt tried to follow them, God sent the water back, and the Egyptian army drowned. Paul draws special attention to the **cloud** and the **sea** because of what he will say in the next verse. If your readers are not familiar with this story, you could add a footnote that refers to or summarizes the story. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	10	2	q15x	figs-activepassive	πάντες εἰς τὸν Μωϋσῆν ἐβαπτίσαντο	1	All were baptized into Moses	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Paul implies that “God” or an unknown person did it. Alternate translation: “they all experienced baptism into Moses” or “God baptized them all into Moses” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1CO	10	2	f7cq	figs-idiom	πάντες εἰς τὸν Μωϋσῆν ἐβαπτίσαντο	1	All were baptized into Moses	Here, **baptized into** identifies the person with whom one is united in baptism. If your readers would misunderstand **baptized into**, you could clarify the idea by using language of union or relationship. Alternate translation: “they all were baptized so that they followed Moses” or “they all were baptized into relationship with Moses” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1CO	10	2	d4ho	figs-metaphor	πάντες εἰς τὸν Μωϋσῆν ἐβαπτίσαντο	1	All were baptized into Moses	Here Paul speaks as if the Israelites had been **baptized**, just like believers in Jesus are **baptized**. By this, he does not mean that the Israelites had a different savior, Moses. Rather, he wants to connect the Israelites and the Corinthians, and one way to do that is to connect their leaders (**Moses** and Jesus). If your readers would misunderstand **baptized into Moses**, you could express the idea by using an analogy or indicating that Paul is speaking figuratively. Since Paul’s point is to connect the ideas in this verse to “baptism into Jesus,” preserve the metaphor here. Alternate translation: “they all were baptized, so to speak, into Moses” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	10	2	isfd	translate-names	τὸν Μωϋσῆν	1	All were baptized into Moses	**Moses** is the name of a man. He is the one whom God used to take the Israelites out of Egypt. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
1CO	10	2	y72i	figs-explicit	ἐν τῇ νεφέλῃ, καὶ ἐν τῇ θαλάσσῃ	1	in the cloud	For the significance of the **cloud** and the **sea**, see the notes on the previous verse. God led the Israelites with the cloud, and he led them through the sea. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	10	3	la48	figs-explicit	πάντες τὸ αὐτὸ πνευματικὸν βρῶμα ἔφαγον	1	in the cloud	In this verse, Paul refers to how God provided the Israelites with “bread from heaven” while they were traveling through the desert. This bread is called “Manna.” For the story, see [Exodus 16](exo/16/01.md). While Paul does not explicitly state this, it is clear that he is comparing the “Manna” to the bread in the Lord’s Supper, just as he compared passing through the Red Sea with baptism in the last two verses. If your readers are not familiar with this story, you could add a footnote that refers to or summarizes the story. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	10	3	d4zh	translate-unknown	πνευματικὸν	1	in the cloud	Here, **spiritual** could indicate: (1) that the **food** came from God in a supernatural way. Alternate translation: “supernatural” (2) that Paul is indicating that the **food** should be compared with the bread in the Lord’s Supper, which is also “spiritual.” Alternate translation: “divine” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	10	4	xut2	figs-explicit	πάντες τὸ αὐτὸ πνευματικὸν ἔπιον πόμα; ἔπινον γὰρ ἐκ πνευματικῆς ἀκολουθούσης πέτρας	1	drank the same spiritual drink … spiritual rock	Here Paul refers to two stories that tell how the Israelites drank water that came out of a rock. For these stories, see [Exodus 17:1–7](exo/17/01.md) and [Numbers 20:2–13](num/20/02.md). In both of these stories, the Israelites are thirsty in the desert, and God commands Moses to act (either by speaking or by hitting the rock with a staff) so that water comes out of the rock for the Israelites to drink. If your readers are not familiar with these stories, you could add a footnote that refers to or summarizes the stories. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	10	4	wina	translate-unknown	πνευματικὸν	1	drank the same spiritual drink … spiritual rock	Here, **spiritual** could indicate: (1) that the **drink** came from God in a supernatural way. Alternate translation: “supernatural” (2) that Paul is indicating that the **drink** should be compared with the wine in the Lord’s Supper, which is also “spiritual.” Alternate translation: “divine” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	10	4	op27	translate-unknown	πνευματικῆς	1	drank the same spiritual drink … spiritual rock	Here, **spiritual** could indicate: (1) that God used the **rock** in a supernatural way. Alternate translation: “a supernatural” (2) that Paul is already hinting that the **rock** should be interpreted as more than a rock but as **Christ** (as he does at the end of the verse). Alternate translation: “a divine” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	10	4	hcae	figs-explicit	ἀκολουθούσης πέτρας	1	drank the same spiritual drink … spiritual rock	Some early Jewish scholars used the two stories about the water coming from the rock to argue that it was the same rock in both stories. This means that the rock was **following** the Israelites as they journeyed through the desert. Paul seems to refer to this interpretation here. If your readers would misunderstanding **following them**, you could include a footnote explaining why Paul speaks in this way. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	10	4	whj4	figs-metaphor	ἡ…πέτρα ἦν ὁ Χριστός	1	that rock was Christ	Here Paul identifies the **rock** as **Christ**. By speaking in this way, he means that the rock was the source of water and life for the Israelites, just as **Christ** is the source of life for all those who believe in him. Paul also probably means that **Christ** was the one who made the water come from the **rock**. If possible, preserve Paul’s metaphor here. If you must express the idea in another, you could state a comparison between how the **rock** provided for the Israelites and how **Christ** provides for all his people. Alternate translation: “they received water from that rock like we receive life from Christ” or “Christ provided for them through the rock, and he provides for us now” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	10	5	lh93		οὐκ…ηὐδόκησεν	1	not well pleased	Alternate translation: “was displeased”
1CO	10	5	tnu4	figs-activepassive	οὐκ ἐν τοῖς πλείοσιν αὐτῶν ηὐδόκησεν ὁ Θεός	1	most of them	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Paul implies that “they” caused it. Alternate translation: “most of them were not pleasing to God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1CO	10	5	w673	figs-activepassive	κατεστρώθησαν	1	their corpses were scattered about	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Paul implies that “God” did it. Alternate translation: “God scattered them about” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1CO	10	5	jxua	figs-euphemism	κατεστρώθησαν…ἐν	1	their corpses were scattered about	Paul is referring to the deaths of many Israelites as “scattering about.” This is a polite way of referring to something unpleasant while still expressing the idea that they died in many different places. If **they were scattered about** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a different polite way of referring to deaths or you could state it plainly. Alternate translation: “they passed away throughout” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
1CO	10	5	b96g	figs-explicit	κατεστρώθησαν…ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ	1	in the wilderness	Here, Paul speaks in general of how the Israelites left Egypt to go to the land that God had promised to give them. To get to that land, they traveled through **the wilderness**. However, the Israelites often disobeyed or grumbled against God, and so he **was not well pleased with most of them**. He punished them by letting most of them die **in the wilderness** and only allowing their children to enter the land that he had promised. See [Numbers 14:20–35](num/14/20.md) for God’s announcement of judgment. If your readers are not familiar with this story, you could add a footnote that refers to or summarizes the story. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	10	6	dzkm	writing-pronouns	ταῦτα	1	in the wilderness	Here, **these things** refers to what he has said about the Israelites in [10:1–5](../10/01.md). If your readers would misunderstand **these things**, you could more clearly express what it refers to. Alternate translation: “what happened to them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
1CO	10	6	nr6j	figs-idiom	ἐγενήθησαν	1	in the wilderness	Here Paul states that what happened to the Israelites **became examples**. This means that what happened can be interpreted as **examples** or occurred as **examples**. If your readers would misunderstand **became**, you could more clearly state that **these things** should be understood as **examples**. Alternate translation: “can be understood as” or “happened as” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1CO	10	6	afxo		μὴ εἶναι ἡμᾶς ἐπιθυμητὰς	1	in the wilderness	Alternate translation: “we would not desire”
1CO	10	6	eisd	figs-ellipsis	ἐπεθύμησαν	1	to play	Here Paul omits some words that may be required in your language to make a full sentence. If your language needs these words, you could supply them from earlier in the verse. Alternate translation: “desired evil things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
1CO	10	7	lven	writing-quotations	ὥσπερ γέγραπται	1	to play	In Paul’s culture, **even as it is written** was a normal way to introduce a quotation from an important text. In this case, the quotation comes from [Exodus 32:6](exo/32/06.md). If your readers would misunderstand how Paul introduces the quotation, you could use a comparable phrase that indicates that Paul is quoting from an important text. Alternate translation: “for it can be read in Exodus” or “For the book of Exodus says” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
1CO	10	7	ej16	figs-quotations	γέγραπται, ἐκάθισεν ὁ λαὸς φαγεῖν καὶ πεῖν, καὶ ἀνέστησαν παίζειν	1	to play	If your language does not use this form, you could translate the command as an indirect quote instead of as a direct quote. Alternate translation: “it is written that the people sat down to eat and to drink and rose up to play” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
1CO	10	7	awhu	figs-explicit	ἐκάθισεν ὁ λαὸς φαγεῖν καὶ πεῖν, καὶ ἀνέστησαν παίζειν	1	to play	This quotation comes from a story in which Moses has gone up on a mountain to meet with God. While he is gone, the Israelites make an idol and worship it. This quotation is how their worship is described. Paul chooses this verse because it refers specifically to food sacrificed to idols and to sexual immorality (**play**, see the next note), which are the topics he has and will discuss. If your readers are not familiar with this story, you could add a footnote that refers to or summarizes the story. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	10	7	ukp4	figs-euphemism	παίζειν	1	to play	Here, **play** is a polite way to refer to sexual behavior. If your readers would misunderstand **play**, you could use a comparable polite term. Alternate translation: “to have sex” or “to make love” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
1CO	10	8	szje	figs-abstractnouns	πορνεύωμεν…ἐπόρνευσαν	1	In one day, twenty-three thousand people died	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **immorality**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “immoral.” Alternate translation: “should we commit what is sexually immoral … committed what is sexually immoral” or “should behave in sexually immoral ways … behaved in sexually immoral ways” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1CO	10	8	jb3v	figs-explicit	τινες αὐτῶν ἐπόρνευσαν, καὶ ἔπεσαν μιᾷ ἡμέρᾳ εἴκοσι τρεῖς χιλιάδες	1	In one day, twenty-three thousand people died	Here Paul refers to a story found in [Numbers 25:1–9](num/25/01.md). In this story, many Israelites began to worship a god named “Baal of Peor.” While worshiping this god, they also **committed sexual immorality**. God judged the Israelites by killing 24,000 of them. If your readers are not familiar with this story, you could add a footnote that refers to or summarizes the story. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	10	8	vlru	grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ	1	In one day, twenty-three thousand people died	Here, **and** introduces the result of the Israelites “committing” **sexual immorality**. If your language does not use **and** to introduce a result, you could use a word or phrase that is more natural. Alternate translation: “and as a result,” or “with the result that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
1CO	10	8	vw5g	translate-numbers	εἴκοσι τρεῖς χιλιάδες	1	In one day, twenty-three thousand people died	Here, **23,000** does not match the number that the Old Testament story includes, which is 24,000. Most likely, Paul is using a round number here. Consider using ways in your language to express a number, particularly a round number. Alternate translation: “about twenty-three thousand people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])
1CO	10	8	mc7x	figs-euphemism	ἔπεσαν	1	In one day, twenty-three thousand people died	Paul is referring to the deaths of many Israelites as “falling.” This is a polite way of referring to something unpleasant. If **fell** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a different polite way of referring to deaths or you could state the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “they passed away” or “fell down dead” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
1CO	10	8	xqfc	translate-numbers	μιᾷ ἡμέρᾳ	1	In one day, twenty-three thousand people died	Here, **one day** refers to one cycle of the sun while the sun is up. Use a word or phrase in your language that refers to this time period. Alternate translation: “in a single day” or “during one daytime” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])
1CO	10	9	z4xf	figs-explicit	τινες αὐτῶν ἐπείρασαν, καὶ ὑπὸ τῶν ὄφεων ἀπώλλυντο	1	were destroyed by snakes	Here Paul refers to a story found in [Numbers 21:5–6](num/21/05.md). In this story, many Israelites “spoke against” or challenged their leaders and God himself. In response, God sent **snakes**, and the **snakes** bit the Israelites, and many of them died. If your readers are not familiar with this story, you could add a footnote that refers to or summarizes the story. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	10	9	rhyb	grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ	1	were destroyed by snakes	Here, **and** introduces the result of the Israelites “putting” **the Lord to the test**.

1CO	10	9	l5h4	figs-activepassive	ὑπὸ τῶν ὄφεων ἀπώλλυντο	1	were destroyed by snakes	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Paul implies that “God” did it by using **the snakes**. Alternate translation: “God used snakes to destroy them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1CO	10	10	tdsy	figs-explicit	τινὲς αὐτῶν ἐγόγγυσαν, καὶ ἀπώλοντο ὑπὸ τοῦ ὀλοθρευτοῦ	1	were destroyed by the destroyer	Here Paul refers to a story found in [Numbers 16:41–50](num/16/41.md) and perhaps also a story found in [Numbers 14:1–38](num/14/01.md). In both of these stories, Israelites “grumble” or complain about how their leaders and God himself are leading them. In response, God sends a plague or kills Israelites who **grumbled**. If your readers are not familiar with these stories, you could add a footnote that refers to or summarizes the stories. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]]) Num 16:41–50
1CO	10	10	cz1e	grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ	1	were destroyed by the destroyer	Here, **and** introduces the result of the Israelites “grumbling.” If your language does not use **and** to introduce a result, you could use a word or phrase that is more natural.

1CO	10	10	h02d	translate-unknown	τοῦ ὀλοθρευτοῦ	1	were destroyed by the destroyer	Here, **destroyer** refers to an angelic messenger whom God sends to “destroy.” Sometimes, this angel is called “the Angel of Death.” The stories that Paul refers to do not explicitly mention **the destroyer**, but Paul understands **the destroyer** to be the one who acts out God’s judgment by bringing a plague and killing Israelites. If your readers would misunderstand **the destroyer**, you could use a word or phrase that refers to a spiritual being that “destroys.” However, this spiritual being must be one whom God could send. Alternate translation: “the angel of death” or “a destroying angel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	10	11	u1mp	writing-pronouns	ταῦτα	1	these things happened to them	Here, **these things** refers back to what Paul has said about the Israelites in [10:7–10](../10/07.md).

1CO	10	11	bxef	translate-unknown	τυπικῶς	1	these things happened to them	Just as in [10:6](../10/06.md), **examples** here refers to how the stories about the Israelites function as **examples** or “illustrations” for the believers who hear or read those stories. If your readers would misunderstand **examples**, you could use a comparable word or phrase, and compare with how you translated “examples” in [10:6](../10/06.md).

1CO	10	11	xlwp	grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	2	these things happened to them	Here, **but** introduces a further development. It does not contrast with the previous clause.

1CO	10	11	zavw	figs-activepassive	ἐγράφη	1	these things happened to them	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Paul implies that “someone” did it. Alternate translation: “a person wrote them” or “people wrote them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1CO	10	11	xotv	figs-abstractnouns	πρὸς νουθεσίαν ἡμῶν	1	these things happened to them	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **admonition**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “admonish.” Alternate translation: “to admonish us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1CO	10	11	wmp1	figs-metaphor	εἰς οὓς τὰ τέλη τῶν αἰώνων κατήντηκεν	1	as examples	Here Paul speaks as if **the end of the ages** could **come** on somebody. By speaking as if **the end of the ages** were something that could **come**, Paul expresses the idea that he and the Corinthians are living during **the end of the ages**. If your readers would misunderstand this figure of speech, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “who live during the end of the ages” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	10	11	j3z1	figs-idiom	εἰς οὓς τὰ τέλη τῶν αἰώνων κατήντηκεν	1	the end of the ages	Here, **the end of the ages** refers to the last period in the history of the world. It also means that this last period has been the goal of all the previous events. If your language has a way to refer to the last period in the history of the world, you could use it here. If your language has a way to refer to the end of the world, you could express the idea by stating that the end of the world will happen soon. Alternate translation: “to whom the end of the world is coming soon” or “on whom the end times have come” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1CO	10	12	df2p	figs-metaphor	ἑστάναι…μὴ πέσῃ	1	does not fall	Here someone who **stands** is someone who is strong and faithful when following Jesus. People who **fall** are those who fail to faithfully follow Jesus and whom God punishes, just like he punished the Israelites. “Standing” and “falling” represent physically the spiritual state of the person. If your readers would misunderstand **stands** and **fall**, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “he has firm footing … he might not slip” or “he acts faithfully … he might not fail” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	10	12	hn4j	figs-imperative	βλεπέτω	1	does not fall	Here, Paul uses a third person imperative. If you have third person imperatives in your language, you could use one here. If you do not have third person imperatives, you could express the idea using words such as “should” or “needs to.” Alternate translation: “he needs to be careful that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
1CO	10	12	s8yj	figs-gendernotations	ἑστάναι, βλεπέτω μὴ πέσῃ	1	does not fall	Although **he** and **him** are masculine, Paul is using them to refer to anyone, whether man or woman. If **he** and **him** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use non-gendered words or refer to both genders. Alternate translation: “he or she stands, let him or her be careful that he or she might not fall” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
1CO	10	13	a8vj	grammar-connect-exceptions	πειρασμὸς ὑμᾶς οὐκ εἴληφεν, εἰ μὴ ἀνθρώπινος	1	No temptation has overtaken you that is not common to all humanity	If it would appear in your language that Paul was making a statement here and then contradicting it, you could reword this to avoid using an exception clause. Alternate translation: “The only temptations that have seized you are those that are common to humanity” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-exceptions]])
1CO	10	13	hc7q	figs-personification	πειρασμὸς ὑμᾶς οὐκ εἴληφεν	1	He will not let you be tempted beyond your ability	Here, a **temptation** is spoken of figuratively as though it were a person who could “seize” someone. If this might be confusing for your readers, you could express this meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “You have encountered no temptation” or “No temptation has tempted you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
1CO	10	13	e4je	figs-abstractnouns	πειρασμὸς…οὐκ…σὺν τῷ πειρασμῷ	1	He will not let you be tempted beyond your ability	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **temptation**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “tempt.” Alternate translation: “Nothing that is tempting … with what is tempting you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1CO	10	13	r066	figs-idiom	ἀνθρώπινος	1	He will not let you be tempted beyond your ability	Something that **is common to humanity** is something that many humans experience, and it is not unique to one or two people.

1CO	10	13	a72t	figs-activepassive	ὑμᾶς πειρασθῆναι	1	will not let you be tempted	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

1CO	10	13	idi9	figs-metaphor	ὑπὲρ ὃ δύνασθε	1	will not let you be tempted	Here Paul speaks as if a **temptation** could be **beyond** what the Corinthians **are able** to handle. By speaking as if the **temptation** is too far in distance, Paul emphasizes that a **temptation** that is **beyond** would be one that the Corinthians could not resist, just as they could not reach a place that is **beyond** them. If your readers would misunderstand this figure of speech, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “above what you are able” or “so that you are not able” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	10	13	au0q	figs-ellipsis	δύνασθε	1	will not let you be tempted	Here Paul omits what the Corinthians **are able** to do.

1CO	10	14	ly4k	figs-abstractnouns	τῆς εἰδωλολατρίας	1	flee away from idolatry	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **idolatry**, you could express the idea by using a phrase such as “worshiping other gods” or “serving idols.” Alternate translation: “serving idols” or “worshiping idols” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1CO	10	15	ed82	grammar-connect-condition-fact	ὡς φρονίμοις	1	flee away from idolatry	Paul here uses **as**, but he means that he thinks he really is speaking to **sensible people**. If your language does not use **as** if what it introduces is certain or true, and if your readers might misunderstand and think that what John is saying is not certain, then you could express the idea by identifying the Corinthians as **sensible people**. Alternate translation: “to you like this because you are sensible people” or “like someone who talks to reasonable people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
1CO	10	15	mnb2	writing-pronouns	ὅ φημι	1	flee away from idolatry	Here, **what I say** refers to what Paul is about to say in the next verses (especially [10:16–22](../10/16.md).

Alternate translation: “The cup in the Lord’s Supper” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
1CO	10	16	tavb	figs-metonymy\n	τὸ ποτήριον	1	The cup of blessing	Here the Corinthians would have understood **cup** to refer to the drink inside the **cup**, which in Paul’s culture would have been wine.

Alternate translation: “communion with the blood of Christ … communion with the body of Christ” (2) being joined together with other believers, which comes from sharing in the **blood** and **body** of Christ.

Here, to **break** bread refers to taking a large loaf and splitting it up into pieces so that many people can eat the pieces.

1CO	10	17	g954	translate-unknown	εἷς ἄρτος…τοῦ ἑνὸς ἄρτου	1	loaf of bread	Here, Paul speaks of **one bread** because he has in mind one “loaf” of **bread** from which **we** would eat pieces.

He speaks in this way to emphasize the unity that these people have when they eat the **one bread**, which is as close as if they had only one body.

Alternate translation: “we who are many share all things together” or “we who are many are united together” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	10	18	f97w	figs-idiom	τὸν Ἰσραὴλ κατὰ σάρκα	1	Are not those who eat the sacrifices participants in the altar?

Here Paul refers to how the priests would offer some of a sacrifice to God, while the person who gave the sacrifice and others with that person would eat the rest. In this way, the person who gave the sacrifice shared the food with God and with others.

Alternate translation: “those who eat the rest of the sacrifices after the priest has offered the best parts to God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	10	18	wz2h	figs-possession	κοινωνοὶ τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου	1	Are not those who eat the sacrifices participants in the altar?

1CO	10	19	j8dj	translate-unknown	εἰδωλόθυτόν	1	Or that food sacrificed to an idol is anything?	Just as in [8:1](../08/01.md), here Paul speaks about animals that are slaughtered, offered to a god, and then eaten. For many people in Paul’s culture, this was the only meat that was available for them to eat. In many cases, people would eat this meat at a god’s temple or shrine. However, sometimes the meat could be sold to people, who would then eat it in their homes. In the next verses, Paul will speak about whether and how Christians should eat or not eat this meat. If your language has a specific word or phrase for meat from an animal that has been offered to a god, you could use it here. If your language does not have such a word, you could use a descriptive phrase. Alternate translation: “meat from animals sacrificed to idols” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	10	19	lxm3	figs-activepassive	εἰδωλόθυτόν	1	Or that food sacrificed to an idol is anything?	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

Alternate translation: “food that people have sacrificed to idols” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1CO	10	19	l9t4	figs-rquestion	οὖν…ὅτι εἰδωλόθυτόν τὶ ἐστιν, ἢ ὅτι εἴδωλόν τὶ ἐστιν?	1		Paul does not ask this question because he is looking for information. Rather, he asks it to involve the Corinthians in what he is arguing. The question assumes that the answer is “no, they are not.” If your readers would misunderstand this question, you could express the idea with a strong negation. Alternate translation: “then? Food sacrificed to idols is nothing, and an idol is nothing.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
1CO	10	19	tmkb		τὶ ἐστιν	-1		Here, **is anything** could ask about: (1) whether **food sacrificed idols** and **an idol** are significant or important.

1CO	10	20	skct	figs-ellipsis	ἀλλ’ ὅτι	1		Here Paul omits some words that may be required in your language to make a full sentence. If your language needs these words, you could supply some from the previous verse ([10:19](../10/19.md)). Alternate translation: “Rather, I am saying that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
1CO	10	20	hvi0	figs-infostructure	ὅτι ἃ θύουσιν τὰ ἔθνη…θύουσιν	1		Here Paul states the object before the verb.

The Corinthians would have understood him to mean that it is shocking and unthinkable to do both of these things. If your readers would misunderstand **You are not able**, you could express the idea with a strong command or a statement of how bad doing both these things would be. Alternate translation: “You should never drink … You should never partake of the table” or “It is very wrong to drink … It is very wrong to partake of the table” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

The word **Or** introduces an alternate to what Paul speaks about in [10:21](../10/21.md). If they do indeed participate in meals connected to the Lord and also meals connected to demons, they will **provoke the Lord to jealousy**. If **Or** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word or phrase that signifies a contrast or gives an alternative.

1CO	10	22	l8ik	figs-rquestion	ἢ παραζηλοῦμεν τὸν Κύριον?	1	Or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy?	Paul does not ask this question because he is looking for information.

Alternate translation: “Do not provoke the Lord to jealousy.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
1CO	10	22	h9fh	figs-abstractnouns	παραζηλοῦμεν τὸν Κύριον	1	provoke	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **jealousy**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “jealous.” Alternate translation: “do we provoke the Lord to be jealous” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

By repeating **All things {are} lawful for me**, Paul emphasizes his qualifications or objections to this statement. If your language does not use repetition in this way, you could state **All things {are} lawful for me** once and include both comments after that. Alternate translation: ““All things {are} lawful for me,’ but not all things {are} beneficial, and not all things build up” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
1CO	10	23	tu2m	writing-quotations	πάντα ἔξεστιν, ἀλλ’	-1	Everything is lawful	In this verse, just as in [6:12](../06/12.md), Paul twice quotes what some people in the Corinthian church are saying. The ULT indicates that these claims are quotations by using quotation marks. If your readers would misunderstood **All things {are} lawful for me** and think that Paul is claiming this, you could clarify that some of the Corinthians are saying this, and Paul is saying the words that occur after **but**. Alternate translation: “You say, ‘All things {are} lawful for me,’ but I respond that … You say, ‘All things {are} lawful for me,’ but I respond that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])

Alternate translation: “{are} beneficial to others … build others up” (2) the person or people who say that **All things {are} lawful**. Alternate translation: “{are} beneficial for you … build you up” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	10	23	ex6z	figs-metaphor	οὐ πάντα οἰκοδομεῖ	1	not everything builds people up	Just as in [8:1](../08/01.md), Paul here speaks as if believers were a building that one could **build up**. With this metaphor, he emphasizes that only some things help believers become stronger and more mature, just like building a house makes it strong and complete. If your readers would misunderstand this figure of speech, you could express the idea non-figuratively or with a comparable metaphor. Alternate translation: “not all things enable believers to grow” or “not all things edify” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	10	24	bpf8	figs-imperative	μηδεὶς…ζητείτω	1	not everything builds people up	Here, Paul uses a third person imperative. If you have third person imperatives in your language, you could use one here.

1CO	10	24	i6ek	figs-gendernotations	ἑαυτοῦ	1	not everything builds people up	Here, **his** is written in masculine form, but it refers to anyone, no matter what their gender might be. If the meaning of **his** would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea by using a word that does not have gender or you could use both genders. Alternate translation: “his or her own” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
1CO	10	24	mcwj	figs-possession	τὸ ἑαυτοῦ…ἀλλὰ τὸ τοῦ ἑτέρου	1	not everything builds people up	Here Paul speaks of a **good** that belongs to oneself or to another person.

1CO	10	24	dppr	figs-genericnoun	τοῦ ἑτέρου	1	not everything builds people up	Paul is speaking of other people in general, not of one particular **other person**.

1CO	10	25	djh4	figs-explicit	ἐν μακέλλῳ	1	not everything builds people up	Here, **the market** is the public place where meat and other foods were **sold**.

1CO	10	25	m6w7	figs-activepassive	πωλούμενον	1	not everything builds people up	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who does the action, Paul implies that “butchers” or “sellers” do it. Alternate translation: “butchers sell” or “people sell” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1CO	10	25	b93i	figs-ellipsis	ἀνακρίνοντες	1	not everything builds people up	Here Paul does not state what they are **asking** about, since the Corinthians would have understood him without these words.

Paul is speaking as if “eating,” “drinking,” and “doing” things were a hypothetical possibility, but he means that the Corinthians will do these things. If your language does not state something as a possibility if it is certain or true, and if your readers might misunderstand and think that what Paul is saying is not certain, then you can translate his words as an affirmative statement.

1CO	11	intro	abce			0		# 1 Corinthians 11 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nThis is the beginning of a new section of the letter (Chapters 11-14). Paul now talks about proper church services. In this chapter, he deals with two different problems: women in the church services (verses 1-16) and the Lord’s Supper (verses 17-34).\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Proper conduct in a church service\n\n### Disorderly women\n\nPaul’s instructions here are debated among scholars. There may have been women who were abusing their Christian freedom and causing disorder in the church by going against established cultural customs. The disorder that their actions created would have caused him to be concerned.\n\n### The Lord’s Supper\n\nThere were problems in how the Corinthians were handling the Lord’s Supper. They did not act in a unified manner. During the feast celebrated along with the Lord’s Supper, some of them ate their own food without sharing. Some of them got drunk while the poor people remained hungry. Paul taught that the believers dishonored Christ’s death if they participated in the Lord’s Supper while they were sinning or while they were in broken relationships with each other. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/reconcile]])\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### Rhetorical questions\n\nPaul uses rhetorical questions to scold the people for their unwillingness to follow the rules for worship he has suggested. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])\n\n### The head\n\nPaul uses “head” as a metonym for authority in verse 3 and also to refer to a person’s actual head in verse 4 and following. Since they are so close together, it is likely that Paul intentionally used “head” in this way. This would show that the ideas in these verses were connected. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

1CO	11	2	ttwu	figs-metaphor	τὰς παραδόσεις κατέχετε	1	you remember me in everything	Here, Paul speaks as if **the traditions** were something physical that the Corinthians would **hold firmly to**. By using this figure of speech, Paul wishes to emphasize that the Corinthians are believing the traditions and acting in line with them as carefully and consistently as if they were physically holding on to them. If your readers would misunderstanding **hold firmly**, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “you keep the traditions” or “you follow the traditions” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	11	2	bwes	figs-abstractnouns	τὰς παραδόσεις	1	you remember me in everything	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **traditions**, you could express the idea by using a relative clause with a verb such as “teach” or “learn.” Alternate translation: “to the things you learned from me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

This is an important metaphor that Paul uses in many places, and it might contain elements of both of the possibilities in this note, so preserve the metaphor if possible. This figure of speech could refer to how the head: (1) functions as the source of life and existence for the body. The person who is identified as **the head** would function as the source of life and existence for the other person, and the other person is connected to the **head**. Alternate translation: “Christ is the source of every man, and the man {is} the source of a woman, and God {is} the source of Christ” (2) functions as the leader or director of the body. The person who is identified as **the head** would function as the authority over or leader of the other person.

Alternate translation: “each man {is} the head of his woman” or “each man is the head of each woman” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])
1CO	11	4	evt9	grammar-connect-time-simultaneous	κατὰ κεφαλῆς ἔχων	1	having something on his head	Here, **having something on his head** happens at the same time as **praying or prophesying**. If your readers would misunderstand the relationship between these events, you could use a word or phrase that indicates that the events happen at the same time. Alternate translation: “while he has something on his head” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous]])
1CO	11	4	uuv2	figs-explicit	κατὰ κεφαλῆς ἔχων	1	having something on his head	Here, **something on his head** refers to a piece of clothing that would be worn on the top and back of the head. The phrase does not refer to hair or to some piece of clothing that obscures the face. Paul does not clarify, however, what kind of clothing this might be. If possible, use a general phrase that could refer to clothing. Alternate translation: “having a covering on his head” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	11	4	g11x	translate-unknown	καταισχύνει	1	having something on his head	Here, **dishonors** is a word that refers to shaming someone else or causing them to lose honor. Use a word or phrase in your language that refers to this idea. Alternate translation: “shames” or “takes honor away from” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	11	4	lit3	figs-metaphor	τὴν κεφαλὴν αὐτοῦ	1	dishonors his head	Here, **his head** could refer to: (1) how [11:3](../11/03.md) states that “Christ is the head of every man.” The phrase **his head** thus refers to “Christ” as the **head** of the man. Alternate translation: “Christ, his head” (2) the man’s physical **head**, which would mean that the man **dishonors** “himself.” Alternate translation: “his own head” or “himself” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	11	5	b7ku	figs-explicit	ἀκατακαλύπτῳ τῇ κεφαλῇ	1	woman who prays … dishonors her head	Here, **with the head uncovered** could refer to: (1) not wearing a piece of clothing on the hair and back of the head. This piece of clothing would be similar to the one discussed in the last verse.

Alternate translation: “with her hair unbound” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	11	5	k5yl	figs-possession	τῇ κεφαλῇ	1	with her head uncovered	Here the Corinthians would have understood **the head** to refer to the **head** of the **woman**. If your readers would understand this, you could include a possessive word that clarifies whose **head** is in view. Alternate translation: “with her head” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
1CO	11	5	zcfw	translate-unknown	καταισχύνει	1	with her head uncovered	Here, **dishonors** is a word that refers to shaming someone else or causing them to lose honor.

This man would be the woman’s husband. Alternate translation: “her husband, her head” (2) again how [11:3](../11/03.md) states that “the man {is} the head of a woman.” In this case, the man would refer to men in general. Alternate translation: “every man, her head” (3) the woman’s physical **head**, which would mean that the woman **dishonors** “herself.” Alternate translation: “her own head” or “herself” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	11	5	sw8t	writing-pronouns	ἐστιν	1	as if her head were shaved	Here, **it** refers back to having **the head uncovered**.

1CO	11	5	pco3	figs-idiom	ἓν…ἐστιν καὶ τὸ αὐτὸ τῇ ἐξυρημένῃ	1	as if her head were shaved	Here, **one and the same thing** is a way to say that two things are similar or identical. If your readers would misunderstand this phrase, you could use a comparable idiom or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “it is the same thing as having been shaved” or “this is just like having been shaved” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1CO	11	5	fd7y	figs-ellipsis	τῇ ἐξυρημένῃ	1	as if her head were shaved	Here, **having been shaved** refers to the **head**. If you need to clarify what is being **shaved**, you could include **head**.

1CO	11	5	ltq4	figs-explicit	τῇ ἐξυρημένῃ	1	as if her head were shaved	In Paul’s culture, a woman with a **shaved** head would experience shame and dishonor, and Paul assumes this for the same of his argument. If that is not true in your culture, you might need to clarify that a **shaved** head was shameful for a woman. Alternate translation: “as having been shamefully shaved” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	11	5	e1pz	figs-activepassive	τῇ ἐξυρημένῃ	1	as if her head were shaved	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Paul implies that “someone” did it. Alternate translation: “as someone shaving her head” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1CO	11	6	wamj	grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical	εἰ	1	If it is disgraceful for a woman	Here Paul uses **if** to introduce a true possibility. He means that **a woman** might **cover her head**, or she might not. He specifies the result for if the **woman does not cover her head**. If your readers would misunderstand this form, you could express the **if** statement by introducing it with a word such as “whenever.” Alternate translation: “whenever” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical]])
1CO	11	6	lac8	figs-explicit	οὐ κατακαλύπτεται…κατακαλυπτέσθω	1	If it is disgraceful for a woman	Just as in [11:5](../11/05.md), **not** “covering” the **head** could refer to: (1) not wearing a piece of clothing on the hair and back of the head.

Alternate translation: “loosens her hair … let her bind up her hair” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	11	6	ahln	figs-imperative	καὶ κειράσθω	1	If it is disgraceful for a woman	Here, Paul uses a third person imperative. If you have third person imperatives in your language, you could use one here. If you do not have third person imperatives, you could express the idea using a word such as “should” or “needs to.” Alternate translation: “her hair also needs to be cut off” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
1CO	11	6	i9ou	figs-activepassive	καὶ κειράσθω	1	If it is disgraceful for a woman	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

1CO	11	6	s4r5	grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἰ	2	If it is disgraceful for a woman	Paul is speaking as if this were a hypothetical possibility, but he means that it is actually true. If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, and if your readers might misunderstand and think that what Paul is saying is not certain, then you can translate his words as an affirmative statement. Alternate translation: “because {it is}” or “since {it is}” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
1CO	11	6	lqlu	figs-doublet	τὸ κείρασθαι ἢ ξυρᾶσθαι	1	If it is disgraceful for a woman	Here, **to have her hair cut off** refers to how **hair** is trimmed or cut much shorter. The phrase **to be shaved** refers to how **hair** can be cut so short that it is no longer visible. If your language has separate words for these two actions, you can use them here. If your language has only one word for cutting **hair** short, you could use just one word here. Alternate translation: “to have her hair cut short” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
1CO	11	6	pflq	figs-activepassive	τὸ κείρασθαι ἢ ξυρᾶσθαι	1	If it is disgraceful for a woman	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

1CO	11	6	od1s	figs-imperative	κατακαλυπτέσθω	1	If it is disgraceful for a woman	Here, Paul uses a third person imperative. If you have third person imperatives in your language, you could use one here.

1CO	11	7	endt	grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1	should not have his head covered	Here, **For** introduces further reasons why what Paul has argued about “covering heads” is true. If your readers would misunderstand **For**, you could leave it untranslated or use a word or phrase that introduces further reasons. Alternate translation: “Here are more reasons:” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
1CO	11	7	cycr		οὐκ ὀφείλει	1	should not have his head covered	This could indicate that the **man**: (1) should not **cover his head**. Alternate translation: “must not” (2) is not required to **cover his head**, but he can do what he wants to do. Alternate translation: “is under no obligation”
1CO	11	7	aa4r	figs-explicit	κατακαλύπτεσθαι τὴν κεφαλήν	1	should not have his head covered	Here, **to cover his head** refers to using a piece of clothing that would be worn on the top and back of the head. The phrase does not refer to hair or to some piece of clothing that obscures the face. Paul does not clarify, however, what kind of clothing this might be. If possible, use a general phrase that could refer to clothing. Alternate translation: “have a covering on his head” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	11	7	hvot	grammar-connect-logic-result	ὑπάρχων	1	should not have his head covered	Here, **being** introduces a clause that gives a reason or basis for what he has already said. If your readers would misunderstand this connection, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a reason or basis. Alternate translation: “since he is” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
1CO	11	7	rc0x	figs-abstractnouns	εἰκὼν καὶ δόξα Θεοῦ	1	should not have his head covered	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **image** and **glory**, you could express the idea by using verbs such as “reflect” and “glorify.” Alternate translation: “one who reflects and glorifies God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1CO	11	7	mdob	figs-explicit	ἡ γυνὴ…δόξα ἀνδρός ἐστιν	1	should not have his head covered	Here, **woman** and **man** could refer to: (1) a **woman** and **man** who are married to each other. Alternate translation: “the wife is the glory of the husband” (2) any people who are male and female. Alternate translation: “the female person is the glory of the male person” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	11	7	ziew	figs-genericnoun	ἡ γυνὴ…δόξα ἀνδρός ἐστιν	1	should not have his head covered	Paul is speaking of “women” and “men” in general, not of one particular **woman** and **man**.

1CO	11	7	t5jn	figs-abstractnouns	δόξα ἀνδρός	1	glory of the man	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **glory**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “glorify.” Alternate translation: “the one who glorifies man” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1CO	11	8	w8jm	grammar-connect-logic-result	γάρ	1	For neither … for man	Here, **For** introduces a basis for what Paul has claimed in [11:7](../11/07.md), most specifically for the claim that “woman is the glory of man.” In [11:10](../11/10.md), Paul gives the result of what he has claimed in [11:7](../11/07.md). Because of this, in some languages [11:7–8](../11/07.md) might seem like they interrupt the logic or argument. If that is true in your language, you could mark [11:7–8](../11/07.md) as an interruption by using parentheses or some other natural form in your language. Alternate translation: “As a side note,” or “By the way,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
1CO	11	8	s5ns	figs-explicit	οὐ…ἐστιν ἀνὴρ ἐκ γυναικός, ἀλλὰ γυνὴ ἐξ ἀνδρός.	1	For man was not made from woman. Instead, woman was made from man	Here, Paul is speaking about a **man** and a **woman**. These words could refer to: (1) the first **man** and **woman** that God created: Adam and Eve. In the story in [Genesis 2:18–25](gen/02/18.md), God has already made Adam. He makes Adam sleep, takes a “rib” from his side, and uses it to create a woman, Eve. In this sense, **woman {is} from man**. Alternate translation: “the first man was not from the first woman, but the first woman was from the first man” (2) “men” and “women” in general. In this case, Paul would be referring to the role that men play in procreation. Alternate translation: “men do not come from women, but women come from men” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	11	9	g8lw	grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ γὰρ	1	For man was not made from woman. Instead, woman was made from man	Here, **For indeed** introduces a second basis for what Paul has claimed in [11:7](../11/07.md), most specifically for the claim that “woman is the glory of man.” In [11:10](../11/10.md). However, Paul gives the result of what he has claimed in [11:7](../11/07.md) in [11:10](../11/10.md). Because of this, in some languages [11:7–8](../11/07.md) might seem like they interrupt the logic or argument. If that is true in your language, you could mark [11:7–8](../11/07.md) as an interruption by using parentheses or some other natural form in your language. Alternate translation: “As another side note,” or “Also by the way,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
1CO	11	9	rrs5	figs-explicit	οὐκ ἐκτίσθη ἀνὴρ διὰ τὴν γυναῖκα, ἀλλὰ γυνὴ διὰ τὸν ἄνδρα	1	For man was not made from woman. Instead, woman was made from man	Again, Paul is speaking about a **man** and a **woman**. Just as in [11:8](../11/08.md), these words could refer to: (1) the first **man** and **woman** that God created: Adam and Eve. In the story in [Genesis 2:18–25](gen/02/18.md), God has already made Adam. God then has Adam name all the animals, but there was no “helper” for Adam. God then makes Eve as a “helper” for Adam. Alternate translation: “the first man was not created for the first woman, but the first woman was created for the first man” (2) “men” and “women” in general. In this case, Paul would be referring to the relationship between males and females or general or to the specific relationship between husbands and wives. Alternate translation: “men were not created for women, but women for men” or “husbands were not created for wives, but wives for husbands” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	11	9	tctb	figs-activepassive	οὐκ ἐκτίσθη ἀνὴρ	1	For man was not made from woman. Instead, woman was made from man	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Paul implies that “God” did it. Alternate translation: “God did not create man” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1CO	11	9	t4je	figs-ellipsis	γυνὴ διὰ τὸν ἄνδρα	1	For man was not made from woman. Instead, woman was made from man	Here Paul omits some words that your language may require to make a complete thought. Paul omits these words because he stated them explicitly in the previous clause (**was created**). If your language does need these words, you can supply them from that clause. Alternate translation: “woman was created for the man” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
1CO	11	10	q3kx	grammar-connect-logic-result	διὰ τοῦτο…ἡ γυνὴ…διὰ τοὺς ἀγγέλους	1	have a symbol of authority on her head	Here, **For this reason** could refer to: (1) both what Paul said in [11:7](../11/07.md) about how “the woman is the glory of man” and what he will say at the end of this verse about **the angels**. Alternate translation: “Because of how the woman is the glory of the man and because of the angels, the woman” (2) just what Paul has said in [11:7](../11/07.md) about how “the woman is the glory of man.” Alternate translation: “Because of what I have said, the woman … because of the angels” (3) just what Paul will say at the end of the verse about **the angels**. Alternate translation: “For this reason, that is, because of the angels, the woman” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
1CO	11	10	bikt	figs-explicit	ἡ γυνὴ	1	have a symbol of authority on her head	Here, **the woman** could refer to: (1) a female person. Alternate translation: “the female person” (2) a wife. Alternate translation: “the wife” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	11	10	jsu0	figs-genericnoun	ἡ γυνὴ	1	have a symbol of authority on her head	Paul is speaking of “women” in general, not of one particular **woman**. If your readers would misunderstand this form, you could use a form that refers to people in general. Alternate translation: “every woman” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])
1CO	11	10	olmx	translate-unknown	ἐξουσίαν ἔχειν ἐπὶ τῆς κεφαλῆς	1	have a symbol of authority on her head	The phrase **have authority on the head** could refer to: (1) the **authority** that the “man” has over **the woman**. In this view, **authority** implies the head covering or long hair, which **the woman** wears as a sign of the man’s **authority** over her. Alternate translation: “to have a sign of the man’s authority on her head” (2) how the **woman** has **authority** over her own **head**. In other words, she has **authority** to decide what to wear or not wear on her head, or **authority** could imply the head covering or long hair, which **the woman** wears as a sign of her **authority** over herself. Alternate translation: “to have authority over her own head” or “to have a sign of her authority on her head” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	11	10	hbs1	figs-abstractnouns	ἐξουσίαν ἔχειν ἐπὶ	1	have a symbol of authority on her head	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **authority**, you could express the idea in a different way. Make sure you use a word or phrase that fits with the interpretation you chose in the last note. Alternate translation: “to rule over” or “to have someone rule over” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1CO	11	10	o1mz	figs-possession	τῆς κεφαλῆς	1	have a symbol of authority on her head	Here, **the** with **head** implies that **the head** belongs to the **woman**. If your readers would misunderstand this implication, you could use a word that directly states possession. Alternate translation: “her head” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
1CO	11	10	vwq4	figs-explicit	διὰ τοὺς ἀγγέλους	1	have a symbol of authority on her head	Here, **because of the angels** clearly means that Paul considers **the angels** to be a reason for why **the woman ought to have authority on the head**, whichever meaning of that clause you decide on. However, what Paul means by the phrase **because of the angels** is not clear. Therefore, you also should leave your translation open so that your readers could draw any of the following conclusions. The phrase **because of the angels** could refer to: (1) how the angels oversee the order of the world and especially worship. The **woman** having **authority on the head** would satisfy what the angels require for worship practices. Alternate translation: “because of what the angels require” (2) how the angels can be sexually attracted to earthly women, so **the woman ought to have authority on the head** to keep the angels from acting or being tempted to act sexually with women. Alternate translation: “because otherwise the angels would be tempted” (3) how the angels are present in the worship of the community, and **the woman** must **have authority on the head** as a sign of respect to them. Alternate translation: “because angels are present when you worship” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	11	11	pir4	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	πλὴν	1	Nevertheless, in the Lord	Here, **Nevertheless** introduces a contrast or qualification of what Paul has been saying, especially with reference to [11:8–9](../11/08.md). Use a word or phrase in your language that introduces a contrast or qualification of previous arguments. Alternate translation: “Even so” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
1CO	11	11	h9t4	figs-metaphor	ἐν Κυρίῳ	1	in the Lord	Here Paul uses the spatial metaphor **in the Lord** to describe the union of believers with Christ. In this case, being **in the Lord**, or united to the Lord, identifies the situation in which men and women are **not independent** from each other. Alternate translation: “in their union with the Lord” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	11	11	hqy4	figs-doublenegatives	οὔτε…χωρὶς…οὔτε ἀνὴρ χωρὶς	1	the woman is not independent from the man, nor is the man independent from the woman	Here Paul uses two negative words, **not** and **independent from**, to indicate a positive meaning. If your language does not use two negative words like this, you could instead use one positive word. Alternate translation: “{is} dependent on … and man {is} dependent on” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
1CO	11	11	velr	figs-genericnoun	γυνὴ…ἀνδρὸς…ἀνὴρ…γυναικὸς	1	the woman is not independent from the man, nor is the man independent from the woman	Paul is speaking of “men” and “women” in general, not of one particular **man** and **woman**. If your readers would misunderstand this form, you could use a form that refers to people in general. Alternate translation: “every woman … men … every man … women” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])
1CO	11	12	aiid	figs-genericnoun	ἡ γυνὴ…τοῦ ἀνδρός…ὁ ἀνὴρ…τῆς γυναικός	1	all things come from God	Paul is speaking of “men” and “women” in general, not of one particular **man** and **woman**. If your readers would misunderstand this form, you could use a form that refers to people in general. Alternate translation: “every woman … men … every man … women” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])
1CO	11	12	fd3u	figs-explicit	ὥσπερ…ἡ γυνὴ ἐκ τοῦ ἀνδρός, οὕτως καὶ ὁ ἀνὴρ διὰ τῆς γυναικός	1	all things come from God	Here, **even as the woman {is} from the man** refers back to the story about how God made the first woman, Eve, from a rib he took from the first man, Adam. Paul has already referred to this story in [11:8](../11/08.md). Paul then compares this with how **the man {is} through the woman**. This clause refers to how women give birth to men. If your readers would misunderstand what these two clauses refer to, you could state it more explicitly. Alternate translation: “even as the first woman came from the first man, so also men are born from women” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	11	12	i8qu		τὰ…πάντα ἐκ τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	all things come from God	Alternate translation: “God created all things”

Paul does not ask this question because he is looking for information. Rather, he asks it to involve the Corinthians in what he is arguing. The question assumes that the answer is “no, it is not.” If your readers would misunderstand this question, you could express the idea with a strong negation. If you do, you may need to include a phrase such as “and you will find” after **Judge for your own selves**, which by itself introduces a question and not a statement. Alternate translation: “Judge for your own selves, and you will find that it is not proper for a woman to pray to God uncovered.” or “Judge for your own selves whether it is proper for a woman to pray to God uncovered.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
1CO	11	13	eex3	translate-unknown	πρέπον	1	Judge for yourselves	Here, **proper** identifies behavior that most people in a culture would agree is “appropriate” or “right” for a certain people or situations. Use a word or phrase that identifies what is “appropriate” or “right” for someone or at sometime. Alternate translation: “right for” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	11	13	ylgd	translate-unknown	ἀκατακάλυπτον	1	Judge for yourselves	Just as in [11:5](../11/05.md), **uncovered** could refer to: (1) not wearing a piece of clothing on the hair and back of the head. Alternate translation: “without a cloth on the head” (2) not putting the hair up in a traditional hairstyle but instead letting it flow freely. Alternate translation: “with her hair unbound” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

This is the first part of a rhetorical question that continues into the next verse. Paul does not ask this question because he is looking for information. Rather, he asks it to involve the Corinthians in what he is arguing. The question assumes that the answer is “yes, it does.” If your readers would misunderstand this question, you could express the idea with a strong affirmation. If you use the following alternate translation, you will need to translate the beginning of the next verse as a separate affirmation. Alternate translation: “Even nature itself teaches you that if a man might have long hair, it is a disgrace for him.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]]) (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
1CO	11	14	gyw9	figs-personification	οὐδὲ ἡ φύσις αὐτὴ διδάσκει ὑμᾶς	1	Does not even nature itself teach you … for him?	Here, **nature** is spoken of figuratively as though it were a person who could **teach** someone. Paul speaks in this way to emphasize what the Corinthians should learn from **nature**. If this might be confusing for your readers, you could express this meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “Does not even nature itself show you” or “Do you not understand from nature itself” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
1CO	11	14	wflv	translate-unknown	ἡ φύσις αὐτὴ	1	Does not even nature itself teach you … for him?	Here, **nature** refers to the way things work in the world. The word does not refer simply to the “natural world” but rather can include everything that exists and how it all functions. If your readers would misunderstand **nature**, you could use a word or phrase that refers to “the way things work.” Alternate translation: “how the world itself works” or “what naturally happens” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	11	14	rurk	grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical	ἀνὴρ μὲν ἐὰν κομᾷ, ἀτιμία αὐτῷ ἐστιν	1	Does not even nature itself teach you … for him?	Here Paul uses **if** to introduce a true possibility. He means that **a man might have long hair**, or he might not. He specifies the result for **if a man** does **have long hair**. If your readers would misunderstand this form, you could express the **if** statement by introducing it with a word such as “when” or by avoiding the **if** structure. Alternate translation: “when a man has long hair, it is a disgrace for him” or “it is a disgrace for a man to have long hair” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical]])
1CO	11	14	kr9k	translate-unknown	κομᾷ	1	Does not even nature itself teach you … for him?	Here Paul uses a word that refers to someone letting his or her hair grow long. It is not clear how long the hair must be to count as **long hair**. Use a word or phrase that refers to what your culture would consider **long hair**. Alternate translation: “grows his hair out” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	11	14	jgcu	figs-abstractnouns	ἀτιμία αὐτῷ ἐστιν	1	Does not even nature itself teach you … for him?	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **disgrace**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “disgrace” or an adjective such as “disgraceful.” Alternate translation: “it disgraces him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1CO	11	15	f66k	figs-rquestion	γυνὴ δὲ ἐὰν κομᾷ, δόξα αὐτῇ ἐστιν?	1	For her hair has been given to her	This is the second part of the rhetorical question that began in the last verse. Paul does not ask this question because he is looking for information. Rather, he asks it to involve the Corinthians in what he is arguing. The question assumes that the answer is “yes, nature does teach this.” If your readers would misunderstand this question, you could express the idea with a strong affirmation. If you use the following alternate translation, you should translate the previous verse as a separate affirmation. Alternate translation: “However, if a woman has long hair, it is glory for her.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]]) (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
1CO	11	15	qlhs	grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical	γυνὴ…ἐὰν κομᾷ, δόξα αὐτῇ ἐστιν?	1	For her hair has been given to her	Here Paul uses **if** to introduce a true possibility. He means that **a woman might have long hair**, or she might not. He specifies the result for **if a woman** does **have long hair**. If your readers would misunderstand this form, you could express the **if** statement by introducing it with a word such as “when” or by avoiding the **if** structure. Alternate translation: “when a woman has long hair, it is glory for her” or “it is glory for a woman to have long hair” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical]])
1CO	11	15	qbci	translate-unknown	κομᾷ	1	For her hair has been given to her	Just as in [11:14](../11/14.md), here Paul uses a word that refers to someone letting his or her hair grow long. It is not clear how long the hair must be to count as **long hair**. Use a word or phrase that refers to what your culture would consider **long hair**. Alternate translation: “grows her hair out” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	11	15	vpou	figs-abstractnouns	δόξα αὐτῇ ἐστιν	1	For her hair has been given to her	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **glory**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “glorify” or an adjective such as “glorious.” Alternate translation: “it glorifies her” or “it is glorious for her” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1CO	11	15	s7ys	figs-activepassive	ὅτι ἡ κόμη…δέδοται αὐτῇ	1	For her hair has been given to her	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Paul implies that “God” did it. Alternate translation: “God has given her the long hair” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1CO	11	15	jaxe	translate-unknown	ἡ κόμη	1	For her hair has been given to her	Here Paul uses a word that refers to **the long hair** itself. It is not clear how long the hair must be to count as **long hair**. Use a word or phrase that refers to what your culture would consider **long hair**. Alternate translation: “grown-out hair” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1CO	11	15	dwbm		ἀντὶ περιβολαίου	1	For her hair has been given to her	This could refer to: (1) how **the long hair** is equivalent to or functions as **a covering**. Alternate translation: “to be a covering” (2) how **the long hair** functions “instead of” or as a replacement of **a covering**. Alternate translation: “instead of a covering”
1CO	11	16	ou4r	grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical	εἰ	1	For her hair has been given to her	Here Paul uses **if** to introduce a true possibility. He means that someone might be **contentious about this**, or someone might not. He specifies the result for **if anyone** is **contentious**. If your readers would misunderstand this form, you could express the **if** statement by introducing it with a word such as “whenever.” Alternate translation: “whenever” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical]])
1CO	11	16	qi6p		δοκεῖ φιλόνικος εἶναι	1	For her hair has been given to her	Alternate translation: “decides to pick a fight about this” or “considers starting a conflict about this”
1CO	11	16	q5jl	figs-exclusive	ἡμεῖς	1	For her hair has been given to her	Here, **we** refers to Paul and others who proclaim the Gospel with him. It does not include the Corinthians. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
1CO	11	16	dr9j	figs-explicit	τοιαύτην συνήθειαν	1	For her hair has been given to her	Here, **any such practice** could refer to: (1) the **practice** that anyone who **thinks to be contentious** supports. Therefore, this **practice** would be for women to have “uncovered” heads. Alternate translation: “the practice that they have” or “the practice of women with uncovered heads” (2) being **contentious**. Alternate translation: “any such practice of being contentious” or “the practice of being contentious” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1CO	11	16	cjpt	figs-ellipsis	οὐδὲ αἱ ἐκκλησίαι τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	For her hair has been given to her	Here Paul omits some words that your language may require to make a complete thought. Paul omits these words because he stated them explicitly in the previous clause (**do not have any such practice**). If your language does need these words, you can supply as many as are needed from that clause. Alternate translation: “nor do the churches of God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
1CO	11	17	id4f			0	Connecting Statement:	As Paul talks about communion, the Lord’s supper, he reminds them to have right attitudes as well as unity. He reminds them that if they fail in those things when taking communion, they will become sick and die, as has already happened to some of them.
1CO	11	17	vt5a		τοῦτο δὲ παραγγέλλων	1	in the following instructions, I do not praise you. For	“But as I give you these instructions”

Alternate translation: “For there will probably be factions among you” (2) Paul was using irony to shame them for having factions. Alternate translation: “For you seem to think that there must be factions among you” or “For you seem to think that you must divide yourselves” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])
1CO	11	19	kcr7		αἱρέσεις	1	factions	opposing groups of people

1CO	11	22	nz88	figs-rquestion	τί εἴπω ὑμῖν? ἐπαινέσω ὑμᾶς ἐν τούτῳ?	1	What should I say to you? Should I praise you?	Paul is rebuking the Corinthians. Alternate translation: “I can say nothing good about this. I cannot praise you.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

1CO	11	25	gr2k		τὸ ποτήριον	1	the cup	It is best to translate this literally. The Corinthians knew which cup he took, so it is not simply “a cup” or “some cup” or “any cup.” This could refer to: (1) the cup of wine that one would expect him to use. (2) the third or fourth of the four cups of wine that the Jews drank at the Passover meal.
1CO	11	25	z54e		τοῦτο ποιεῖτε, ὁσάκις ἐὰν πίνητε	1	Do this as often as you drink it	“Drink from this cup, and as often as you drink from it”

1CO	11	29	gqd2		μὴ διακρίνων τὸ σῶμα	1	without discerning the body	This could mean: (1) that person does not recognize that the church is the body of the Lord. (2) that person does not consider that he is handling the Lord’s body.

1CO	11	30	vx5t	figs-euphemism	κοιμῶνται ἱκανοί	1	and many of you have fallen asleep	Here, **fallen asleep** is a euphemism for death. Alternate translation: “and some of you have died” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]]).
1CO	11	30	bh6j	figs-explicit	ἱκανοί	1	many of you	If this would sound like Paul is talking to those who have died, you may need to make explicit that he is not. Alternate translation: “many of the members of your group” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

1CO	12	intro	abcf			0		# 1 Corinthians 12 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>### Gifts of the Holy Spirit<br><br>This chapter begins a new section. Chapters 12-14 discuss spiritual gifts within the church.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### The Church, the body of Christ<br><br>This is an important metaphor in Scripture. The Church has many different parts. Each part has different functions. They combine to make one church. All of the different parts are necessary. Each part is to be concerned for all the other parts, even those that seem less important. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### “No one can say, ‘Jesus is Lord,’ except by the Holy Spirit.”<br><br>In reading the Old Testament, the Jews would have substituted the word “Lord” for the word “Yahweh.” This sentence probably means that no one can say that Jesus is Yahweh, God in the flesh, without the Holy Spirit’s influence drawing them to accept this truth. If this statement is translated poorly, it can have unintended theological consequences.
1CO	12	1	da2e			0	Connecting Statement:	Paul lets them know that God has given special gifts to believers. These gifts are to help the body of believers.
