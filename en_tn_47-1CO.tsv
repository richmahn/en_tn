Divisions in the church (1:10-4:21)<br>1. Moral sins and irregularities (5:1-13)<br>1. Christians taking other Christians to court (6:1-20)<br>1. Marriage and related matters (7:1-40)<br>1. Misuse of Christian liberty; food sacrificed to idols, fleeing idolatry; women's head coverings (8:1-13; 10:1-11:16)<br>1. Paul's rights as an apostle (9:1-27)<br>1. The Lord's Supper (11:17-34)<br>1. The gifts of the Holy Spirit (12:1-31)<br>1. Love (13:1-13)<br>1. The gifts of the Holy Spirit: prophecy and languages (14:1-40)<br>1. The resurrection of believers and the resurrection of Christ (15:1-58)<br>1. Closing: the contribution for Christians in Jerusalem, requests, and personal greetings (16:1-24)<br><br>#### Who wrote the Book of 1 Corinthians?<br><br>Paul wrote 1 Corinthians. Paul was from the city of Tarsus. He had been known as Saul in his early life. Before becoming a Christian, Paul was a Pharisee. He persecuted Christians. After he became a Christian, he traveled several times throughout the Roman Empire telling people about Jesus.<br><br>Paul started the church that met in Corinth. He was staying in the city of Ephesus when he wrote this letter.<br><br>#### What is the Book of 1 Corinthians about?<br><br>1 Corinthians is a letter that Paul wrote to the believers who were in the city of Corinth. Paul had heard that there were problems among the believers there. They were arguing with each other. Some of them did not understand some of the Christian teachings. And some of them were behaving badly. In this letter, Paul responded to them and encouraged them to live in a way that pleased God.<br><br>#### How should the title of this book be translated?<br><br>Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, "First Corinthians." Or they may choose a clearer title, such as "Paul's First Letter to the Church in Corinth." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])<br><br>## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts<br><br>#### What was the city of Corinth like?<br><br>Corinth was a major city located in ancient Greece. Because it was near the Mediterranean Sea, many travelers and traders came to buy and sell goods there. This resulted in the city having people from many different cultures. The city was famous for having people who lived in immoral ways. The people worshipped Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love. As part of the ceremonies honoring Aphrodite, her worshipers had sexual intercourse with temple prostitutes.<br><br>#### What was the problem with meat sacrificed to idols?<br><br>Many animals were slaughtered and sacrificed to the false gods in Corinth. Priests and worshipers kept some of the meat. Much of the meat was sold in markets. Many Christians disagreed with each other over whether it was right for them to eat this meat, because it had been dedicated to a false god. Paul writes about this problem in 1 Corinthians.<br><br>## Part 3: Important Translation Issues<br><br>#### How are the ideas of "holy" and "sanctify" represented in 1 Corinthians in the ULT?<br><br>The scriptures use such words to indicate any one of various ideas. For this reason, it is often difficult for translators to represent them well in their versions. In translating into English, 1 Corinthians ULT uses the following principles:<br><br>* Sometimes the meaning in a passage implies moral holiness. Especially important for understanding the gospel is the fact that God considers Christians to be sinless because they are united to Jesus Christ. Another related fact is that God is perfect and faultless. A third fact is that Christians are to conduct themselves in a blameless, faultless manner in life. In these cases, the ULT uses "holy," "holy God," "holy ones," or "holy people." (See: 1:2; 3:17)<br>* Sometimes the meaning in a passage indicates a simple reference to Christians without implying any particular role filled by them. In these cases, the ULT uses "believer" or "believers." (See: 6:1, 2; 14:33; 16:1, 15)<br>* Sometimes the meaning in the passage implies the idea of someone or something set apart for God alone. In these cases, the ULT uses "set apart," "dedicated to," "reserved for," or "sanctified." (See: 1:2; 6:11; 7:14, 34)<br><br>The UST will often be helpful as translators think about how to represent these ideas in their own versions.<br><br>#### What is the meaning of "flesh?"<br><br>Paul frequently used the terms "flesh" or "fleshly" to refer to Christians who did sinful things. However, it is not the physical world that is evil. Paul also described Christians who lived in a righteous way as "spiritual." This is because they did what the Holy Spirit taught them to do. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/flesh]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/spirit]])<br><br>#### What did Paul mean by the expression "in Christ," "in the Lord," etc.?<br><br>This kind of expression occurs in 1:2, 30, 31; 3:1; 4:10, 15, 17; 6:11, 19; 7:22; 9:1, 2; 11:11, 25; 12:3, 9, 13, 18, 25; 14:16; 15:18, 19, 22, 31, 58; 16:19, 24. Paul meant to express the idea of a very close union with Christ and the believers. At the same time, he often intended other meanings as well. See, for example, "those who have been dedicated in Christ Jesus" (1:2), where Paul specifically meant that Christian believers have been dedicated to Christ.<br><br>Please see the introduction to the Book of Romans for more details about this kind of expression.<br><br>#### What are the major issues in the text of the Book of 1 Corinthians?<br><br>For the following verses, modern versions of the Bible differ from older versions. Translators are advised to follow the modern versions of the Bible. However, if in the translators' region there are Bibles that read according to older versions of the Bible, the translators can follow those. If so, these verses should be put inside square brackets ([]) to indicate that they were probably not original to 1 Corinthians.<br><br>* "Therefore glorify God with your body." Some older versions read "Therefore glorify God with your body and in your spirit, which are God's." (6:20)<br>* "I did this even though I myself was not under the law" (9:20). Some older versions leave this passage out.<br>* "for the sake of conscience--the conscience of the other man." Some older versions read "for the sake of conscience: for the earth and everything in it belong to the Lord: the conscience of the other man." (10:28)<br>* "and that I give my body to be burned" (13:3). Some older versions read, "and that I give my body so that I might boast."<br>* "But if anyone does not recognize this, let him not be recognized" (14:38). Some older versions read, "But if anyone is ignorant of this, let him be ignorant."<br><br><br>(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])<br>
1CO	01	intro	ud5y	1 Corinthians 01 General Notes		0		# 1 Corinthians 01 General Notes<br>#### Structure and formatting<br><br>The first three verses are a greeting. In the ancient Near East, this was a common way of starting a letter.<br><br>Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the words of verse 19, which are from the Old Testament.<br><br>#### Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>##### Disunity<br>In this chapter, Paul scolds the church for being divided and for following different apostles. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/apostle]])<br><br>##### Spiritual gifts<br>Spiritual gifts are specific supernatural abilities to help the church. The Holy Spirit gives these gifts to Christians after they come to believe in Jesus. Paul lists spiritual gifts in Chapter 12. Some scholars believe the Holy Spirit gave some of these gifts only in the early church to help establish the developing church. Other scholars believe all the gifts of the Spirit are still available to help all Christians throughout the church history. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]])<br><br>#### Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>##### Idioms<br><br>In this chapter, Paul refers to the return of Christ using two different phrases: "the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ" and "the day of our Lord Jesus Christ." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])<br><br>##### Rhetorical questions<br>Paul uses rhetorical questions to scold the Corinthians for dividing into factions and for relying on human wisdom. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])<br><br>#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>##### Stumbling block<br>A stumbling block is a rock people stumble over. Here it means the Jews find it hard to believe that God allowed his Messiah to be crucified. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])<br>

This chapter deals with sexual immorality of one church member. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/fornication]])<br><br>##### Metaphor<br>Paul uses an extended comparison using many metaphors. Yeast represents evil. The loaf probably represents the whole congregation. The unleavened bread represents living purely. So the whole passage means: Don't you know that a little evil will affect the whole congregation? So get rid of the evil so you can live purely. Christ has been sacrificed for us. So let us be sincere and truthful and not wicked and behaving badly. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/evil]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/unleavenedbread]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/purify]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/passover]])<br><br>##### Rhetorical questions<br>Paul uses rhetorical questions in this chapter.

Therefore nothing is wrong with the meat. Christians are free to eat it. However, someone who does not understand this may see a Christian eating it. They may then be encouraged to eat the meat as an act of worship to the idol.<br>
1CO	08	01	jf6h	figs-inclusive		0	General Information:	"We" means Paul and, though specifically writing to the Corinthian believers, includes all believers. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-inclusive]])
1CO	08	01	nzt4	Connecting Statement:		0		Paul reminds the believers that though idols have no power, believers must be careful not to affect the weaker believers who might think they care about the idols. He tells believers to be careful with the liberty believers have in Christ.

1CO	08	07	th5p			0	General Information:	Paul is speaking here of "weak" brothers, people who cannot separate food sacrificed to idols from the worship of those idols. If a Christian eats food that has been sacrificed to an idol, weak brothers might think that God will allow them to worship the idol by eating the food. Even if the eater has not worshiped the idol and is simply eating the food, he has still corrupted his weak brothers' conscience.

Some people claimed that he was trying to gain financially from the church.<br><br>#### Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>##### Earning money from the church<br>People accused Paul of just wanting money from the church. Paul answered that he rightfully could get money from the church. The Old Testament taught that those who worked should get their living from their work. He and Barnabas purposefully never used this right and earned their own living.<br><br>#### Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>##### Metaphor<br>Paul uses many metaphors in this chapter. These metaphors teach complex truths. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])<br><br>#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>##### Contextualization<br>This passage is important because Paul "contextualizes" ministering the gospel to different audiences. This means that Paul makes himself and the gospel understandable without his actions hindering the gospel being received. The translator should take extra care to preserve aspects of this "contextualization" if possible. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/goodnews]])<br><br>##### Rhetorical questions<br>Paul uses many rhetorical questions in this chapter.

1CO	10	intro	v6gr	1 Corinthians 10 General Notes		0		# 1 Corinthians 10 General Notes<br>#### Structure and formatting<br><br>Chapters 8-10 together answer the question: "Is it acceptable to eat meat that has been sacrificed to an idol?"<br><br>In this chapter, Paul uses the exodus to warn people not to sin. Then, he returns to discussing meat offered to idols. He uses the Lord's Supper as an example. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])<br><br>#### Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>##### Exodus<br>Paul uses the experiences of Israel leaving Egypt and roaming the desert as a warning to the believers. Although the Israelites all followed Moses, they all died on the way. None of them reached the Promised Land. Some worshiped an idol, some tested God, and some grumbled. Paul warns Christians not to sin. We can resist temptation because God provides a way of escape. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/promisedland]])<br><br>##### Eating meat sacrificed to idol<br>Paul discusses meat offered to idols. Christians are allowed to eat, but it may hurt others. So when buying meat or eating with a friend, do not ask if it has been offered to idols. But if someone tells you it has been offered to idols, don't eat it for the sake of that person. Do not offend anyone. Seek to save them instead. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/save]])<br><br>##### Rhetorical questions<br>Paul uses many rhetorical questions in this chapter. He uses them to emphasize important points as he teaches the Corinthians. (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion)<br>

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
1CO	10	28	qi77	figs-you		0	says to you ... do not eat ... informed you	Paul is speaking to the Corinthians as if they were one person, so the word "you" and the command "do not eat" here are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

Paul now talks about proper church services. In this chapter, he deals with two different problems: women in the church services (verses 1-16) and the Lord's Supper (verses 17-34).<br><br>#### Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>##### Proper conduct in a church service<br><br>##### Disorderly women<br>Paul's instructions here are debated among scholars. There may have been women who were abusing their Christian freedom and causing disorder in the church by going against established cultural customs. The disorder that their actions created would have caused him to be concerned.<br><br>##### The Lord's Supper<br>There were problems in how the Corinthians were handling the Lord's Supper. They did not act in a unified manner. During the feast celebrated along with the Lord's Supper, some of them ate their own food without sharing. Some of them got drunk while the poor people remained hungry. Paul taught that the believers dishonored Christ's death if they participated in the Lord's Supper while they were sinning or while they were in broken relationships with each other. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/reconcile]])<br><br>#### Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>##### Rhetorical questions<br><br>Paul uses rhetorical questions to scold the people for their unwillingness to follow the rules for worship he has suggested. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])<br><br>##### The head<br><br>Paul uses "head" as a metonym for authority in verse 3 and also to refer to a person's actual head in verse 4 and following. Since they are so close together, it is likely that Paul intentionally used "head" in this way. This would show that the ideas in these verses were connected. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])<br>

1CO	11	17	vt5a			0	in the following instructions, I do not praise you. For when	Another possible meaning is "as I give you these instructions, there is something for which I cannot praise you: when"

Chapters 12-14 discuss spiritual gifts within the church.<br><br>#### Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>##### The Church, the body of Christ<br><br>This is an important metaphor in Scripture. The Church has many different parts. Each part has different functions. They combine to make one church. All of the different parts are necessary. Each part is to be concerned for all the other parts, even those that seem less important. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])<br><br>#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>##### "No one can say, 'Jesus is Lord,' except by the Holy Spirit."<br>In reading the Old Testament, the Jews would have substituted the word "Lord" for the word "Yahweh." This sentence probably means that no one can say that Jesus is Yahweh, God in the flesh, without the Holy Spirit's influence drawing them to accept this truth. If this statement is translated poorly, it can have unintended theological consequences.<br>

Christ is the first of many who God will raise to life. The resurrection is central to the gospel. Few doctrines are as important as this one.

1CO	15	12	ub2p	figs-rquestion		0	how can some of you say there is no resurrection of the dead?	Paul is using this question to begin a new topic. Alternate translation: "you should not be saying that there is no resurrection of the dead!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

1CO	15	23	p4g9	figs-metaphor		0	who is the firstfruits	Here "firstfruits" is a metaphor, comparing Christ to the first of the harvest, which would be followed by the rest of the harvest.

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
1CO	15	29	jdc9	figs-activepassive		0	the dead are not raised	This can be translated in active form. Alternate translation: "God does not raise the dead" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

The reason he and others were in danger is that some people were angry that they taught that Jesus will raise people from death. Alternate translation: "If people will not rise from the dead, we gain nothing by being in danger every hour for teaching that people will rise." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

1CO	15	32	lm3v	figs-metaphor		0	I fought with beasts at Ephesus	Paul is referring to something that he actually did.

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1CO	15	32	c36a			0	Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die	Paul concludes that if there is no further life after death, it is better for us to enjoy this life as we can, for tomorrow our life will end without any further hope.
