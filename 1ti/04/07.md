# worldly stories loved by old women

"profane stories and old wives' tales." The word for "stories" is the same as for "myths" in [1 Timothy 1:4](../01/04.md), so you should translate it the same here.

# loved by old women

This is probably an expression that means "silly" or "absurd." Paul is not purposely insulting women in his reference to "old women." Instead, he and his audience knew that men die younger than women, so there are more women than men whose minds have become feeble due to old age. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# train yourself in godliness

"train yourself to honor God" or "train yourself to act in ways that please God"
