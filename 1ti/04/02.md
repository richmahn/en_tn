Possible meanings are 1) Paul is speaking of people who can no longer tell that they are doing wrong as if their minds are ruined like skin that someone has burned with a hot iron or 2) Paul is speaking of these people as if Satan had put a mark on these people with a hot iron to indicate that they belong to him.
