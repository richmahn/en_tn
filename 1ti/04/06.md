## translationNotes

* **place these things before** - "put these thoughts in the believers' minds" or "help the believers remember these words." The "thoughts" and "words" refer to all the teachings from [[:en:bible:notes:1ti:03:16]] to [[:en:bible:notes:1ti:04:03]].
* **nourished** - "trained" (UDB). God was making Timothy stronger and teaching Timothy to do what pleases God.
* **words of faith** - "words that cause people to believe"
* **profane stories loved by old women** - "profane and old-womanish myths." The word for <b>stories</b>  is the same as for "myths" in [[:en:bible:notes:1ti:01:03]], so you should translate it the same here. The reference to <b>old women</b>  is probably a metaphor for "silly" or "absurd." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]].) Paul is not purposely insulting women in his reference to “old women.” Instead, he and his audience knew that men die younger than women, so there are more women than men whose minds have become feeble due to old age.
* **train yourself in godliness** - "train yourself to be more godly" or "train yourself to act in ways that please God" or "work hard to become more godly"
* **body training** - "physical exercise"
* **holds promise for this life** - "is beneficial to this life" or "helps to make this life better"
