# If you place these things before the brothers

Paul speaks of his instructions as if they were objects that could be physically presented to the believers. Here, to place before means to instruct or to remind. AT: "If you help the believers remember these things" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# these things

This refers to the teaching that started in [1 Timothy 3:16](../03/16.md).

# the brothers

This refers to all believers whether male or female. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])

# you are being nourished by the words of faith and by the good teaching that you have followed

Paul speaks of God's word and its teaching as if it could physically feed Timothy and make him strong. This can be stated in active form. AT: "the words of faith and the good teaching that you have followed are causing you to trust more strongly in Christ" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# words of faith

"words that cause people to believe"

# worldly stories loved by old women

"profane stories and old wives' tales." The word for "stories" is the same as for "myths" in [1 Timothy 1:4](../01/03.md), so you should translate it the same here.

# loved by old women

This is probably an expression that means "silly" or "absurd." Paul is not purposely insulting women in his reference to "old women." Instead, he and his audience knew that men die younger than women, so there are more women than men whose minds have become feeble due to old age. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# train yourself in godliness

"train yourself to honor God" or "train yourself to act in ways that please God"

# bodily training

"physical exercise"

# holds promise for this life

"is beneficial to this life"
