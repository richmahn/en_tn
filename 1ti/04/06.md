# If you place these things before the brothers

Paul speaks of his instructions as if they were objects that could be physically presented to the believers. Here, to place before means to instruct or to remind. AT: "If you help the believers remember these things" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# these things

This refers to the teaching that started in [1 Timothy 3:16](../03/16.md).

# the brothers

This refers to all believers whether male or female. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])

# you are being nourished by the words of faith and by the good teaching that you have followed

Paul speaks of God's word and its teaching as if it could physically feed Timothy and make him strong. This can be stated in active form. AT: "the words of faith and the good teaching that you have followed are causing you to trust more strongly in Christ" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# words of faith

"words that cause people to believe"
