# worthy of full acceptance

"worthy of your complete belief" or "worthy of your full trust"

# For it is for this

"This is the reason"

# struggle and work very hard

The words "struggle" and "work very hard" mean basically the same thing. Paul uses them together to emphasize the intensity with which they serve God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# we have confidence in the living God

Here "living God" probably means, "God, who makes all things live."

# but especially of believers

The understood information can be stated clearly. AT: "but he is especially the Savior of those people who believe" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
