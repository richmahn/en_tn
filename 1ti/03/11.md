## Women in the same way  ##

"Wives, likewise have requirements" or "deaconesses, there are requirements like deacons." The general term <b>women</b>  may apply to women in general, but it seems to apply to deacons' wives or female deacons here because the preceding and following verses clearly speak about deacons.

"act properly"

## not slanderers  ##

"they must not speak evil about other people"

## moderate  ##

"they must not do anything to excess"

## husbands of one wife  ##

A man must have only one wife. It is unclear if this excludes men who have been previously widowed or divorced, or never married.

## For those  ##

"For those deacons" or "For those bishops, deacons, and deaconesses" or "For these church leaders"
