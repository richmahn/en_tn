# husbands of one wife

A man must have only one wife. It is unclear if this excludes men who have been previously widowed, divorced, or never married. See how you translated this in [1 Timothy 3:2](./01.md).

# manage well their children and household

"properly take care of and lead their children and others who live in their homes"
