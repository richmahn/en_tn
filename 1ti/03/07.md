# those outside

"those outside of the church." Paul speaks of the church as though it were a place, and of unbelievers as though they were physically outside of it. Alternate translation: "those who are not Christians" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# he does not fall into disgrace and the trap of the devil

Paul speaks of disgrace and the devil causing someone to sin as if they were a hole or a trap into which a person falls. Here "fall into" means to experience. Alternate translation: "nothing causes him shame before the unbelievers and so that the devil does not cause him to sin" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
