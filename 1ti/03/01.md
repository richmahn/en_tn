# Connecting Statement:

Paul gives some special instructions on how the overseers of the church should act and be.

# a good work

"an honorable task"

# husband of one wife

An overseer must have only one wife. It is unclear if this excludes men who have been previously widowed or divorced, or never married.

# He must be moderate, sensible, orderly, and hospitable

"He must not do anything to excess, must be reasonable and behave well, and must be friendly to strangers"

# He must not be addicted to wine, not a brawler, but instead, gentle, peaceful

"He must neither drink too much alcohol nor like to fight and argue, but instead he must be gentle and peaceful"

# a lover of money

"greedy for money"
