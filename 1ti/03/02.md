# husband of one wife

An overseer must have only one wife. It is unclear if this excludes men who have been previously widowed or divorced, or never married.

# He must be moderate, sensible, orderly, and hospitable

"He must not do anything to excess, must be reasonable and behave well, and must be friendly to strangers"
