# He should not be a new convert

"He should not be a new believer" or "He must be a mature believer"

# fall into condemnation as the devil

Paul speaks of the experience of being condemned for having done wrong as if it were a hole that a person could fall into. Alternate translation: "have God condemn him as he condemned the devil" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
