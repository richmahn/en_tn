# Connecting Statement:

Paul gives some special instructions on how the deacons of the church and their wives should act and be.

# Deacons, likewise

"Deacons, like overseers"

# should be dignified, not double-talkers

Paul speaks about these people as if they were "double-talkers" or could say two things at once. He means the person says one thing but mean something else. Alternate translation: "should act properly and mean what they say" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
