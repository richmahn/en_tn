# We all agree

"No one can deny"

# that the mystery of godliness is great

"that the truth that God has revealed is great"

# He appeared ... up in glory

This is most likely a song or poem that Paul is quoting. If your language has a way of indicating that this is poetry you could use it here. If not, you could translate this as regular prose rather than poetry. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry]])

# He appeared

Here "He" is ambiguous. It could refers to "God" or to "Christ." It may be best to translate this as "He." If you must be more specific you could translate it as "Christ who is God" or "Christ."

# in the flesh

Paul uses "flesh" here to mean a human being. Alternate translation: "as a true human being" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# was vindicated by the Spirit

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "the Holy Spirit confirmed that he was who he said he was" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# was seen by angels

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "the angels saw him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# was proclaimed among nations

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "people in many nations told others about him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# was believed on in the world

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "people in many parts of the world believed in him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# was taken up in glory

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "God the Father took him up to heaven in glory" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# in glory

This means he received power from God the Father and he is worthy of honor.
