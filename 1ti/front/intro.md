Paul from the city of Tarsus was the author. He had been known as Saul in his early life. Before becoming a Christian, Paul was a Pharisee. He persecuted Christians. After he began to trust in Jesus Christ, he traveled several times throughout the Roman Empire telling people about Jesus.

This book is the first letter Paul wrote to his disciple and close friend Timothy. Paul wrote it probably near the end of his life.

## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts ##

#### What is discipleship? ####

Discipleship is the process of making disciples of Christ. The goal of discipleship is to encourage other Christians to grow in likeness to Christ. This letter gives many instructions about how a leader should train a less mature Christian. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/disciple]])

## Part 3: Important Translation Issues ##

##### Singular and plural "you" #####
In this book, the word "I" refers to Paul. Also, the word "you" is almost always singular and refers to Timothy. The exception to this is 6:21. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

#### What did Paul mean by the expression "in Christ," "in the Lord," etc.? ####

Paul meant to express the idea of a very close union with Christ and the believers. Please see the introduction to the Book of Romans for more details about this kind of expression.

#### What are the major textual issues in the text of the Book of 1 Timothy? ####

The following are the most significant textual issues in the Book of 1 Timothy:
