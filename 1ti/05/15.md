# turned aside after Satan

Paul speaks of living in faithfulness to Christ as if it were a path to be followed. This means the woman stopped obeying Jesus and started obeying Satan. AT: "left the path of Christ to follow Satan" or "decided to obey Satan instead of Christ" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
