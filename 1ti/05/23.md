(It is not clear how verse 23 fits with verse 22 and verses 24-25. It may simply be something unrelated that Paul wanted to say before he forgot it. If it is related, it would likely be a way of saying that by "pure" in the previous verse Paul was talking about conduct, not diet.)

## You should no longer drink water ##

or "You should stop being a water-drinker," one who drinks only water (UDB). Paul is not forbidding water. He is suggesting that Timothy use wine as medicine.

## sins of some people ##

(In verse 24, Paul continues what he was saying in verse 22. The <b>sins of some people</b>  would be the sins likely to be committed by those on whom hands are hastily placed [verse 22].)

## they go before them into judgment ##

“their sins go before those people into judgment.” Possible meanings are 1) Their sins show what the person is like even before it is time for the church to judge whether or not the person should be a leader, or 2) Their sins show what the person is like before it is time for the church to judge whether or not the person is guilty, or 3) Their sins are evident and God judges them now.

## some follow later ##

“But some sins follow those people later.” Possible meanings are 1) Timothy will not know about some sins until later, or 2) The church will not know about some sins until later, or 3) God will not judge some sins until the final judgment.

## even the others cannot be hidden ##

"the other good works will be known in the future"
