# learn to be lazy

"get into the habit of doing nothing"

# talk nonsense and are busybodies, saying things they should not say

These three phrases are probably three ways of speaking of the same activity. These people should not be looking into other people's private lives and telling about them to others who are no better off after hearing.

# nonsense

words that do not help those who hear them

# busybodies

people who look into other people's private lives for their own good and not for the good of the other people
