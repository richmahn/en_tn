# some good works are openly known

"some good works are obvious"

# good works

The works are considered "good" because they fit with God's character, purposes, and will.

# but even the others cannot be hidden

Paul speaks of sins as if they were objects that someone could hide. This can be stated in active form. AT: "but people will later find out about even the good deeds that are not obvious" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
