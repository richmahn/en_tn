# But a real widow is left all alone

"But one who is truly a widow has no family"

# She always remains with requests and prayers

"She continues to make requests and prayers"

# requests and prayers

These two words mean basically the same thing. Paul uses them together to emphasize how much these widows pray. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# both night and day

The words "night" and "day" are used together to mean "at all times." Alternate translation: "all the time" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
