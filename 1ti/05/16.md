# any believing woman

"any Christian woman" or "any woman who believes in Christ"

# has widows

# so that the church will not be weighed down

Paul speaks of the community having to help more people than they are able as if they were carrying too much weight on their backs. This can be stated in active form. AT: "so that the church will not have more work to do than they can" or "so that the Christian community will not have to help widows whose families could provide for them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# real widows

"those women who have no one to provide for them"
