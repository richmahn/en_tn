# Connecting Statement:

Paul again talks of how elders (overseers) should be treated and then gives Timothy some personal instructions.

# Let the elders who rule well be considered worthy

This can be stated in active form. AT: "All believers should think of the elders who are good leaders as worthy" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# double honor

Possible meanings are 1) "respect and payment" or 2) "more respect than others receive"

# those who work with the word and in teaching

Paul speaks about the word as if it is an object which a person can work with. AT: "those who preach and teach God's word" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# For the scripture says

This is personification that means that this is what someone has written in the scriptures. AT: "For we read in the scriptures that" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# You shall not put a muzzle on an ox while it treads the grain

Paul is using this quotation as a metaphor meaning that church leaders deserve to receive payment from the Christian community for their work. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# muzzle

a sleeve that goes over an animal's snout and mouth to prevent it from eating while it is doing work (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

# treads the grain

And ox "treads the grain" when it walks on or pulls a heavy object over the cut grain to separate the grain from the stalks. The ox was allowed to eat some of the grain as they worked.

# is worthy of

"deserves"
