# Connecting Statement:

Paul again talks of how elders (overseers) should be treated and then gives Timothy some personal instructions.

# Let the elders who rule well be considered worthy

This can be stated in active form. AT: "All believers should think of the elders who are good leaders as worthy" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# double honor

Possible meanings are 1) "respect and payment" or 2) "more respect than others receive"

# those who work with the word and in teaching

Paul speaks about the word as if it is an object that a person can work with. AT: "those who preach and teach God's word" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
