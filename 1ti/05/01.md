# Connecting Statement:

Paul continues to tell Timothy how to treat the men, women, widows, and younger women in the church.

# General Information:

Paul was giving these commands to one person, Timothy. Languages that have different forms of "you" or different forms for commands would use the singular form here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# Do not scold an older man

"Do not speak harshly to an older man"

# Instead, exhort him

"Instead, encourage him"

# as if he were a father ... as if they were brothers ... as mothers ... as sisters

Paul uses these similes to tell Timothy that he should treat fellow believers with sincere love and respect. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# younger women

You can state clearly the understood information. AT: "exhort younger women" or "encourage younger women" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# in all purity

"with pure thoughts and actions" or "in a holy way"
