# does not provide for his own relatives, especially for those of his own household

"does not help with his relatives' needs, especially for those family members living in his home"

# he has denied the faith

"he has acted contrary to the truth we believe"

# is worse than an unbeliever

"is worse than those who do not believe in Jesus." Paul means this person is worse than an unbeliever because even unbelievers take care of their relatives. Therefore, a believer should certainly take care of his relatives.
