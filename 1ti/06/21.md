# they have missed the faith

Paul speaks of faith in Christ as if it were a target at which to aim. Alternate translation: "they have not understood or believed the true faith" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# May grace be with you

"May God give grace to all of you." The "you" is plural and refers to the whole Christian community. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
