# Now

This marks a break in the teaching. Here Paul begins to contrast the kind of riches the wicked people seek through godliness ([1 Timothy 6:5](../06/05.md)) and the true kind of gain people receive through godliness. Alternate translation: "Of course"

# godliness with contentment is great gain

The words "godliness" and "contentment" are abstract nouns. Alternate translation: "it is great gain for a person to do what is godly and to be content with what they have" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# is great gain

"provides great benefits" or "does many good things for us"
