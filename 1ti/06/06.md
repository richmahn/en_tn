# Now

This marks a break in the teaching. Here Paul begins to contrast the kind of riches the wicked people seek through godliness ([1 Timothy 6:5](./03.md)) and the true kind of gain people receive through godliness. AT: "Of course"

# godliness with contentment is great gain

The words "godliness" and "contentment" are abstract nouns. AT: "it is great gain for a person to do what is godly and to be content with what they have" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# is great gain

"provides great benefits" or "does many good things for us"

# brought nothing into the world

"brought nothing into the world when we were born"

# Neither are we able to take out anything

"And we can take nothing out of the world when we die"

# let us

"we should"
