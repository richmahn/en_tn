## under the yoke as slaves ##

This can be translated as a metaphor that views a slave as an ox or other strong animal with a wooden bar placed over its shoulders so it can pull a plow. If including this metaphor is too difficult, you can omit it. It can also be translated as a metaphor for being a Christian (UDB). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
