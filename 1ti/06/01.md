# Connecting Statement:

Paul gives some specific instructions to slaves and masters and then continues with instructions on living in a godly way.

# Let all who are under the yoke as slaves

Paul speaks of people working as slaves as if they are oxen carrying a yoke. Alternate translation: "Let all who are working as slaves" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Let all who are

It is implied that Paul is speaking about believers. Alternate translation: "Let all who are believers" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# the name of God and the teaching might not be blasphemed

This can be stated in active and positive form. Alternate translation: "the unbelievers might always speak respectfully about the name of God and the teaching" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])

# the name of God

Here "name" refers to God's nature or character. Alternate translation: "the character of God" or "God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# the teaching

"the faith" or "the gospel"
