## under the yoke ##

This can be translated as a metaphor that views a slave as an ox or other strong animal with a wooden bar placed over its shoulders so it can pull a plow. This is also a doublet for <b>slaves,<b>  so if including the metaphor is too difficult, you can omit it. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]], [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]].) It can also be translated as in the UDB as a metaphor for being a Christian.
