## translationNotes

* **under the yoke** - This can be translated as a metaphor that views a slave as an ox or other strong animal with a wooden bar placed over its shoulders so it can pull a plow. This is also a doublet for <b>slaves,<b>  so if including the metaphor is too difficult, you can omit it. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]], [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]].) It can also be translated as in the UDB as a metaphor for being a Christian.
* **be blasphemed** - "those outside the church have bad things to say about God and the message about God"
* **slaves who have believing masters should not disrespect them, because they are brothers** - "because their believing masters are brothers, slaves who have believing masters should not disrespect their masters"
* **they should serve them** - "slaves with believing masters should serve those masters"
