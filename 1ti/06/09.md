# Now

This word marks a break in the teaching. Here Paul returns to the topic about those who think being godly will make them wealthy (See: [1 Timothy 6:5](./03.md)).

# to become wealthy fall into temptation, into a trap

Paul speaks about those who let the temptation of money cause them to sin as if they are animals that have fallen into a hole that a hunter has used as a trap. Alternate translation: "to become wealthy will encounter more temptation than they can resist, and they will be like an animal in a trap (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# They fall into many foolish and harmful passions

This continues the trap metaphor. This means that their foolish and harmful passions will overcome them. Alternate translation: "And as an animal falls into a hunter's trap, they will fall into many foolish and harmful passions" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# into whatever else makes people sink into ruin and destruction

Paul speaks about those that let sin destroy them as if they are a boat that sinks under the water. Alternate translation: "into other kinds of evil that ruin and destroy people as if they were a boat sinking under the water" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
