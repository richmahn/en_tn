# they will store up for themselves a good foundation for what is to come

Here Paul speaks about God's blessings that he gives in heaven as if they are riches that a person is storing away for later use. And, the certainty of these blessings that people will never lose is spoke of as if they were the foundation of a building. Alternate translation: "it will be as though they were storing up for themselves many things that God will give them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# take hold of real life

This recalls the sports metaphor of [1 Timothy 6:12](../06/12.md), where the prize is something that the winner can actually hold in his hands. Here the "prize" is "real" life. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
