# Fight the good fight of faith

Here Paul speaks about a person continuing in faith as if they are an athlete fighting to win a contest or a warrior fighting a battle. AT: "Try your hardest to obey Christ's teachings with as much energy as an athlete uses in a contest" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Take hold of the everlasting life

This continues the metaphor. Paul speaks about a person receiving eternal life as if they are a victorious athlete or warrior taking their prize. AT: "Take eternal life as your reward as a victorious athlete takes his prize" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# to which you were called

This can be stated in active form. AT: "to which God has called you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# you gave the good confession

"you confessed what is good" or "you confessed the truth"

# before many witnesses

Paul expresses the idea of location in order to signal the idea of the people to whom Timothy was speaking. AT: "to many witnesses" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
