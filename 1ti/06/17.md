## translationNotes

* **riches that are uncertain** - "the many things that they own that they may lose." The reference here is to physical objects.
* **true riches** - "things that will make us truly happy." The reference here may include physical objects, but it more likely refers to states like love, joy, and peace that people try to obtain by means of physical objects.
* **be rich in good works** - "look for opportunities to do good works the way you would look for physical wealth" or "enjoy doing good works the way you enjoy physical wealth"
* **foundation** - The first part of a house to be built. This is a metaphor for the first of the "true riches" and the beginning of the "real life" God will give his people in eternity. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **take hold of real life** - This recalls the sports metaphor of [[:en:bible:notes:1ti:06:11]], where the prize is something that the winner can actually hold in his hands. Here the "prize" is <b>real</b> life. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
