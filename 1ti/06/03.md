## translationNotes

* **If someone teaches** - "Anyone who teaches" or "Those who teach." Paul assumes that people are in fact teaching <b>differently</b>; this is not a hypothetical case. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
* **someone … he … he** - The UDB uses the plural "some people … such people … they" to say that the "someone" who "teaches" could be male or female, one person or many people. Use the form in your language that allows for this range of meaning.
* **he is sick with arguments** - "all he wants to do is argue" or "they crave arguments." Such people greatly desire the act of arguing itself, and do not really want to find a way to agree.
* **word fights** - "arguments over what words mean" or "words that cause fights" or "words meant to hurt others"
* **envy** - "the desire to have what others have"
* **strife** - "arguments between believers"
* **insults** - "people falsely saying bad things about each other"
* **evil suspicions** - Saying that anyone who disagrees with them is trying to do evil.
* **contentions** - "quarrels that last a long time"
* **decayed minds** - "minds that have been destroyed by bad thoughts"
