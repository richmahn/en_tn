# Connecting Statement:

Paul encourages Timothy to pray for all people.

# first of all

"most important" or "before anything else"

# I urge that requests, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made

This can be stated in active form. AT: "I urge all believers to make requests, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgiving to God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# I urge

"I plead" or "I ask"

# a peaceful and quiet life

Here "peaceful" and "quiet" mean the same thing. Paul wants all believers to be able to live calm lives without trouble from the authorities. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# in all godliness and dignity

"that honors God and that other people will respect"

# He desires all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth

# to come to the knowledge of the truth

Paul speaks of learning the truth about God as if it were a place to which people could be brought. AT: "to know and accept what is true" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
