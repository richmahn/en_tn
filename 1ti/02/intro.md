# 1 Timothy 02 General Notes #

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Peace #####
Paul encourages the Christians to live peaceful lives by exercising discipline and self-control. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/discipline]])

##### Women in the church #####
Paul is probably instructing the women how to use their freedom in Christ in such a way that it does not upset the normal cultural standards for women. Because of the potential for controversy, extra care should be taken in translating these passages. 

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### "Prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings" #####
There is some overlap in meaning to these terms. It is not necessary to view these as perfectly distinct categories.
