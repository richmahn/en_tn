# Connecting Statement:

Paul finishes his instructions on prayer then gives some special instructions for women.

# I want men in every place to pray and to lift up holy hands

Here "holy hands" means the entire person is holy. AT: "I want men in every place who are holy to lift up their hands and pray" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# men in every place

"the males in all places" or "the males everywhere." Here the word "men" refers specifically to males.

# lift up holy hands

It was a normal posture for people to raise their hands while praying.
