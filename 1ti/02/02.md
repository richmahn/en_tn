# a peaceful and quiet life

Here "peaceful" and "quiet" mean the same thing. Paul wants all believers to be able to live calm lives without trouble from the authorities. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# in all godliness and dignity

"that honors God and that other people will respect"
