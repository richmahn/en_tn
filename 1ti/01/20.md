# Hymenaeus ... Alexander

These are names of men. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# whom I gave over to Satan

Paul speaks as if he physically handed these men to Satan. This probably means that Paul rejected them from the community of believers. Since they are no longer a part of the community, Satan can have power over them and harm them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# they may be taught

This can be stated in active form. AT: "that God may teach them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
