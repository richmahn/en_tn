# I am placing this command before you

Paul speaks of his instructions as if he could physically put them in front of Timothy. Alternate translation: "I am entrusting you with this command" or "This is what I am commanding you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# my child

Paul speaks of his close relationship to Timothy as though Paul is the father and Timothy is the child. It is also likely that Timothy was converted to Christ by Paul, and so this is why Paul considered him like his own child. Alternate translation: "who is truly like my child" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# in accordance with the prophecies previously made about you

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "in agreement with what other believers prophesied about you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# fight the good fight

Paul speaks about Timothy working for the Lord as if he were a soldier fighting a battle. Alternate translation: "continue to work hard for the Lord" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
