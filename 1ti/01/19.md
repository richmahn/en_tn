# a good conscience

"a conscience that chooses right instead wrong." See how you translated this in [1 Timothy 1:5](./05.md).

# some have shipwrecked their faith

Paul speaks of these people's faith as if it were a ship that could be wrecked at sea. He means that they have ruined their faith and no longer believe in Jesus. You should use this or a similar metaphor if it will be understood in the project language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
