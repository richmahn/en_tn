# 1 Timothy 01 General Notes #

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Spiritual children #####
Paul calls Timothy his "son." Paul was very involved in discipling Timothy in his faith. Therefore, he called him his "spiritual" son. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/disciple]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/spirit]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]]) 

##### Genealogies #####

Genealogies are lists that record a person's ancestors or descendants. Jews used genealogies to choose the right man to become king. They did this because only a son of a king could become king. Most important people had records of their genealogies.

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter ####

##### Play on words #####
The phrase "the law is good if one uses it lawfully" is a pun or play on words. "Law" and "lawfully" sound similar.
