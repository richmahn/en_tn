# General Information:

In this book, unless otherwise noted, the word "our" refers to Paul and Timothy (the one to whom this letter is written), as well as to all believers. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-inclusive]])

# Paul, an apostle

"I, Paul, wrote this letter. I am an apostle." Your language may have a particular way of introducing the author of a letter. Immediately after introducing the writer, you may want to indicate to whom the letter was written, as in the UDB.

# according to the commandment of

"by the command of" or "by the authority of"

# God our Savior

"God who saves us"

# Christ Jesus our hope

Here "our confidence" refers to the person in whom we have confidence. Alternate translation: "Christ Jesus, who is the one in whom we have confidence" or "Christ Jesus, whom we trust" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
