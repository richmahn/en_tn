# But the grace

"And the grace"

# the grace of our Lord overflowed

Paul speaks of God's grace as if it were a liquid that could fill a container and spill out of the top when the container is full. AT: "God showed me much grace" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# with faith and love

This is the result of God showing much grace to Paul. AT: "which caused me to trust in Jesus and love him"

# that is in Christ Jesus

This speaks about Jesus as if he were a container that holds a liquid. Here "in Christ Jesus" refers to having a relationship with Jesus. AT: "that Christ Jesus enables me to give to God because I am united to him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
