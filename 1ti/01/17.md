# Now ... Amen

The word "Now" is used here to mark a break in the main teaching. Here Paul praises God.

# the king of the ages

"the eternal king" or "the chief ruler forever"

# Now to the king of the ages, the immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory forever and ever

The abstract nouns "honor" and "glory" can be stated as verbs. Alternate translation: "Now may people forever honor and glorify the king of the ages, who is immortal, invisible, and the only God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
