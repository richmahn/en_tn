A father teaches his son about wisdom (1:8–9:18)\n3. Proverbs from Solomon (10:1–22:16)\n4. Sayings from wise men (22:17–24:22)\n5. More sayings from wise men (24:23–34)\n6. Hezekiah’s proverbs from Solomon (25:1–29:27)\n7. Sayings from Agur (30:1–33)\n8. Sayings from Lemuel (31:1–9)\n9. Description of a good and capable wife (31:10–31)\n\n### What is the Book of Proverbs about?\n\nThe Book of Proverbs is a collection of proverbs. A proverb is a saying that gives wise advice or teaches something that is generally true about life. Most societies have their own proverbs and may use specific language that indicates something is a proverb. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-proverbs]])\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nThe title of this book is often translated as “Proverbs.” A more general translation would be “Sayings for Wise People,” “Wise Sayings,” or something similar.\n\n### Who wrote the Book of Proverbs?\n\nProverbs begins with the words, “The Proverbs of Solomon, son of David and King of Israel.” However, Solomon did not write all of the proverbs in this book. Unnamed wise men wrote the proverbs in [22:17](../22/17.md)–[24:34](../24/34.md). Agur the son of Jakeh wrote the proverbs in [30:1–33](../30/01.md) and King Lemuel wrote the proverbs in [31:1–31](../31/01.md).\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### What is meant by “wisdom” and “foolishness” in the Book of Proverbs?\n\n“Wisdom” refers to understanding and doing what is true and morally right. A wise person understands and does what Yahweh considers to be right. Anyone living in this way will also learn to live well with other people and to make good practical decisions in life. Those who fail to live in this way are called “foolish.” For this reason, it is possible for a person to be very intelligent and still be foolish. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/wise]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/foolish]])\n\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\n\n### Parallelism\n\nMany proverbs have two parts that have a relationship to each other. The second part may strengthen the first part, give more details about the first part, or say what seems to be the opposite of the first part. Translators should take into account that each proverb is also part of a larger group of proverbs. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])\n\n### Personification\n\nIn Proverbs, certain qualities such as wisdom and stupidity are often represented as if they were human. [Proverbs 1:20–33](../01/20.md), [3:15–18](../03/15.md), [4:6–9](../04/06.md), and [8:1](../08/01.md)–[9:12](../09/12.md) refer to wisdom as if it were a woman. [Proverbs 9:13–18](../09/13.md) refers to stupidity as if it were a woman. In languages where it is possible for a woman figure to represent these qualities, the translator should translate in this way. However, if direct translation is not possible in your language, you may translate these personifications as similes instead. In that case, wisdom or folly would be presented as being like a wise or stupid woman. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
1:intro	y4et				0	# Proverbs 1 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n1. Introduction and purpose for Proverbs (1:1–7)\n    * Title (1:1)\n    * The Purpose of Proverbs (1:2–6)\n    * Main Theme: Fearing Yahweh is essential to being wise (1:7)\n2. A father teaches his son about wisdom (1:8–9:18)\n    * Avoid evil companions (1:8–19)\n    * Do not reject wisdom (1:20–33)\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Personification\n\nIn [1:20–33](../01/20.md), wisdom is referred to as if it were a woman. In languages where it is possible for a woman figure to represent an abstract concept like wisdom, the translator should translate the personification directly. However, if direct translation is not possible in your language, you may translate these personifications as similes instead. In that case, wisdom would be presented as being like a wise woman.

The second clause emphasizes the meaning of the first clause by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if it would be helpful to your readers, you could connect the phrases with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional.

An adulteress is a woman who commits adultery.

30:intro	aud8				0	# Proverbs 30 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nChapter 30 is a chapter in Proverbs attributed to Agur, who is a person otherwise unknown.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Agur\n\nHis full title is Agur, Son of Jakeh. Agur comes from a Hebrew word that means “gatherer” and so some scholars believe this is not a real name, but possibly a way of referring to Solomon as a gatherer of proverbs. However, it is still prudent to simply use this as a name.\n\n### Three things and four\n\nFrom verses 15 through 32, the author uses a specific technique to explain some things. He says there are three things and even four and lists items that exemplify a feature like “small and yet wise.” The numbering is not meant to be so literal, but as a memory device that introduces the items. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/wise]])\n\n### Themes\n\nThere are individual proverbs that run along common themes, often including contrasting elements: wise/foolish, money, lazy/diligent, truth telling, wicked/righteous, sluggard, pride/humility, integrity/crookedness.
