front:intro	spe4				0	# Introduction to Proverbs\n\n## Part 1: General Introduction\n\n### Outline of Proverbs\n\n1. Introduction and purpose for Proverbs (1:1–7)\n2. A father teaches his son about wisdom (1:8–9:18)\n3. Proverbs from Solomon (10:1–22:16)\n4. Sayings from wise men (22:17–24:22)\n5. More sayings from wise men (24:23–34)\n6. Hezekiah’s proverbs from Solomon (25:1–29:27)\n7. Sayings from Agur (30:1–33)\n8. Sayings from Lemuel (31:1–9)\n9. Description of a good and capable wife (31:10–31)\n\n### What is the Book of Proverbs about?\n\nThe Book of Proverbs is a collection of proverbs. A proverb is a saying that gives wise advice or teaches something that is generally true about life. Most societies have their own proverbs and may use specific language that indicates something is a proverb. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-proverbs]])\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nThe title of this book is often translated as “Proverbs.” A more general translation would be “Sayings for Wise People,” “Wise Sayings,” or something similar.\n\n### Who wrote the Book of Proverbs?\n\nProverbs begins with the words, “The Proverbs of Solomon, son of David and King of Israel.” However, Solomon did not write all of the proverbs in this book. Unnamed wise men wrote the proverbs in [22:17](../22/17.md)–[24:34](../24/34.md). Agur the son of Jakeh wrote the proverbs in [30:1–33](../30/01.md) and King Lemuel wrote the proverbs in [31:1–31](../31/01.md).\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### What is meant by “wisdom” and “foolishness” in the Book of Proverbs?\n\n“Wisdom” refers to understanding and doing what is true and morally right. A wise person understands and does what Yahweh considers to be right. Anyone living in this way will also learn to live well with other people and to make good practical decisions in life. Those who fail to live in this way are called “foolish.” For this reason, it is possible for a person to be very intelligent and still be foolish. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/wise]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/foolish]])\n\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\n\n### Parallelism\n\nMany proverbs have two parts that have a relationship to each other. The second part may strengthen the first part, give more details about the first part, or say what seems to be the opposite of the first part. Translators should take into account that each proverb is also part of a larger group of proverbs. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])\n\n### Personification\n\nIn Proverbs, certain qualities such as wisdom and stupidity are often represented as if they were human. [Proverbs 1:20–33](../01/20.md), [3:15–18](../03/15.md), [4:6–9](../04/06.md), and [8:1](../08/01.md)–[9:12](../09/12.md) refer to wisdom as if it were a woman. [Proverbs 9:13–18](../09/13.md) might also refer to stupidity as if it were a woman. In languages where it is possible for a woman figure to represent these qualities, the translator should translate in this way. However, if direct translation is not possible in your language, you may translate these personifications as similes instead. In that case, wisdom or folly would be presented as being like a wise or stupid woman. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
1:intro	y4et				0	# Proverbs 1 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n1. Introduction and purpose for Proverbs (1:1–7)\n    * Title (1:1)\n    * The Purpose of Proverbs (1:2–6)\n    * Main Theme: Fearing Yahweh is essential to being wise (1:7)\n2. A father teaches his son about wisdom (1:8–9:18)\n    * Avoid evil companions (1:8–19)\n    * Do not reject wisdom (1:20–33)\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### My Son\n\nOccasionally, Solomon addresses a series of proverbs to “my son” or “sons.” This does not mean that those proverbs only apply to males. Instead, these phrases are forms used to pass on advice from a father to his son, and the kind of advice in these proverbs is about common temptations of young men.\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### Personification\n\nIn [1:20–33](../01/20.md), wisdom is referred to as if it were a woman. In languages where it is possible for a woman figure to represent an abstract concept like wisdom, the translator should translate the personification directly. However, if direct translation is not possible in your language, you may translate these personifications as similes instead. In that case, wisdom would be presented as being like a wise woman.

The second clause emphasizes the meaning of the first clause by repeating the same idea with different words.

However, if it would be helpful to your readers, you could connect the phrases with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional.

Solomon does not state if these people are removed by being killed or by being forced to leave **the land**, so it is best to use general expressions for these phrases. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “will be removed … will be taken away”

3:intro	a94e				0	# Proverbs 3 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n2. A father teaches his son about wisdom (1:8–9:18)\n    * Avoid evil companions (1:8–19)\n    * Do not reject wisdom (1:20–33)\n    * Wisdom prevents people from committing crime or adultery (2:1–22)\n    * Humbly trust Yahweh (3:1–12)\n    * The value of wisdom (3:13–20)\n    * Do not act wickedly (3:21–35)\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### My Son\n\nOccasionally, Solomon addresses a series of proverbs to “my son” or “sons.” This does not mean that those proverbs only apply to males. Instead, these phrases are forms used to pass on advice from a father to his son, and the kind of advice in these proverbs is about common temptations of young men.\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### Personification\n\nIn [3:15–18](../03/15.md), wisdom is referred to as if it were a woman. In languages where it is possible for a woman figure to represent an abstract concept like wisdom, the translator should translate the personification directly. However, if direct translation is not possible in your language, you may translate these personifications as similes instead. In that case, wisdom would be presented as being like a wise woman. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
3:1	tjcg			בְּ֭נִ⁠י	1	From [2:1](../02/01.md) to [7:27](../07/27.md), Solomon addresses his **son** directly, as he had previously in [1:8–19](../01/08.md). [3:1](../03/01.md) continues these direct instructions.

The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could connect the phrases with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional.

Alternate translation: “remember to obey”
3:2	e1jx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	כִּ֤י	1	**For** here indicates that what follows is a reason for the commands in the previous verse.

4:intro	z4ah				0	# Proverbs 4 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n2. A father teaches his son about wisdom (1:8–9:18)\n    * Avoid evil companions (1:8–19)\n    * Do not reject wisdom (1:20–33)\n    * Wisdom prevents people from committing crime or adultery (2:1–22)\n    * Humbly trust Yahweh (3:1–12)\n    * The value of wisdom (3:13–20)\n    * Do not act wickedly (3:21–35)\n    * Wisdom will benefit you (4:1–9)\n    * Behave wisely and avoid those who do not (4:10–19)\n    * Live righteously (4:20–27)\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### My Son\n\nOccasionally, Solomon addresses a series of proverbs to “my son” or “sons.” This does not mean that those proverbs only apply to males. Instead, these phrases are forms used to pass on advice from a father to his son, and the kind of advice in these proverbs is about common temptations of young men.\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### Personification\n\nIn [4:6–9](../04/06.md), wisdom is referred to as if it were a woman. In languages where it is possible for a woman figure to represent an abstract concept like wisdom, the translator should translate the personification directly. However, if direct translation is not possible in your language, you may translate these personifications as similes instead. In that case, wisdom would be presented as being like a wise woman. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])\n

5:intro	jxf1				0	# Proverbs 5 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n2. A father teaches his son about wisdom (1:8–9:18)\n    * Avoid evil companions (1:8–19)\n    * Do not reject wisdom (1:20–33)\n    * Wisdom prevents people from committing crime or adultery (2:1–22)\n    * Humbly trust Yahweh (3:1–12)\n    * The value of wisdom (3:13–20)\n    * Do not act wickedly (3:21–35)\n    * Wisdom will benefit you (4:1–9)\n    * Behave wisely and avoid those who do not (4:10–19)\n    * Live righteously (4:20–27)\n    * Avoid temptation to commit adultery (5:1–23)\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### My Son\n\nOccasionally, Solomon addresses a series of proverbs to “my son” or “sons.” This does not mean that those proverbs only apply to males. Instead, these phrases are forms used to pass on advice from a father to his son, and the kind of advice in these proverbs is about common temptations of young men.\n\n### Adulteress\n\nThis chapter repeatedly warns young men to avoid any adulterous woman, who is called “strange” and “foreign.” (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/adultery]])\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### Euphemism\n\nIn [5:15–20](../05/15.md), Solomon uses several euphemisms to refer to sexual activity between a man and his wife or an adulterous woman. Although the UST expresses the meaning of these euphemisms plainly, only do so if sexual language would not be offensive in your culture. It is usually best to use a euphemism from your own language that means the same thing.

6:intro	xq95				0	# Proverbs 6 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n2. A father teaches his son about wisdom (1:8–9:18)\n    * Avoid evil companions (1:8–19)\n    * Do not reject wisdom (1:20–33)\n    * Wisdom prevents people from committing crime or adultery (2:1–22)\n    * Humbly trust Yahweh (3:1–12)\n    * The value of wisdom (3:13–20)\n    * Do not act wickedly (3:21–35)\n    * Wisdom will benefit you (4:1–9)\n    * Behave wisely and avoid those who do not (4:10–19)\n    * Live righteously (4:20–27)\n    * Avoid temptation to commit adultery (5:1–23)\n    * Practical warnings (6:1–19)\n    * Adultery will be punished (6:20–35)\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### My Son\n\nOccasionally, Solomon addresses a series of proverbs to “my son” or “sons.” This does not mean that those proverbs only apply to males. Instead, these phrases are forms used to pass on advice from a father to his son, and the kind of advice in these proverbs is about common temptations of young men.\n\n### Adulterous women\n\nThis chapter repeatedly warns young men to avoid any adulterous woman, who is called “strange” and “foreign.” (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/adultery]])\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### Rhetorical questions\n\nIn [6:9](../06/09.md), [27](../06/27.md), [28](../06/28.md), the author uses rhetorical questions to emphasize the importance of what he is saying. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])\n\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### Animals used as examples\n\nIn this chapter, the gazelle, bird, and ant have certain characteristics which the author uses to teach about wisdom. If your language does not recognize those animals as being wise, you could add a footnote to explain or possibly substitute other animals from your culture that would help explain the same concept.

7:intro	pk5f				0	# Proverbs 7 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n2. A father teaches his son about wisdom (1:8–9:18)\n    * Avoid evil companions (1:8–19)\n    * Do not reject wisdom (1:20–33)\n    * Wisdom prevents people from committing crime or adultery (2:1–22)\n    * Humbly trust Yahweh (3:1–12)\n    * The value of wisdom (3:13–20)\n    * Do not act wickedly (3:21–35)\n    * Wisdom will benefit you (4:1–9)\n    * Behave wisely and avoid those who do not (4:10–19)\n    * Live righteously (4:20–27)\n    * Avoid temptation to commit adultery (5:1–23)\n    * Practical warnings (6:1–19)\n    * Adultery will be punished (6:20–35)\n    * The Story of an Adulterer (7:1–27)\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### My Son\n\nOccasionally, Solomon addresses a series of proverbs to “my son” or “sons.” This does not mean that those proverbs only apply to males. Instead, these phrases are forms used to pass on advice from a father to his son, and the kind of advice in these proverbs is about common temptations of young men.\n\n### Adulterous women\n\nThis chapter continues the theme about adulterous women and warns young men to avoid any adulterous woman, who is called “strange” and “foreign.” (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/adultery]])\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### The historic present\n\nTo call attention to developments in the story, Solomon uses the present tense in past narration in [7:8–13](../07/08.md) and [21–22](../07/21.md). If it would not be natural to do that in your language, you could use the past tense in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense]])

8:intro	z8jj				0	# Proverbs 8 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n2. A father teaches his son about wisdom (1:8–9:18)\n    * Avoid evil companions (1:8–19)\n    * Do not reject wisdom (1:20–33)\n    * Wisdom prevents people from committing crime or adultery (2:1–22)\n    * Humbly trust Yahweh (3:1–12)\n    * The value of wisdom (3:13–20)\n    * Do not act wickedly (3:21–35)\n    * Wisdom will benefit you (4:1–9)\n    * Behave wisely and avoid those who do not (4:10–19)\n    * Live righteously (4:20–27)\n    * Avoid temptation to commit adultery (5:1–23)\n    * Practical warnings (6:1–19)\n    * Adultery will be punished (6:20–35)\n    * The Story of an Adulterer (7:1–27)\n    * Wisdom benefits the wise (8:1–36)\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Wisdom calls out\n\nIn this chapter, wisdom is referred to as if it were a woman who calls out for all to learn from her and was with God when he created the universe. In languages where it is possible for something like wisdom to be spoken of as if it were a person who speaks, the translator should translate in this way. However, if direct translation is not possible in your language, you may translate the personification as similes instead. In that case wisdom would be presented as being like a wise woman. When wisdom speaks in [8:4–36](../08/04.md), the notes will use the proper noun “Wisdom” to indicate that the personification of wisdom is speaking. See how you translated similar references to wisdom in [1:20–33](../01/20.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])\n

9:intro	y75r				0	# Proverbs 9 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n2. A father teaches his son about wisdom (1:8–9:18)\n    * Avoid evil companions (1:8–19)\n    * Do not reject wisdom (1:20–33)\n    * Wisdom prevents people from committing crime or adultery (2:1–22)\n    * Humbly trust Yahweh (3:1–12)\n    * The value of wisdom (3:13–20)\n    * Do not act wickedly (3:21–35)\n    * Wisdom will benefit you (4:1–9)\n    * Behave wisely and avoid those who do not (4:10–19)\n    * Live righteously (4:20–27)\n    * Avoid temptation to commit adultery (5:1–23)\n    * Practical warnings (6:1–19)\n    * Adultery will be punished (6:20–35)\n    * The Story of an Adulterer (7:1–27)\n    * Wisdom benefits the wise (8:1–36)\n    * Wisdom and folly (9:1–18)\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Wisdom calls out\n\nIn this chapter and the previous chapter, wisdom is referred to as if it were a woman who prepares a meal and calls out for all to come and learn from her. In languages where it is possible for something like wisdom to be spoken of as if it were a person who speaks, the translator should translate in this way. However, if direct translation is not possible in your language, you may translate the personification as similes instead. In that case wisdom would be presented as being like a wise woman. When wisdom speaks in [9:4–12](../09/04.md), the notes will use the proper noun “Wisdom” to indicate that the personification of wisdom is speaking. See how you translated similar references to wisdom in [1:20–33](../01/20.md) and [8:4–36](../08/04.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])\n

In contrast, chapters 16–22 mostly contain proverbs in which the second of two parallel clauses completes, emphasizes, or qualifies the idea of the first clause. Chapter 16 also contains contrasting parallelism ([16:1](../16/01.md), [2](../16/02.md), [9](../16/09.md), [14](../16/14.md), [22](../16/22.md), [33](../16/33.md)) and parallelism in which both clauses have the same meaning for emphasis ([16:11](../16/11.md), [16](../16/16.md), [18](../16/18.md), [30](../16/30.md)).

(See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/godly]])\n\n### King Lemuel\n\nThis person is unknown in Scripture, other than here. It is important to recognize that the words in this chapter are words of his mother addressed to him. They are formed like advice of a mother to her son.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### An acrostic poem\n\nVerse 10 through 31 is tightly formed as a poem in the original language. There are 22 lines in the Hebrew language that each begin with a successive letter of the alphabet. However, each language will have a different set of letters. Therefore, it is important to realize this was a single composition with a single theme of a noble or godly wife.\n\n### Themes\n\nThere are individual proverbs that run along common themes, often including contrasting elements: wise/foolish, money, lazy/diligent, truth telling, wicked/righteous, sluggard, pride/humility, integrity/crookedness. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/wise]], [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/foolish]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/evil]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]])
