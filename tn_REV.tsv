This was probably the Apostle John. He wrote the Book of Revelation while on the island of Patmos. The Romans exiled John there for teaching people about Jesus.\n\n### What is the Book of Revelation about?\n\nJohn wrote the Book of Revelation to encourage believers to remain faithful even when they are suffering. John described visions he had of Satan and his followers fighting against and killing believers. In the visions God causes many terrible things to happen on the earth to punish wicked people. In the end, Jesus defeats Satan and his followers. Then Jesus comforts those who were faithful. And the believers will live forever with God in the new heavens and earth.\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nTranslators may choose to call this book by one of its traditional titles, “Revelation,” “The Revelation of Jesus Christ,” “The Revelation to Saint John,” or “The Apocalypse of John.” Or they may choose a possibly clearer title, such as “The Things that Jesus Christ Showed to John.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])\n\n### What type of writing is the Book of Revelation?\n\nJohn used a special style of writing to describe his visions. John described what he saw by using many symbols. This style of writing is called symbolic prophecy or apocalyptic literature. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-apocalyptic]])\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### Are the events of Revelation past or future?\n\nSince early Christian times, scholars have interpreted Revelation differently. Some scholars think John described events that happened during his time. Some scholars think John described events happening from his time until the return of Jesus. Other scholars think John described events that will happen in a short period of time just before Christ returns.\n\nTranslators will not need to decide how to interpret the book before they translate it. Translators should leave the prophecies in the tenses that are used in the ULT.\n\n### Are there any other books in the Bible like Revelation?\n\nNo other book of the Bible is like the Book of Revelation. But, passages in Ezekiel, Zechariah, and especially Daniel are similar in content and style to Revelation. It may be beneficial to translate Revelation at the same time as Daniel since they have some imagery and style in common.\n\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\n\n### Does one need to understand the Book of Revelation to translate it?\n\nOne does not need to understand all of the symbols in the Book of Revelation to translate it properly. Translators should not give possible meanings for the symbols or numbers in their translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-apocalyptic]])\n\n### How are the ideas of “holy” and “sanctify” represented in Revelation in the ULT?\n\nThe scriptures use these words to indicate any one of various ideas. For this reason, it is often difficult for translators to represent them well in their versions. In translating Revelation into English, the ULT uses the following principles:\n\n* The meaning in two passages indicates moral holiness. Here, the ULT uses “holy.” (See: 14:12; 22:11)\n* Usually the meaning in Revelation indicates a simple reference to Christians without implying any particular role filled by them. In these cases, the ULT uses “believer” or “believers.” (See: 5:8; 8:3, 4; 11:18; 13:7; 16:6; 17:6; 18:20, 24; 19:8; 20:9)\n* Sometimes the meaning implies the idea of someone or something set apart for God alone. In these cases, the ULT uses “sanctify,” “set apart,” “dedicated to,” or “reserved for.”\n\nThe UST will often be helpful as translators think about how to represent these ideas in their own versions.\n\n### Periods of time\n\nJohn referred to various periods of time in Revelation. For example, there are many references to forty-two months, seven years, and three and a half days. Some scholars think these time periods are symbolic. Other scholars think these are actual time periods. The translator should treat these time periods as referencing actual periods of time. It is then up to the interpreter to determine their significance or what they may represent.\n\n### The verb “Behold” which occurs often in the book of Revelation\n\n**Behold** is a word that focuses the attention of the listener on what the speaker is about to say or do. The word literally means “look!” or “see!” However, in this case, the expression denotes the act of seeing figuratively by means of giving notice and attention. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Listen carefully!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n## Special concepts or frequent themes in the book of Revelation\n\n### Trumpet\n\nA trumpet was an instrument for making a loud sound that, in John’s time, was probably made of metal. Usually trumpets are instruments for producing music or for calling people to gather together for an announcement or meeting. If you do not have trumpets in your culture, use a word in your language for a loud instrument. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])\n\n### Scroll\n\nIn ancient times, a scroll was a type of book made of one long, rolled-up sheet of papyrus or leather. After writing on a scroll or reading from it, people rolled it up by using the rods attached to its ends. Scrolls were used for legal documents and scripture. Sometimes scrolls that were delivered by a messenger were sealed with wax. If the wax was still present when the scroll was received, then the receiver knew that no one had opened the scroll to read it or write on it since it had been sealed. Alternate translation: “a scroll with writing on the front and the back” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])\n\n### Seal\n\nIn ancient times, seals represent pieces of wax that secured documents closed. Melted wax was used to seal letters or other documents that needed to be protected. When the wax cooled and hardened, the letter could not be opened without breaking the wax seal. The person who received the letter would see the unbroken seal and know that no one had opened it. Alternate translation: “and it had seven seals keeping it closed” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])\n\n### The Seven Spirits\n\nThe number "seven" is often used in the Bible as a symbol for completeness and perfection. Here, the "seven spirits" could refer to: (1) The Spirit of God that is described with seven attributes in [Isaiah 11:2](../isa/11/02.md). Alternate translation: “the sevenfold Holy Spirit”. (2) Seven individual spirits which serve God and that also might be the “seven angels” in [8:2](../08/02.md). Alternate translation: “the seven spirit beings” or “the seven angelic spirits” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage]])\n\n## What are the major issues in the text of the Book of Revelation?\n\nFor the following verses, some modern versions of the Bible differ from older versions. The ULT text has the modern reading and puts the older reading in a footnote. If a translation of the Bible exists in the general region, translators should consider using the reading found in those versions. If not, translators are advised to follow the modern reading.\n\n* “‘I am the alpha and the omega,’ says the Lord God, ‘the one who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty’” (1:8). Some versions add the phrase “the Beginning and the End.”\n* “the elders prostrated themselves and worshiped” (5:14). Some older versions read, “the twenty-four elders prostrated themselves and worshiped the one who lives forever and ever.”\n* “so that a third of it \\[the earth\\] was burned up” (8:7). Some older versions do not include this phrase.\n* “the one who is and who was” (11:17). Some versions add the phrase “and who is to come.”\n* “they are blameless” (14:5). Some versions add the phrase “before the throne of God” (14:5).\n* “the one who is and who was, the Holy One” (16:5). Some older versions read, “O Lord, the One who is and who was and who is to be.”\n* “The nations will walk by the light of that city” (21:24). Some older versions read, “The nations that are saved will walk by the light of that city.”\n* “Blessed are those who wash their robes” (22:14). Some older versions read “Blessed are those who do his commandments.”\n* “God will take away his share in the tree of life and in the holy city” (22:19). Some older versions read, “God will take away his share in the book of life and in the holy city.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])\n
1:intro	u1e2				0	# Revelation 1 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n### Outline of Chapter One of Revelation\n\nI. The Introduction to Revelation\n\nA. The Prologue (1:1-8)\n\n1. The Preface (1:1-3)\n2. The Address and the Doxology (1:4-6)\n3. The Book’s Theme (1:7-8)\n\nII. John’s Vision of Christ\n\nB. John’s Appointment to Write the Book of Revelation (1:9-20)\n\n1. The Initial Appointment to Write (1:9-11)\n2. The Source of the Appointment (1:12-16)\n3. The Appointment Repeated and Elaborated (1:17-20)\n\nThis chapter explains how the Book of Revelation records the vision John received on the island of Patmos.\n\nSome translations set quotations from the Old Testament farther to the right on the page to make them easier to read. The ULT does this with the quoted words in verse 7.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Seven churches\n\nJohn wrote this book to seven actual churches in Asia Minor, which is now the country of Turkey.\n\n### The Seven Spirits\n\nThe number "seven" is often used in the Bible as a symbol for completeness and perfection. Here, the "seven spirits" could refer to: (1) The Spirit of God that is described with seven attributes in [Isaiah 11:2](../isa/11/02.md). Alternate translation: “the sevenfold Holy Spirit”. (2) Seven individual spirits which serve God and that also might be the “seven angels” in [8:2](../08/02.md). Alternate translation: “the seven spirit beings” or “the seven angelic spirits” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage]])\n\n### Seven golden lampstands\n\nThe "seven golden lampstands" refer to seven poles that each hold one or more oil lamps at the top. These seven lamp holders are made of gold. Apparently these lamp holders represent the seven assemblies of believers in the seven cities mentioned in the previous verse. The number "seven" is often used in the Bible as a symbol for completeness and perfection, so it may be that these seven churches represent Christ’s church as a whole, that is, all believers. Alternate translation: “seven golden stands holding oil lamps” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage]])\n\n### Seven stars\n\nThe "seven stars" of [Revelation 1:20](../rev/01/20.md) symbolizes the angels of the seven churches.\n\n\n### White\n\nThe Bible often speaks of something that belongs to a person as being “white.” This is metaphor and metonym for that person living rightly and pleasing God. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]])\n\n### “Him who is, and who was, and who is to come”\n\nGod exists now. He has always existed. He will always exist. Your language may have a different way of saying this.\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### The Seven Spirits\n\nThe number "seven" is often used in the Bible as a symbol for completeness and perfection. Here, the "seven spirits" could refer to: (1) The Spirit of God that is described with seven attributes in [Isaiah 11:2](../isa/11/02.md). Alternate translation: “the sevenfold Holy Spirit”. (2) Seven individual spirits which serve God and that also might be the “seven angels” in [8:2](../08/02.md). Alternate translation: “the seven spirit beings” or “the seven angelic spirits” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage]])\n\n### Blood\n\nBlood is a metonym for death. Jesus “has released us from our sins by his blood.” John means that Jesus saved us from our sins by dying for us. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### “He is coming with the clouds”\n\nJesus went into the clouds when he went up to heaven after God raised him from the dead. When Jesus returns, he will also be “with the clouds.” It is not clear whether he will be sitting or riding on clouds or coming in the clouds or “with the clouds” in some other way. Your translation should express this in a way that is natural in your language.\n\n### “One like a son of man”\n\nThis refers to Jesus. You should translate the words “son of man” using the same words as you did in the Gospels for when Jesus called himself the “Son of Man.” The expression "like a son of man" describes a human figure that recalls the same phrase from [Daniel 7:13](../dan/07/13.md). The point of this comparison is that the figure John saw looked like a human. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “a being that looked like a man” or “a figure that resembled a human being” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])\n\n### “The angels of the seven churches”\n\nThe word “angels” here can also mean “messengers.” This might refer to heavenly beings, or to the messengers or leaders of these seven churches. John uses the same word “angel” (singular) in verse 1 and in many other places throughout the book. Your translation should also use the same word.\n\n### The word “to keep” or “to obey”\n\nThe word “to keep” means “to pay attention to” or “to heed” or “to obey”. There are various ways to render the idea or meaning of this word “to keep” as a frequent idiomatic expression in the book of Revelation. Basically, the meaning of this idiom which can vary depending on the context of the book of Revelation. For example, see how you translated “to keep” in [Revelation 1:3](../01/03.md). If your readers would not understand this idiom, you could use an equivalent idiom or use plain language. Alternate translation: “to take to heart” or “to continually consider” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

If this might confuse your readers, you could say the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “the time for the fulfillment of what is written in this book is near” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1:3	myem		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ὁ γὰρ καιρὸς ἐγγύς	1	Here, John speaks figuratively of **time** as if it could be **near** something.

1:4	vw1t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	Ἰωάννης	1	# General Information:\n\nIn this culture, letter writers would give their own names first, and they would refer to themselves in the third person. If that would be confusing in your language, you could use the first person. If your language has a particular way of introducing the author of a letter, you could also use that. Alternate translation: “I, John, am writing this letter” or “From John” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
1:4	apl8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	ταῖς ἑπτὰ ἐκκλησίαις ταῖς ἐν τῇ Ἀσίᾳ	1	In this culture, after giving their own names, letter writers would then say to whom they were writing, naming those people in the third person.

Alternate translation: “to you who are members of the seven churches that are in Asia” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
1:4	y9yh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-blessing	χάρις ὑμῖν καὶ εἰρήνη, ἀπὸ ὁ ὢν, καὶ ὁ ἦν, καὶ ὁ ἐρχόμενος	1	In this culture, letter writers would offer a good wish for the recipient before introducing the main business of the letter. Use a form in your language that makes it clear that this is a greeting and blessing. Alternate translation: “May the one who is, and who was, and who is coming give you grace and peace” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-blessing]])
1:4	lsun		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	χάρις ὑμῖν καὶ εἰρήνη, ἀπὸ ὁ ὢν, καὶ ὁ ἦν, καὶ ὁ ἐρχόμενος	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the ideas of **grace** and **peace**, you could express the same idea in another way.

1:4	x38p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage	ἑπτὰ πνευμάτων	1	The number **seven** is often used in the Bible as a symbol for completeness and perfection. Here, the **seven spirits** could refer to: (1) The Spirit of God that is described with seven attributes in [Isaiah 11:2](../isa/11/02.md). Alternate translation: “the sevenfold Holy Spirit”.

1:5	gz2n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	ὁ μάρτυς ὁ πιστός	1	This phrase **the faithful witness** is a title describing Jesus Christ. The phrase probably comes from [Psalm 89:37](../psa/089/037.md). Likewise, every title that is describing Jesus Christ in this verse comes from Psalm 89, including: **the firstborn from the dead** and **the ruler of the kings of the earth**. Psalm 89 itself refers to the promises that God gave to David in [2 Samuel 7](../2sa/07/01.md). So all of these titles describe Jesus Christ as the one who completes God’s promises to David. You may want to include some of this information in a footnote. You may also want to indicate the presence of an Old Testament quotation or allusion here by using a different typeface or indentation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
1:5	l3h8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ὁ πρωτότοκος τῶν νεκρῶν	1	This phrase **the firstborn from the dead** is an idiom meaning “the first person to die and become alive again”. The phrase probably alludes to [Psalm 89:27](../psa/89/27.md). If your readers would not understand this idiom, you could use plain language. Alternate translation: “the first person to be raised from death” or “the first person to come back to life to never die again” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1:5	j1xp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	τῶν νεκρῶν	1	The word **dead** is a singular noun that refers to a group of people. If your language does not use singular nouns in that way, you can use a different expression. Alternate translation: “from those who are dead” or “from those who have died” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns]])
1:5	gqw8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	καὶ ὁ ἄρχων τῶν βασιλέων τῆς γῆς	1	This phrase **the ruler of the kings of the earth** is a title of Jesus Christ that describes his future dominion over the earth. This phrase alludes to [Psalm 89:27](../psa/089/027.md). As with the previous phrases from [Psalm 89](../psa/089/001.md), you may want to indicate the presence of an Old Testament quotation or allusion here by using a different typeface or formatting. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
1:5	ttqn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	τῷ ἀγαπῶντι ἡμᾶς	1	A new sentence begins here that continues through the rest of the next verse. This sentence praises Jesus Christ. If it is helpful for your readers, you may want to state the main verb here at the beginning of the sentence and then repeat it again in the next verse. You may also want to break this long sentence into two or more shorter sentences. Alternate translation: “May Jesus Christ receive glory and power always because he loves us” or “May Jesus Christ receive glory and power always. He is the one who loves us” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
1:5	tqfs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	τῷ	1	Here, **the one** refers to Jesus Christ. If this is not clear to your readers, you can say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “To Jesus Christ, who loves us” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
1:5	u6v7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	λύσαντι ἡμᾶς ἐκ τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν ἡμῶν	1	Here John uses **released** figuratively of forgiving people for their **sins**. If this would confuse your readers, you could express the meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternative translation: “has forgiven us for our sins” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1:5	rvmr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἡμᾶς & ἡμῶν	1	The words **us** and **our** here include both John and his readers. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
1:5	jpnq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐκ τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν ἡμῶν	1	John uses **sins** figuratively to refer to the punishment for **sins**. He means that Jesus causes people who believe in him to escape eternal punishment for their sins. If this would confuse your readers, you could say the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “from the punishment for our sins” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1:5	q64f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τῷ αἵματι αὐτοῦ	1	Here, **blood** figuratively represents the death of Christ on the cross. If this might confuse your readers, you could use a comparable word that stands for death or express the idea in non-figurative language. Alternate translation: “his death on the cross” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1:6	nhfb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	βασιλείαν	1	Here, **a kingdom** functions as a metaphor for the unity that believers have as they belong to each other and to God. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate the meaning of **kingdom** here explicitly. Alternate translation: “a group that belongs to God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1:6	iq7j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἱερεῖς	1	Here, the word **priests** functions as a metaphor for people who live to serve God. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “people who work” or “people who live” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1:6	nesy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	βασιλείαν, ἱερεῖς τῷ Θεῷ καὶ Πατρί αὐτοῦ—αὐτῷ ἡ δόξα καὶ τὸ κράτος	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for **glory** or **power**, you could express these ideas in other ways. Here, **power** refers to the authority that Jesus has to rule over his kingdom. Alternate translation: “may people glorify Jesus and may he rule over everyone” or “may people honor Jesus always and may he reign” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1:6	ne7x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	τῷ Θεῷ καὶ Πατρί αὐτοῦ	1	Here, the words **God** and **Father** refer to one person, not two. This is God the Father who exists with the Son and the Holy Spirit as God. The name **Father** is an important title for God that describes the relationship between God and Jesus. Alternate translation: “for God, his Father” or “for God, who is the Father of Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
1:6	nm1i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας	1	This expression refers to endless future time. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “for all eternity” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1:7	ldv8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks	ἰδοὺ, ἔρχεται μετὰ τῶν νεφελῶν, καὶ ὄψεται αὐτὸν πᾶς ὀφθαλμὸς, καὶ οἵτινες αὐτὸν ἐξεκέντησαν, καὶ κόψονται ἐπ’ αὐτὸν πᾶσαι αἱ φυλαὶ τῆς γῆς	1	# General Information:\n\nThe clauses **Behold, he is coming with the clouds**, **every eye will see him, even those who pierced him**, and **will mourn because of him** are quotations from the Old Testament. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by setting off all of this material with quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
1:7	mx1c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	Here, **Behold** is a word that focuses the attention of the listener on what the speaker is about to say. Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation. Alternate translation: “Listen carefully!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1:7	bbqj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἔρχεται μετὰ τῶν νεφελῶν	1	The pronoun **he** here refers to Jesus Christ. If this is unclear to your readers, you could express the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “Jesus is coming with the clouds” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
1:7	isa6			ἔρχεται μετὰ τῶν νεφελῶν	1	This phrase probably refers to [Daniel 7:13](../dan/07/13.md). You may want to include this information in a footnote.
1:7	k0qo			ἔρχεται μετὰ τῶν νεφελῶν	1	Alternate translation: “He approaches on the clouds”
1:7	nxqe			ὄψεται αὐτὸν πᾶς ὀφθαλμὸς, καὶ οἵτινες αὐτὸν ἐξεκέντησαν, καὶ κόψονται ἐπ’ αὐτὸν πᾶσαι αἱ φυλαὶ τῆς γῆς	1	These phrases probably refer to [Zechariah 12:10](../zec/12/10.md). You may want to include this information in a footnote.
1:7	hb4i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	πᾶς ὀφθαλμὸς	1	Since people see with their eyes, the word **eye** is used to refer to people. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “every person” or “everyone” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
1:7	ndf6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	καὶ οἵτινες αὐτὸν ἐξεκέντησαν	1	Jesus’ hands and feet were **pierced** when he was nailed to the cross and a soldier **pierced** his side with a spear. Here **those who pierced him** refers to the people who killed him. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “even those who pierced and killed him” or “even those who stabbed him to death” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1:7	ewtl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	καὶ οἵτινες αὐτὸν ἐξεκέντησαν	1	John is leaving out some of the words that a clause would need in many languages to be complete. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could supply these words from the previous clause. Alternate translation: “even those who pierced him will see him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
1:7	s0rd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	ναί! ἀμήν!	1	Here, the phrase **Yes, Amen** has two words that mean basically the same thing. **Yes** affirms, emphasizes, and strengthens the following word, **Amen**. If your language does not use repetition to do this, you could use one phrase and provide emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “Certainly it shall be thus!” or “Yes indeed, may this truly be so!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
1:8	c96p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	ἐγώ εἰμι τὸ Ἄλφα καὶ τὸ Ὦ, λέγει Κύριος, ὁ Θεός, ὁ ὢν, καὶ ὁ ἦν, καὶ ὁ ἐρχόμενος, ὁ Παντοκράτωρ	1	Here, **says the Lord God** indicates that the clauses that come before and after this phrase are quotations. If this might confuse your readers, you could move this phrase to the beginning or end of the verse. Alternate translation: “The Lord God says, ‘I am the alpha and the omega, the one who is, and who was, and who is coming, the Almighty.’” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
1:8	ufix		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τὸ Ἄλφα καὶ τὸ Ὦ	1	The first and last letters of the Greek alphabet are **alpha** and **omega**. Comparing God to these letters means that he is the first and the last of all things. If it would be helpful in your language, you may consider using the first and last letters of your language’s alphabet, or use plain language. Alternate translation: “the A and the Z” or “the first and the last” or “the one who began and will end all things” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1:8	l1ss		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	τὸ Ἄλφα καὶ τὸ Ὦ	1	Here the phrase **the alpha and the omega** refers to the eternal nature of God the Father or that of Jesus Christ. The Greek alphabet represents time, and referring to the beginning and ending letters includes all of those in between. In other words, these letters represent all of time. Therefore, the idea here is that God always exists. The second part of the verse says this plainly. Alternate translation: “the one who always existed and will always exist” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
1:8	t0ga		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	τὸ Ἄλφα καὶ τὸ Ὦ, λέγει Κύριος	1	Some versions add the phrase “the Beginning and the End” after this statement. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the phrase it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to follow the example of the ULT. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
1:8	in5e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ὁ ἐρχόμενος	1	See how you translated the phrase **who is coming** in [verse 4](../01/04.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1:8	c1ii		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	ὁ Παντοκράτωρ	1	God is using the adjective **Almighty** as a noun in order to describe who he is. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this with a noun phrase. Alternate translation: “the one who is Almighty” or “the Almighty One” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
1:9	qyu1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	Ἰωάννης, ὁ ἀδελφὸς ὑμῶν, καὶ συνκοινωνὸς ἐν τῇ θλίψει, καὶ βασιλείᾳ, καὶ ὑπομονῇ, ἐν Ἰησοῦ	1	The Apostle **John** refers to himself in the third person here in this verse. If this is confusing in your language, you could translate this in the first person primarily or predominantly. Alternate translation: “I … am experiencing affliction with you … ” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
1:9	mg1k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you	ὁ ἀδελφὸς ὑμῶν	1	Here, **your** is plural and refers to the believers assembled among the seven churches mentioned in chapters 1–3 of this book. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “the brother of you believers” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
1:9	y5gy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ὁ ἀδελφὸς	1	John is using the term **brother** to mean that he shares the same faith. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “your fellow believer” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1:9	ikek		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	βασιλείᾳ	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **suffering**, **kingdom**, and **endurance**, you could express these ideas in another way. Alternate translation: “someone who is patiently enduring while suffering just as you are because we belong to Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1:9	o6k9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐν Ἰησοῦ	1	Here John pictures **Jesus** as containing the **suffering**, **kingdom**, and **patient endurance** that everyone who believes in him experiences. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this idea plainly. Alternate translation: “that we all experience because we believe in Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1:9	c1a9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	διὰ τὸν λόγον τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	John uses **word of God** figuratively to describe the gospel message that came from God and that John proclaimed by using words. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “because of the message from God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1:9	sim8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τὴν μαρτυρίαν Ἰησοῦ	1	John is using the possessive form to describe the **testimony** about **Jesus** that John proclaimed. If this is not clear in your language, you could say the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “the testimony that I proclaimed about Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
1:10	s2sw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐγενόμην ἐν Πνεύματι	1	Here, **in the Spirit** could mean: (1) God’s Spirit (the Holy Spirit) took control of John in order to influence John to receive divine revelation. Alternate translation: “I was influenced by the Spirit of God” or “God’s Spirit took control of me” (2) God caused John’s spirit to be in a state so that he could perceive revelation. Alternate translation: “God influenced my spirit” or “God took control of my spirit” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1:10	lnj2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τῇ Κυριακῇ ἡμέρᾳ	1	Here, **the Lord’s day** refers specifically to Sunday, which was the day of the week when believers gathered to worship together in honor of the Lord’s resurrection. If this is unclear to your readers, you could express the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “Sunday, the Lord’s day” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1:10	fa68		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	φωνὴν μεγάλην ὡς σάλπιγγος	1	The **voice** was very **loud** so that the noise sounded **like a trumpet**. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “a voice as loud as a trumpet being blown” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
1:10	ggph		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	φωνὴν μεγάλην	1	Here, **a loud voice** refers to a person speaking loudly, who is later revealed to be Jesus Christ. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “a sound of someone speaking loudly” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1:10	fu9q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ὡς σάλπιγγος	1	A **trumpet** was an instrument for making a loud sound that, in John’s time, was probably made of metal. Usually "trumpets" are instruments for producing music or for calling people to gather together for an announcement or meeting. If you do not have trumpets in your culture, use a word in your language for a loud instrument. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1:11	y4ab		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	λεγούσης	1	Here, **saying** introduces a quotation. What follows is what the voice of the previous verse said. Consider natural ways of introducing direct quotations in your language. You may want to start a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “That voice said” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
1:11	kq6x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ἔφεσον & Σμύρναν & Πέργαμον & Θυάτειρα & Σάρδεις & Φιλαδέλφιαν & Λαοδίκιαν	1	These are names of cities in the region of western Asia Minor that are in the modern area of southwestern Turkey today. The logic of the order seems to begin with Ephesus, the most important city at the time and then proceed to move clockwise until it reaches the city that is the furthest south at Laodicea. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
1:12	r89l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τὴν φωνὴν ἥτις	1	Here, **voice** refers figuratively to the person speaking. The context indicates that Jesus Christ is the one speaking here. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “who” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1:12	flem		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage	ἑπτὰ λυχνίας χρυσᾶς	1	Here, **seven golden lampstands** refer to seven poles that each hold one or more oil lamps at the top. These seven lamp holders are made of gold. Apparently these lamp holders represent the seven assemblies of believers in the seven cities mentioned in the previous verse. The number **seven** is often used in the Bible as a symbol for completeness and perfection, so it may be that these seven churches represent Christ’s church as a whole, that is, all believers. Alternate translation: “seven golden stands holding oil lamps” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage]])
1:13	xmx7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	ὅμοιον Υἱὸν Ἀνθρώπου	1	The expression **like a son of man** describes a human figure that recalls the same phrase from [Daniel 7:13](../dan/07/13.md). The point of this comparison is that the figure John saw looked like a human. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “a being that looked like a man” or “a figure that resembled a human being” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
1:13	y6qk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ζώνην χρυσᾶν	1	A **sash** was a strip of cloth worn around the chest. This one had the appearance of gold and may have been woven from golden threads. A **sash** is not a belt that is worn around the waist. Alternate translation: “strap” or “band” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1:14	hqz1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	ἡ δὲ κεφαλὴ αὐτοῦ καὶ αἱ τρίχες	1	Here, the phrase **head and hair** refers to the hair that is on the head. It does not mean that the skin of the head was white. Alternate translation: “the hair on his head” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
1:14	mg7r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	λευκαὶ, ὡς ἔριον λευκόν ὡς χιών	1	John uses repetition here in order to emphasize how white the hair was. If your language does not use repetition in this way, you could use one phrase and provide emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “extremely white like wool or snow” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
1:14	j9w4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	λευκαὶ, ὡς ἔριον λευκόν ὡς χιών	1	John is comparing the **hair** to **wool** and **snow** because those things are both very white. If your readers would not be familiar with those things, you could use the name of something in your area that is known to be very white, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “white as egret feathers” or “white as cotton” or “very, very white” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1:14	vp4t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ αὐτοῦ ὡς φλὸξ πυρός	1	It may be that the phrase **flame of fire** repeats information in a way that would be unnatural to express in your language. If so, you can say it in a more natural way. Alternate translation: “his eyes blazed like fire” or “his eyes were glowing like flames” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo]])
1:15	u551		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	οἱ πόδες αὐτοῦ ὅμοιοι χαλκολιβάνῳ	1	The point of this comparison is that the **feet** were like **polished bronze**, which is very shiny. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “his feet were very shiny like polished bronze” or “his feet were reflecting light like polished bronze” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
1:15	qbno		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	οἱ πόδες αὐτοῦ ὅμοιοι χαλκολιβάνῳ	1	John refers here to **polished bronze**. If your readers would not be familiar with that metal, you could use a more general comparison or an expression without a comparison. Alternate translation: “his feet were very shiny like polished metal” or “his feet were shining” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1:15	d6je		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-events	ὅμοιοι χαλκολιβάνῳ ὡς ἐν καμίνῳ πεπυρωμένης	1	Here, **furnace** refers to a strong container for holding a very hot fire. People would put metal like **bronze** in it, and the hot fire would make the metal **refined** by melting away any impurities that were in the metal. Do not translate this verse in a way that would imply that the bronze was first polished and then refined in a furnace, which reverses the actual order of events. Alternate translation: “like bronze that has been purified in a hot furnace and then polished” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-events]])
1:15	izg6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	ἡ φωνὴ αὐτοῦ ὡς φωνὴ ὑδάτων πολλῶν	1	The point of this comparison is that **the sound** of **his voice** was very loud and powerful. The image could be that of a loud waterfall or loud ocean waves or a loud downpour of rain. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “his voice was very loud like the sound of rushing waters” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
1:16	qu9h			καὶ ἔχων	1	Here, the subject of **having** continues from verse [1:13](../01/13.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could start a new sentence here and repeat the subject. Alternate translation: “This one like a son of man had” or “He had”
1:16	pp58		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage	καὶ ἐκ τοῦ στόματος αὐτοῦ ῥομφαία δίστομος ὀξεῖα ἐκπορευομένη	1	Here, the imagery of the **sword** protruding from Christ’s mouth is most likely a metaphor for the spoken word, especially God’s word, as being figuratively sharp and able to pierce things, as in Ephesians 6:17 and Hebrews 4:12. The symbolism may have been inspired by the fact that Roman **double-edged** swords were shaped like human tongues in their forms. The translator may wish to include some of this information in a footnote. Alternate translation: “the blade of a sharp sword that cuts on both sides protruding from his mouth” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage]])
1:16	cb26		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	ὡς ὁ ἥλιος φαίνει ἐν τῇ δυνάμει αὐτοῦ	1	Here, the phrase **shining as the sun at its strength** compares the face of Jesus Christ to the way that the sun shines in its full force during the middle of the day. Use a natural expression in your language for this. Alternate translation: “shining as bright as the noonday sun” or “shining as bright as the sun at mid-day” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
1:17	vz4u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	καὶ ἔθηκεν τὴν δεξιὰν αὐτοῦ ἐπ’ ἐμὲ	1	Here, the subject of **and he placed his right hand on me** should be assumed from earlier in the context at verse [1:13](../01/13.md). Verse [1:13](../01/13.md) mentions one **like a son of man** as a description of Jesus Christ. If this might confuse your readers, you could explicitly state the subject as Jesus. Alternate translation: “Jesus placed his right hand on me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
1:17	jw5r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	καὶ ἔθηκεν τὴν δεξιὰν αὐτοῦ ἐπ’ ἐμὲ	1	Here, the phrase **and he placed his right hand on me** signifies a cultural gesture or symbolic action that expresses comfort and assurance for the person who is need of encouragement at the moment of fear. The symbolic action has the accompanying verbal expression of **Do not be afraid** so as to illustrate the significance and symbolism of the cultural gesture. Alternate translation: “and he touched me with his right hand” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
1:17	uc3d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	ἐγώ εἰμι ὁ πρῶτος καὶ ὁ ἔσχατος	1	Here, **the first and the last** refers to the eternal nature of Jesus because he is God. He existed before anything else and he will continue to exist after everything else is gone. In this expression, **first** refers to what is before everything and **last** refers to what is after everything. This is similar to the use of alpha and omega in [verse 8](../01/08.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the one who existed before everything and will exist after everything” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
1:18	zm05		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καὶ ὁ ζῶν καὶ ἐγενόμην νεκρὸς	1	Here, **the one who lives** also refers to the eternal nature of Jesus as God. It could refer to: (1) God possessing eternal life in himself. Alternate translation: “the living one” (2) God being the source of life. Alternate translation: “the one who gives life” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1:18	cc7c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	Here, **behold** focuses the attention of the listener on what the speaker is about to say. Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation. See how you translated **behold** in [Revelation 1:7](../01/07.md). Alternate translation: “know this” or “you must understand” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1:18	ppy0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας τῶν αἰώνων	1	This expression refers to endless future time. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “for all eternity” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1:18	a4e2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἔχω τὰς κλεῖς τοῦ θανάτου καὶ τοῦ ᾍδου	1	John uses **keys** here figuratively to refer to authority or power. Just as **keys** have the ability to control the opening or locking of a door, so Jesus has the power to control death and Hades. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I have the power over death and over Hades” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1:18	pgql		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἔχω τὰς κλεῖς τοῦ θανάτου καὶ τοῦ ᾍδου	1	This clause implies that Jesus can give life to those who have died and let them out of **Hades**. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express that explicitly. Alternate translation: “I have the power to give life to people who have died and to let them out of Hades” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1:18	acrx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate	τοῦ θανάτου καὶ τοῦ ᾍδου	1	The word **Hades** is the Greek name for the place where the spirits of dead people go. Many Bible translations just use this word as it is, and others translate it, using a word for the place of the dead in their language. The words **death** and **Hades** mean almost the same thing. Through **death** a person enters **Hades**. Alternate translation: “to release people from death, that is, from Hades” or “to free people from death and from the grave” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate]])
1:19	eupc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litany	ἃ εἶδες, καὶ ἃ εἰσὶν, καὶ ἃ μέλλει γενέσθαι μετὰ ταῦτα	1	Here, **what you have seen, both the things that are and what must happen after these things** refers to the things that Jesus is showing to John throughout this book. These clauses could indicate (1) events in two time periods, present and future. In this case, the tense of **have seen** is from the perspective of John when he is writing. He cannot write something until he has seen it. Alternate translation: “what you see, that is, the things that exist now, and what must happen afterwards” or (2) events in three time periods, past, present, and future. Alternate translation: “what you have seen, what is, and what must happen afterwards” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litany]])
1:20	ytmk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὸ μυστήριον τῶν ἑπτὰ ἀστέρων	1	Here, **the mystery** refers to a secret or symbolic meaning of the vision of the **seven stars**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “the secret meaning of the seven stars” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1:20	ttic		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	τὸ μυστήριον τῶν ἑπτὰ ἀστέρων, οὓς εἶδες ἐπὶ τῆς δεξιᾶς μου, καὶ τὰς ἑπτὰ λυχνίας τὰς χρυσᾶς	1	This sentence leaves out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words if it would be helpful in your language. Alternate translation: “I will explain the mystery of the seven stars that you saw in my right hand, and the seven golden lampstands” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
1:20	fl5d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage	λυχνίας	1	See how you translated this word in [verse 12](../01/12.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage]])
1:20	eek9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἄγγελοι τῶν ἑπτὰ ἐκκλησιῶν	1	Here, **the angels of the seven churches** could refer to: (1) heavenly angels who protect the seven churches, or (2) human messengers who are sent to the seven churches. In the second case, **the angels** could either be human representatives who lead among each of the seven churches or, alternatively, the actual messengers who went from John bearing the book of Revelation to the seven churches mentioned in [verse 11](../01/11.md). The translator should use a word here that can allow for both interpretations, if possible. Alternate translation: “the seven messengers of the seven churches” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

2:intro	zps2				0	# Revelation 2 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n### Outline of Chapters Two and Three of Revelation\n\nI. The Current Condition of the Churches (2:1-3:22)\n\nA. The Letter to Ephesus (2:1-7)\n\nB. The Letter to Smyrna (2:8-11)\n\nC. The Letter to Pergamum (2:12-17)\n\nD. The Letter to Thyatira (2:18-29)\n\nE. The Letter to Sardis (3:1-6)\n\nF. The Letter to Philadelphia (3:7-13)\n\nG. The Letter to Laodicea (3:14-22)\n\nChapters 2 and 3 together are usually called the “seven letters to the seven churches.” You may wish to set each letter apart. The reader can then easily see that they are separate letters.\n\nSome translations set quotations from the Old Testament farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text. The ULT does this with the quoted words of verse 27.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### The personal knowledge that Jesus expresses about the churches\n\nJesus uses the phrase **I know** to express his personal familiarity and knowledge at times of some of the churches mentioned in Revelation chapters two and three. The phrase **I know** is an idiom for expressing knowledge of the present situation and the types of circumstances that the Christians experienced among the various churches mentioned in chapters two and three of the book of Revelation. The idiomatic expression **I know** indicates an assurance that Jesus understands the current conditions or circumstances in which the Christians were living. Although usually positive in a tone of assurance (see Revelation 2:2,9,13,19; 3:8), the phrase **I know** sometimes expresses a critical or negative assessment that Jesus affirms (see Revelation 3:1,15). Thus, the expression **I know** affirms more than simply a knowledge of circumstances on the part of Jesus, but the phrase also asserts a claim to be in a position to make a valid judgment as an impartial arbiter who might be critical at times. Therefore, the translator may wish to provide for his readership a textual note that explains the phrase **I know** as meaning something more than simply the awareness that Jesus has of the current religious, social, and moral conditions for the Christians which are addressed by Jesus (see Revelation chapters two and three). Alternate translation: “I am aware of the fact that” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])\n\n### The use of the second person singular to refer to a plural group of people\n\nThe second person pronouns and the second person individuals addressed throughout chapters two and three of the book of Revelation are often singular in their number, but they are plural in their references. Technically, every message to each of the seven churches mentioned in Revelation chapters two and three are addressed to a singular, individual **angel**, so that one would naturally expect singular references in the language of the letters. Thus, many of the second person references in the verbs and the pronouns, although singular in their literal sense, are plural in their implied references to the believers of the church that receives the message in the letter. If the singular form of the second person address and the second person verbal references would not be natural in your language, then perhaps the translator could use the plural forms of the second person, or “you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd]])\n\n### Poverty and wealth\n\nThe Christians in Smyrna were poor because they did not have much money. But they were rich spiritually because God would reward them for their suffering. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/spirit]])\n\n### “The devil is about to”\n\nPeople were about to take some of the Christians in Smyrna and throw them into prison and even kill some of them ([Revelation 2:10](../rev/02/10.md)). John does not say who these people were. But he does speak of them harming the Christians as if Satan himself were harming them. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])\n\n### Balaam, Balak, and Jezebel\n\nBalaam, Balak, and Jezebel were people who lived long before Jesus was born. They all tried to harm the Israelites either by cursing them or by making them want to stop obeying God.\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### “Let the one who has an ear hear”\n\nJesus is emphasizing that what he has just said is important and may take some effort to understand and put into practice. Here, the phrase **has an ear** presents a metonym for the willingness to understand and obey by association with the part of the body in which his listeners would have been receiving his teaching. Alternate translation: “Let the one who is willing to listen, listen to” or “The one who is willing to understand, let him understand and obey” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])\n\nSince Jesus is speaking directly to his audience, you may prefer to use the second person here. Alternate translation: “If you are willing to listen, then listen to” or “If you are willing to understand, then understand” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])\n\n### “what the Spirit says to the churches”\n\nHere, **the Spirit** most likely refers to God’s Spirit, or simply the Holy Spirit of God’s triune nature, in contrast to the spirit of the writer or author which one finds in [Revelation 1:10](../01/10.md). In other words, the Holy Spirit addresses the messages and contents of each letter written to each of the seven churches which are addressed in chapters two and three (see Revelation 2:7, 11, 17, 29: 3:6, 13, 22). See the chapter introductions for chapter two and for chapter three to read this same same explanatory note. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### “The angel of the church”\n\nThe word **angel** here can also mean “messenger” or “representative.” This might refer to the messenger or a representative leader of the church. See how you translated **angel** in [Revelation 1:20](../rev/01/20.md).\n\n### “Says these things”\n\nThe verses with the phrase **says these things** can be difficult to translate. They do not make complete sentences. You may need to add “These are” to the beginning of these sentences. Jesus uses these words to speak of himself as if he were speaking of another person. Your language may not allow people to speak of themselves as if they were speaking of other people. Jesus began speaking in [Revelation 1:17](../rev/01/17.md). He continues to speak through the end of Chapter 3. The phrase **says these things** indicates that the words that come after this expression are a direct quotation. Use a phrase that makes this clear in your language. Alternate translation: “says this message” or “says the following words” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])\n\n### “the one who conquers”\n\nThe expression **the one who conquers** refers to anyone who is victorious by overcoming difficulties in the Christian life (see Revelation 2:7, 11, 17, 26; 3:5, 12, 21). The expression represents a metaphor comparing the Christian life to a military battle, in which the Christian overcomes the forces of evil and any difficult obstacles in warfare. Alternate translation: “the one who wins the victory” or “the one who overcomes” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\nThe expression **the one who conquers** refers to anyone who is victorious by overcoming difficulties in the Christian life. The generic noun phrase **the one who conquers** occurs in Revelation chapters two and three often (see Revelation 2:7, 11, 17, 26; 3:5, 12, 21). The expression is not specific to any one person, but can be applied to a plural entity or group of people. If the generic noun phrase would be misunderstood in your language, use a more natural phrase such as turning the singular word into a plural group reference. Alternate translation: “anyone who has the victory” or “those who have the victory” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])
2:1	mn8x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	τῷ ἀγγέλῳ τῆς ἐν Ἐφέσῳ ἐκκλησίας γράψον	1	# General Information:\n\nThis is the beginning of the message to the angel of the church in **Ephesus**. **Ephesus** is the name of one of the seven churches, or seven assemblies of believers, which existed in southwestern Asia Minor when John wrote the book of Revelation. See how you translated this in [Revelation 1:11](../01/11.md) (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
2:1	kq5r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τῷ ἀγγέλῳ	1	Here, **the angel** could refer to: (1) a heavenly angel who protects the church in Ephesus, or (2) a human messenger who is sent to the church in Ephesus as a representative leader. In this case, **the angel** could either be a representative leader of the church in Ephesus or the actual messenger who went from John bearing the book of Revelation to the church in Ephesus. See how you translated **angel** in [Revelation 1:20](../01/20.md) (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:1	mz7l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	τάδε λέγει	1	Here, **says these things** indicates that the words that come after this phrase are a direct quotation. Use a phrase that makes this clear in your language. Alternate translation: “says this message” or “says the following words” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
2:1	q1ck		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ὁ κρατῶν τοὺς ἑπτὰ ἀστέρας ἐν τῇ δεξιᾷ αὐτοῦ, ὁ περιπατῶν ἐν μέσῳ τῶν ἑπτὰ λυχνιῶν τῶν χρυσῶν	1	Here, the implied subject of the two clauses is Jesus Christ. Jesus is the assumed subject from the context established in the previous chapter one. If this might confuse your readers, you could say the intended reference to Jesus explicitly. Alternate translation: “Jesus Christ, the one who holds the seven stars in his right hand, who walks in the midst of the seven golden lampstands” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
2:1	ugs3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage	τῶν ἑπτὰ λυχνιῶν τῶν χρυσῶν	1	The **golden lampstands** are symbols that represent the seven churches, or seven assemblies of believers. See how you translated **lampstands** in [Revelation 1:12](../01/12.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage]])
2:2	mm3q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	οἶδα	1	For the expression **I know** that occurs often in chapters two and three of the book of Revelation (see Revelation 2:2,9,13,19; 3:1,8,15), please see the explanatory note for **I know** in the chapter two introduction. Alternate translation: “I am aware of the fact that” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
2:2	jg1u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τὸν κόπον	1	If your readers would misunderstand the abstract noun **labor**, you can express it with the verb “to work”. Alternate translation: “that you laboured very hard” or “that you worked very hard” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:2	iwe7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τὴν ὑπομονήν	1	If your readers would misunderstand the abstract noun **endurance**, you can express it with the verb “endure.” Alternate translation: “that you patiently suffered” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:2	l6mv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd	τὰ ἔργα σου, καὶ τὸν κόπον καὶ τὴν ὑπομονήν σου, καὶ ὅτι οὐ δύνῃ βαστάσαι κακούς; καὶ ἐπείρασας τοὺς λέγοντας ἑαυτοὺς ἀποστόλους, καὶ οὐκ εἰσίν, καὶ εὗρες αὐτοὺς ψευδεῖς	1	The second person pronouns and the second person individuals addressed throughout this verse and throughout chapters two and three are often singular in their number, but they are plural in their references. Technically, every message to each of the seven churches mentioned in Revelation chapters two and three are addressed to a singular, individual **angel** (see the previous verse), so that one would naturally expect singular references in the language of the letters. Thus, many of the second person references in the verbs and the pronouns, although singular in their literal sense, are plural in their implied references to the believers of the church that receives the message in the letter. If the singular form of the second person address and the second person verbal references would not be natural in your language, then perhaps the translator could use the plural forms of the second person, or “you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd]])
2:2	sxbf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	κακούς	1	Here, **evil people** translates directly an adjective in the Greek that signifies simply “wicked” or **evil**. Thus, the translator must supply a noun that the adjective is describing through an assumed implication. The natural assumption for the noun to be supplied would be human individuals who were people in the surrounding community of those being addressed here. Alternate translation: “wayward people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
2:2	ka9e			εὗρες αὐτοὺς ψευδεῖς	1	Here, **you have found them** indicates the literal translation of the Greek. However, the sense of **found** is something like “to understand” or simply to come to the knowledge about a certain reality. The understood reality is actually the falsehood of the claim of certain people to be apostles. Alternate translation: “you have recognized those people to be false apostles”
2:3	nn01		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καὶ ὑπομονὴν ἔχεις	1	Here, **and you have patient endurance** implies a missing affirmation of **I know** from the previous verse. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternative translation: “I realize that you have patient endurance” or “I recognize that you have patient endurance” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:3	muq8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	διὰ τὸ ὄνομά μου	1	Here, **name** is a metonym for the person of Jesus Christ, since Jesus uses **name** here to refer to himself. The believers in Ephesus are suffering persecution and difficult circumstances for the sake of Jesus Christ as believers in him. The assembly in Ephesus suffers for the sake of the person and message of Jesus Christ within their society. Alternate translation: “because of me” or “because you believe in my name” or “because you believe in me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
2:3	j46d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	οὐ κεκοπίακες	1	Being discouraged is spoken of as growing **weary**. The metaphor relates the notion of quitting an action with becoming tired since often people stop an action if they are tired. Alternate translation: “you have not become discouraged” or “you have not quit” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:3	mg3z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes	οὐ κεκοπίακες	1	Here, **have not grown weary** is a litotes expression that expresses emphasis by negating the opposite statement. In this case, Jesus emphasizes the act of persevering and not giving up despite obstacles by stating the opposite notion. The believers at Ephesus had persevered in trials but did not give up. Thus, they did not grow **weary** or become tired, but rather they continued to try hard. See the previous note about the metaphor in the figure of speech. Alternate translation: “you have not grown tired” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
2:4	j7gz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ἔχω κατὰ σοῦ, ὅτι	1	Here **I have against you that** indicates a negative, critical sentiment. It expresses the idea of a critical attitude in the person speaking, meaning something like: “I have something against you” or “there is something about you that I disapprove of”. Jesus is leaving out a word in the idiomatic expression that some languages would need in order for a clause to be complete. However, the following words in the context describe the matter of contention that Jesus is angry about. If your language requires an explanation of what Jesus is taking issue with the Ephesian church about, then you can supply it from the context. Alternate translation: “I disapprove of you because” or “I have a criticism to make of you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
2:4	kx98		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τὴν ἀγάπην σου τὴν πρώτην ἀφῆκες	1	To stop doing something is spoken of as leaving it **behind**. Here, **love** represents an object that can abandoned. Here, the expression presents a metaphor expressing **love** as an object that can be forsaken. Alternate translation: “you have stopped loving me as you did at the beginning” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:5	sfw2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	πόθεν πέπτωκας	1	The notion of the church no longer loving as much as they used to love is spoken of as having **fallen** in the sense of “how far you have fallen from your original location”. Here, “falling” from a standing location is a metaphor for abandoning an earlier love and devotion for a person, in this case Jesus. Here, the metaphorical expression describes a tremendous decline in the love for Jesus among the Christians at Ephesus. Alternate translation: “how much you have changed” or “how much you once loved me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:5	cd8v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	καὶ τὰ πρῶτα ἔργα ποίησον	1	Here, **the first works** is a metonym that describes the behavior or way of life of the Ephesian believers earlier in their Christian practice. Earlier in the Christian way of life of the Ephesian believers they made greater efforts in their stronger devotion for Jesus. Alternate translation: “and do the first efforts” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
2:5	hlyf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἔρχομαί σοι καὶ κινήσω τὴν λυχνίαν σου ἐκ τοῦ τόπου αὐτῆς	1	Here, **I will come to you and I will remove your lampstand from its place** could refer to: (1) a special coming in judgment that Jesus would make personally for only the church of Ephesus. (2) the final, second coming of Jesus to the earth in judgment. In both interpretation options, Jesus uses a metaphor from the actual Roman destruction of the Jerusalem temple in 70 AD. In 70 AD, the Romans entered the Jerusalem temple and removed the seven-branched lampstand from inside the sanctuary. However, the translator should not make either interpretive option explicit in the translation. Alternate translation: “I will come to you and I will extract your lampstand from its place” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:5	j8p5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage	ἔρχομαί σοι καὶ κινήσω τὴν λυχνίαν σου ἐκ τοῦ τόπου αὐτῆς	1	The **lampstand** is a symbol that represents one of the seven churches. See how you translated **lampstand** in [Revelation 1:12](../01/12.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage]])
2:6	g8gn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἀλλὰ τοῦτο ἔχεις	1	**But you have this** is a metaphor in which **this** represents the fact that Jesus hates the works of the Nicolaitans. The metaphor in this idiomatic expression is that **this** is spoken of as if it were an object someone could have. If this might confuse your readers, you could say the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “But this is to your credit” or “But here is a good thing you are doing” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:6	cvi5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	τῶν Νικολαϊτῶν	1	The **Nicolaitans** were people who followed the teachings or practices of a man named Nicolaus. The translator should not attempt to specify the actual teachings or practices of the **Nicolaitans** since there is no certainty about what Nicolaus taught or practiced. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
2:7	s3qg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ὁ ἔχων οὖς, ἀκουσάτω	1	Jesus is emphasizing that what he has just said is important and may take some effort to understand and put into practice. Here, the phrase **has an ear** presents a metonym for the willingness to understand and obey by association with the part of the body in which his listeners would have been receiving his teaching. Alternate translation: “Let the one who is willing to listen, listen to” or “The one who is willing to understand, let him understand and obey” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
2:7	tidg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	ὁ ἔχων οὖς, ἀκουσάτω	1	Since Jesus is speaking directly to his audience, you may prefer to use the second person here. Alternate translation: “If you are willing to listen, then listen to” or “If you are willing to understand, then understand” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
2:7	zln0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	τὸ Πνεῦμα	1	Here, **the Spirit** most likely refers to God’s Spirit, or simply the Holy Spirit of God’s triune nature, in contrast to the spirit of the writer or author which one finds in [Revelation 1:10](../01/10.md). In other words, the Holy Spirit addresses the messages and contents of each letter written to each of the seven churches which are addressed in chapters two and three (see Revelation 2:7, 11, 17, 29: 3:6, 13, 22). See the chapter introductions for chapter two and for chapter three to read this same same explanatory note. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
2:7	wzg1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τῷ νικῶντι	1	The expression **To the one who conquers** refers to anyone who is victorious by overcoming difficulties in the Christian life (see Revelation 2:7, 11, 17, 26; 3:5, 12, 21). The expression represents a metaphor comparing the Christian life to a military battle, in which the Christian overcomes the forces of evil and any difficult obstacles in warfare. Alternate translation: “To the one who wins the victory” or “To the one who overcomes the obstacles” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:7	t84w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	τῷ νικῶντι	1	The expression **To the one who conquers** refers to anyone who is victorious by overcoming difficulties in the Christian life. The generic noun phrase **the one who conquers** occurs in Revelation chapters two and three often (see Revelation 2:7, 11, 17, 26; 3:5, 12, 21). The expression is not specific to any one person, but can be applied to a plural entity or group of people. If the generic noun phrase would be misunderstood in your language, use a more natural phrase such as turning the singular word into a plural group reference. Alternate translation: “To anyone who has the victory” or “To those who have the victory” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])
2:7	ng2d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	ἐκ τοῦ ξύλου τῆς ζωῆς	1	John is using the possessive form of **tree** to describe the **tree** as giving **life**. The imagery recalls Genesis 3:22’s reference to **the tree of life** in the Garden of Eden. If this is not clear in your language, you could say the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “the tree that grants life” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
2:7	rmf5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate	τῷ Παραδείσῳ τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Here, **paradise** is a Greek transliteration of a Persian word that describes a pleasure garden and zoo that Persian monarchs built at their residences. However, in the Bible **paradise** becomes a symbol for heaven. The symbolism for heaven might be seen in Luke 23:43 and 2 Corinthians 12:4, which both show that **paradise** is a name for the abode of God. Thus, **paradise** represents the eternal and permanent home of believers in Jesus Christ in the new heavens and the new earth of the future. Alternate translation: “the garden of God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate]])
2:8	is3w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	καὶ τῷ ἀγγέλῳ τῆς ἐν Σμύρνῃ ἐκκλησίας γράψον	1	# General Information:\n\nThis is the beginning of the message to the angel of the church in **Smyrna**. **Smyrna** is the name of one of the seven churches, or seven assemblies of believers, which existed in southwestern Asia Minor when John wrote the book of Revelation. See how you translated this in [Revelation 1:11](../01/11.md) (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
2:8	ie9x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τῷ ἀγγέλῳ	1	See how you translated **angel** in [Revelation 1:20](../01/20.md) (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

2:8	huo8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	ὁ πρῶτος καὶ ὁ ἔσχατος, ὃς ἐγένετο νεκρὸς καὶ ἔζησεν	1	Jesus is referring to himself in the third person here. If this is confusing in your language, you could translate this in the first person. Alternate translation: “I am the first and the last and I am the one who became dead but came to life again” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
2:8	k7qk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	ὁ πρῶτος καὶ ὁ ἔσχατος	1	Here, the **first and the last** refers to the eternal nature of Jesus Christ. See how you translated this in [Revelation 1:17](../01/17.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
2:8	t5l1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	ὃς ἐγένετο νεκρὸς καὶ ἔζησεν	1	Here, the phrase **who became dead but came to life again** describes Jesus by the two extremes of his death on the cross as well as his current life after the resurrection. The figure of speech is a type of merism. See how you translated the very similar phrase in [Revelation 1:18](../01/18.md). However, note that there are slight differences between this verse and [Revelation 1:18](../01/18.md), such as in the order of the words. Alternate translation: “who became dead but lived again” or “who became dead but returned back to life” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
2:9	s6ja		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd	σου	1	See how you translated second person pronouns and references in [Revelation 2:2](../02/02.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd]])
2:9	p6hp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τὴν θλῖψιν	1	If your readers would misunderstand the abstract noun **affliction**, you can express it as a verb. Alternate translation: “I know how you have suffered” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:9	ch4u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τὴν πτωχείαν	1	If your readers would misunderstand the abstract noun **poverty**, you can express it as a verb. Alternate translation: “how poor you are” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:9	lhuk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἀλλὰ πλούσιος εἶ	1	Here, **rich** is a metaphor for the spiritual condition of the Christians in Smyrna. The Christians in Smyrna were physically poor because they did not have much money. However, they were spiritually rich because God would reward them for their suffering in the future. Thus, the metaphor uses the language of physical money to describe the spiritual condition of Smyrna’s Christians. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:9	f6bp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τὴν βλασφημίαν ἐκ τῶν λεγόντων Ἰουδαίους εἶναι ἑαυτούς	1	If your readers would misunderstand the abstract noun **slander**, you can express it as a verb. Alternate translation: “how people have slandered you—those who say they are Jews” or “how people have said terrible things about you—those who say they are Jews” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:9	qf9p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony	καὶ οὐκ εἰσίν	1	Here, **but they are not** is irony in the sense of the fact that Jesus does not intend to say that the people are not literal Jews. Jesus actually means that these people are indeed Jews, although they do not behave in a manner that agrees with their ethnic identification. Jews should behave as if they were God’s people, but these people mentioned here do not act as if they were actually God’s chosen race. Alternate translation: “but they are not real Jews” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])
2:9	a4yu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	συναγωγὴ τοῦ Σατανᾶ	1	Here, **a synagogue of Satan** is a metaphor describing Jewish people in Smyrna that were slandering the Christians in the local church. The metaphor uses the imagery of the word **synagogue** as a place to gather together Jews for both worship and for learning. However, the Jews described in this verse gather together to slander the Christians of Smyrna. Therefore, these Jews actually gather and serve **Satan** as a **synagogue** in a certain sense. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:9	hv3o		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	συναγωγὴ τοῦ Σατανᾶ	1	Here, **a synagogue of Satan** signifies a synagogue that serves Satan in some metaphorical sense (see previous note). The phrase uses the possessive form to describe the fact that the synagogue of Jews serves Satan. If this is not clear in your language, you could say the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “a synagogue that follows Satan” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
2:10	a9ue		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	See how you translated **Behold** in [Revelation 1:7](../01/07.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:10	agx4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	μέλλει βάλλειν ὁ διάβολος ἐξ ὑμῶν εἰς φυλακὴν, ἵνα πειρασθῆτε	1	Here, **to throw** is a idiomatic expression for putting someone into prison or jail. The enemies of the Christians will test them, not God himself. Translators should avoid making the impression to their readers that God is in league with Satan as an author of evil or temptation. Alternate translation: “the devil will soon cause others to put some of you in prison” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
2:10	tlvz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd	ἐξ ὑμῶν	1	See how you translated the second person pronouns and references in [Revelation 2:2](../02/02.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd]])
2:10	snk8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἡμερῶν δέκα	1	Here, **ten days** is probably metaphorical for a short time or limited amount of time for testing. Daniel 1:14 is most likely the source of the expression for a short time of testing. The translator should not avoid, however, rendering the time as a literal length of time of ten days, in contrast to some unspecified amount of time in a metaphorical expression. Alternate translation: “for a short time of testing” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:10	f5t1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	γίνου πιστὸς ἄχρι θανάτου	1	The use of the word **until** does not mean that you should stop being faithful at death. Rather, the idea is to be faithful even to the point of death. Alternate translation: “Be faithful to me even if they kill you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:10	zhj8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τὸν στέφανον τῆς ζωῆς	1	Here, **the crown of life** refers as a metaphor to the reward of eternal life itself. Jesus is using the possessive form to describe the crown or the wreath as the prize of life itself. Eternal life is the reward in the metaphor of a crown. Alternate translation: “life as your crown” or “life as your wreath” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
2:11	g7zq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ὁ ἔχων οὖς, ἀκουσάτω	1	See how you translated this phrase in [Revelation 2:7](../02/07.md) (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

2:11	y88p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	τὸ Πνεῦμα	1	Here, **the Spirit** most likely refers to God’s Spirit, or simply the Holy Spirit of God’s triune nature, in contrast to the spirit of the writer or author which one finds in [Revelation 1:10](../01/10.md). In other words, the Holy Spirit addresses the messages and contents of each letter written to each of the seven churches which are addressed in chapters two and three (see Revelation 2:7, 11, 17, 29: 3:6, 13, 22). See the chapter introductions for chapter two and for chapter three to read this same same explanatory note. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
2:11	s9d2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	ὁ νικῶν	1	See how you translated this generic noun phrase in [Revelation 2:7](../02/07.md). For the metaphorical expression **one who conquers** that occurs often in chapters two and three of the book of Revelation (see Revelation 2:7, 11, 17, 26; 3:5, 12, 21), please see the explanatory note for this generic noun phrase **one who conquers** in the chapter two introduction. Alternate translation: “anyone who conquers” or “all who conquer” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])
2:11	q6w2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	οὐ μὴ ἀδικηθῇ ἐκ τοῦ θανάτου τοῦ δευτέρου	1	Here, the clause **will certainly not be hurt** is a euphemism for experiencing the second death in actuality. The literal meaning of the clause gives the sense of mistreating or injuring someone. However, in this case, the euphemism represents the greater danger of a second, spiritual death (see next note). Alternate translation: “will not experience the second death” or “will not die the second death” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
2:11	ayw1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐκ τοῦ θανάτου τοῦ δευτέρου	1	Here, **by the second death** is a metaphor that describes the spiritual or eternal transition from normal life that occurs after the first natural death that people suffer at the end of life. The phrase **second death** is further described and defined in Revelation 20:6,14: 21:8. The translator should translate the phrase **the second death** literally and also give an explanatory note with references to Revelation 20:6,14; 21:8. Alternate translation: “by the eternal death” or “by the spiritual death” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:12	ll17		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	καὶ τῷ ἀγγέλῳ τῆς ἐν Περγάμῳ ἐκκλησίας γράψον	1	# General Information:\n\nThis is the beginning of the message to the angel of the church in **Pergamum**. **Pergamum** is the name of one of the seven churches, or seven assemblies of believers, which existed in southwestern Asia Minor when John wrote the book of Revelation. See how you translated this in [Revelation 1:11](../01/11.md) (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

2:13	ltx3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	οἶδα ποῦ κατοικεῖς	1	Here, **I know where you live** is an idiom for expressing knowledge of the present condition and difficult circumstances that the Christians in Pergamum were experiencing at that time. The idiomatic expression indicates an assurance that Jesus understands the current problems and difficult conditions of the people which he addresses here. Jesus not only expresses knowledge of the city of Pergamum as a location or place, but he also expresses his familiarity with the religious, social, and moral conditions which the Christians experienced while living in Pergamum. See the explanatory note for **I know** in the chapter two introduction contents. Alternate translation: “I know where you dwell” or “I know where you have your home” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
2:13	ryn6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	ὁ θρόνος τοῦ Σατανᾶ	1	Here, **the throne of Satan** means the place that “Satan controls and gives power to his throne”. Jesus is using the possessive form to describe the place where Satan has power and control with a reference to a throne for describing the rule of Satan as a metonym. There is most likely a local reference to a giant altar to the god Zeus that existed in Pergamum at this time. Alternate translation: “where Satan rules” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
2:13	fxzt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	κρατεῖς τὸ ὄνομά μου	1	Here, **you hold tightly to my name** is a idiomatic expression meaning to firmly believe in the name of Jesus. Alternate translation: “you firmly believe in my name” or “you have a strong faith in my name” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
2:13	tf7c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τὸ ὄνομά μου	1	Here, **name** is a metonym for the person of Jesus. See how you translated the phrase **my name** in [Revelation 2:3](../02/03.md). Alternate translation: “you hold tightly to me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
2:13	x6j6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	οὐκ ἠρνήσω τὴν πίστιν μου	1	If your readers would misunderstand the abstract noun **faith**, you can express it positively with the verb “believe.” Alternate translation: “you continued to tell people that you believe in me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:13	da1q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τὴν πίστιν μου	1	Here, **{your} faith in me** means “your faith that places trust in me.” Jesus is using the possessive form to describe the faith that the Christians had in Jesus as the object of their belief. Alternate translation: “your belief in me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
2:13	lu4b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ἀντιπᾶς	1	**Antipas** is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
2:13	phzk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	ὁ μάρτυς μου ὁ πιστός μου	1	Here, **my witness, my faithful one** means that Antipas “faithfully testified of me.” Jesus is using the possessive form to describe Antipas as a faithful witness to Jesus himself. Antipas faithfully witnessed about Jesus even up to the point of death so that one can simply call Antipas a “martyr.” Alternate translation: “my faithful martyr” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
2:13	xgge		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ὃς ἀπεκτάνθη	1	Here, **who was killed** can be changed from the awkward passive form in some languages. If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “whom those in your city killed” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2:13	biue		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd	παρ’ ὑμῖν	1	See how you translated second person pronouns and references in [Revelation 2:2](../02/02.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd]])
2:13	v5lv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ὅπου ὁ Σατανᾶς κατοικεῖ	1	Here, **where Satan lives** is an idiomatic expression that basically means where Satan rules. For this idiom and metaphorical imagery to describe Satan’s rule in Pergamum, see the note above for the phrase **the throne of Satan** in this same verse here. Alternate translation: “where Satan has power” or “where Satan rules” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
2:14	wu6n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ἔχω κατὰ σοῦ ὀλίγα	1	See how you translated a similar phrase in [Revelation 2:4](../02/04.md), although in this case there is no actual ellipsis technically speaking with the presence of the object **a few things**. Alternate translation: “I disapprove of you because of a few things you have done” or “I am angry with you because of a few things you did” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
2:14	rd44		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	κρατοῦντας τὴν διδαχὴν Βαλαάμ	1	Here, **hold tightly** is an idiomatic expression for either: (1) people who teach what **Balaam** taught. (2) people who do what **Balaam** taught. The second option seems preferable in this context for the metaphor, as seen in the UST rendition. If this might confuse your readers, you could use an equivalent expression in the target language. Alternate translation: “some who do the teaching of Balaam” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:14	j3nc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	τῷ Βαλὰκ	1	**Balak** was the name of a king in the Old Testament (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
2:14	hg4g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	βαλεῖν σκάνδαλον	1	Here, **to throw a stumbling block** is a metaphor for the act of leading and, thereby, causing people to sin. Therefore, this expression speaks of an action or behavior that leads people to sin as if it were a stone that sits in a road over which people stumble. The Greek word for **stumbling block** also can mean the trigger peg in an animal trap so that the phrase expresses the idea of setting a trap. If this might confuse your readers, you could use an equivalent expression in the target language. Alternate translation: “to set a trap” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:14	mu6e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	φαγεῖν εἰδωλόθυτα	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way for the word **food sacrificed to idols**, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Jesus uses the passive form here to focus on what is sacrificed rather than the person who does the sacrificing. If you must state who does the sacrificing, you could use a vague or indefinite subject. Alternate translation: “the things that people have sacrificed to idols” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2:14	rvjm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	φαγεῖν εἰδωλόθυτα	1	Here, **to eat food sacrificed to idols** speaks of eating food dedicated to a pagan god so that Jews considered the food to be unclean and, thus, forbidden to eat. The phrase **food sacrificed to idols** describes animals that are slaughtered, offered to a god, and then eaten. If your language has a specific word or phrase for meat from an animal that has been offered to a god, you could use it here. If your language does not have such a word, you could use a descriptive phrase. Alternate translation: “meat from animals sacrificed to idols” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
2:14	u19f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	πορνεῦσαι	1	Here, **to be sexually immoral** literally means immoral sexual activity. Yet, often people take the expression as a metaphor that signifies idolatry. If the expression is indeed a metaphor, then one should translate the word literally. However, if this might confuse the readers, one could use an equivalent expression in the target language, one could express this meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “to sin sexually” or “to commit sexual sin” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:15	jmzp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	κρατοῦντας τὴν διδαχὴν	1	See how you the phrase **holding tightly to the teaching** in the previous verse. Alternate translation: “doing the teaching” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

2:16	f8dy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	εἰ δὲ μή	1	If your readers would misunderstand this phrase, you can supply the verb from the previous phrase. Alternate translation: “If you do not repent, I” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
2:16	qict		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἔρχομαί	1	See how you translate this word in [Revelation 2:5](../02/05.md). Alternate translation: “I will punish” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:16	fd6u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	πολεμήσω	1	Here, **will wage war** expresses a metaphor for judgment that utilizes the imagery of a sword coming from the mouth of Jesus. The translator may wish to maintain a fairly literal rendition in order to allow the metaphor to work with the sword imagery in this verse and from the prior verses of [Revelation 1:16](../01/16.md) and [Revelation 2:12](../02/12.md). Alternate translation: “I will punish” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:16	j52q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage	ἐν τῇ ῥομφαίᾳ τοῦ στόματός μου	1	This refers to the **sword** in [Revelation 1:16](../01/16.md) and [Revelation 2:12](../02/12.md). Although symbols in apocalyptic language are not normally to be replaced with the item they represent, translators may choose whether or not to show that this is a symbol which represents the words that Jesus speaks (see the UST). This symbol indicates that Jesus will defeat his enemies by giving a simple command. Alternate translation: “with the sword that is my mouth” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage]])
2:17	lm1j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ὁ ἔχων οὖς, ἀκουσάτω	1	See how you translated this phrase in [Revelation 2:7](../02/07.md) (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

2:17	unnj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	τὸ Πνεῦμα	1	Here, **the Spirit** most likely refers to God’s Spirit, or simply the Holy Spirit of God’s triune nature, in contrast to the spirit of the writer or author which one finds in [Revelation 1:10](../01/10.md). In other words, the Holy Spirit addresses the messages and contents of each letter written to each of the seven churches which are addressed in chapters two and three (see Revelation 2:7, 11, 17, 29: 3:6, 13, 22). See the chapter introductions for chapter two and for chapter three to read this same same explanatory note. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
2:17	i61b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	τῷ νικῶντι	1	See how you translated this generic noun phrase in [Revelation 2:7](../02/07.md). For the metaphorical expression **one who conquers** that occurs often in chapters two and three of the book of Revelation (see Revelation 2:7, 11, 17, 26; 3:5, 12, 21), please see the explanatory note for this generic noun phrase **one who conquers** in the chapter two introduction. Alternate translation: “anyone who conquers” or “all who conquer” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])
2:17	ngjb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τοῦ μάννα τοῦ κεκρυμμένου	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way for the word **hidden manna**, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Jesus uses the passive form here to focus on what is hidden rather than the person who does the hiding. If you must state who does the hiding, you could use an indefinite subject or Jesus himself (see the UST). Alternate translation: “manna that I have hid” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2:17	yeqt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ψῆφον λευκήν	1	Here, **a white stone** could signify a variety of different interpretive options which relate to the social context of Pergamum when John wrote the book of Revelation. The translator should not choose any interpretation over another in this case, but simply maintain a fairly literal translation of the phrase **a white stone**. Hence, this note would suggest that the translator should not attempt to render **a white stone** in any way that seeks to be culturally relevant, since commentators are not exactly sure what the phrase signifies first in the original context here (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
2:17	l59r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ὄνομα καινὸν γεγραμμένον	1	Here, **a new name written** could mean the name of Jesus, the name of God, or else, more likely, the new name of the person who conquers. The translator should not choose any interpretation over another in this case, but simply maintain a fairly literal translation of the phrase **a new name written**. If your language does not use the passive form in this way for the word **written**, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Jesus uses the passive form here to focus on what is written rather than the person who does the writing. If you must state who does the writing, you could use an indefinite subject or Jesus himself (see the UST). Alternate translation: “a new name that I wrote” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

2:18	p86i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	οἱ πόδες αὐτοῦ ὅμοιοι χαλκολιβάνῳ	1	People create objects of **bronze** and have them **polished** in order to make them shine and reflect light. Likewise, the feet of Jesus shine and reflect light like **polished bronze**. See how you translated this in [Revelation 1:15](../01/15.md). Alternate translation: “whose feet are very shiny like polished bronze” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
2:19	oum6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	οἶδά σου τὰ ἔργα	1	See how you translated the clause **I know your works** in [Revelation 2:2](../02/02.md). Alternate translation: “I am aware of what you have done” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

If the singular form of the second person address and the second person references would not be natural in your language, then perhaps the translator could use the plural forms of the second person, or “you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd]])
2:19	bx33		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τὴν ἀγάπην, καὶ τὴν πίστιν, καὶ τὴν διακονίαν, καὶ τὴν ὑπομονήν σου	1	If your readers would misunderstand the abstract noun **love**, **faith**, **service**, and **endurance**, you can express them with their corresponding verbs that describe the actions. Alternate translation: “how you have loved, trusted, served, and endured patiently” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:19	y2mu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὴν ἀγάπην, καὶ τὴν πίστιν, καὶ τὴν διακονίαν, καὶ τὴν ὑπομονήν σου	1	If your readers would misunderstand these abstract nouns in the clause then you can state the implied objects of these terms explicitly.

2:19	pi0k			τὰ ἔργα σου, τὰ ἔσχατα πλείονα τῶν πρώτων	1	Here, the clause **your last works {are} greater than {your} first {works}** presents a comparison of previous labor or efforts to the current labor or efforts of the believers. If your readers would misunderstand the noun **works**, you can express it with the verb “to work” or “to do”. Alternate translation: “you do more now than you did at first”
2:20	wbu1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ἀλλ’ ἔχω κατὰ σοῦ	1	See how you translated a similar phrase in [Revelation 2:4](../02/04.md). Alternate translation: “But I disapprove of some of the things you are doing” or “But I am angry with you because of something you are doing” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
2:20	f6e8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τὴν γυναῖκα Ἰεζάβελ	1	Jesus spoke of a certain **woman** in their church at Thyatira as if she were the famous Queen **Jezebel**, because she did the same kinds of sinful actions that Jezebel had done in the Old Testament. Alternate translation: “the woman who is just like Jezebel” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:20	mnom		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	πορνεῦσαι, καὶ φαγεῖν εἰδωλόθυτα	1	See how you translated a similar clause with the same phrases in [Revelation 2:14](../02/14.md). It is possible to interpret both phrases as metaphors for idolatry or sinful actions in general (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
2:21	g7yh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	ἔδωκα αὐτῇ χρόνον ἵνα μετανοήσῃ	1	Here, **I gave her time so that she might repent** represents a purpose clause. The word **so that** introduces a purpose clause. Jesus is stating a purpose for which he granted some time for the woman Jezebel to repent of her actions. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a purpose clause. Alternate translation: “I gave her time for the purpose of her repentance” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
2:21	rtai		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	τῆς πορνείας αὐτῆς	1	Here, **her immorality** expresses the idea of impure passion. The word **immorality** always applies to females. The manner of expressing female immorality varies greatly in many languages. Use a natural idiom for expressing female immorality in your target language (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
2:22	kpoe		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	See how you translated **Behold** in [Revelation 1:7](../01/07.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:22	twa2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	βάλλω αὐτὴν εἰς κλίνην & εἰς θλῖψιν μεγάλην	1	Here, having Jezebel lie in **a bed** would be the result of Jesus making her very sick. The imagery of the bed is simply a metonym for the entire process of lying in bed when one is sick. The act of throwing someone into a bed causes the punishment to appear to be more intense and graphic in its idiomatic expression. Alternate translation: “I will make her lie sick in bed … I will make suffer greatly” or “I will make her very sick … I will make suffer greatly” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
2:22	lj36		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	βάλλω αὐτὴν εἰς κλίνην, καὶ τοὺς μοιχεύοντας μετ’ αὐτῆς εἰς θλῖψιν μεγάλην	1	Here, Jesus speaks of causing people to suffer with the idiomatic expression of throwing them into suffering. The metaphor or idiomatic expression presents the imagery of causing suffering or hurt by the act of throwing someone into the suffering or hurt. Alternate translation: “I will throw her onto a bed, and I will make her and those who commit adultery with her to suffer greatly” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:22	g53b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐὰν μὴ μετανοήσουσιν ἐκ τῶν ἔργων αὐτῆς	1	This implies that they have participated with her in her wicked behavior. By repenting of **her deeds**, they also **repent** of participating in her behavior. Alternate translation: “if they do not repent from doing the evil that she does” or “if they do not repent of participating in her deeds” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:23	cn5s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τὰ τέκνα αὐτῆς	1	Jesus spoke of the disciples of Jezebel as if they were **her children**. Alternate translation: “her followers” or “her disciples” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:23	kx34		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	τὰ τέκνα αὐτῆς ἀποκτενῶ ἐν θανάτῳ	1	Here, **I will strike her children dead** expresses the idea of killing the disciples of Jezebel. The phrase implies death by a swift and ruthless action. The idiomatic language suggests the idea of killing by means of a pestilence. Alternate translation: “I will slay her children” or “I will exterminate her children” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
2:23	zm6t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	νεφροὺς καὶ καρδίας	1	The terms **kidneys** and **hearts** are metonyms that represents feelings and desires in the idiomatic language. Alternate translation: “what people think and want” or “secret thoughts and desires” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
2:23	bgs9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	δώσω ὑμῖν ἑκάστῳ	1	The phrase **I will give to each one of you** represents an idiomatic expression describing the distribution of punishment and reward. If this idiom might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I will punish or reward each one of you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

2:24	zqpg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd	ὑμῖν δὲ λέγω τοῖς λοιποῖς τοῖς ἐν Θυατείροις, ὅσοι οὐκ ἔχουσιν τὴν διδαχὴν ταύτην, οἵτινες οὐκ ἔγνωσαν τὰ βαθέα τοῦ Σατανᾶ, ὡς λέγουσιν; οὐ βάλλω ἐφ’ ὑμᾶς ἄλλο βάρος	1	See how you translated second person pronouns and references in [Revelation 2:2](../02/02.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd]])
2:24	tli6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ὅσοι οὐκ ἔχουσιν τὴν διδαχὴν ταύτην	1	Here, to believe in a **teaching** is spoken of as to hold or to grasp the **teaching**. If this idiom might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “to everyone who does not believe this teaching” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
2:24	scu6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	οὐκ ἔχουσιν τὴν διδαχὴν ταύτην	1	Here, **teaching** is an abstract noun that your readers might misunderstand without the use of a verbal phrase. If this abstract noun would confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly with a verb. Alternate translation: “do not hold to what she teaches” or “do not believe what she teaches” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:24	d5i9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τὰ βαθέα	1	Here, the adjective **deep** describes matters that that the disciples of Jezebel consider to be profound and very important. The adherents to Jezebel’s instruction kept this type of subject matter secret which they also thought to be **deep** in the sense of important or profound. Alternate translation: “the secret things” or “the profound matters” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:24	y2t5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τὰ βαθέα τοῦ Σατανᾶ	1	Jesus is using the possessive form to describe **the deep things** that Satan supposedly taught the disciples of Jezebel. If this is not clear in your language, you could say the meaning explicitly with a verb. Alternate translation: “the deep things that Satan revealed to them” or “the deep things that Satan taught them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
2:24	sgil		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	οὐ βάλλω ἐφ’ ὑμᾶς ἄλλο βάρος	1	Here, to **put any other burden** literally translates as “to throw another heavy load” onto someone to carry in a metaphorical manner. The phrase is an idiom for requiring another difficult command or burdensome order that one must perform besides already existing commands. If this might confuse your readers, you could use an equivalent expression or explicit language. Alternate translation: “I do not place any other burden on you” or “I do not impose any other burden upon you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
2:24	ikkh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-exceptions	οὐ βάλλω ἐφ’ ὑμᾶς ἄλλο βάρος	1	Here, **other** refers to the phrase “what you have” in the next verse. In other words, Jesus is saying that he will not give these people any additional command beyond what they already have from him. If this is confusing or if it would appear in your language that Jesus was making a statement here and then contradicting it in the next verse, you could connect these ideas in a different way. If you do this, you will need to delete the word “However” in the next verse. Alternate translation: “the only burden I will put on you is this:” or “I will only burden you with obeying what I have already commanded you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-exceptions]])
2:25	tfzk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πλὴν ὃ ἔχετε	1	Here, **what you have** refers to the commands that Jesus has already given to the believers in Thyatira. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “the commands that I have already given to you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:25	vgxm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	κρατήσατε	1	See how you translated the verb to **hold on tightly to** in [Revelation 2:13](../02/13.md) (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

For the metaphorical expression **one who conquers** that occurs often in chapters two and three of the book of Revelation (see Revelation 2:7, 11, 17, 26; 3:5, 12, 21), please see the explanatory note for this generic noun phrase **one who conquers** in the chapter two introduction. Alternate translation: “anyone who conquers” or “all who conquer” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])
2:26	aiws		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	τηρῶν	1	See how you translated this word in [Revelation 1:3](../01/03.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
2:26	v2e0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τὰ ἔργα μου	1	Here, **my works** does not refer to the things that Jesus does, but rather, it refers to the things he orders his disciples to do. If this is not clear in your language, you could say the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “the works that I give to you” or “the works that I require of you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
2:27	c9gu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks	καὶ ποιμανεῖ αὐτοὺς ἐν ῥάβδῳ σιδηρᾷ, ὡς τὰ σκεύη τὰ κεραμικὰ συντρίβεται	1	This entire verse is a loose citation or paraphrase of Psalm 2:8-9 in the Old Testament. The passage of Psalm 2:8-9 describes God promising to give the king of Israel authority over the entire world and its peoples. However, Jesus applies the passage of Psalm 2:8-9 here to those to whom he gives authority over all peoples and nations. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate that verse 2:27 is a quotation by setting off all of the words with quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
2:27	e5kc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ποιμανεῖ αὐτοὺς ἐν ῥάβδῳ σιδηρᾷ	1	Here, **he will shepherd them with a rod of iron** expresses a metaphor that describes a king’s rule as if the king were a shepherd that punishes wrong with the threat of using an iron rod or staff. The symbol of an iron rod or staff indicates a rule that is so complete that the rule dominates all opposition to one’s dominion or power. If your readers would not understand what it means to rule as a shepherd with an iron rod, you could use an equivalent metaphor or idiom from your culture. Alternate translation: “he will rule them like a shepherd with a rod of iron” or “he will govern with a rod of iron” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:27	ksl1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	ὡς τὰ σκεύη τὰ κεραμικὰ συντρίβεται	1	Here, breaking **jars of clay** to **pieces** is a simile that represents either: (1) destroying people who do wicked acts, or (2) defeating enemies who oppose the rule of Jesus. If this expression would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent comparison or express this meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “as jars of clay are smashed into pieces” or “as jars of clay are shattered to pieces” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
2:27	w8pp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	συντρίβεται	1	Here, **are broken into pieces** expresses a passive sense in the passive form. If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “he will break them into pieces” or “he will smash them into pieces” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2:28	n9ts		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὡς κἀγὼ εἴληφα παρὰ τοῦ πατρός μου	1	Here, some languages may need to know what was **received**. This could mean: (1) he received **authority** from his Father. (2) He received the morning star from his Father. The second option is most likely, as reflected in the UST rendition of this verse. If such ambiguity might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “as I also have received power from my Father” or “as I also have received dominion from my Father” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:28	hr39		rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	τοῦ πατρός μου	1	Here, **my Father** is an important title for God that describes the relationship between God and Jesus. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
2:28	g5iy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage	τὸν ἀστέρα τὸν πρωϊνόν	1	Here, **the morning star** represents a **star** that appears just before dawn and early in the **morning**. It was a symbol of victory since the context suggests that those who are victorious with Jesus shall rule with the authority of Jesus as victors. There is much debate as to what the symbol of **the morning star** means or signifies for the believer that is victorious with Jesus. This symbol could mean: (1) Lucifer or Satan, (2) the resurrection of a believer, (3) the King of Babylon, (4) the planet Venus as a symbol of victory, (5) the eternal life of the righteous, (6) the Holy Spirit, (7) Jesus Christ Himself, or (8) a symbolic image that represents the future rule of the believers and the righteous in the kingdom of Jesus.

2:29	y6m4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	τὸ Πνεῦμα	1	Here, **the Spirit** most likely refers to God’s Spirit, or simply the Holy Spirit of God’s triune nature, in contrast to the spirit of the writer or author which one finds in [Revelation 1:10](../01/10.md). In other words, the Holy Spirit addresses the messages and contents of each letter written to each of the seven churches which are addressed in chapters two and three (see Revelation 2:7, 11, 17, 29: 3:6, 13, 22). See the chapter introductions for chapter two and for chapter three to read this same same explanatory note. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
3:intro	q1l9				0	# Revelation 3 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n### Outline of Chapters Two and Three of Revelation\n\nI. The Current Condition of the Churches (2:1-3:22)\n\nA. The Letter to Ephesus (2:1-7)\n\nB. The Letter to Smyrna (2:8-11)\n\nC. The Letter to Pergamum (2:12-17)\n\nD. The Letter to Thyatira (2:18-29)\n\nE. The Letter to Sardis (3:1-6)\n\nF. The Letter to Philadelphia (3:7-13)\n\nG. The Letter to Laodicea (3:14-22)\n\nChapters 2 and 3 together are usually called the “seven letters to the seven churches.” You may wish to set each letter apart. The reader can then easily see that they are separate letters.\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with verse 7.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### The personal knowledge that Jesus expresses about the churches\n\nJesus uses the phrase **I know** to express his personal familiarity and knowledge at times of some of the churches mentioned in Revelation chapters two and three. The phrase **I know** is an idiom for expressing knowledge of the present situation and the types of circumstances that the Christians experienced among the various churches mentioned in chapters two and three of the book of Revelation. The idiomatic expression **I know** indicates an assurance that Jesus understands the current conditions or circumstances in which the Christians were living. Although usually positive in a tone of assurance (see Revelation 2:2,9,13,19; 3:8), the phrase **I know** sometimes expresses a critical or negative assessment that Jesus affirms (see Revelation 3:1,15). Thus, the expression **I know** affirms more than simply a knowledge of circumstances on the part of Jesus, but the phrase also asserts a claim to be in a position to make a valid judgment as an impartial arbiter who might be critical at times. Therefore, the translator may wish to provide for his readership a textual note that explains the phrase **I know** as meaning something more than simply the awareness that Jesus has of the current religious, social, and moral conditions for the Christians which are addressed by Jesus (see Revelation chapters two and three). Alternate translation: “I am aware of the fact that” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])\n\n### The use of the second person singular to refer to a plural group of people\n\nThe second person pronouns and the second person individuals addressed throughout chapters two and three of the book of Revelation are often singular in their number, but they are plural in their references. Technically, every message to each of the seven churches mentioned in Revelation chapters two and three are addressed to a singular, individual **angel**, so that one would naturally expect singular references in the language of the letters. Thus, many of the second person references in the verbs and the pronouns, although singular in their literal sense, are plural in their implied references to the believers of the church that receives the message in the letter. If the singular form of the second person address and the second person verbal references would not be natural in your language, then perhaps the translator could use the plural forms of the second person, or “you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd]])\n\n### Seven spirits of God\n\nThese spirits are the seven spirits of [Revelation 1:4](../rev/01/04.md).\n\n### Seven stars\n\nThese stars are the seven stars of [Revelation 1:20](../rev/01/20.md).\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### Look, I am standing at the door and am knocking\n\nJesus speaks of his desire to have the Christians in Laodicea obey him as if he were a man asking people in a house to allow him to enter and eat with them ([Revelation 3:20](../rev/03/20.md)). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n### “Let the one who has an ear hear”\n\nJesus is emphasizing that what he has just said is important and may take some effort to understand and put into practice. Here, the phrase **has an ear** presents a metonym for the willingness to understand and obey by association with the part of the body in which his listeners would have been receiving his teaching. Alternate translation: “Let the one who is willing to listen, listen to” or “The one who is willing to understand, let him understand and obey” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])\n\nSince Jesus is speaking directly to his audience, you may prefer to use the second person here. Alternate translation: “If you are willing to listen, then listen to” or “If you are willing to understand, then understand” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])\n\n### “what the Spirit says to the churches”\n\nHere, **the Spirit** most likely refers to God’s Spirit, or simply the Holy Spirit of God’s triune nature, in contrast to the spirit of the writer or author which one finds in [Revelation 1:10](../01/10.md). In other words, the Holy Spirit addresses the messages and contents of each letter written to each of the seven churches which are addressed in chapters two and three (see Revelation 2:7, 11, 17, 29: 3:6, 13, 22). See the chapter introductions for chapter two and for chapter three to read this same same explanatory note. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### “The angel of the church”\n\nThe word **angel** here can also mean “messenger” or “representative.” This might refer to the messenger or a representative leader of the church. See how you translated **angel** in [Revelation 1:20](../rev/01/20.md).\n\n### “Says these things”\n\nThe verses with the phrase **says these things** can be difficult to translate. They do not make complete sentences. You may need to add “These are” to the beginning of these sentences. Jesus uses these words to speak of himself as if he were speaking of another person. Your language may not allow people to speak of themselves as if they were speaking of other people. Jesus began speaking in [Revelation 1:17](../rev/01/17.md). He continues to speak through the end of Chapter 3. The phrase **says these things** indicates that the words that come after this expression are a direct quotation. Use a phrase that makes this clear in your language. Alternate translation: “says this message” or “says the following words” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])\n\n### “the one who conquers”\n\nThe expression **the one who conquers** refers to anyone who is victorious by overcoming difficulties in the Christian life (see Revelation 2:7, 11, 17, 26; 3:5, 12, 21). The expression represents a metaphor comparing the Christian life to a military battle, in which the Christian overcomes the forces of evil and any difficult obstacles in warfare. Alternate translation: “the one who wins the victory” or “the one who overcomes” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\nThe expression **the one who conquers** refers to anyone who is victorious by overcoming difficulties in the Christian life. The generic noun phrase **the one who conquers** occurs in Revelation chapters two and three often (see Revelation 2:7, 11, 17, 26; 3:5, 12, 21). The expression is not specific to any one person, but can be applied to a plural entity or group of people. If the generic noun phrase would be misunderstood in your language, use a more natural phrase such as turning the singular word into a plural group reference. Alternate translation: “anyone who has the victory” or “those who have the victory” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])
3:1	k6b7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	καὶ τῷ ἀγγέλῳ τῆς ἐν Σάρδεσιν ἐκκλησίας γράψον	1	# General Information:\n\nThis is the beginning of the message to the angel of the church in **Sardis**. **Sardis** is the name of one of the seven churches, or seven assemblies of believers, which existed in southwestern Asia Minor when John wrote the book of Revelation. See how you translated this in [Revelation 1:11](../01/11.md) (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

3:1	un3c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage	τὰ ἑπτὰ πνεύματα	1	The number **seven** is a symbol of completeness and perfection. The **seven spirits** refers either to the Spirit of God or to seven spirits which serve God. See how you translated this in [Revelation 1:4](../01/04.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage]])
3:1	lpfk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	οἶδά σου τὰ ἔργα	1	See how you translated the clause **I know your works** in [Revelation 2:2](../02/02.md). Alternate translation: “I am aware of what you have done” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
3:1	xtk2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ὄνομα ἔχεις	1	Here, **name** is a metonym for the person who possesses the name. Essentially, the **name** represents the reputation of the person who has the name. See how you translated **name** in [Revelation 2:3](../02/03.md). Alternate translation: “you have a stature” or “you have a fame” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
3:1	ty18		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ζῇς, καὶ νεκρὸς εἶ	1	Here, being **alive** is a metaphor for obeying and honoring God. However, being **dead** is a metaphor for disobeying and dishonoring God. In other words, honoring God is spoken of as being **alive**, while, on the other hand, disobeying and dishonoring God is described as being **dead**. If these expressions of a spiritual condition would confuse your readers, you could say the meaning of the metaphors plainly. Alternate translation: “you are obedient, but you are disobedient” or “you honor me, but you dishonor me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:2	l7qg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	γίνου γρηγορῶν	1	Here, the command to **wake up** is a metaphor for the state of being alert or actively vigilant. In other words, being watchful or alert and vigilant is described by the action of waking up from sleep. If your readers would not understand what it means to **wake up** in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “Be alert!” or “Be awarel” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:2	d8cw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	στήρισον τὰ λοιπὰ, ἃ ἔμελλον ἀποθανεῖν	1	Here, the **deeds** which the believers do are the same **works** mentioned in the previous verse. These **deeds** which the believers in Sardis do are described as if they were alive and also in danger of dying. Thus, **deeds** are referred to as if they were living persons or humans who live and die. If this figure of speech of personification might be confusing for your readers, you could express this meaning in a non-figurative or explicit way. Alternate translation: “complete the work that remains, which is about to prove futile” or “finish the work that remains, which is about to prove useless” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
3:2	ja1g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	σου τὰ ἔργα	1	See how you translated this word **your deeds** in [Revelation 2:2](../02/02.md). Alternate translation: “your works” or “your actions” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
3:2	jq58		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	Θεοῦ μου	1	Jesus is using the possessive form to describe the **God** that Jesus possesses or claims has his own God. If this is not clear in your language, you could sasy the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “the God I serve” or “the God I worship” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
3:3	wcs4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πῶς εἴληφας καὶ ἤκουσας	1	Here, this phrase **what you have received and heard** refers to God’s word or the teaching of God’s word which the believers had received and heard. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “God’s word that you received and heard” or “the truth that you received and heard” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:3	e324		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	τήρει	1	See how you translated this word in [Revelation 1:3](../01/03.md) and in [Revelation 2:26](../02/26.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
3:3	gwk8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐὰν & μὴ γρηγορήσῃς	1	Being alert to danger is spoken of as waking up in a metaphorical sense. See how you translated “wake up” in the previous verse. Alternate translation: “If you are not alert” or “If you are not careful” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:3	ypw4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	ἥξω ὡς κλέπτης	1	Here, Jesus will **come** at a time when people do not expect him, just as a **thief** comes when he is not expected. The unexpected nature of the arrival of a thief is also explained in the following clause of this verse. However, if this simile would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent comparison or express the meaning in a nonfigurative way. Alternate translation: “I will come unexpectedly” or “I will come without warning” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
3:4	bpg5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd	ἀλλὰ ἔχεις	1	The second person pronouns and the second person individuals addressed throughout this verse and throughout chapters two and three are often singular in their number, but they are plural in their references. See how you translated the second person pronouns and the second person individuals referenced in [Revelation 2:2](../02/02.md). Alternate translation: “But there are a few of you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd]])
3:4	fy7f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ὀλίγα ὀνόματα	1	Here, the word **names** represent the people themselves as a metonym for the persons. If your readers would not understand this, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “a few people” or “a few persons” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
3:4	imsu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	οὐκ ἐμόλυναν τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτῶν	1	Here, Jesus describes sins in a believer’s life as if they were dirty **clothes**. This figure of speech is a metaphor for how sin pollutes the life of a believer. Thus, to be holy or sacred to God relates to the imagery of what one wears as clothing or garments. If your readers do not understand what it means to be **stained** in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning in a nonfigurative way. Alternate translation: “have not made dirty their clothes” or “have not polluted their clothes” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:4	x2if		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οὐκ ἐμόλυναν τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτῶν	1	Here, Jesus describes sins in a believer’s life as if they were dirty **clothes**. The metaphor may be stated positively or negatively. Here, the original Greek phrase is negative, as in they **have not stained their clothes**. However, one can state this same idea positively to make the meaning explicit. If your language does not use the negative language of this form, you can state this in the positive form or in another way that makes the meaning explicit. Alternate translation: “have kept their clothes clean” or “who have kept themselves pure” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:4	x48r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	περιπατήσουσιν μετ’ ἐμοῦ	1	Here, the word to **walk** is a idiomatic expression that describes life or living. People commonly spoke of living as a **walk**. If your readers do not understand what the idiom means in this context, you could use an equivalent idiom from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning of the idiom in a nonfigurative or plain way. Alternate translation: “they will live with me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
3:4	w5t9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐν λευκοῖς	1	Clothes that are **white** represent a pure life without sin. The color of **white** also represents victory in eternal life, as stated in the next verse. If your readers do not understand what it means to be **white** in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning in a nonfigurative or plain way. Alternate translation: “in purity” or “in victory” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:5	v69e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	ὁ νικῶν	1	See how you translated this generic noun phrase in [Revelation 2:7](../02/07.md). For the metaphorical expression **one who conquers** that occurs often in chapters two and three of the book of Revelation (see Revelation 2:7, 11, 17, 26; 3:5, 12, 21), please see the explanatory note for this generic noun phrase **one who conquers** in the chapter two introduction. Alternate translation: “anyone who conquers” or “all who conquer” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])
3:5	w5k4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	περιβαλεῖται ἐν ἱματίοις λευκοῖς	1	Here, one can translate the passive verb **clothed** as an active verb in contrast to the passive voice. If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “will wear white clothes” or “will dress themselves in white clothes” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
3:5	hmy4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	λευκοῖς	1	See how you translated this metaphor of the color **white** in the previous verse. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:5	wn1x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	οὐ μὴ ἐξαλείψω τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ	1	Here, **I will certainly not wipe his name out** refers to a denial of ever deleting, erasing, removing, blotting out, or wiping out a name in any way. Here, the translator should translate the idea of wiping out with whatever verb is most naturally applied to the process of removing someone’s name from a book or list of some sort. If your readers would not understand this idiom, you could use an equivalent idiom or use plain language. Alternate translation: “I will certainly not delete his name out” or “I will certainly not remove his name” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
3:5	yyu5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ὁμολογήσω τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ	1	Here **I will confess his name** does not simply mean that Jesus will say the name of the person. Rather, the expression means that Jesus will announce that he possesses the person. In other words, Jesus will proclaim that the person belongs to Jesus himself. Here, **his name** refers to the person himself by the figure of a metonym. If your readers would not understand this metonym, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “I will announce that he belongs to me” or “I will acknowledge that he is mine” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
3:5	bi3h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	τοῦ Πατρός μου	1	Here, **Father** is an important title for God that describes the relationship between God and Jesus in the trinity. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
3:5	q22s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τῶν ἀγγέλων αὐτοῦ	1	See how you translated **angel** in [Revelation 1:20](../01/20.md) (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

3:6	i49v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	τὸ Πνεῦμα	1	Here, **the Spirit** most likely refers to God’s Spirit, or simply the Holy Spirit of God’s triune nature, in contrast to the spirit of the writer or author which one finds in [Revelation 1:10](../01/10.md). In other words, the Holy Spirit addresses the messages and contents of each letter written to each of the seven churches which are addressed in chapters two and three (see Revelation 2:7, 11, 17, 29: 3:6, 13, 22). See the chapter introductions for chapter two and for chapter three to read this same same explanatory note. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
3:7	rf9b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	καὶ τῷ ἀγγέλῳ τῆς ἐν Φιλαδελφίᾳ ἐκκλησίας γράψον	1	# General Information:\n\nThis is the beginning of the message to the angel of the church in **Philadelphia**. **Philadelphia** is the name of one of the seven churches, or seven assemblies of believers, which existed in southwestern Asia Minor when John wrote the book of Revelation. See how you translated this in [Revelation 1:11](../01/11.md) (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
3:7	ksg4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τῷ ἀγγέλῳ	1	See how you translated **angel** in [Revelation 1:20](../01/20.md) (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:7	xarn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	τάδε λέγει	1	See how you translated the phrase **says these things** in [Revelation 2:1](../02/01.md) (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
3:7	ih6i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage	τὴν κλεῖν Δαυείδ	1	Here, **the key** is a symbol of authority, power, or ability to control something, which, in this case, is the Messiah’s kingdom of King David. Jesus speaks of his authority as the Messiah to decide who may enter into his kingdom as if he possessed the key that King of David had to open and close the city gates of Jerusalem. The symbolic imagery of Jesus having keys for his kingdom occurs also in [Matthew 16:19](../16/19.md). As the translator, you should not make the meaning of the figure explicit or attempt to specify the meaning of the symbolism beyond the plain or simple figure of the symbolic language. Alternate translation: “the key of David’s authority” or “the key of David’s kingdom” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage]])
3:7	aam6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	ὁ ἀνοίγων καὶ οὐδεὶς κλείσει, καὶ κλείων καὶ οὐδεὶς ἀνοίγει	1	Here, the phrase **the one who opens and no will shut, and he shuts and no one opens** expresses the authority, power, or ability to control the kingdom of King David by means of a merism. This merism lists the two opposite, extreme actions of authority by the analogy of opening and closing a door with a key, which are the the only two possibilities for action with a door. Jesus speaks of his authority as the Messiah to decide who may enter into his kingdom as if he possessed the key that King of David had to open and close the city gates of Jerusalem. The symbolic imagery of King David having a key for his kingdom to open and close doors also occurs in [Isaiah 22:22](../22/22.md). If this merism would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “the one who opens and no one can shut, and he shuts and no one can open” or “the one who opens and no one may shut, and he shuts and no one may open” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
3:8	k48c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	οἶδά σου τὰ ἔργα	1	See how you translated the clause **I know your works** in [Revelation 2:2](../02/02.md). Alternate translation: “I am aware of what you have done” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
3:8	t5hn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	See how you translated **Behold** in [Revelation 1:7](../01/07.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:8	j1x7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage	δέδωκα ἐνώπιόν σου θύραν ἠνεῳγμένην	1	Here, **an open door** represents a symbolic figure for an opportunity for service or for proclamation of the gospel message. The language may also indicate a symbolic figure for a free entrance into the kingdom of Jesus the Messiah to the readers of the letter. As the translator, you should not make the meaning of the figure explicit or attempt to specify the meaning of the symbolism beyond the plain or simple figure of the symbolic language. Alternate translation: “I have set before you an open door” or “I have placed before you an open door” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage]])
3:8	vp9n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage	ἣν οὐδεὶς δύναται κλεῖσαι αὐτήν	1	See how you translated the word here **to shut** and the symbolic language of this clause in the previous verse. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage]])
3:8	h90i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	μικρὰν ἔχεις δύναμιν	1	Here, the phrase **you have little power** is an idiomatic expression that describes the social status of the believers as a community in Philadelphia. The Philadelphia assembly of believers had little influence or little social prestige in their community there in Philadelphia. As an idiomatic expression, one could say that the Philadelphia assembly had little power in their community or social context in the city of Philadelphia. If your readers do not understand what the idiom means in this context, you could use an equivalent idiom from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning of the idiom in a nonfigurative or plain way. Alternate translation: “you have little prestige” or “you do not have much power” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
3:8	xyw6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐτήρησάς	1	See how you translated this word in [Revelation 1:3](../01/03.md) and in [Revelation 2:26](../02/26.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
3:8	wsws		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	μου τὸν λόγον	1	Jesus is using the possessive form to describe the **word** or words that he spoke when he taught the believers in the city of Philadelphia. If this is not clear in your language, you could say the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “the word that I spoke” or “my teaching” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
3:8	b3kz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τὸ ὄνομά μου	1	Here, **my name** is a metonym for the person who has that name, which in this case, is Jesus. If your readers would not understand this metonym, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “me” or “the name that I have” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
3:9	vfkb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ & ἰδοὺ	1	See how you translated **Behold** in [Revelation 1:7](../01/07.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:9	x78m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	συναγωγῆς τοῦ Σατανᾶ	1	Here, people who gather to obey or to honor **Satan** are spoken of as if they were in a **synagogue**. A **synagogue** is a place of worship and teaching for the Jewish people. See how you translated this same phrase in [Revelation 2:9](../02/09.md). In that verse and its context Jesus also declares there that certain Jewish people were not acting like true Jews as the representative people of God. The translator should retain here in this verse the metaphor and simply define the figure of speech of a **synagogue of Satan** in an explanatory note. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:9	q496		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	προσκυνήσουσιν	1	Here, to **bow down** in front of a person’s feet represents a sign of submission. Thus, the action of bowing down is not a symbolic gesture that figuratively expresses worship. On the contrary, the gesture of bowing down symbolizes respect or obeisance. If there is a gesture with similar meaning in your culture, you could consider using it here in your translation. Alternate translation: “bow down in submission” or “prostrate themselves” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
3:9	ah4w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	ἐνώπιον τῶν ποδῶν σου	1	Here, **feet** represents the person or the people before whom these individuals from the **synagogue of Satan** bow down. If this figure of speech of synecdoche would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your culture or plain language. Alternate translation: “before you” or “to you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
3:10	f9vi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐτήρησας & τηρήσω	1	See how you translated this word in [Revelation 1:3](../01/03.md) and in [Revelation 2:26](../02/26.md) for the meaning of the first instance of the word in this verse. However, the second instance of this word in this verse has a special sense of keeping someone safe or protected from something that will cause harm or injury to them. Thus, there is a wordplay between two senses of keeping within this verse in this case here. The translator should attempt to maintain the wordplay in his translation of both instances of the word in this verse, as the UST maintains in this verse and its context. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
3:10	k8mb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τὸν λόγον τῆς ὑπομονῆς μου	1	Jesus is using the possessive form to describe the **word** or command that he spoke when he taught the believers in the city of Philadelphia. If this is not clear in your language, you could say the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “the word that I spoke about steadfastness” or “my teaching on steadfastness” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
3:10	y577		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τῆς ὑπομονῆς	1	If your readers would misunderstand the abstract noun **steadfastness**, you can express it with the verb “to endure.” See how you translated this word in [Revelation 1:9](../01/09.md) and in [Revelation 2:2](../02/02.md). Alternate translation: “to suffer patiently” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
3:10	ql9y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	τῆς ὥρας	1	The translator may wish to explain that **hour** is not sixty minutes. Rather, the **hour** is a moment of time, or a time period, of testing. If this idiom is not clear in your language, then you could say the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “the time” or “the moment” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
3:10	gv5g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τῆς ὥρας τοῦ πειρασμοῦ	1	Jesus is using the possessive form to describe the **hour** as a time when God tests all of the world. The subject of **testing** is God who tests all people during the **hour** of great suffering. If it is not clear in your language that God is the one who tests the world, then you could say the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “the hour when God tests” or “the hour of God’s testing” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
3:10	e6bw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τῆς μελλούσης ἔρχεσθαι	1	Here, **to come** describes future being or existence. If your readers would not understand what it means for future existence **to come**, then you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning in a nonfigurative way. Alternative translation: “that will occur” or “that is about to be” or “that is about to exist” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:11	ih12		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἔρχομαι ταχύ	1	Here, **coming quickly** implies an arrival of Jesus to judge. It is understood that Jesus is **coming** in order to judge. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate the implicit meaning in an explicit way. Alternate translation: “I am coming to judge quickly” or “I am coming to judge soon” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:11	n9a9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	κράτει ὃ ἔχεις	1	See how you translated the verb to **Hold fast to** in [Revelation 2:13](../02/13.md) (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
3:11	a4m5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τὸν στέφανόν	1	Here, **crown** stands for a reward or a victory prize. See how you translated **crown** in [Revelation 2:10](../02/10.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:12	px36		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	ὁ νικῶν	1	See how you translated this generic noun phrase in [Revelation 2:7](../02/07.md). For the metaphorical expression **one who conquers** that occurs often in chapters two and three of the book of Revelation (see Revelation 2:7, 11, 17, 26; 3:5, 12, 21), please see the explanatory note for this generic noun phrase **one who conquers** in the chapter two introduction. Alternate translation: “anyone who conquers” or “all who conquer” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])
3:12	xiwx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ποιήσω αὐτὸν στῦλον ἐν τῷ ναῷ τοῦ Θεοῦ μου	1	Jesus is speaking of victorious believers as if they were a **pillar** in the temple of God. Here, a **pillar** represents an important and permanent part of God’s kingdom. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I will make him strong, like a pillar in the temple of my God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:12	k7dy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	γράψω ἐπ’ αὐτὸν τὸ ὄνομα τοῦ Θεοῦ μου, καὶ τὸ ὄνομα τῆς πόλεως τοῦ Θεοῦ μου	1	The idiom of writing a name on an object or person usually indicates possession. Thus, this expression likely refers to the idea that the believers indicated here belong to Jesus or God. Likewise, **the name of the city** probably refers to the idea that the believers here are citizens of God's city of Jerusalem. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I will write on him God's name, the name of my God's city” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
3:12	ljn7			τὸ ὄνομά μου τὸ καινόν	1	Here, **my new name** may have a few possible references. The new name could be the "Lamb" of [Revelation 5:6](../05/06.md), or the "Word of God" of [Revelation 19:12](../19/12.md), or the "King of kings and Lord of lords" of [Revelation 19:16](../19/16.md). It is difficult to know precisely what name, if any, is being referenced by the expression **my new name** specifically.

3:13	cm7r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	τὸ Πνεῦμα	1	Here, **the Spirit** most likely refers to God’s Spirit, or simply the Holy Spirit of God’s triune nature, in contrast to the spirit of the writer or author which one finds in [Revelation 1:10](../01/10.md). In other words, the Holy Spirit addresses the messages and contents of each letter written to each of the seven churches which are addressed in chapters two and three (see Revelation 2:7, 11, 17, 29: 3:6, 13, 22). See the chapter introductions for chapter two and for chapter three to read this same same explanatory note. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

3:14	f65v			ὁ Ἀμήν	1	Here, **The Amen** is a name for Jesus Christ. Jesus confirms or guarantees God’s promises and plans by saying **Amen** to them. See how you translated the term **Amen** in [1:6](../01/06.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate]])

3:14	btv1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἡ ἀρχὴ τῆς κτίσεως τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Here, **the beginning of the creation of God** could refer to: (1) the one who rules over everything that God created. (2) the one through whom God created everything. The meaning is not that Jesus is the first being that God created, but that Jesus rules over everything and is the one by means of whom God created all things.

Here, **cold** and **hot** could: (1) represent two extremes of spiritual interest or love for God, where “cold” is to be completely against God, and to be “hot” is to be zealous to serve him. (2) both refer to water that is useful for drinking or for cooking or healing, respectively. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “you are like water that is neither cold nor hot” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

Alternate translation: “I will reject you as I would spit out lukewarm water” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:17	r8l2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	πλούσιός εἰμι, καὶ πεπλούτηκα, καὶ οὐδὲν χρείαν ἔχω	1	Jesus speaks of their spiritual condition as if he were speaking about their physical condition.

The **gold refined by fire** represents spiritual wealth. The **brilliant white garments** represents righteousness. And the **salve to anoint your eyes** represents the ability to understand spiritual things. Alternate translation: “to come to me and receive spiritual wealth, which is more valuable than gold that is refined by fire. Receive from me righteousness, which is like brilliant white garments, so that you will not be ashamed. And receive from me wisdom, which is like salve for the eyes, so that you may understand spiritual things” (See: rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor)
3:18	yxwq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τῆς γυμνότητός σου	1	Here, **nakedness** is a metaphor for the shame of a lack of spirituality in the assembly, as also described with other metaphors in [Revelation 3:17](../03/17.md).

3:20	i7gy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἕστηκα ἐπὶ τὴν θύραν καὶ κρούω	1	Jesus speaks about wanting people to relate to him as if he desires them to invite him into their home.

If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. \nAlternate translation: “I am like one standing at the door and knocking” \n(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:20	sr5y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	κρούω	1	When people want someone to welcome them into their home, they **knock** on the door. Thus, Jesus knocking on the door of a believer's home represents a symbolic action to show that Jesus seeks admission into the heart of a believer and/or into the hearts of the believers comprising the assemby of saints. If this would not be clear to your readers, you can explain the significance of this action. Alternate translation: “I want you to let me come inside” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
3:20	m6n2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἀκούσῃ τῆς φωνῆς μου	1	Here, **my voice** refers to Christ speaking.

3:20	di8q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	καὶ εἰσελεύσομαι πρὸς αὐτὸν	1	In a context such as this, your language might prefer the verb “go” here. Alternate translation: “I will indeed go into his home” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])
3:20	une1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	καὶ δειπνήσω μετ’ αὐτοῦ	1	Here, **eat with him** represents being together as friends.

Alternate translation: “anyone who conquers” or “all who conquer” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])
3:21	h40e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	δώσω αὐτῷ	1	This expression refers to the permission of Jesus for the believer to take the privileges of a victory. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I will allow him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
3:21	mn2c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	καθίσαι μετ’ ἐμοῦ ἐν τῷ θρόνῳ μου	1	To **sit down** on a **throne** means to rule as an expression of metonymy association with a king's throne.

3:22	vnr6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	τὸ Πνεῦμα	1	Here, **the Spirit** most likely refers to God’s Spirit, or simply the Holy Spirit of God’s triune nature, in contrast to the spirit of the writer or author which one finds in [Revelation 1:10](../01/10.md). In other words, the Holy Spirit addresses the messages and contents of each letter written to each of the seven churches which are addressed in chapters two and three (see Revelation 2:7, 11, 17, 29: 3:6, 13, 22). See the chapter introductions for chapter two and for chapter three to read this same same explanatory note. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
4:intro	cl9f				0	# Revelation 4 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n### Outline of Chapter Four of Revelation within 4:1-8:1\n\nThe Unrolling of the Seven-sealed Scroll (4:1-8:1)\n\nI. A Vision of God in Heaven (4:1-5:14)\n\nA. God Sitting on the Throne in Heaven (4:1-11)\nB. The Seven-sealed Scroll in Heaven that Jesus Takes (5:1-14)\n\nII. The Seven Seals (6:1-8:1)\n\nA. The Unrolling of the First Seal (6:1-2)\nB. The Unrolling of the Second Seal (6:3-4)\nC. The Unrolling of the Third Seal (6:5-6)\nD. The Unrolling of the Fourth Seal (6:7-8)\nE. The Unrolling of the Fifth Seal (6:9-11)\nF. The Unrolling of the Sixth Seal (6:12-17)\n   1. The Servants of God (7:1-17)\n      a. The Servants of God on Earth (7:1-8)\n      b. The Servants of God in Heaven (7:9-17)\nG. The Unrolling of the Seventh Seal (8:1)\n\n\nJohn has finished describing the letters to the churches. He now begins in chapter four of Revelation to describe a vision that God showed him. In chapter four of Revelation John has a vision of God sitting on his throne in heaven.\n \nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with verses 8 and 11.\n\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Trumpet\n\nA **trumpet** is a instrument for producing music or for calling people to gather together for an announcement or meeting. See how you translated **trumpet** in [Revelation 1:10](../01/10.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])\n\n### Throne\n\nSee how you translated **throne** in [Revelation 1:4](../01/04.md). John does not specify to the reader that it is God who is sitting on the throne. However, later in the book John does specify that God is the one sitting on the throne (see 7:10, 15; 12:5; and 19:4).\n\n### Crown\n\nSee how you translated the word "crown" in [Revelation 2:10](../02/10.md).\n\n### Jasper, carnelian, and emerald\n\nThese words refer to kinds of special stones that the people in John’s day considered valuable. It may be difficult for you to translate these words if people in your culture do not value special kinds of stones.\n\n### Twenty-four elders\n\nInterpreters debate the symbolic meaning of **24** as the number of the elders. The symbolic significance of the term **elders** is also debated, but it probably indicates the church or the people of God at the time that John wrote the book of Revelation. In this sense, the leaders of the church represent the church or the believers that comprise the church. There were twelve tribes in Old Testament Israel and twelve apostles in the New Testament church. Alternate translation: “24 church leaders” or “24 older saints” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage]])\n\n### Seven spirits of God\n\nThese spirits are the seven spirits of [Revelation 1:4](../rev/01/04.md).\n\n### Four living creatures\n\nInterpreters debate what the symbolic significance of **four** and of **living creatures** precisely is. It is recommended that the translator keep the phrase literal and allow the symbolic significance to stand in the translation or rendition. Alternate translation: “four animate beings” or “four living things” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage]])\n\n### Giving glory to God\n\nGod’s glory is the great beauty and radiant majesty that God has because he is God. Other Bible writers describe it as if it were a light so bright that no one can look at it. No one can give God this kind of glory, because it is already his. When people give glory to God or when God receives glory, people say that God has the glory that is his, that it is right for God to have that glory, and that people should worship God because he has that glory. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/glory]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/worthy]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/worship]])\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### Difficult images\n\nSuch things as bolts of lightning coming from the throne, lamps that are spirits, and a sea in front of the throne may be difficult to imagine. The words for them may be difficult to translate. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-apocalyptic]])
4:1	vh4i			μετὰ ταῦτα	1	The expression **after these things** represents a formal way to close one event and to begin another event. Usually the phrase marks the beginning of new vision that John observes, thereby introducing a new section in the book. See how you translated this phrase in [Revelation 7:1](../07/01.md). The expression occurs also in Revelation 7:9; 15:5; 18:1; and 19:1. Alternate translation: “After I had just seen these things” or "After these thing had happened"
4:1	suqj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	See how you translated **behold** in [Revelation 1:7](../01/07.md). Here, it is more natural to avoid the usual “pay attention” in the UST.

4:1	z8r8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	θύρα ἠνεῳγμένη ἐν τῷ οὐρανῷ	1	The expression **open door in heaven** stands for the ability that God gave John to see into heaven, at least by means of a vision in John's spiritual state of mind.

4:2	utn2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor		1	See how you translated **throne** in [Revelation 1:4](../01/04.md). John does not specify to the reader that it is God who is sitting on the throne. However, later in the book John does specify that God is the one sitting on the throne (see 7:10, 15; 12:5; and 19:4).
4:3	m4mi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	λίθῳ, ἰάσπιδι καὶ σαρδίῳ	1	The terms **jasper** and **carnelian** refer to valuable stones. Jasper may have been clear like glass or crystal.

4:4	b695		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage	εἴκοσι τέσσαρας πρεσβυτέρους	1	Interpreters debate the symbolic meaning of **24** as the number of the elders. The symbolic significance of the term **elders** is also debated, but it probably indicates the church or the people of God at the time that John wrote the book of Revelation.

4:5	u1da			φωναὶ, καὶ βρονταί	1	Here, **rumblings** are the loud noises that thunder makes. Use your language’s way of describing the sound of thunder.
4:5	e1jm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage	τὰ ἑπτὰ πνεύματα τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	The number **seven** is a symbol of completeness and perfection. The **seven spirits** refers either to the Spirit of God or to seven spirits who serve God. See how you translated this in [Revelation 1:4](../01/04.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage]])
4:6	droz			τοῦ θρόνου	1	See how you translated **throne** in [Revelation 1:4](../01/04.md). John does not specify to the reader that it is God who is sitting on the throne. However, later in the book John does specify that God is the one sitting on the throne (see 7:10, 15; 12:5; and 19:4).
4:6	ja33		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	θάλασσα ὑαλίνη	1	If your readers would misunderstand this simile, you can state how it was like **glass** or a **sea**. This could mean: (1) a sea is spoken of as if it were glass. Alternate translation: “a sea that was as smooth as glass” (2) glass is spoken of as if it were a sea. Alternate translation: “glass that was spread out like a sea”\n(See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
4:6	cv9p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	ὁμοία κρυστάλλῳ	1	If your readers would misunderstand this simile, you can state how it was **like crystal**. Alternate translation: “clear as crystal” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
4:6	fr7x			ἐν μέσῳ τοῦ θρόνου καὶ κύκλῳ τοῦ θρόνου	1	The description for the location of the **four living creatures** is difficult to understand. Most likely, the **four living creatures** are standing next to the throne, each one of them on each of the four sides respectively. Then, around the **four living creatures** the 24 elders are all sitting on thrones. Alternate translation: “immediately around the throne” or “close to the throne and around it”
4:6	b66k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage	τέσσαρα ζῷα	1	Interpreters debate what the symbolic significance of **four** and of **living creatures** precisely is.

John now sees Jesus as the Lamb. In chapter five of Revelation the Lamb takes a scroll that is sealed with seven seals or takes a scroll that is sealed with seven pieces of wax or seals.\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this in verses 9-13.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### The Lamb\n\nThe Lamb symbolically refers Jesus as a sacrifice. The translator should not change the symbol of the Lamb as a picture of sacrifice. Alternate translation: “a male sheep” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage]])\n\nThe “Lion of the tribe of Judah” and the “Root of David” are metaphors that refer to Jesus as the Lamb. Jesus descended from the tribe of Judah and the family of David. Lions are fierce, and all animals and people are afraid of them, so they are a metaphor for a king whom everyone obeys. The words **Root of David** speak of Israel’s King David as if he were a seed that God had planted and of Jesus as if he were a root growing from that seed. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n### Sealed scroll\n\nKings and important people in John’s time wrote important documents on large pieces of paper or animal skin. They then rolled them up and sealed them with wax so they would stay closed. Only the person to whom the document was written had the authority to open it by breaking the seal. In this chapter, “the one who was seated on the throne” had written the scroll. Only the person called “the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David” and “the Lamb” had the authority to open it. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/scroll]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/authority]])\n\n### A Scroll\n\nIn ancient times, a scroll was a type of book made of one long, rolled-up sheet of papyrus or leather. After writing on a scroll or reading from it, people rolled it up by using the rods attached to its ends. Scrolls were used for legal documents and scripture. Sometimes scrolls that were delivered by a messenger were sealed with wax. If the wax was still present when the scroll was received, then the receiver knew that no one had opened the scroll to read it or write on it since it had been sealed. Alternate translation: “a scroll with writing on the front and the back” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])\n\n### Seven Seals\n\nHere, **seven seals** represents seven pieces of wax that secured documents closed. Melted wax was used to seal letters or other documents that needed to be protected. When the wax cooled and hardened, the letter could not be opened without breaking the wax seal. The person who received the letter would see the unbroken seal and know that no one had opened it. Alternate translation: “and it had seven seals keeping it closed” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])\n\n### Twenty-four elders\n\nInterpreters debate the symbolic meaning of **24** as the number of the elders. The symbolic significance of the term **elders** is also debated, but it probably indicates the church or the people of God at the time that John wrote the book of Revelation. In this sense, the leaders of the church represent the church or the believers that comprise the church. There were twelve tribes in Old Testament Israel and twelve apostles in the New Testament church. Alternate translation: “24 church leaders” or “24 older saints” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage]])\n\n### Christian prayers\n\nThe prayers of Christians are described as incense. Christian prayers have a good smell to God. He is pleased when Christians pray.\n\n### Seven spirits of God\n\nThese spirits are the seven spirits of [Revelation 1:4](../rev/01/04.md).\n

5:1	xzbs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐπὶ τὴν δεξιὰν	1	The right hand can be used figuratively as a symbol of power, authority, or strength. However, sometimes the term “right hand” literally refers to a person’s right hand. Perhaps this is also the case here in this context. This should be translated using the term that the language uses to refer to this hand. Alternate translation: "in the hand" (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
5:1	u3br			τοῦ καθημένου ἐπὶ τοῦ θρόνου	1	This is God that sits on the throne here. In other words, this is the same **one** who is sitting on the throne earlier in the book in [Revelation 4:2-3](../04/02.md).
5:1	yhm3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	βιβλίον, γεγραμμένον ἔσωθεν καὶ ὄπισθεν	1	In ancient times, a scroll was a type of book made of one long, rolled-up sheet of papyrus or leather.

5:1	aj7m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	κατεσφραγισμένον σφραγῖσιν ἑπτά	1	Here, **seven seals** represents seven pieces of wax that secured documents closed. Melted wax was used to seal letters or other documents that needed to be protected. When the wax cooled and hardened, the letter could not be opened without breaking the wax seal. The person who received the letter would see the unbroken seal and know that no one had opened it. Alternate translation: “and it had seven seals keeping it closed” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

5:3	khd2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐδύνατο	1	This expression means literally "was able". However, the idiom refers to the idea of being sufficiently worthy or deserving to open the scroll. Thus, the expression does not simply convey the notion of being able to open the scroll. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “was worthy” or "was deserving" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
5:3	lj9u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	ἐν τῷ οὐρανῷ, οὐδὲ ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, οὐδὲ ὑποκάτω τῆς γῆς	1	Here, the entire clause and all of its descriptions of parts of the cosmos or universe represent a merism. Essentially, the entire clause means everywhere. In other words, the entire clause represents the following: the place where God and the angels live, the place where people and animals live, and the place where those who have died are. Alternate translation: “anywhere in heaven or on the earth or under the earth” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
5:3	ww4e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	βλέπειν	1	This expression means literally "to see". However, the idiom refers to the action of reading and not simply looking or seeing a book or scroll. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “to view” or "to look inside" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

5:4	o8pc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	εὑρέθη	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Although it is not clear who attempted to find someone, the context suggests that John could not find anyone worthy to open and to read the scroll. Alternate translation: “I did not find" or "I did not see" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

5:5	j67w			ὁ λέων ὁ ἐκ τῆς φυλῆς Ἰούδα	1	Here, **the Lion** is a title for the man **from the tribe of Judah** that God had promised would be the great king. This title probably refers to [Genesis 49:9](../../gen/49/09.md). You may want to include this information in a footnote. Alternate translation: “The one who is called the Lion of the tribe of Judah” or “The king who is called the Lion of the tribe of Judah”
5:5	b6wg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ὁ λέων	1	The king is spoken of as if he were a **Lion** because a lion is very strong. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
5:5	i89j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage	ἡ ῥίζα Δαυείδ	1	Here, **the Root of David** is a title for the descendant of **David** that God had promised would be the great king. This title probably refers to [Isa 11:10](../../isa/11/10.md). You may want to include this information in a footnote. Alternate translation: “the one who is called the Root of David” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage]])
5:5	z3vw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἡ ῥίζα Δαυείδ	1	The descendant is spoken of as if David’s family were a tree and he were a root of that tree. Alternate translation: “the Descendant of David” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
5:6	v99j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐν μέσῳ τοῦ θρόνου καὶ τῶν τεσσάρων ζῴων καὶ ἐν μέσῳ τῶν πρεσβυτέρων, Ἀρνίον ἑστηκὸς	1	Here, **in the middle of** describes a setting in which **the four living creatures** surround the central throne for the **Lamb** that exists in the center of the imagery or vision. The **elders** are sitting on thrones that also surround the central throne and **the four living creatures**. However, **the elders** are further out and even more removed in terms of relative space from the center of the throne for the **Lamb** than are the **the four living creatures**. Where the **Lamb** is standing in relation to **the throne** is not entirely clear and should not be translated very specifically. Thus, the translator should avoid specifying the exact details of where the **Lamb** stands in his relative location with **the throne**. If this spatial relationship is confusing in your language, then the translator might give a less confusing description by stating generally that the **Lamb** was standing near or at the throne. Alternate translation: “near the throne and the four living creatures and the elders” or “close to the throne and the four living creatures and the elders” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
5:6	zkxf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage	τῶν τεσσάρων ζῴων	1	See how you translated **living creatures** in [Revelation 4:6](../04/06.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage]])

5:6	du51		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage	Ἀρνίον	1	Here, **Lamb** symbolically refers Jesus as a sacrifice. The translator should not change the symbol of the **Lamb** as a picture of sacrifice. Alternate translation: “a male sheep” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage]])
5:6	o15q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ὡς ἐσφαγμένον	1	Here, **as though having been killed** translates a passive verb phrase that literally means “having been slain”. Thus, the passive verb phrase expresses the fact that the Lamb, although he was alive or living, actually had marks or cuts which indicated that he had died or was killed by others. If your language does not use the passive verb form in this way, you can state this witha an active verb form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “as though someone had killed him” or “as though someone had murdered him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
5:6	oz6y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage	κέρατα ἑπτὰ καὶ ὀφθαλμοὺς ἑπτά	1	The number **seven** is often used in the Bible as a symbol for completeness and perfection.

5:6	erg2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage	τὰ ἑπτὰ πνεύματα τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	The number **seven** is a symbol of completeness and perfection. The **seven spirits** refers either to the Spirit of God or to seven spirits who serve God. See how you translated this symbolic phrase in [Revelation 1:4](../01/04.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage]])
5:6	t7d1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἀπεσταλμένοι εἰς πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν	1	If your language does not use a passive form like **sent out** here, then you can translate the passive expression with an active verb. Alternate translation: “which God sent out into all the earth” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
5:7	egp6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	ἦλθεν	1	He approached the throne. Some languages may use the verb “to go” with a form equivalent to the phrase “he went.” Use whichever verb is more natural in you language. Alternate translation: “he went” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])
5:7	fkax		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐκ τῆς δεξιᾶς	1	See the explicit mention of **the scroll** in the next verse in [Revelation 5:8](../05/08.md). Alternate translation: “it from the right hand” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

5:8	uv6w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἕκαστος	1	Here, **each one** could refer to: (1) each one of the elders and living creatures, or, (2) solely each one of the elders. The translator should not make the references explicit since the persons or characters are not clearly identified in the Greek language. Alternate translation: “everyone” or “all” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
5:8	jy9u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	θυμιαμάτων	1	The term **incense** refers to a mixture of fragrant spices that is burned to produce smoke that has a pleasant smell. God commanded that the Israelites burn incense as an offering to him. If your readers would not be familiar with what incense is, you could use a general expression in your translation. Alternate translation: “pleasant smoke" or "fragrant spices” or “good-smelling plants" (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
5:8	qak6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage	θυμιαμάτων	1	Here, **incense** symbolizes the **prayers** of the **saints** to God. Alternate translation: “aromatic herbs” or “aromatic resins” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage]])

5:9	yu7h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐσφάγης	1	Here, **you were slaughtered** is a passive verbal phrase that can be turned into an active verbal expression. If your language does not use this passive form, you can state this in active form. Alternate translation: “they slaughtered you” or “people killed you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
5:9	qtv5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐν τῷ αἵματί σου	1	Here, **blood** is a metonym that substitutes for blood. The phrase **with your blood** can mean “by your death” or “by dying.” Since **blood** represents a person’s life, losing the blood represents a death or the act of dying. If your readers would not understand this, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “with your death” or “with your act of dying.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
5:9	zzc7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litany	ἐκ πάσης φυλῆς, καὶ γλώσσης, καὶ λαοῦ, καὶ ἔθνους	1	The clause **from every tribe and tongue and people and nation** represents a litany. The list in this litany represents all **people** of the earth and includes every ethnic group that the world contains. Use words in your language that someone would use to include all types of people, races, and ethnic groups which inhabit the world. Alternate translation: “from every ethnic group and tongue and people and nation” or “from every tribe and tongue and race and nation.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litany]])

The numbers **myriads** and **thousands** simply mean numbers that are so great that they are countless. If people will not understand these numbers in your target language, then you can simply use natural expressions in your language for numbers that are so great that one cannot count them. Use expressions in your language that show huge numbers that are difficult to count.

The Servants of God in Heaven (7:9-17)\nG. The Unrolling of the Seventh Seal (8:1)\n\nThe author describes what happened after the Lamb opens each of the first six seals. The Lamb does not open the seventh seal until Chapter 8.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### The Lamb\n\nThe Lamb symbolically refers Jesus as a sacrifice. The translator should not change the symbol of the Lamb as a picture of sacrifice. Alternate translation: “a male sheep” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage]])\n\n### Sealed scroll\n\nKings and important people in John’s time wrote important documents on large pieces of paper or animal skin. They then rolled them up and sealed them with wax so they would stay closed. Only the person to whom the document was written had the authority to open it by breaking the seal. In this chapter, “the one who was seated on the throne” had written the scroll. Only the person called “the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David” and “the Lamb” had the authority to open it. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/scroll]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/authority]])\n\n### A Scroll\n\nIn ancient times, a scroll was a type of book made of one long, rolled-up sheet of papyrus or leather. After writing on a scroll or reading from it, people rolled it up by using the rods attached to its ends. Scrolls were used for legal documents and scripture. Sometimes scrolls that were delivered by a messenger were sealed with wax. If the wax was still present when the scroll was received, then the receiver knew that no one had opened the scroll to read it or write on it since it had been sealed. Alternate translation: “a scroll with writing on the front and the back” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])\n\n### Seven Seals\n\nHere, **seven seals** represents seven pieces of wax that secured documents closed. Melted wax was used to seal letters or other documents that needed to be protected. When the wax cooled and hardened, the letter could not be opened without breaking the wax seal. The person who received the letter would see the unbroken seal and know that no one had opened it. Alternate translation: “and it had seven seals keeping it closed” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])\n\n### Twenty-four elders\n\nInterpreters debate the symbolic meaning of **24** as the number of the elders. The symbolic significance of the term **elders** is also debated, but it probably indicates the church or the people of God at the time that John wrote the book of Revelation. In this sense, the leaders of the church represent the church or the believers that comprise the church. There were twelve tribes in Old Testament Israel and twelve apostles in the New Testament church. Alternate translation: “24 church leaders” or “24 older saints” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage]])\n\n### Seven Seals\n\nKings and important people in John’s time wrote important documents on large pieces of paper or animal skin. They then rolled them up and sealed them with wax so they would stay closed. Only the person to whom the document was written had the authority to open it by breaking the seal. In this chapter, the Lamb opens the seals. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-apocalyptic]])\n\n### The Four Horsemen\n\nAs the Lamb opens each of the first four seals, the author describes horsemen riding different colored horses. The colors of the horses seem to symbolize how the rider will affect the earth.\n\n### The Altar\n\nAn altar was a raised structure on which the Israelites burned animals and grains as offerings to God. During Bible times, simple altars were often made by forming a mound of packed-down dirt or by carefully placing large stones to form a stable pile. However, altars were often made of metal when John wrote the book of Revelation. If your readers would not be familiar with what an altar is, you could use a general expression in your translation. Alternate translation: “the cultic furniture" or "the offering stand” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### Similes\n\nIn verses 12-14, the author uses several similes to try to describe the images he sees in the vision.

Alternate translation: “another seal” or “the next seal” or “seal number two” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
6:3	i1p4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal	τοῦ δευτέρου ζῴου	1	The word **second** is an ordinal number.

Alternate translation: “God gave permission to its rider” or “its rider received permission” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
6:4	je64		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐδόθη αὐτῷ μάχαιρα μεγάλη	1	Here, **to him was given a huge sword** might be expressed with an active verbal phrase.

7:intro	f27i				0	# Revelation 7 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n## Outline of Chapter Seven of Revelation within 4:1-8:1\n\nThe Unrolling of the Seven-sealed Scroll (4:1-8:1)\n\nI. A Vision of God in Heaven (4:1-5:14)\n\nA. God Sitting on the Throne in Heaven (4:1-11)\nB. The Seven-sealed Scroll in Heaven that Jesus Takes (5:1-14)\n\nII. The Seven Seals (6:1-8:1)\n\nA. The Unrolling of the First Seal (6:1-2)\nB. The Unrolling of the Second Seal (6:3-4)\nC. The Unrolling of the Third Seal (6:5-6)\nD. The Unrolling of the Fourth Seal (6:7-8)\nE. The Unrolling of the Fifth Seal (6:9-11)\nF. The Unrolling of the Sixth Seal (6:12-17)\n   1. The Servants of God (7:1-17)\n      a. The Servants of God on Earth (7:1-8)\n      b. The Servants of God in Heaven (7:9-17)\nG. The Unrolling of the Seventh Seal (8:1)\n\nScholars have interpreted parts of this chapter in many different ways. Translators do not need to fully understand what this chapter means to accurately translate its contents. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-apocalyptic]])\n\nIt is important to accurately translate the large numbers in this chapter. The number 144,000 is twelve times twelve thousand.\n\nTranslators should be aware that the tribes of the people of Israel are not listed in this chapter the same as they are generally listed in the Old Testament.\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with verses 5-8 and 15-17.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Worship\n\nGod saves his people and keeps them through times of trouble. His people respond by worshipping him. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/worship]])\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### The Lamb\n\nThe Lamb symbolically refers Jesus as a sacrifice. The translator should not change the symbol of the Lamb as a picture of sacrifice. Alternate translation: “a male sheep” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage]])\n\n### Four Angels standing at the four corners of the earth\n\nJohn sees "four angels" standing at the four corners of the earth in Revelation chapter seven. The earth is spoken of as if it were a vast, flat square like a sheet of paper. The phrase "the four corners" refers to the north, south, east, and west. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning of this expression plainly. Alternate translation: “the four extremities of the earth" or "the four directions of the earth" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])\n\n### Four Winds\n\nThe expression of "the four winds of the earth" occurs elsewhere in the Bible and is simply an idiom equivalent to the earlier idiomatic expression "the four corners of the earth". The language of this idiomatic expression probably refers back to [Jer 49:36](../../jer/49/36.md). You may want to include this information in a footnote. Alternate translation: “the four extremities of the earth" or "the four directions of the earth" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])\n\n### 144,000\n\nThe number 144,000 is twelve times twelve thousand and has some type of symbolic sense that the translator does not need to render the number. The number represents 12,000 from twelve tribes of Israel.

8:intro	ma7f				0	# Revelation 8 General Notes\n\n## Outline of Chapter Eight of Revelation within 4:1-8:1 and 8:2-11:19\n\n### The Unrolling of the Seven-sealed Scroll (4:1-8:1)\n\nI. A Vision of God in Heaven (4:1-5:14)\n\nA. God Sitting on the Throne in Heaven (4:1-11)\nB. The Seven-sealed Scroll in Heaven that Jesus Takes (5:1-14)\n\nII. The Seven Seals (6:1-8:1)\n\nA. The Unrolling of the First Seal (6:1-2)\nB. The Unrolling of the Second Seal (6:3-4)\nC. The Unrolling of the Third Seal (6:5-6)\nD. The Unrolling of the Fourth Seal (6:7-8)\nE. The Unrolling of the Fifth Seal (6:9-11)\nF. The Unrolling of the Sixth Seal (6:12-17)\n   1. The Servants of God (7:1-17)\n      a. The Servants of God on Earth (7:1-8)\n      b. The Servants of God in Heaven (7:9-17)\nG. The Unrolling of the Seventh Seal (8:1)\n\n## The Seven Trumpets (8:2-11:19)\n\nI. The Sounding of the Seven Trumpets (8:2-11:19)\n\nA. The Prayers of God's People to Begin the Seven Trumpets (8:2-6)\nB. The First Trumpet (8:7)\nC. The Second Trumpet (8:8-9)\nD. The Third Trumpet (8:10-11)\nE. The Fourth Trumpet (8:12-13)\nF. The Fifth Trumpet (9:1-12)\nG. The Sixth Trumpet (9:13-21)\nH. Preparations for the Seventh Trumpet (10:1-11:14)\n   1. John eats the Book in an Angel's Hand (10:1-11)\n   2. John measures the Temple and the Second Woe occurs (11:1-14)\nI. The Seventh Trumpet (11:15-19)\n\n\nChapter eight begins the seven trumpets after the Lamb had finished unrolling the seven seals. The seven trumpets start in verse 8:2 and continue to 11:19 in total. Like the seals, the trumpets progress from one to seven in a chronological manner within John's vision.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### The Lamb\n\nThe Lamb symbolically refers Jesus as a sacrifice. The translator should not change the symbol of the Lamb as a picture of sacrifice. Alternate translation: “a male sheep” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage]])\n\n### Four Angels standing at the four corners of the earth\n\nJohn sees "four angels" standing at the four corners of the earth in Revelation chapter seven. The earth is spoken of as if it were a vast, flat square like a sheet of paper. The phrase "the four corners" refers to the north, south, east, and west. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning of this expression plainly. Alternate translation: “the four extremities of the earth" or "the four directions of the earth" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])\n\n### Four Winds\n\nThe expression of "the four winds of the earth" occurs elsewhere in the Bible and is simply an idiom equivalent to the earlier idiomatic expression "the four corners of the earth". The language of this idiomatic expression probably refers back to [Jer 49:36](../../jer/49/36.md). You may want to include this information in a footnote. Alternate translation: “the four extremities of the earth" or "the four directions of the earth" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])\n\n### 144,000\n\nThe number 144,000 is twelve times twelve thousand and has some type of symbolic sense that the translator does not need to render the number. The number represents 12,000 from twelve tribes of Israel.\n\n### Seven trumpets\n\nSeven angels blow seven trumpets in Revelation 8:2-11:19. Trumpets are instruments for producing music or for calling people to gather together for an announcement or meeting. See how you translated "trumpet" in [Revelation 1:10](../01/10.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])\n\n### Incense\n\nThe term "incense" refers to a mixture of fragrant spices that is burned to produce smoke that has a pleasant smell. God commanded that the Israelites burn incense as an offering to him. If your readers would not be familiar with what incense is, you could use a general expression in your translation. Alternate translation: “pleasant smoke" or "fragrant spices” or “good-smelling plants" (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### Passive voice\n\nJohn uses the passive voice several times in this chapter. This hides who performs the action. This will be difficult to convey if the translator’s language does not have a passive voice. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])\n\n### Similes\n\nIn verses 8 and 10, John uses similes to try to describe the images he sees in the vision. He compares the images to everyday things. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
8:1	yd7b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἤνοιξεν	1	The pronoun **he** refers to the Lamb of the previous verse and in the immediate context. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “the Lamb opened” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
8:1	ac8b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τὴν σφραγῖδα τὴν ἑβδόμην	1	See how you translated **seal** in [Revelation 5:1](../05/01.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
8:1	mh2b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal	τὴν σφραγῖδα τὴν ἑβδόμην	1	This is the last of the seven seals on the scroll. The word **seventh** is an ordinal number. Alternate translation: “the next seal” or “the final seal” or “seal number seven” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
8:1	p4ns			ἐγένετο σιγὴ	1	Here, **there there was silence** means there was complete silence or lack of sound for a short period of time in heaven. The length of the quiet time is not really significant here. The particularly significant aspect for the translator to render is that heaven was quiet during a brief period of time. Alternate translation: “there was no sound" or “it was completely quiet”
8:2	jec9			τοὺς ἑπτὰ ἀγγέλους, οἳ ἐνώπιον τοῦ Θεοῦ ἑστήκασιν	1	Interpreters often link the **seven angels** here with the **seven spirits** in [Revelation 1:4](../01/10.md) and [Revelation 4:5](../04/05.md). This connection seems logical, but it is not explicit in the text.
8:2	fri9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐδόθησαν αὐτοῖς ἑπτὰ σάλπιγγες	1	Each of the seven angels were given one trumpet. This could mean: (1) God gave them seven trumpets. (2) the Lamb gave them seven trumpets. If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “God gave seven trumpets to them" or "Jesus gave seven trumpets to them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
8:2	bne0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ἑπτὰ σάλπιγγες	1	Here, **trumpets** are instruments for producing music or for calling people to gather together for an announcement or meeting.

8:3	gzhb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου	1	See how you translated **altar** in [Revelation 6:9](../06/09.md). Alternate translation: “the cultic furniture" or "the offering stand” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
8:3	cgym		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	λιβανωτὸν χρυσοῦν	1	The term **censor** refers to a container, usually a metal bowl, in which one burns incense, most often during a religious or cultic ceremony. Usually a **censor** had a handle so that a priest could carry it to an altar, as in this context. Incense, which is placed in the **censor**, is a mixture of fragrant spices that is burned to produce smoke that has a pleasant smell. If your readers would not be familiar with what a **censor** is, you could use a general expression in your translation. Alternate translation: “gold incense container" or "gold incense bowl" (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
8:3	fkxi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐδόθη αὐτῷ θυμιάματα πολλὰ	1	Here, **was given** could indicate that: (1) God gave much incense. (2) the Lamb gave much incense. If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “God gave much incense to him" or "Jesus gave much incense to him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
8:3	fm59		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	θυμιάματα	1	The term **incense** refers to a mixture of fragrant spices that is burned to produce smoke that has a pleasant smell. God commanded that the Israelites burn incense as an offering to him. If your readers would not be familiar with what incense is, you could use a general expression in your translation. Alternate translation: “pleasant smoke" or "fragrant spices” or “good-smelling plants" (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
8:3	f9g9			δώσει	1	Alternate translation: "he would offer the incense" or “he would give it"
8:3	paml		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τὸ θυσιαστήριον τὸ χρυσοῦν	1	See how you translated **altar** in [Revelation 6:9](../06/09.md). This **altar** here appears to be distinct or different from the one mentioned earlier in this verse. However, such a distinction is not entirely clear. It seems preferable that the translator not attempt to indicate any relation between the two occurrences of **altar** in this verse, but only separately render the two distinct occurrences of **altar**. Alternate translation: “the golden cultic furniture" or "the golden offering stand” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
8:4	xpyu			ὁ καπνὸς τῶν θυμιαμάτων	1	Here, **the smoke of the incense** literally is the incense smoke that went up from burning the incense. Alternate translation: "the smoke that rose from the incense burning" or "the smoke that went up from the incense burning"
8:4	lq1q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐκ χειρὸς τοῦ ἀγγέλου	1	Here, **the hand** refers to the golden censer in the angel's hand. If it would be helpful in your language, you make it clear that the incense was burning within a censer and not directly touching the hand of the angel. Alternate translation: “from the censer in the angel's hand” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
8:4	kol8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐνώπιον τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	This expression **before God** refers to the presence of God.

8:5	dovr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	καὶ εἴληφεν ὁ ἄγγελος τὸν λιβανωτόν, καὶ ἐγέμισεν αὐτὸν ἐκ τοῦ πυρὸς τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου	1	Here, **the fire** probably refers to burning coals. The angel took live coals from the altar and put them in a censer before throwing the burning incense and the live coals upon the earth. If it would be clearer for your readers, in your translation you could just refer to the “censer for burning incense". Alternate translation: "And the angel took the incense container and filled it with the fire of the altar" or "And the angel took the censor and filled it with the burning coals of the altar" or "And the angel took the censor and filled it with coals of fire from the altar" (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

8:7	eyfz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	χάλαζα	1	Here, **hail** usually refers to lumps of frozen water that fall from the sky.

If your readers would not be familiar with what hail is, you could use a general expression in your translation. Alternate translation: “hailstones” or "ice balls" or "balls of ice" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “all the green plants” or "all the green vegetation" (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
8:8	rnh8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal	ὁ δεύτερος ἄγγελος	1	The word **second** is an ordinal number. Alternate translation: “the next angel” or “angel number two” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])

John eats the Book in an Angel's Hand (10:1-11)\n   2. John measures the Temple and the Second Woe occurs (11:1-14)\nI. The Seventh Trumpet (11:15-19)\n\nIn this chapter, John continues to describe what happens when angels sound seven trumpets. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-apocalyptic]])\n\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n\n### Woe\n\n\n\nJohn describes several “woes” in the Book of Revelation. This chapter begins to describe three “woes” announced at the end of Chapter 8. Woes signify calamity, disaster, or a terrible event.\n\n\n### Seven trumpets\n\nSeven angels blow seven trumpets in Revelation 8:2-11:19. Trumpets are instruments for producing music or for calling people to gather together for an announcement or meeting. See how you translated "trumpet" in [Revelation 1:10](../01/10.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])\n\n### Animal imagery\n\nThis chapter includes several animals: locusts, scorpions, horses, lions, and snakes. Animals convey different qualities or traits. For example, a lion is powerful and dangerous. Translators should use the same animals in their translation if possible. If the animal is unknown, one with similar qualities or traits should be used.\n\n### Locusts\n\nThe locusts are insects that fly together in large groups. People fear them because they can eat up the leaves in gardens and on trees. If your readers would not be familiar with what locusts are, in your translation you could use the name of a similar flying insect in your culture, or you could use a general expression. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])\n\n### Bottomless pit\n\nThis image is seen several times in the Book of Revelation. It is a picture of hell as being inescapable and the opposite direction as heaven. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/hell]])\n\n### Abaddon and Apollyon\n\n“Abaddon” is a Hebrew word. “Apollyon” is a Greek word. Both words mean “Destroyer.” John used the sounds of the Hebrew word and wrote them with Greek letters. The ULT and UST write the sounds of both words with English letters. Translators are encouraged to transliterate these words using the letters of the target language. The original Greek readers would have understood “Apollyon” to mean “Destroyer.” So translators may also supply what it means in the text or in a footnote. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate]])\n\n### Repentance\n\nDespite great signs, people are described as not repenting and so remain in their sin. People refusing to repent are also mentioned in Chapter 16. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/repent]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### Simile\n\nJohn uses many similes in this chapter. They help to describe the images that he sees in his vision. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])\n\n### Generic Sense\n\nSeveral times in this chapter John uses the masculine word men in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use a term in your language that is clearly inclusive of both men and women such as “people” or “humanity.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
9:1	d26c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal		1	See how you translated **angel** in [Revelation 8:2](../08/02.md).

9:2	way2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	ὡς καπνὸς καμίνου μεγάλης	1	A **huge furnace** was a big oven that burned wood or coal to make bread, pottery, or even to smelt metals like iron. Often furnaces would give off a great amount of thick, dark **smoke**.

Alternate translation: “huge kiln" or "huge oven" or "huge stove” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
9:2	tp79		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	ὡς καπνὸς καμίνου μεγάλης	1	The point of this comparison is the **huge furnace** gives off a great amount of thick, dark **smoke**.

9:4	tz3f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	τοὺς ἀνθρώπους	1	As the General Notes to this chapter discuss, here and in several other places in this chapter John uses the masculine word men in a generic sense that includes both men and women.

9:5	rui1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐδόθη αὐτοῖς	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

17:intro	ysn1				0	# Revelation 17 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nThis chapter begins to describe how God will destroy Babylon.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Prostitute\n\nScripture often pictures idolatrous Jews as adulterous people and sometimes as prostitutes. This is not the reference here. The translator should allow this illustration to be vague. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-apocalyptic]])\n\n### Seven hills\n\nThis possibly refers to the city of Rome, which was known as the city on seven hills. However, the translator should not attempt to identify Rome in the translation.\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### Metaphors\n\nJohn uses many different metaphors in this chapter. He explains some of their meanings, but allows them to remain relatively unclear. The translator should attempt to do the same. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### “The beast you saw existed, does not exist now, but is about to come up”\n\nThis and similar phrases in this chapter contrast the beast with Jesus. Jesus is called “the one who is, and who was, and who is to come” elsewhere in the Book of Revelation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])\n\n### Paradox\n\nA paradox is a true statement that appears to describe something impossible. This sentence in 17:11 is a paradox: “the beast … is itself also an eighth king; but it is one of those seven kings.” The translator should not attempt to resolve this paradox. It should remain a mystery. ([Revelation 17:11](../rev/17/11.md))

19:intro	h785				0	# Revelation 19 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nThe beginning of chapter 19 concludes the topic of Babylon falling.\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with verses 1-8.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Songs\n\nThe Book of Revelation often describes heaven as a place where people sing. They worship God with songs. This illustrates that heaven is a place where God is always worshiped. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/heaven]])\n\n### Wedding celebration\n\nThe wedding celebration or feast is an important image in Scripture. Jewish culture often pictured paradise, or life with God after death, as a feast. Here, the wedding feast is for the Lamb, who is Jesus, and his bride, who is all his people.

20:intro	c7eh				0	# Revelation 20 General Notes\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### The thousand-year reign of Christ\n\nIn this chapter, Jesus is said to reign for a thousand years, at the same time that Satan is bound. Scholars are divided over whether this refers to a future period of time or to Jesus reigning now from heaven. It is not necessary to understand this passage in order to translate it accurately. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]])\n\n### Final rebellion\n\nThis chapter also describes what happens after the thousand years are ended. During this time, Satan and many people will attempt to rebel against Jesus. This will result in God’s ultimate and final victory over sin and evil. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/evil]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/eternity]])\n\n### Great white throne\n\nThis chapter ends with God judging all people who ever lived. God separates people who believe in Jesus from those who do not believe in him. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/judge]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/heaven]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]])\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### Book of Life\n\nThis is a metaphor for eternal life.

21:intro	pai8				0	# Revelation 21 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nThis chapter gives a detailed picture of the new Jerusalem.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Second death\n\nDeath is a type of separation. The first death is physically dying, when the soul is separated from the body. The second death is being eternally separated from God. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/death]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/soul]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/eternity]])\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### Book of Life\n\nThis is a metaphor for eternal life. Those possessing eternal life are said to have their names written in this Book of Life. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### New heaven and new earth\n\nIt is unclear whether this is an entirely new heaven and earth or if it is remade out of the present heaven and earth. The same is also true of the new Jerusalem. It is possible this will affect translation in some languages. The word “new” in the original language means different and better than the old. It does not mean new in time.

22:intro	e1ya				0	# Revelation 22 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nThis chapter emphasizes that Jesus is coming soon.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Tree of life\n\nThere is probably an intended connection between the tree of life in the Garden of Eden and the tree of life mentioned in this chapter. The curse that began in Eden will end at this time.\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### Alpha and omega\n\nThese are the names of the first and last letters in the Greek alphabet. The ULT spells out their names in English. This strategy can serve as a model for translators. Some translators, however, may decide to use the first and last letters in their own alphabet.
