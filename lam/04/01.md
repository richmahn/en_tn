# The gold has become tarnished; how the purest gold has changed

The people of Jerusalem are spoken of as if they were gold that is no longer shiny, and therefore no longer valuable. Alternate translation: "The people of Jerusalem are like gold that is no longer shiny. They are like pure gold that is no longer beautiful" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# how the purest gold has changed

This is an exclamation that shows the author's sadness that this has happened. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations]])

# The holy stones are scattered at the corner of every street

This may refer to the temple being destroyed and its stones scattered throughout the city. It may also be a metaphor for the people being scattered. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# at the corner of every street

"wherever the streets come together" or "by all the roads"
