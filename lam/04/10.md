# The hands of compassionate women

Here the women are represented by their "hands." Because they were so hungry, women who had been compassionate in the past were no longer compassionate toward their children; instead they boiled them for food. Alternate translation: "Compassionate women" or "Women who had been compassionate in the past" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# they became their food

"their children became the women's food"

# the daughter of my people was

This is a poetic name for Jerusalem, which is spoken of here as if it were a woman. See how you translated this in [Lamentations 2:11](../02/11.md). Alternate translation: "my people were" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
