## translationNotes

* **They are defiled by that blood** - Because they have committed murder, they are ritually unclean, unable to worship God or be with ordinary people. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **"Flee! Unclean," these prophets and priests cry out** - Some versions translate these words as being spoken by the ordinary people, not the murderous prophets and priests.
