## They are defiled by that blood ##

Because they have committed murder, they are ritually unclean, unable to worship God or be with ordinary people. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## "Flee! Unclean," these prophets and priests cry out ##

Some versions translate these words as being spoken by the ordinary people, not the murderous prophets and priests.
