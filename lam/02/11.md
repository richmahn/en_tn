# General Information:

The author shifts from describing Jerusalem to describing his own experience.

# My eyes have failed from their tears

This is an idiom. Alternate translation: "I have cried until I cannot cry anymore" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# my stomach churns

The word "churn" means to move around violently, normally in a circular rotation. This does not mean the stomach is literally churning, but describes how the author feels. Alternate translation: "my insides ache" or "my stomach hurts" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# my inner parts are poured out to the ground

The author speaks of feeling grief in his inner being as if his inner body parts had fallen out of his body onto the ground. Alternate translation: "my entire inner being is in grief" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the daughter of my people

This is a poetic name of Jerusalem, which is spoken of here as if it were a woman. Alternate translation: "my people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
