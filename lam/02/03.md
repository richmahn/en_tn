# General Information:

The author continues the use of metaphors to express how the Lord opposed Judah.

# he has cut off every horn of Israel

This speaks of the Lord taking away Israel's strength as if he were cutting off its horns. The word "horn" refers to an animal horn, not a musical instrument. Alternate translation: "he has taken away all of Israel's strength" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# withdrawn his right hand from before the enemy

Here the Lord's protection is represented by his "right hand." Alternate translation: "stopped protecting us from our enemies" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# He has burned up Jacob like a blazing fire that devours everything around it

This speaks of how the Lord has destroyed Jacob as if a fire has completely burned it. Alternate translation: "He has destroyed Jacob like a blazing fire destroys everything"

# Jacob

Here "Jacob" refers to the places where his descendants lived. Alternate translation: "Israel" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
