# General Information:

The city of Jerusalem is spoken of as if it were a woman. In Lamentations, Zion and Jerusalem are names used to refer to the same city. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# Jerusalem sinned greatly, therefore, she has become scorned as something that is filthy

This speaks of Jerusalem being scorned in the same way that a woman is scorned when she is unclean. According to the law of Moses, a woman was considered unclean during her monthly bleeding. Alternate translation: "Jerusalem's sins have made her filthy and unclean, and therefore she was unacceptable before God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# Jerusalem sinned greatly

This describes Jerusalem as a woman who sinned, while it also stands for the inhabitants of Jerusalem. Alternate translation: "The people of Jerusalem sinned greatly" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# has become scorned

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "has become an object of scorn" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# her nakedness

"her naked." Jerusalem is described as a woman whose private parts have been exposed to everyone to shame her. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
