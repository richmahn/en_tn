# for a comforter is far from me, one who restores my life

This speaks of Jerusalem having no one to comfort her as if she did have a comforter, but that he was far away. The word "comforter" can be expressed as a verb. Alternate translation: "for there is no one to comfort me and restore my life" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# restores my life

"revives me"
