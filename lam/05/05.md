# Those who are coming after us

"Our enemies who are chasing after us." This refers to the Babylonian army.

# we can find no rest

This speaks of being able to rest as if "rest" were an object that could be found. Alternate translation: "we are unable to rest" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
