# Our inheritance has been turned over to strangers; our houses to foreigners

The idea of things being turned over to others can be expressed with an active form. Since it is also understood in the second part of the sentence, those words can be repeated there. AT: "You have turned our inheritance over to strangers; you have turned our houses over to strangers" or "You have allowed strangers to take possession of our inheritance; you have allowed foreigners to take possession of our houses" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
