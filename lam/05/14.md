This is where the elders would give legal advice, but also where people would meet socially.

# the young men have left their music

Playing music was part of the social life at the city gate. This speaks of the men no longer playing their music as if the act of playing music were a place that they left. Alternate translation: "the young men have stopped playing their music" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
