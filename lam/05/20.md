# Why do you forget us forever? Why do you forsake us for so many days?

The author uses these rhetorical questions to express his feelings that Yahweh has forgotten them. These questions can be written as a statement. Alternate translation: "It is as though you will forget us forever or not come back to us for a very long time!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
