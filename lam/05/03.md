# We have become orphans ... our mothers are like widows

The people of Jerusalem have no one to protect them because the men have either died in battle or have gone into exile. This speaks of the people not having their fathers and husbands present as if they had actually become orphans and widows. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# orphans, the fatherless

These two phrases have the same meaning and emphasize that the people no longer have their fathers. Alternate translation: "orphans who have no fathers" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
