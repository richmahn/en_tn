# You will let their hearts be shameless

Here the "heart" is a metonym that represents their attitudes and emotions, and being "shameless" means not feeling ashamed of their sins even though they should. Their not being ashamed would give even more reason for God to punish them. Alternate translation: "You will let them feel no shame for their sins" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# May your condemnation be upon them

The abstract noun "condemnation" can be expressed with the verbs "condemn" or "curse." Alternate translation: "Condemn them" or "Curse them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
