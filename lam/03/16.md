## He has crushed...he has pushed me ##

are two expressions for God humbling the author. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## You have removed peace from my life ##

The author is no longer experiencing joy or pleasure in his life.

## my endurance has perished ##

Some versions translate, "My glory has perished," but here "glory" stands for endurance or strength. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
