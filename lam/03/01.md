## under the rod of Yahweh's fury ##

The rod is a stick that people used to beat and punish someone. AT: "Because Yahweh is angrily beating me." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## walk in darkness rather than light ##

This means to live in confusion and gloom. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## he has turned against me; he turns his hand against me ##

AT: "he has become my enemy; he uses his power to punish me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
