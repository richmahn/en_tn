# Connecting Statement:

A new poem begins. Here the author speaks of the sufferings that his people experienced. He speaks about them as if God had personally attacked only him. However, the writer intends to speak for everyone in the city. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# who has seen misery

Here "has seen" represents has experienced. Alternate translation: "who has experienced misery" or "who has suffered" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# under the rod of Yahweh's fury

Being "under the rod" represents being beaten with a rod. The author speaks of God's punishment as if God had beaten him with a rod. Alternate translation: "because Yahweh was very angry and has beaten me with a rod" or "because Yahweh was very angry and has punished me severely" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
