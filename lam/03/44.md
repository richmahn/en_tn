# Connecting Statement:

The prayer that began in [Lamentations 3:42](../03/42.md) continues.

# You have covered yourself with a cloud so that no prayer can pass through

This represents God refusing to listen to the people's prayer. Alternate translation: "You refuse to listen to our prayers. It is as though you put a cloud between us and you so that our prayers cannot get to you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
