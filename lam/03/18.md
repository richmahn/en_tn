# My endurance has perished and so has my hope in Yahweh

The author speaks as if his ability to endure more suffering and his hope that Yahweh will help him were living beings that have died. AT: "I cannot endure anymore suffering and I can no longer hope that Yahweh will help me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# endurance

Some versions translate this as "glory" or "splendor."
