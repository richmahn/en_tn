# General Information:

The writer speaks of the one who waits for Yahweh ([Lamentations 3:25](./25.md)).

# Let him offer his cheek to the one who strikes him

The word "him" refers to anyone who is suffering and who waits for Yahweh. Here "offer his cheek" represents allowing someone to strike his cheek. Alternate translation: "Let him allow people to hit him on the face" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# let him be filled to the full with reproach

The author speaks of a person as if he were a container and reproach were a liquid. Being filled with reproach represents being reproached much. The implication is that he should be patient when this happens. Alternate translation: "let him be insulted much" or "let him be patient when people reproach him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
