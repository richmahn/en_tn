# Who has spoken and it came to pass, unless the Lord decreed it?

The author uses this rhetorical question to teach that when someone commands something to happen, it will happen only if God has already decreed that it should happen. AT: "No one has spoken and it came to pass, unless the Lord decreed it." or "What someone has commanded to happen has never happened unless the Lord decreed it." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# has spoken

It can be expressed clearly that this refers to commanding something to happen. AT: "has commanded that something should happen" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# it came to pass
