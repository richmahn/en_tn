# General Information:

God is often spoken of as if he were a warrior.

# He bent his bow

A soldier has to bend his bow in order to shoot an arrow from it. The author speaks of God deciding to cause him trouble as if God were a warrior ready to shoot him with an arrow. See how you translated this in [Lamentations 2:4](../02/04.md). Alternate translation: "It was as if God made his bow ready to shoot"
