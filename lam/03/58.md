# you defended my case, you saved my life

The author speaks of God keeping him from being killed by his enemies as if God had defended him in court as a lawyer defends someone, and kept him from being killed. Alternate translation: "you saved my life from my enemies. It is as though you defended me in court" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# you defended my case

Here "defended my case" represents arguing for him. Alternate translation: "you argued my case for me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
