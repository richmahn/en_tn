# He drove me away

"He forced me to go away"

# caused me to walk in darkness rather than light

Here "darkness" represents suffering. Alternate translation: "caused me to suffer terribly with no hope, like a person walking in darkness rather than light" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
