# Yahweh is my inheritance

When God gave each tribe of Israel their land, he called it an inheritance. The author speaks of Yahweh being all he needs as if Yahweh were the inheritance that he had received. AT: "Because Yahweh is with me, I have everything I need" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
