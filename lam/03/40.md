# General Information:

The writer speaks again about the suffering that God has caused to Jerusalem, but here he speaks of "we" and "us," not "I" and "me."
In verse 42 the author starts a prayer that he and the people of Israel should pray.

# let us return to Yahweh

Here "return to Yahweh" represents submitting to him again. Alternate translation: "let us submit to Yahweh again" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
