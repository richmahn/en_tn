# General Information:

In verse 42 the author starts a prayer that he and the people of Israel should pray.

# let us return to Yahweh

Here "return to Yahweh" represents submitting to him again. AT: "let us submit to Yahweh again" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Let us lift up our hearts and our hands

Here "lift up our hearts" represents praying sincerely. It was customary for the Israelites to raise their hands when praying to God. AT: "Let us pray sincerely with lifted hands" or "Let us lift up our hands and pray sincerely" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# We have transgressed and rebelled

The words "transgressed" and "rebelled" share similar meanings. Together they indicate that transgression is the same as rebelling against Yahweh. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# You have covered yourself with anger

Here anger is spoken of as if it were a garment that God has put on. Hebrew often spoke of emotions as if they were clothing. AT: "You have been angry" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# you have killed

"you have killed many of us"

# you have not spared

Here "spared" represents having pity. AT: "you have not had pity on us" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
