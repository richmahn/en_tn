# He blocked my path

The author speaks of God causing him to continue to suffer as if God was preventing him from escaping the suffering by blocking his path. AT: "It is as though he blocked my path" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# a wall of hewn stone

"a wall of cut stones." People would cut stones into regular shapes that could fit together well in order to build a strong wall.

# he made my paths crooked

Crooked paths do not lead people to where they want to go. Here they represent unsuccessful ways of escaping suffering. AT: "it is as though he has made my paths crooked" or "I have tried to make the suffering stop, but God has prevented me, like one who prevents another from escaping by making his paths crooked" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
