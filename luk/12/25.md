# Which of you ... lifespan?

Jesus uses a question to teach his disciples. Alternate translation: "None of you can make your life any longer by being anxious!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# add a cubit to his lifespan

This is a metaphor because a cubit is a measure of length, rather than of time. The image is of a person's life stretched out as if it were a board, a rope, or some other physical object. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
