# If God so clothes the grass in the field, which

"If God clothes the grass in the field like that, and it" or "If God gives the grass in the field such beautiful clothing, and it." God making the grass beautiful is spoken of as if God were putting beautiful clothes on the grass.  Alternate translation: "If God makes the grass in the field beautiful like this, and it" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# is thrown into the oven

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "someone throws it into a fire" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# how much more will he clothe you

This is an exclamation, not a question. Jesus emphasizes that he will certainly take care of people even better than he does the grass. This could be stated clearly. Alternate translation: "he will certainly clothe you even better" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations]])
