# Are not five sparrows sold for two small coins?

Jesus uses a question to teach the disciples. Alternate translation: "You know that five sparrows are sold for only two small coins." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# sparrows

very small, seed-eating birds

# not one of them is forgotten in the sight of God

This could be stated in active form and in positive form. Alternate translation: "God never forgets any of them" or "God indeed remembers every sparrow" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
