# Luke 12 General Notes #

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### "Blasphemy against the Spirit" #####

No one knows for sure what actions people perform or what words they say when they commit this sin. However, they probably insult the Holy Spirit and his work. Part of the Holy Spirit's work is to make people understand that they are sinners and that they need to have God forgive them. Therefore, anyone who does not try to stop sinning is probably committing blasphemy against the Spirit. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/blasphemy]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/holyspirit]])

##### Servants #####

God expects his people to remember that everything in the world belongs to God. God gives his people things so they can serve him. He wants them to please him by doing what he wants them to do with everything he has given them. One day Jesus will ask his servants what they have done with everything he gave them to use. He will give a reward to those who have done what he wanted them to do, and he will punish those who have not.

##### Division #####

Jesus knew that those who did not choose to follow him would hate those who did choose to follow him. He also knew that most people love their families more than they love anyone else. So he wanted his followers to understand that following and pleasing him had to be more important to them than having their family love them ([Luke 12:51-56](./51.md)).

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### "Son of Man" #####

Jesus refers to himself as the "Son of Man" in this chapter ([Luke 12;8](./08.md)). Your language may not allow people to speak of themselves as if they were speaking about someone else. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sonofman]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
