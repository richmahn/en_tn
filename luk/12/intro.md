# Luke 12 General Notes #

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### "Blasphemy against the Spirit" #####

There is a great deal of controversy regarding properly identifying this specific sin. However, it seems to involve insulting the Holy Spirit and his work. Since part of his work is to convince people that they are sinners and that they need God's forgiveness, anyone who mocked this truth would be unwilling to come in repentance to God. For this reason, he would not be forgiven. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])

##### Stewardship #####
Although the word "steward" is not used in this chapter, stewardship, which is the work of a steward, is a concept that plays a significant part of the teaching in it. A good steward is a person whom others can trust to handle what belongs to them. Because everything always belongs to God, everything he gives each person still belongs to God, and the person who receives gifts from God is really a steward of what belongs to God. This includes not only the physical objects that God allows a person to control, but also such things as that person's natural abilities. God expects his stewards to remember that at any time he might command them to report how they have been handling what he has given them to be stewards over. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/trust]])

##### Division #####
There is an important teaching about division in this chapter ([Luke 12:51-56](./51.md)). This division is not intended to imply that people will become enemies. Instead, it references that there is now a clear division in the world between those who are Christians and those who are not. One's identity as a follower of Jesus is more significant than any family relation.

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### "Son of Man" #####
Jesus refers to himself as the "Son of Man." Some languages may not be able to have a person refer to himself in the third person. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sonofman]])

##### General and Specific Instructions #####
There are times that the New Testament gives specific instructions or commands that always apply to all Christians. At other times, its instructions are considered to be more general instructions and should only be taken as "good ideas." For example, "do not be anxious" or "sell your possessions" are not meant to be instructions to all Christians.
