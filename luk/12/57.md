(Jesus continues speaking to the crowds.)

## Why do you not judge what is right for yourselves ##

This is a rhetorical question used as a rebuke. It can be translated as "You yourselves should discern what is right." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]]) It introduces Jesus' teaching about what is right.

## for yourselves ##

“on your own initiative” or “while you still have time to do that” (UDB). It implies that the hearers should act out of their own self-interest and wisdom without anyone else having to force them.

## For when you go with your adversary ##

This is the beginning of another parable. Jesus uses a hypothetical situation as a metaphor for God's impending judgment.

## For when you go ##

Though Jesus is talking to a crowd, the situation he is presenting is something that a person would go through alone. So in some languages the word "you" would be singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

## settle the matter with him ##

"settle the matter with your adversary"

## the judge ##

This refers to the magistrate, but the term here is more specific and threatening.
