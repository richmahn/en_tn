# because you do not know the hour when the Son of Man comes

The only similarity between a thief and the Son of Man is that people do not know when either one will come, so they need to be ready.

# do not know the hour when

"do not know at what time"

# when the Son of Man comes

Jesus is talking about himself. Alternate translation: "when I, the Son of Man, will come"
