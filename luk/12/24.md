# ravens

This refers either to 1) crows, a kind of bird that eats mostly grain, or 2) ravens, a kind of bird that eats the flesh of dead animals. Jesus' audience would have considered the ravens worthless since the Jewish people could not eat these types of birds.

# storeroom ... barn

# How much more valuable you are than the birds!

This is an exclamation, not a question. Jesus emphasizes the fact that people are much more valuable to God then birds. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations]])
