## translationNotes

* Jesus continues to teach his disciples.
* **ravens** - This refers either to 1) crows, a kind of bird that eat mostly grain, or 2) ravens, a kind of bird that eat the flesh of dead animals. Jesus' audience would have considered the ravens worthless because they could not be eaten.
* **How much more valuable you are than the birds!** - This is an exclamation, emphasizing the fact that people are much more valuable to God then birds.
* **add a cubit to his lifespan** - This is a metaphor because a cubit is a measure of length, rather than of time. The image is of a person's life stretched out as if it were a board, a rope, or some other physical object. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
