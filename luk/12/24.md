# ravens

This refers either to 1) crows, a kind of bird that eats mostly grain, or 2) ravens, a kind of bird that eats the flesh of dead animals. Jesus' audience would have considered the ravens worthless since the Jewish people could not eat these types of birds.

# storeroom ... barn

These are places where food is stored.

# How much more valuable you are than the birds!

This is an exclamation, not a question. Jesus emphasizes the fact that people are much more valuable to God then birds. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations]])

# Which of you ... lifespan?

Jesus uses a question to teach his disciples. AT: "None of you can make your life any longer by being anxious!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# add a cubit to his lifespan

This is a metaphor because a cubit is a measure of length, rather than of time. The image is of a person's life stretched out as if it were a board, a rope, or some other physical object. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# If then you are not able to do such a very little thing, why do you worry about the rest?

Jesus uses another question to teach his disciples. AT: "Since you cannot do even this small thing, you should not worry about the other things." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
