# Who then is ... right time?

Jesus uses a question to answer Peter's question indirectly. He expected those who wanted to be faithful managers to understand that the parable was about them. Alternate translation: "I said it for everyone who is ... right time." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# the faithful and wise manager

Jesus tells another parable about how servants should be faithful while they wait for their master to return. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])

# whom his lord will set over his other servants

"whom his lord puts in charge of his other servants"
