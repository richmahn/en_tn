This is a break in Jesus' teachings. A man asks Jesus to do something and Jesus responds to him.

# divide the inheritance with me

In that culture, inheritances came from the father, usually after the father had died. You may need to make explicit that the speaker's father had probably died. AT: "share my father's property with me now that our father is dead" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
