# General Information:

This is a break in Jesus' teachings. A man asks Jesus to do something and Jesus responds to him.

# divide the inheritance with me

Inheritances came from the father in that culture. This could be stated. AT: "share my father's property with me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# Man

Possible meanings are 1) this is simply a way to address a stranger or 2) Jesus is rebuking the man. Your language might have a way of addressing people in either of these ways. Some people do not translate this word at all.

# who made me a judge or a mediator over you?

Jesus uses a question to rebuke the man. Some languages would use the plural form for "you" or "your." AT: "I am not your judge or mediator." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# He said to them

The word "them" here probably refers to the whole crowd of people. AT: "And Jesus said to the crowd"

# keep yourselves from all greedy desires

"guard yourself from every form of greed." AT: "do not allow yourself to love having things" or "do not let the urge to have more things control you"

# a person's life

This is a general statement of fact. It does not refer to any specific person. Some languages have a way of expressing that.

# the abundance of his possessions

"how many things he owns" or "how much wealth he has"
