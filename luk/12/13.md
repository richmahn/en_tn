## translationNotes

* **Man** - Some understand this to be simply a way of addressing a stranger. Others understand that Jesus was rebuking the man. Your language might have a way of addressing people in either of these ways. Some people do not translate this word at all.
* **who made me a judge or a mediator over you?** - This is a rhetorical question. It could also be translated as "I am not your judge or mediator." Some languages would use the plural form for "you" or "your." Languages that have a dual form would use that. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]], [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
* **And he said to them** - The word "them" here probably refers to the whole crowd of people. This could be translated as "And Jesus said to the crowd."
* **Keep yourself from all greedy desires** - "Guard yourself from every form of greed." It could also be translated as "Don't allow yourself to love having things" or "Don't be controlled by the urge to have more."
* **someone's life** - This is a general statement of fact. It does not refer to any specific person. Some languages have a way of expressing that.
* **the abundance of his possessions** - "how many things he owns" (UDB) or "how much wealth he has"
