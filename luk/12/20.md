# Connecting Statement:

Jesus quotes how God responds to the rich man, as he finishes telling his parable.

# tonight your soul is required of you

The "soul" refers to the life of a person. AT: "you will die tonight" or "I will take your life from you tonight" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# the things you have prepared, whose will they be?

"who will own what you have stored up?" or "who will have what you prepared?" God uses a question to make the man realize that he would no longer possess those things. AT: "the things that you have prepared will belong to someone else!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# stores up treasure

"saves up valuable things"

# is not rich toward God

has not used his time and possessions for the things that are important to God
