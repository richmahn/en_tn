Jesus continues to teach his disciples.

## Do you think that I came to bring peace on the earth? ##

This is a rhetorical question. People expected the Messiah to bring them peace from their enemies. This can be translated as "You should not think that I have come to bring peace on earth." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## but rather division ##

"but I came to bring division"

## division ##

"hostility" or "discord"

## there will be five in one house divided ##

This is an example of the kind of division there will be even within families.
