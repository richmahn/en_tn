# Do you think that I came to bring peace on the earth? No, I tell you, but rather division

Jesus asks a question to let them know that he is going to correct their wrong understanding. You may need to supply the words "I came" that are omitted in the second sentence. AT: "You think that I came to bring peace on the earth, but I tell you I did not. Instead, I came to bring division" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# division

"hostility" or "discord"
