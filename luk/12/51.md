# Do you think that I came to bring peace on the earth? No, I tell you, but rather division

Jesus asks a question to let them know that he is going to correct their wrong understanding. You may need to supply the words "I came" that are omitted in the second sentence. AT: "You think that I came to bring peace on the earth, but I tell you I did not. Instead, I came to bring division" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# division

"hostility" or "discord"

# there will be five in one house divided

This is an example of the kind of division there will be even within families.

# there will be five in one house

It may be helpful to state that this refers to people. AT: "there will be five people in one house" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# against ... against ... against ... against ... against ... against ... against ... against

"will oppose ... will oppose ... will oppose ... will oppose ... will oppose ... will oppose ... will oppose ... will oppose"
