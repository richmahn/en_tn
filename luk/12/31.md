(Jesus continues to teach his disciples.)

## seek his kingdom ##

"focus on God's kingdom" or "greatly desire God's kingdom"

## these things will be added to you  ##

"these things also will be given to you." "These things" refers to food and clothing.

## little flock ##

Jesus was calling his disciples a flock. A flock is a group of sheep or goats that a shepherd cares for. As a shepherd cares for his sheep, God would care for Jesus' disciples. This can be translated as "small group" or "dear group." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
