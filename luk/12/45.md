Jesus continues to tell his disciples a parable.

## that servant ##

This refers to the servant whose lord has put him in charge of the other servants.

## says in his heart ##

AT: "thinks to himself" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## My lord delays his return ##

AT: "My master will not return soon"

## male and female servants ##

The words that are translated here as “male and female servants” are normally translated as “boys” and "girls". They may indicate that the servants were young or that they were dear to their master.

## place his portion with the unfaithful ##

"put him with the unfaithful people" or "sends him to the place where he sends those who are unfaithful"
