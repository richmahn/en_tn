# that servant

This refers to the servant whose lord has put him in charge of the other servants.

# says in his heart

"heart" here refers to the person. AT: "thinks to himself" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# My lord delays his return

"My master will not return soon"

# male and female servants

The words that are translated here as "male and female servants" are normally translated as "boys" and "girls." They may indicate that the servants were young or that they were dear to their master.

# in a day when he does not expect, and in an hour that he does not know

The words "day" and "hour" form a merism of time that refers to any time, and the words "expect" and "know" have similar meanings, so the two phrases here are parallel to emphasize that the coming of the lord will be a total surprise to the servant. However, the phrases should not be combined unless your language has no different words for "know" and "expect" or "day" and "hour." AT: "at a time when the servant is not expecting him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# cut him in pieces and appoint a place for him with the unfaithful

Possible meanings are 1) this is an exaggeration for the master dealing out harsh punishment toward the slave, or 2) this describes the manner in which the servant will be executed and buried as punishment. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
