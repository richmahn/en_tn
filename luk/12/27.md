# Consider the liliesâ€”how they grow

"Think about how the lilies grow"

# lilies

Lilies are beautiful flowers that grow wild in the fields. If your language does not have a word for lily, you can use the name of another flower like that or translate it as "flowers" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

# neither do they spin

The process of making thread or yard for cloth is called "spinning." It may be helpful to make this explicit. AT: "neither do they make thread in order to make cloth" or "and they do not make yarn" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# Solomon in all his glory

"Solomon, who had great wealth" or "Solomon, who wore beautiful clothes"

# If God so clothes the grass in the field, which

"If God clothes the grass in the field like that, and it" or "If God gives the grass in the field such beautiful clothing, and it." God making the grass beautiful is spoken of as if God were putting beautiful clothes on the grass.  AT: "If God makes the grass in the field beautiful like this, and it" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# is thrown into the oven

This can be stated in active form. AT: "someone throws it into a fire" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# how much more will he clothe you

This is an exclamation, not a question. Jesus emphasizes that he will certainly take care of people even better than he does the grass. This could be stated clearly. AT: "he will certainly clothe you even better" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations]])
