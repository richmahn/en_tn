# For when you go ... bit of money

Jesus uses a hypothetical situation to teach the crowd. His point is that they should resolve the things they are able to resolve without involving the public courts. This can be restated to make it clear it might not happen. AT: "For if you were to go ... bit of money" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])

# the very last bit of money

"the entire amount of money that your adversary demands"
