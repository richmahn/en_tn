## translationNotes

* (Jesus continues to tell his disciples a parable.)
* **Blessed are** - "How good it is for"
* **whom the master will find watching when he comes** - "whose master finds them waiting for him when he returns" or "who are ready when the master returns"
* **he will tuck…make them sit down** - This is a reversal the previous verses. Because the servants have been faithful to their master, the master will now reward them by serving them.
* **he will tuck his long robe in his belt** - This can be translated with the implicit information made explicit: “He will prepare to serve by tucking his clothes into his belt” or “He will dress to serve.” (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
* **in the second watch of the night** - This can be translated as "late at night" or "just before midnight." The second watch was between 9:00 p.m. and midnight. (See: [[en:obe:other:biblicaltime]])
* **or if even in the third watch** - This can be translated as "or if he comes very late at night." The third watch was from midnight to 3:00 a.m. (See: [[en:obe:other:biblicaltime]])
