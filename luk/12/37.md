# Blessed are

"How good it is for"

# whom the master will find watching when he comes

"whose master finds them waiting for him when he returns" or "who are ready when the master returns"

# he will tuck in his long clothing at his belt, and have them sit down

Because the servants have been faithful and ready to serve their master, the master will now reward them by serving them.
