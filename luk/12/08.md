# I say to you

Jesus readdresses his audience to mark a shift in his speech to a new topic, in this case, to speak about confession.

# everyone who confesses me before men

What is confessed can be stated clearly. AT: "whoever tells others that he is my disciple" or "anyone who acknowledges before others that he is loyal to me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# the Son of Man

Jesus is referring to himself. AT: "I, the Son of Man"

# he who denies me before men

"he who disowns me before people." What is denied can be stated clearly. AT: "whoever refuses to acknowledge to others that he is my disciple" or "if anyone refuses to say that he is loyal to me, he" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# will be denied

"will be disowned." This can be stated in active form. AT: "the Son of Man will deny him" or "I will deny that he is my disciple" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# Everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man

"a Word" here is a synecdoche for "words." "Everyone who says something bad about the Son of Man" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# it will be forgiven him

"he will be forgiven." This can be stated in active form. AT: "God will forgive him for that" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# blasphemes against the Holy Spirit

"speaks evil against the Holy Spirit"

# but to him ... it will not be forgiven

This can be expressed with an active verb. AT: "but he ... God will not forgive him" or "but he ... God will consider him guilty forever" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
