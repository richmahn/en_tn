# I say to you

Jesus readdresses his audience to mark a shift in his speech to a new topic, in this case, to speak about confession.

# everyone who confesses me before men

What is confessed can be stated clearly. Alternate translation: "whoever tells others that he is my disciple" or "anyone who acknowledges before others that he is loyal to me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# the Son of Man

Jesus is referring to himself. Alternate translation: "I, the Son of Man"
