## translationNotes

* Jesus continues to tell his disciples a parable.
* **because you do not know the hour when the Son of Man comes** - The only similarity between a thief and the Son of Man is that people do not know when either one will come, so they need to be ready.
* **when the Son of Man comes** - Jesus was talking about himself. So it can be translated as "when I, the Son of Man, will come."
