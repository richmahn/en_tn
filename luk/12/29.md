Jesus continues to teach his disciples.

## Do not look for what you will eat and drink ##

"Do not focus on what you will eat and drink" or "do not greatly desire more to eat and drink"

## all the nations of the world ##

This can be translated as "all people of other nations" or "all the unbelievers in the world." "Nations" is used here as a metonym for "unbelievers." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
