# Connecting Statement:

In verse 42, Jesus begins to tell another parable.

# General Information:

In verse 41, there is a break in the story line as Peter asks Jesus a question about the previous parable.

# Who then is ... right time?

Jesus uses a question to answer Peter's question indirectly. He expected those who wanted to be faithful managers to understand that the parable was about them. AT: "I said it for everyone who is ... right time" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# the faithful and wise manager

Jesus tells another parable about how servants should be faithful while they wait for their master to return. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])

# whom his lord will set over his other servants

"whom his lord puts in charge of his other servants"

# Blessed is that servant

"How good it is for that servant"

# whom his lord finds doing that when he comes

"if his lord finds him doing that work when he comes back"

# Truly I say to you

This expression means they should pay special attention to what he is about to say.

# will set him over all his property

"will put him in charge of all his property"
