## Who then is ##

This is the beginning of a rhetorical question. Jesus did not answer Peter's question directly, but expected those who wanted to be faithful managers to understand that the parable was about them. It can be introduced with a statement: "I said it for everyone who is." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## the faithful and wise manager ##

Jesus tells another parable about how servants should be faithful while they wait for their master to return. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])

## whom his lord will set over his other servants ##

"whom his lord puts in charge of his other servants"

## Blessed is that servant ##

"How good it is for that servant"

## whom his lord finds doing that when he comes ##

This can be translated as "if his lord finds him doing that work when he comes back."
