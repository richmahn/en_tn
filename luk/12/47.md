## translationNotes

* (Jesus continues to tell his disciples a parable.)
* **will be beaten with many blows** - "will be hit many times" or "will be whipped many times." This can be translated with an active verb: "his master will hit him many times" or "his master will punish him severely."
* **Everyone to whom much is given, much will be required of him** - This can be translated with active verbs: "They will require more of anyone who has received much" or "the master will require more of everyone he has given much to."
* **they entrust â€¦ they will ask** - The word "they" here does not refer to a specific group of people. It can also be translated as "the master entrusts ... the master will ask." If you translated the previous sentences with a passive, consider following the UDB. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
* **to whom they entrust much** - "to whom they give much property to take care of" or "to whom they give much responsibility"
