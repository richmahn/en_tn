# Connecting Statement:

Jesus finishes telling the parable.

# That servant, having known his lord's will, and not having prepared or done according to his will, will be beaten with many blows

This can be translated in active form. AT: "But as for the servant who knows his lord's will does not prepare or do according to it, the master will beat him with many blows" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# his lord's will ... according to his will

"what his master wanted him to do ... it"

# many blows ... few blows

Both servants are punished, but these phrases show the servant who intentionally disobeyed his master was punished more severely than the other servant.
