# Connecting Statement:

Jesus finishes telling the parable.

# That servant, having known his lord's will, and not having prepared or done according to his will, will be beaten with many blows

This can be translated in active form. AT: "But as for the servant who knows his lord's will does not prepare or do according to it, the master will beat him with many blows" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# his lord's will ... according to his will

"what his master wanted him to do ... it"

# many blows ... few blows

Both servants are punished, but these phrases show the servant who intentionally disobeyed his master was punished more severely than the other servant.

# But everyone who has been given much, from them much will be required

This can be stated in active form. AT: "They will require more of anyone who has received much" or "The master will require more of everyone he has given much to" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# the one ... much, even more will be asked

This can be stated in active form. AT: "the master will ask even more of the one ... much" or "the master will require even more of the one ... much" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# the one who has been entrusted with much

This can be stated in active form. AT: "the one to whom the master has given much property to take care of" or "the one to whom the master has given much responsibility" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
