(Jesus continues to teach his disciples.)

## and give to the poor ##

"and give the money you earn from the sales to poor people"

## Make for yourselves purses ... treasure in heaven ##

This can be translated as "In this way you will make for yourselves purses..." The purses and treasure in heaven are the same thing. They both represent God's blessing in heaven. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## purses which will not wear out ##

"money bags that won't get holes in them"

## does not run out ##

"does not diminish" or "does not become less"
