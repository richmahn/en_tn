# But there is

The word "But" connects this verse to the previous verse about the hypocrisy of the Pharisees. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-connectingwords]])

# there is nothing concealed that will not be revealed

"everything that is hidden will be shown." This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "people will find out about everything that people do secretly" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# nothing hidden that will not be known

This means the same thing as the first part of the sentence in order to emphasize its truth. It can also be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "people will learn about everything that others try to hide" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
