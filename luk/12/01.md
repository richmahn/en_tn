# General Information:

Jesus begins to teach his disciples in front of thousands of people.

# In the meantime

This is probably while the scribes and Pharisees were looking for a way to trap him. The author uses these words to mark the beginning of a new event. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])

# when many thousands of the people ... they trampled on each other

This is background information that tells the setting of the story. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])

# many thousands of the people

"a very great crowd"

# they trampled on each other

This is probably an exaggeration to emphasize that so many people were crowded close together that they would step on each other. Alternate translation: "they were stepping on each other" or "they were stepping on one another's feet" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# he began to say to his disciples first of all

"Jesus first started speaking to his disciples, and said to them"

# Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy

Just as yeast spreads through a whole lump of bread dough, their hypocrisy was spreading through the whole community. Alternate translation: "Guard yourself against the hypocrisy of the Pharisees, which is like yeast" or "Be careful that you do not become hypocrites like the Pharisees. Their evil behavior influences everyone just as yeast affects a lump of dough" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
