# For when you go ... into prison

Jesus uses a hypothetical situation to teach the crowd. His point is that they should resolve the things they are able to resolve without involving the public courts. This can be restated to make it clear it might not happen. Alternate translation: "For if you were to go ... into prison" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])

# when you go

Though Jesus is talking to a crowd, the situation he is presenting is something that a person would go through alone. So in some languages the word "you" would be singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# settle the matter with him

"settle the matter with your adversary"

# the judge

This refers to the magistrate, but the term here is more specific and threatening.

# does not deliver you

"does not take you"
