# I say to you my friends

Jesus readdresses his disciples to mark a shift in his speech to a new topic, in this case, to speak about not being afraid.

# they have no more that they can do

"they cannot cause any more harm" or "they cannot hurt you anymore"

# Fear the one who

The phrase "the one" refers to God. This could be stated. AT: "Fear God who" or "Fear God, because" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# after he has killed

"after he kills you" or "after he kills someone"

# has authority to throw you into hell

This is a general statement about God's authority to judge people. It does not mean this will happen to the disciples. AT: "has authority to throw people into hell"
