Jesus continues his teaching by telling a parable. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])

Jesus was probably still speaking to the entire crowd.

"grew a very good harvest"

# What will I do, because I do not have a place to store my crops?

# barns

buildings where farmers store the crops and food that they grow after it is harvested

# goods

"possessions"

# I will say to my soul

"I will say to myself" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
