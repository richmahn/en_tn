# Now

This word is used here to mark a break in the main story line. Here Jesus explains how the younger son went from having plenty to being in need.

# a severe famine spread through that country

"a drought occurred there and the entire country did not have enough food"

# to be in need

"to lack what he needed" or "to not have enough"
