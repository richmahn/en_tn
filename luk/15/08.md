# Connecting Statement:

Jesus begins telling another parable. It is about a woman with 10 sliver coins.

# Or what woman ... would not light a lamp ... and seek diligently until she has found it?

Jesus uses a question to remind the people that if any of them lost a silver coin, they would certainly look for it diligently. AT: "Any woman ... would certainly light a lamp ... and seek diligently until she has found it" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# if she were to lose

This is a hypothetical situation and not a story about a real woman. Some languages have ways of showing this. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])

# Even so

"In the same way" or "Just as people would rejoice with the woman"

# over one sinner who repents

"when one sinner repents"
