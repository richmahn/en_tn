## translationNotes

* (Jesus continues speaking to the religious leaders.)
* **What woman…would not light a lamp…and seek diligently until she has found it?** - This is a rhetorical question. Jesus was reminding the people that if any of them lost a silver coin, they would certainly look for it diligently. This sentence can be translated as “You know that if a woman had ten silver coins and lost one, she would light a lamp, sweep the floor and search carefully until she has found it.” (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **what woman** - This is a hypothetical situation and not a story about a real woman. Some languages have ways of showing this. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
* **Even so** - "In the same way" or "Just as people would rejoice with the woman"
* **over one sinner who repents** - This can be translated as "when one sinner repents."
