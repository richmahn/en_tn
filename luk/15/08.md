# Connecting Statement:

Jesus begins telling another parable. It is about a woman with 10 sliver coins.

# Or what woman ... would not light a lamp ... and seek diligently until she has found it?

Jesus uses a question to remind the people that if they lost a silver coin, they would certainly look for it diligently. Alternate translation: "Any woman ... would certainly light a lamp ... and seek diligently until she has found it." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# if she were to lose

This is a hypothetical situation and not a story about a real woman. Some languages have ways of showing this. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
