# So the young son left and came toward his father

"So he left that country and started going back to his father." The word "so" marks an event that happened because of something else that happened first. In this case, the young man was in need and had decided to go home.

# While he was still far away

"While he was still far away from his home" or "While he was still far away from his father's house"

# was moved with compassion

"had pity on him" or "loved him deeply from his heart"

# embraced him and kissed him

The father did this to show his son that he loved him and was glad that the son was coming home. If people think that it is strange or wrong for a man to embrace or hug and kiss his son, you can substitute a way that men in your culture show affection to their sons. AT: "welcomed him affectionately"
