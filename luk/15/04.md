# Which one of you ... will not leave ... until he finds it?

Jesus uses a question to remind the people that if any of them lost one of their sheep, they would certainly go looking for it. Alternate translation: "Each of you ... would certainly leave ... until he finds it"  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Which one of you, if he has a hundred sheep

Since the parable starts with "Which one of you," some languages would continue the parable in the second person. Alternate translation: "Which one of you, if you have a hundred sheep" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# hundred ... ninety-nine

"100 ... 99" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])
