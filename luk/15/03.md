## translationNotes

* **Jesus spoke this parable to them** - "To them" refers to the religious leaders.
* **Which one of you . . will not leave the ninety nine . . and go after . . until he finds it?** - This is a rhetorical question. Jesus was reminding the people that if any of them lost one of their sheep, they would certainly go looking for it. This can be translated as a statement as in the UDB. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]]) Some languages have ways of showing that this is a hypothetical situation and not a story about a particular person who has lost a sheep. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
* **Which one of you, if he has a hundred sheep** - Since the parable starts with "Which one of you", some languages would continue the parable in the second person "if you have a hundred sheep." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
