# General Information:

Jesus begins to tell several parables. These parables are hypothetical situations about things that anyone could experience. They are not about particular people. The first parable is about what a person would do if one of his sheep was lost. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])

# to them

Here "them" refers to the religious leaders.

# Which one of you ... will not leave ... until he finds it?

Jesus uses a question to remind the people that if any of them lost one of their sheep, they would certainly go looking for it. AT: "Each of you ... would certainly leave ... until he finds it"  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Which one of you, if he has a hundred sheep

Since the parable starts with "Which one of you," some languages would continue the parable in the second person. AT: "Which one of you, if you have a hundred sheep" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# hundred ... ninety-nine

"100 ... 99" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])

# lays it across his shoulders

This was the way shepherds carried sheep. This could be stated. AT: "lays it across his shoulders to carry it home" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
