# General Information:

Jesus begins to tell several parables. These parables are hypothetical situations about things that anyone could experience. They are not about particular people. The first parable is about what a person would do if one of his sheep was lost. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])

# to them

Here "them" refers to the religious leaders.
