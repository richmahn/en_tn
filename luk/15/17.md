## translationNotes

* Jesus continues his story.
* **came to himself** - "came to his senses" or "understood his situation" or "began to think clearly"
* **How many of my father's hired hands have more than enough food** - This is part of an exclamation. It can be translated as "All my father's hired servants have more than enough food to eat" (UDB).
* **dying from hunger** - This is probably not an exaggeration. The young man may really have been starving.
* **I have sinned against heaven** - "I have sinned against God." Jewish people sometimes avoided saying the word "God" and used the word "heaven" instead.
* **I am no more worthy to be called your son** - "I am not worthy to be called your son." A son has the legal right to inherit part of his father's property.
* **no more worthy** - "no longer worthy" (UDB). It means that in the past he was worthy, but now he was not.
* **make me as one of your hired servants** - "hire me as an employee" or "hire me and I will become one of your servants"
