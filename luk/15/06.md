(Jesus continues telling his parable)

## And when he comes to the house ##

"When the owner of the sheep comes home" or "And when you come home" (UDB). Refer to the owner of the sheep as you did in the previous verse.

## I say to you ##

The word "I" refers to Jesus. He is speaking to a group of people, so the word "you" is plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

## even so ##

"in the same way" or "as the shepherd and his friends and neighbors would rejoice"

## there will be joy in heaven ##

"everyone in heaven will rejoice"

## ninety-nine righteous persons who do not need to repent ##

"ninety nine people who think that they are righteous and do not need to repent." Jesus was not saying that there really are any righteous people.  Rather he was using a figure of speech called irony, because he was talking to people who assumed that they were righteous, but they were not. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])
