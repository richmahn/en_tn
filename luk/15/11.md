## translationNotes

* **A certain man** - This is the beginning of a parable. Introduce it in a way that is natural in your language. Some languages might say "There was a man who."
* **give me now** - The son wanted his father to give it to him immediately. Languages that have a command form that means that they want it done immediately should use that form.
* **the property I am due to inherit** - "the part of your wealth that you planned to give to me when you die"
