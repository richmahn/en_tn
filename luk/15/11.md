# Connecting Statement:

Jesus begins telling another parable. It is about a young man who asks his father for his part of the inheritance. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])

# A certain man

This introduces a new character in the parable. Some languages might say "There was a man who" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])

# give me

The son wanted his father to give it to him immediately. Languages that have a command form that means that they want it done immediately should use that form.

# the portion of the wealth that falls to me

"the part of your wealth that you planned for me to receive when you die"

# between them

"between his two sons"
