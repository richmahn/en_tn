# I am no longer worthy to be called your son

"I am not worthy to be called your son." This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "I am not worthy for you to call me son" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# make me as one of your hired servants

"hire me as an employee" or "hire me and I will become one of your servants." This is a request, not a command. It may be helpful to add "please" as the UST does.
