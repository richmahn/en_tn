# sinned against heaven

Jewish people sometimes avoided saying the word "God" and used the word "heaven" instead. See how you translated this in [Luke 15:18](../15/18.md). Alternate translation: "I have sinned against God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# I am no longer worthy to be called your son

This can be stated in active form. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Luke 15:18](../15/18.md). Alternate translation: "I am not worthy for you to call me your son" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
