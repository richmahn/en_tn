# ninety-nine righteous persons who do not need to repent

Jesus uses sarcasm to say that the Pharisees were wrong to think that they did not need to repent. Your language may have a different way to express this idea. AT: "ninety-nine persons like you, who think they are righteous and do not need to repent" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# ninety-nine

"99" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])
