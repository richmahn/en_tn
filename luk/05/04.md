## translationNotes

* **when he had finished speaking** - "when Jesus had finished teaching the people"
* **Master ** - The Greek word that is translated here as “Master” is a not the normal word for “Master.” This one refers to someone who has authority, and not to  someone who owns someone else. You could also translate it as "Boss" or "Foreman" or with a word that is commonly used to address a person in authority, such as “Sir.”
* **at your word** - "because of your word" or "because you have told me to do this"
* **motioned** - They were too far from shore to call so they made gestures, probably waving their arms.
* **they began to sink** - “the boats began to sink.” If necessary for understanding, the implied information could be made explicit as in, “the boats began to sink because the fish were so heavy." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
