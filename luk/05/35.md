# the days will come when

"soon" or "some day"

# the bridegroom will be taken away from them

Jesus is comparing himself to the bridegroom, and the disciples to the wedding attendants. He does not explain the metaphor, so the translation should explain it only if necessary. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
