# perceiving what they were thinking

This phrase indicates that they were reasoning silently, so that Jesus sensed rather then heard what they were thinking.

# Why are you questioning this in your hearts?

This can be stated in active form. AT: "You should not argue about this in your hearts." or "You should not doubt that I have the authority to forgive sins." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# in your hearts

This expression here means they were thinking this silently. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# Which is easier to say ... walk?

Jesus uses this question to connect his power to forgive with the miracle of healing that he is going to do. It can be stated in active form. AT: "It is easy to say, 'Your sins are forgiven,' but only God can cause this lame man to 'Get up and walk'" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# easier to say

The unspoken implication is that one thing is "easier to say because no one will know," but the other thing is "harder to say because everyone will know." People could not see if the mans sins were forgiven, but they would all know if he would get up and walk. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# the Son of Man

# I say to you
