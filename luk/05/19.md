# They could not find a way to bring him in because of the crowd, so

In some languages it might be more natural to reorder this. Alternate translation: "But because of the crowd of people, they could not find a way to bring the man inside. So"

# because of the crowd

It is clear that the reason they could not enter was that the crowd was so large that there was no room for them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# they went up to the housetop

Houses had flat roofs, and some houses had a ladder or staircase outside to make it easy to go up there. This can be stated. Alternate translation: "they went up to the flat roof of the house" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# right in front of Jesus

"directly in front of Jesus" or "immediately in front of Jesus"
