# Which is easier to say ... walk?

Jesus uses this question to make the scribes think about what might prove whether or not he could really forgive sins. Alternate translation: "I just said 'Your sins are forgiven you.' You may think that it is harder to say 'Get up and walk,' because the proof of whether or not I can heal the man will be shown by whether or not he gets up and walks." or "You may think that it is easier to say 'Your sins are forgiven' than it is to say 'Get up and walk.'" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# easier to say

The unspoken implication is that one thing is "easier to say because no one will know what has happened," but the other thing is "harder to say because everyone will know what has happened." People could not see if the man's sins were forgiven, but they would all know he was healed if he got up and walked. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
