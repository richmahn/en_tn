# new wine

"grape juice." This refers to wine that has not yet fermented.

# wineskins

These were bags made out of animal skins. They could also be called "wine bags" or "bags made of skin."

# the new wine would burst the skins

When the new wine ferments and expands, it breaks the old skins because they can no longer stretch out. Jesus' audience would have understood the information about the wine's fermenting and expanding. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# the wine would be spilled

This can be stated in active form. AT: "the wine would spill out of the bags" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
