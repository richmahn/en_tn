# make me clean ... Be clean

This refers to ceremonial cleanness, but it is understood that he is unclean because of the leprosy. He is really asking Jesus to heal him of his disease. This can be stated clearly. AT: "heal me from leprosy so I will be clean ... Be healed" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# the leprosy left him

"he no longer had leprosy"
