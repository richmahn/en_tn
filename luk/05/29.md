# Connecting Statement:

At the meal, Jesus speaks with the Pharisees and scribes.

# in his house

"in Levi's house"

# reclining at the table

The Greek style of eating at a feast was to lie on a couch and prop oneself up with the left arm on some pillows. AT: "eating together" or "eating at the table" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# to his disciples

"to Jesus' disciples"

# Why do you eat ... sinful people?

The Pharisees and scribes asked this question to express their disapproval that Jesus' disciples were eating with sinners. AT: "You should not eat with sinners!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# you eat and drink with ... sinful people

The Pharisees and scribes believed that religious people should separate themselves from people they considered to be sinners. The word "you" is plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# People who are well ... sick

Jesus expressed this as a proverb. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-proverbs]])

# physician

"medical doctor" or "doctor"

# only those who are sick

The words "need a physician" are understood from the phrase before this. AT: "only those who are sick need one" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# righteous people

Some people thought they were righteous. Jesus referred to them by the way they thought about themselves even though he knew that they were not righteous. AT: "people who think they are righteous" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])
