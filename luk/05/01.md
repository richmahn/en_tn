# listening to the word of God

Possible meanings are 1) "listening to the message God wanted them to hear" or 2) "listening to Jesus' message about God"

# the lake of Gennesaret

These words refer to the Sea of Galilee. Galilee was on the west side of the lake, and the land of Gennesaret was on the east side, so it was called by both names. Some English versions translate this as the proper name of the body of water, "the Lake of Gennesaret."
