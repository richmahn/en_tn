## translationNotes

* **they said to him** - "the religious leaders said to Jesus"
* **Can anyone make** - Jesus used this rhetorical question to cause the people to think about a situation that they already know. It can also be translated as "No one tells the wedding attendants of the bridegroom to fast while he is still with them." (See [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **wedding attendants** - "guests" or "friends." These are friends who celebrate with a man who is getting married.
* **But the days will come when** - "But some day" (UDB) or "But soon"
* **the bridegroom will be taken away from them** - This is a metaphor. Jesus was speaking about himself. This can be made explicit by adding "In the same way, my disciples cannot fast while I am with them." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
