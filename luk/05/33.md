## they said to him ##

"the religious leaders said to Jesus"

## Can anyone make ##

Jesus used this rhetorical question to cause the people to think about a situation that they already know. It can also be translated as "No one tells the wedding attendants of the bridegroom to fast while he is still with them." (See [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## wedding attendants ##

"guests" or "friends." These are friends who celebrate with a man who is getting married.

## But the days will come when ##

"But some day" (UDB) or "But soon"

## the bridegroom will be taken away from them ##

This is a metaphor. Jesus was speaking about himself. This can be made explicit by adding "In the same way, my disciples cannot fast while I am with them." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
