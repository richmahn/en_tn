# They said to him

"The religious leaders said to Jesus"

# Can anyone make ... with them?

Jesus used this question to cause the people to think about a situation that they already know. This can be written as a statement. AT: "No one tells the wedding attendants of the bridegroom to fast while he is still with them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# wedding attendants

"guests" or "friends." These are friends who celebrate with a man who is getting married.

# the wedding attendants of the bridegroom fast

Fasting is a sign of sadness. The religious leaders understood that the wedding attendants would not fast while the bridegroom was with them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# the days will come when

"soon" or "some day"

# the bridegroom will be taken away from them

Jesus is comparing himself to the bridegroom, and the disciples to the wedding attendants. He did not explain the metaphor, so the translation should explain it only when necessary. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
