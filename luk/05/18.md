* **mat** - This could be translated as "sleeping pad" or "bed" or "stretcher" or "couch."
* **was paralyzed** - "could not move himself"
* **And not finding by what way they might bring him in because of the crowd** - In some languages it might be more natural to reorder this. "But because of the crowd of people, they could not find a way to take the man inside. So...."
* **they went up to the housetop** - Houses had flat roofs, and some houses had a ladder or staircase outside to make it easy to go up there.
* **right in front of Jesus** - "directly in front of Jesus" or "immediately in front of Jesus"
