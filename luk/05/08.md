# fell down at Jesus' knees

Possible meanings are 1) "knelt down before Jesus" or 2) "bowed down at Jesus' feet" or 3) "lay down on the ground at Jesus' feet." Peter did not fall accidentally. He did this as a sign of humility and respect for Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])

# sinful man

The word here for "man" means "adult male" and not the more general "human being."
