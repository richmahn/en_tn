## fell down at Jesus knees ##

Possible meanings are 1) "bowed down at Jesus feet" or 2) "lay down on the ground at Jesus feet" or 3) "knelt down before Jesus." Peter did not fall accidentally. He did this as a sign of  humility and respect for Jesus.

## sinful man ##

The word here for "man" means "adult male" and not the more general "human being."

## you will catch men ##

The word “catch” is being used as a metaphor for gathering people to follow Christ. This could also be translated with the metaphor as in “you will fish for people.” It could also be translated without the metaphor as in “you will gather people” or “you will bring people in.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
