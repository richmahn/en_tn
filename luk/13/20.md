Jesus continues speaking in the synagogue.

## To what will I compare the Kingdom of God? ##

This is another rhetorical question that introduces what Jesus wants to talk about it. It can be translated as a statement as in the UDB.  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## It is like yeast ##

Only a little bit of yeast was needed to make a lot of dough rise. This can be made clear as it is in the UDB.

## three measures of flour ##

It can be translated as "a large amount of flour" or with a term that your culture uses for measuring a large amount of flour.
