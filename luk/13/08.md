Jesus continues telling his story.

This can be translated as "Do not do anything to the tree" or "Do not cut it down."

## year ##

See [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/biblicaltimeyear]].

## and put manure on it ##

"and put manure in the soil." Manure is animal dung. People put it in the ground to make the soil good for plants and trees.

## cut it down ##

This can be translated as "Let me cut it down" or "Tell me to cut it down." The servant was making a suggestion; he was not giving a command to the owner.
