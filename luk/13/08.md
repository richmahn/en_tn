# Connecting Statement:

Jesus finishes telling his parable. This is the end of the part of the story that began in [Luke 12:1](../12/01.md).

# Leave it alone

"Do not do anything to the tree" or "Do not cut it down"

# put manure on it

"put manure in the soil." Manure is animal dung. People put it in the ground to make the soil good for plants and trees. AT: "put fertilizer on it" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# If it bears fruit next year, good

It may be helpful to state what will happen. AT: "If it has figs on it next year, we can allow it to keep growing" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# cut it down

The servant was making a suggestion; he was not giving a command to the owner. AT: "Tell me to cut it down" or "I will cut it down"
