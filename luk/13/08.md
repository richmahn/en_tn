Jesus finishes telling his parable. This is the end of the story that began in [Luke 12:1](../12/01.md).

# Leave it alone

"Do not do anything to the tree" or "Do not cut it down"

# put manure on it

"put manure in the soil." Manure is animal dung. People put it in the ground to make the soil good for plants and trees. Alternate translation: "put fertilizer on it" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
