# No, I say

Jesus uses this question, which begins with the words "do you think they were worse sinners ... Jerusalem?", to challenge the understanding of the people. "you think that they were more sinful ... Jerusalem, but I say that they were not" or "I say that you should not think that they were more sinful ... Jerusalem" or "They certainly did not die because they were more sinful" or "You are wrong to think that their suffering proves that they were more sinful" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] or [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
