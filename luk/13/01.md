## translationNotes

* **At that time** - This phrase connects this event to the end of chapter 12 when Jesus was teaching a crowd of people.
* **whose blood Pilate mixed with their own sacrifices** - This is a figure of speech in which their death is spoken of in terms of their blood. It can be translated as "who were killed by Pilate when they were offering their sacrifices." Pilate probably ordered his soldiers to kill people rather than doing it himself. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]], [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
* **Do you think that these Galileans were more sinful** - "Were these Galileans more sinful" or "Does this prove that these Galileans were more sinful?" This is a rhetorical question. It can be translated as a statement: "You think that these Galileans were more sinful" or as a command "Do not think that these Galileans were more sinful" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **No, I tell you** - Jesus said "I tell you" here to emphasize "No." It can be translated as "Certainly not!" Possible meanings are "They certainly were not more sinful" or "Their suffering certainly does not prove that." It can be translated as "You are wrong to think that."
* **all of you will perish in the same way** - "all of you also will die." The phrase "in the same way" means "with the same result," not "by the same method."
* **perish** - "lose your life" or "die"
