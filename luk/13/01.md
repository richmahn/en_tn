# Connecting Statement:

Jesus is still speaking in front of the crowd. Some people in the crowd ask him a question and he begins to respond. This continues the story that begins in [Luke 12:1](../12/01.md).

# At that time

This phrase connects this event to the end of chapter 12, when Jesus was teaching a crowd of people.

# whose blood Pilate mixed with their own sacrifices

Here "blood" refers to the death of the Galileans. They were probably killed while they were offering their sacrifices. This could be stated explicitly as in the UDB. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# whose blood Pilate mixed with their own sacrifices

Pilate probably ordered his soldiers to kill people rather than doing it himself. Alternate translation: "whom Pilate's soldiers killed as they were sacrificing animals" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
