# The Lord answered him

"The Lord responded to the synagogue ruler"

# Hypocrites

Jesus speaks directly to the synagogue ruler, but the plural form includes the other religious rulers also. This can be stated explicitly. Alternate translation: "You and your fellow religious leaders are hypocrites" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# Does not each of you untie his ox or his donkey from the stall and lead it to drink on the Sabbath?

Jesus uses a question to get them to think about something they already knew. Alternate translation: "Every one of you unties his ox or his donkey from the stall and leads it to drink on the Sabbath." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# ox ... donkey

These are animals that people care for by giving them water.

# on the Sabbath

"on a Sabbath." Some languages would say "a Sabbath" because we do not know which particular Sabbath day it was.
