# Connecting Statement:

Jesus begins to tell a parable to the people in the synagogue. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])

# What is the kingdom of God like ... what can I compare it to?

Jesus uses two questions to introduce what he is about to teach. AT: "I will tell you what the kingdom of God is like ... what I can compare it to" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# what can I compare it to?

This is basically the same as the previous question. Some languages can use both questions, and some would use only one. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# It is like a mustard seed

Jesus compares the kingdom to a mustard seed. AT: "The kingdom of God is like a mustard seed" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# a mustard seed

Mustard seeds are very small seeds that grow into large plants. If these are not known, it can be translated with the name of another seed like it or simply as "a small seed" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

# threw into his garden

"planted in his garden." People planted some kinds of seeds by throwing them so that they scattered in the garden. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# a big tree

The word "big" is an exaggeration that contrasts the tree with the tiny seed. AT: "a very large shrub" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# birds of heaven

"birds of the sky." AT: "birds that fly in the sky" or "birds"
