# Connecting Statement:

Jesus begins to tell a parable to the people in the synagogue. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])

# What is the kingdom of God like ... what can I compare it to?

Jesus uses two questions to introduce what he is about to teach. AT: "I will tell you what the kingdom of God is like ... what I can compare it to." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# what can I compare it to?

This is basically the same as the previous question. Some languages can use both questions, and some would use only one. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
