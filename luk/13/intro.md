# Luke 13 General Notes #

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter ####

##### Assumed Knowledge #####
This chapter begins with references to two events, the details of which have not been preserved ([Luke 13:1-5](./01.md)). Despite this lack of knowledge, the teaching still makes sense to the modern reader. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### The use of paradox #####

A paradox is a seemingly absurd statement, which appears to contradict itself, but it is not absurd. A paradox occurs in this chapter: "the last are the first, and the first will be last" ([Luke 13:30](./28.md)).
