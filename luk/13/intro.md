# Luke 13 General Notes

#### Possible translation difficulties in this chapter

##### Unknown events

The people and Jesus speak about two events that they knew about but about which no one today knows anything except what Luke has written ([Luke 13:1-5](./01.md)). Your translation should tell only what Luke tells.

##### Paradox

A paradox is a true statement that appears to describe something impossible. A paradox occurs in this chapter: "those who are least important will be first, and those who are most important will be last" ([Luke 13:30](../../luk/13/30.md)).
