# Do you think that these Galileans were more sinful ... way? No, I tell you

"Were these Galileans more sinful ... way? No, I tell you" or "Does this prove that these Galileans were more sinful ... way? No, I tell you." Jesus uses this question to challenge the understanding of the people. Alternate translation: "You think that these Galileans were more sinful ... way, but they were not" or "Do not think that these Galileans were more sinful ... way" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
