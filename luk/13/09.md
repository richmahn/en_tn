# If it bears fruit next year, good

It may be helpful to state what will happen. Alternate translation: "If it has figs on it next year, we can allow it to keep growing" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# cut it down

The servant was making a suggestion; he was not giving a command to the owner. Alternate translation: "Tell me to cut it down" or "I will cut it down"
