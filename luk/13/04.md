# Or those

This is Jesus' second example of people who suffered. AT: "Or consider those" or "Think about those"

# eighteen people

"18 people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])

# Siloam

This is the name of an area in Jerusalem. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# do you think they were worse sinners ... Jerusalem?

"does this prove that they were more sinful ... Jerusalem?" Jesus uses this question to challenge the understanding of the people. AT: "do not think that they were more sinful ... Jerusalem" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# they were worse sinners

The crowd assumed that they died in this terrible way because they were especially sinful. This could be explicitly stated. AT: "they died because they were worse sinners" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# other men

"other people." The word here is the general term for a person. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])

# No, I say

Here "I say" emphasizes "No." It may be helpful to state Jesus' point clearly. AT: "They certainly did not die because they were more sinful" or "You are wrong to think that their suffering proves that they were more sinful" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# perish

"lose your life" or "die"
