# Do you think that these Galileans were more sinful ... way? No, I tell you

"Were these Galileans more sinful ... way? No, I tell you" or "Does this prove that these Galileans were more sinful ... way? No, I tell you." Jesus uses this question to challenge the understanding of the people. Alternate translation: "You think that these Galileans were more sinful ... way, but they were not" or "Do not think that these Galileans were more sinful ... way" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# No, I tell you

Here "I tell you" emphasizes "no." Alternate translation: "They certainly were not more sinful" or "You are wrong to think that their suffering proves that they were more sinful"

# all of you will perish in the same way

"all of you also will die." The phrase "in the same way" means they will experience the same result, not that they will die by the same method.

# perish

die
