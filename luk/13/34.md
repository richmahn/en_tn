# Connecting Statement:

Jesus finishes responding to the Pharisees. This is the end of this part of the story.

# Jerusalem, Jerusalem

Jesus speaks as if the people of Jerusalem are there listening to him. Jesus says this twice to show how sad he is for them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe]])

# who kills the prophets and stones those sent to you

If it would be strange to address the city, you can make it clear that Jesus was really addressing the people in the city: "you people who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# those sent to you

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "those God has sent to you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# How often I desired

"I so often desired." This is an exclamation and not a question.

# to gather your children

The people of Jerusalem are described as her "children." Alternate translation: "to gather your people" or "to gather the people of Jerusalem" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# the way a hen gathers her brood under her wings

This describes how a hen protects her young from harm by covering them with her wings. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
