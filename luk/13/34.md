(Jesus continues speaking with the Pharisees before going to Jerusalem.)

## Jerusalem, Jerusalem ##

Jesus speaks as if the people of Jerusalem were there listening to him. Jesus said this twice to show how sad he was for them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe]])

## who kills the prophets and stones those sent to you ##

If it would be strange to address the city, you can make it clear that Jesus was really addressing the people in the city: "you people who kill the prophets and stone those God has sent to you"

## to gather your children ##

"to gather your people" or "to gather you"

## the way a hen gathers her brood under her wings ##

This metaphor describes how a hen protects her young from harm by covering them with her wings. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## your house is abandoned ##

This is a metaphor. Possible meanings are 1) "God has abandoned you" or 2) "Your city is empty." It means that God has stopped protecting the people of Jerusalem, so enemies can attack them and drive them away. This is a prophecy about something that would happen soon. It can be translated as "your house will be abandoned" or "God will abandon you." (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]])

## you will not see me until you say ##

"you will not see me until the time comes when you will say" or "the next time you see me, you will say"
