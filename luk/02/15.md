# It came about

This phrase is used to mark a shift in the story to what the shepherds did after the angels left.

# from them

"from the shepherds"

# to each other

"to one another"

# Let us ... to us

Since the shepherds were speaking to one another, languages that have inclusive forms for "we" and "us" should use the inclusive form here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-inclusive]])

# Let us

"We should"

# this thing that has happened

This refers to the birth of the baby, and not to the appearance of the angels.
