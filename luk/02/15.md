## translationNotes

* **from them** - "from the shepherds"
* **to each other** - "to one another"
* **Let usâ€¦ to us** - Since the shepherds were speaking to one another, languages that have inclusive forms for "we" and "us" should use the inclusive form here. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive]])
