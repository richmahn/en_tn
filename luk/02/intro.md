# Luke 02 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetry in 2:14, 29-32.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### "There was no room for them" #####
Luke's account of the birth of Christ does not contain as many details as the other gospels. Luke must not have thought these details were significant, possibly because of the birth narratives in other gospels. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
