# Why were you searching for me?

Jesus uses two questions to mildly rebuke his parents, and to begin to tell them that he had a purpose from his heavenly Father that they did not understand. AT: "You did not need to be concerned about me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Did you not know ... business?

Jesus uses this second question to try to say that his parents should have known about the purpose for which his Father sent him. AT: "You should have known ... business" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# about my Father's business

Possible meanings are 1) Jesus meant these words literally, to indicate that he was doing the work that his Father had given him, or 2) these words are an idiom that indicate where Jesus was, "in my Father's house." Since the next verse says that his parents did not understand what he was telling them, it would be best not to explain it more.

# my Father's business

At age 12, Jesus, the Son of God, understood that God was his real Father (not Joseph, Mary's husband). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
