# they again went up

Jerusalem was higher than almost any other place in Israel, so it was normal for Israelites to speak of going up to Jerusalem.

# at the customary time

"at the normal time" or "as they did every year"

# the feast

This was another name for the Festival of the Passover, since it involved eating a ceremonial meal.
