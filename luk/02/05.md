# to register

This means to report to the officials there so they could include him in the count. Use a term for an official government count if possible.

# along with Mary

Mary traveled with Joseph from Nazareth. It is likely that women were also taxed, so Mary would have needed to travel and be registered as well. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])

# who was engaged to him

"his fiancee" or "who was promised to him." An engaged couple was considered legally married, but there would not have been physical intimacy between them.
