# while they were there

"Deliver is a metaphor. AT: "it was time to give birth to her baby" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# wrapped him in long strips of cloth

In some cultures mothers comfort their babies by wrapping them tightly in cloth or a blanket. AT: "wrapped cloths firmly around him" or "wrapped him tightly in a blanket" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# laid him in a manger

This was some kind of box or frame that people put hay or other food in for animals to eat. It was most likely clean and may have had something soft and dry like hay in it as a cushion for the baby. Animals were often kept near the home to keep them secure and to feed them easily. Mary and Joseph stayed in a room that was used for animals.

# there was no room for them in the inn

"there was no space for them to stay in the guest room." This was probably because so many people went to Bethlehem to register. Luke adds this as background information. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
