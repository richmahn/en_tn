# A light for revelation to the Gentiles

This metaphor means that the child will help people to understand God's will. The Gentiles understanding God's will is spoken of as if it were people using physical light to see a solid object. You may need to make explicit what it is that the Gentiles will see. AT: "This child will enable the Gentiles to understand God's will as light allows people to see clearly" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# for revelation

It may be necessary to state what is to be revealed. AT: "that will reveal God's truth" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# glory to your people Israel

"he will be the reason that glory will come to your people Israel"
