# treasuring them in her heart

A person who thinks is something is very valuable or precious is "treasuring" it. Mary considered the things she was told about her son to be very precious. Alternate translation: "carefully remembering them" or "joyfully remembering them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
