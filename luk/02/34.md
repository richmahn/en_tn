# said to Mary his mother

"said to the child's mother, Mary." Make sure it does not sound like Mary is the mother of Simeon.

# Behold

Simeon used this expression to tell Mary that what he is about to say is extremely important to her.

# this child is appointed for the downfall and rising up of many people in Israel

The words "downfall" and "rising up" express turning away from God and drawing closer to God. Alternate translation: "this child will cause many people in Israel to fall away from God or to rise closer to God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
