## translationNotes

* **When they saw him** - "When Mary and Joseph found Jesus"
* **Why have you treated us this way?** - This could be translated as "How could you do this?" This was somewhat of an indirect rebuke because he had not gone with them on the way back home. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **Why were you searching for me?** - This could be translated as "Why did you two keep looking for me in other places?"
* **Behold** - This phrase is often used to show the beginning of a new or important event. It also can be used to show where the action begins. If your language has a phrase that is used in this way, consider whether it would be natural to use it here.
* **Did you not know…?** - This starts a rhetorical question. Jesus was not trying to find out if they knew or not. Rather he was telling them something. It could be translated as “You should have known.” (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **at my Father's house** - Possible meanings are 1) "at my Father's house" or 2) "about my Father's business." In either case, when Jesus said "my Father" he was referring to God. If he meant "house," then he was referring to the temple. If he meant "business," he was referring to the work God had given him to do. But since the next verse says that his parents did not understand what he was telling them, it would be best not to explain it more.
