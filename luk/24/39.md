# Touch me and see ... see me having

Jesus asks them to confirm by touch that he is not a ghost. It may be helpful to combine and reorder these two sentences. Alternate translation: "Touch me and feel that I have flesh and bones that a ghost would not have"

# flesh and bones

This is a way of referring to the physical body.
