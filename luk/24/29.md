# they compelled him

You may need to make explicit what they compelled him to do. This is probably an exaggeration to show that they needed to speak with him for a long time before they could change his mind. The word "compel" means to use physical force, but it seems that they persuaded him using only words. Alternate translation: "they were able to persuade him to stay" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
