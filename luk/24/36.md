# General Information:

Jesus appears to the disciples. When the two men previously arrived at the house where the Eleven were, Jesus was not with them.

# Jesus himself

The word "himself" focuses on Jesus and the surprise of Jesus actually appearing to them. Most of them had not seen him after his resurrection. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns]])

# in the midst of them

"among them"

# Peace be to you

"May you have peace" or "May God give you peace!" The word "you" is plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# But they were terrified

"But" indicates a strong contrast. Jesus told them to be at peace, but they were very afraid instead.

# terrified and filled with fear

"startled and afraid." These two phrases mean about the same thing, and are used together to emphasize their fear. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# supposed that they saw a spirit

"thought that they were seeing a ghost." They did not yet truly understand that Jesus was really alive.

# a spirit

Here it refers to the spirit of a dead person.
