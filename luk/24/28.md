## As they drew near ##

"As they came near" (UDB)

## he acted as though he would go further ##

The two men understood from his actions that he was going on to another destination. Perhaps he kept walking on the road when they turned off to enter the gate into the village. There is no indication that Jesus deceived them with words.

## they compelled him ##

"They strongly urged him." The Greek word means to use physical force over an extended time, but it seems to be hyperbole. It took them some time and effort to persuade him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

## Jesus went in ##

"Jesus entered the house"

## stay with them ##

Use the dual form of "them."
