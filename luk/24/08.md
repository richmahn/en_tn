# the eleven and all the rest

"all the rest of the disciples that were with the eleven apostles"

# the eleven

This is Luke's first reference to the eleven, because Judas left the twelve and betrayed Jesus.

# Now

This word is used here to mark a break in the main storyline. Here Luke gives the names of some of the women who came from the tomb and told the apostles what had happened there.
