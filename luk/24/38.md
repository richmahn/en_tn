# Why are you troubled?

Jesus uses a question to comfort them. AT: "Do not be frightened." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Why do questions arise in your heart?

Jesus uses a question to mildly rebuke them. Jesus was telling them not to doubt that he was alive. The word "heart" refers to their thinking. AT: "Do not doubt in your minds!" or "Stop doubting!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# Touch me and see ... see me having

Jesus asks them to confirm by touch that he is not a ghost. It may be helpful to combine and reorder these two sentences. AT: "Touch me and feel that I have flesh and bones that a ghost would not have"

# flesh and bones

This is a way of referring to the physical body.

# his hands and his feet

It is understood that his hands and feet contained the nail marks from his crucifixion that would prove it was really Jesus. This can be made explicit. AT: "the wounds in his hands and his feet"
