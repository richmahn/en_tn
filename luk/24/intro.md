# Luke 24 General Notes #

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Faith of the women #####
It appears Luke purposefully contrasts the faith of the women in this chapter with the faith of the twelve disciples.

##### Resurrection #####
Luke goes to great lengths in this chapter to defend Jesus's physical resurrection from the dead. Luke shows that it was not possible for another person to have died in Jesus' place. He also shows that the resurrection was not a metaphor. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/resurrection]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### Son of Man #####

Jesus refers to himself as the "Son of Man." Not every language allows a person to refer to himself in the third person.

##### "On the third day" #####
Jesus is said to have risen from the dead on the third day. He died on a Friday afternoon (before sunset) and was raised on a Sunday. In ancient Israel, a day began and ended at sunset. They also counted any part of the day as a "day." 

##### Two men in bright shining robes #####
Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John all wrote about angels in white clothing with the women at Jesus' tomb. Two of the authors called them men, but that is only because the angels were in human form. Two of the authors wrote about two angels, but the other two authors wrote about only one of them. It is best to translate each of these passages as it appears in the ULB without trying to make the passages all say exactly the same thing. (See: [Matthew 28:1-2](../../mat/28/01.md), [Mark 16:5](../../mrk/16/05.md) and [Luke 24:4](../../luk/24/04.md) and [John 20:12](../../jhn/20/11.md))
