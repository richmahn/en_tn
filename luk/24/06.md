* **remember how** - "remember what"
* **he spoke to you** - Jesus had said this at least a week earlier.
* **to you** - The word "you" is plural. It refers to the women and the other disciples. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
* **that the Son of Man** - This is the beginning of an indirect quote. It can also be translated with a direct quote as in the UDB. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotations]])
* **the Son of Man must be** - "it was necessary for the Son of Man to be." This is something that would certainly happen because God had already decided that it would happen.
* **delivered up into the hands of** - "handed over to" or "given over to." The sentence can also be translated with an active verb: "They will have to hand me, the Son of Man, over to sinful men" (UDB) or "Someone will certainly enable sinful men to seize the Son of Man.
