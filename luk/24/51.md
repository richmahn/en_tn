# It happened

"It came about." This introduces a new event in the story. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])

# while he was blessing them

"while Jesus was asking God to do good to them"

# was carried

Since Luke does not specify who carried Jesus up, we do not know if it was God himself or one or more angels. If your language would have to specify who did the carrying, it would be better to use "went" instead, as the UDB does. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
