# Connecting Statement:

The two men continue responding to Jesus.

# who would free Israel

The Romans ruled over the Jews. AT: "who would free the Israelites from our Roman enemies" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# Yes, and besides all this

This introduces another reason why they believed Jesus would not free Israel. AT: "Now that does not seem possible because"

# the third day

The Jews counted any portion of a day as a day. Therefore, the day Jesus was raised was the "third day" because it followed the day of his burial and the Sabbath day. See how you translated this in [Luke 24:7](./06.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])

# since all these things happened

"since all the many actions have taken place that led up to the death of Jesus"
