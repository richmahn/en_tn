# But this message seemed like idle talk to the apostles

This is an idiom that means "began to act." Whether Peter was sitting or standing when he decided to act is not important. AT: "started out" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# stooping

AT: "the linen cloths in which Jesus' body had been wrapped, but Jesus was not there" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
