# another man said

The reader should be able to infer that these people spoke directly to the servant whom the master had sent out ([Luke 14:17](../14/17.md)). Alternate translation: "another man sent a message, saying" or "another man told the servant to say" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# married a wife

Use an expression that is natural in your language. Some languages may say "gotten married" or "taken a wife."
