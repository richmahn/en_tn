# The first said to him ... Another said ... another man said

The reader should be able to infer that these people spoke directly to the servant whom the master had sent out ([Luke 14:17](../14/17.md)). Alternate translation: "The first sent him a message, saying ... Another sent a message, saying ... another man sent a message, saying" or "The first told the servant to say ... Another told the servant to say ... another man told the servant to say" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
