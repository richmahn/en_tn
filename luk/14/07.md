# Connecting Statement:

Jesus continues to speak to the guests at the house of the Pharisee who had invited him to a meal.

# those who were invited

It may be helpful to identify these people, and to state this in active form. AT: "those whom the leader of the Pharisees had invited to the meal" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# the seats of honor

"the seats for honored people" or "the seats for important people"

# When you ... than you ... say to you ... you will proceed

These occurrences of "you" are singular. Jesus is speaking to the group as if to each individual person. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
