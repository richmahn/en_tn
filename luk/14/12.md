# Connecting Statement:

Jesus continues speaking at the Pharisee's house, but addresses his host directly.

# the man who had invited him

"the Pharisee who had invited him to his house for a meal"

# When you give

"you" is singular because Jesus is speaking directly to the Pharisee that invited him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# do not invite

This probably does not mean they can never invite these people. More likely it means they should invite others as well. AT: "do not only invite" or "do not always invite"

# as they may

"because they might"

# you will be repaid

This can be stated in active form. AT: "in this way they will repay you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
