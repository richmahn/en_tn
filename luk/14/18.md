# General Information:

All of the people who were invited gave the servant excuses about why they could not come to the banquet.

# Connecting Statement:

Jesus continues telling his parable.

# to make excuses

"to say why they could not come to the dinner"

# The first said to him

The reader should be able to infer that these people spoke directly to the servant whom the master had sent out ([Luke 14:17](../14/17.md)). Alternate translation: "The first sent him a message, saying" or "The first told the servant to say" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# Please excuse me

"Please forgive me" or "Please accept my apology"
