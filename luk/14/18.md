# General Information:

All of the people who were invited gave the servant excuses about why they could not come to the banquet.

# Connecting Statement:

Jesus continues telling his parable.

# to make excuses

"to say why they could not come to the dinner"

# The first said to him ... Another said ... another man said

The reader should be able to infer that these people spoke directly to the servant whom the master had sent out ([Luke 14:17](./17.md)). Alternate translation: "The first sent him a message, saying ... Another sent a message, saying ... another man sent a message, saying" or "The first told the servant to say ... Another told the servant to say ... another man told the servant to say" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# Please excuse me

"Please forgive me" or "Please accept my apology"
