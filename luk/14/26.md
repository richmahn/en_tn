# If anyone comes to me and does not hate his own father ... he cannot be my disciple

Here, "hate" is an exaggeration for the lesser love people are to show to people other than Jesus. AT: "If anyone comes to me and does not love me more than he loves his father ... he cannot be my disciple" or "Only if a person loves me more than he loves his own father ... can he be my disciple" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
