# General Information:

Jesus continues to explain to the crowd that it is important to count the cost of being a disciple.

# For which of you who desires to build a tower does not first sit down and count the cost to calculate if he has what he needs to complete it?

Jesus uses this question to prove that people count the cost of a project before they begin it. AT: "If a person wanted to build a tower, he would certainly first sit down and determine if he had enough money to complete it." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# tower

This may have been a watchtower. AT: "a tall building" or "a high lookout platform."

# Otherwise

It may be helpful to give more information. AT: "If he does not first count the cost" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# when he has laid a foundation

"when he has built a base" or "when he has completed the first part of the building"

# is not able to finish

It is understood that he was not able to finish because he did not have enough money. This could be stated. AT: "does not have enough money to be able to finish" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
