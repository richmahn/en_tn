## translationNotes

* (Jesus continues speaking to the crowds.)
* **For which of you** - This is the beginning of a rhetorical question. Jesus used it to get people to think about what they would do in a particular situation. It can also be translated as a statement: If one of you wanted to build a tower, you would certainly first sit down and count the cost." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **tower** - This may have been a watchtower in a vineyard. Some languages might translate it as "a tall building" or "a high lookout platform."
* **Otherwise** - "If he does not first count the cost"
* **when he has laid the foundation** - "when he has built the base." It can also be translated as "when he started building."
