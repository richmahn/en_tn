# General Information:

Jesus continues to explain to the crowd that it is important to count the cost of being a disciple.

# For which of you who desires to build a tower does not first sit down and count the cost to calculate if he has what he needs to complete it?

Jesus uses this question to prove that people count the cost of a project before they begin it. Alternate translation: "If a person wanted to build a tower, he would certainly first sit down and determine if he had enough money to complete it." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# tower

This may have been a watchtower. "a tall building" or "a high lookout platform"
