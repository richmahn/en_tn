# Whoever does not carry his own cross and come after me cannot be my disciple

This could be stated with positive verbs. Alternate translation: "If anyone wants to be my disciple, he must carry his own cross and follow me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])

# carry his own cross

Jesus does not mean every Christian must be crucified. The Romans often made people carry their own crosses before they crucified them as a sign of their submission to Rome. This metaphor means they must submit to God and be willing to suffer in any way to be Jesus' disciples.
