# General Information:

Jesus begins to teach the crowd that was traveling with him.

# If anyone comes to me and does not hate his own father ... he cannot be my disciple

Here, "hate" is an exaggeration for the lesser love people are to show to people other than Jesus. AT: "If anyone comes to me and does not love me more than he loves his father ... he cannot be my disciple" or "Only if a person loves me more than he loves his own father ... can he be my disciple" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])

# Whoever does not carry his own cross and come after me cannot be my disciple

This could be stated with positive verbs. AT: "If anyone wants to be my disciple, he must carry his own cross and follow me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])

# carry his own cross

Jesus does not mean every Christian must be crucified. The Romans often made people carry their own crosses before they crucified them as a sign of their submission to Rome. This metaphor means they must submit to God and be willing to suffer in any way to be Jesus' disciples. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
