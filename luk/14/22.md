# The servant said

It may be necessary to state clearly the implied information that the servant did what the master commanded him. Alternate translation: "After the servant went out and did that, he came back and said" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# what you commanded has been done

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "I have done what you commanded" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
