# Luke 14 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Verse 3 says, "Jesus asked the experts in the Jewish law and the Pharisees, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath, or not?" Many times, the Pharisees got angry with Jesus for healing on the Sabbath. In this passage, Jesus dumbfounds the Pharisees. It was normally the Pharisees who tried to trap Jesus.

##### Abrupt transitions #####

This chapter abruptly shifts from one topic to another. There are several large sections comprised of multiple verses and other short teachings contained in a single verse.

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter ####

##### Allegory #####

Luke [Luke 14:15-24](./15.md) probably functions as an extended metaphor. The kingdom of God can be represented as a wedding feast or dinner. This metaphor would then signify that people reject Jesus for a variety of unimportant reasons and because of this miss out on the great blessing of Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/kingdomofgod]])

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### The use of paradox #####

This is a statement that seems absurd, that appears to contradict itself. A paradox occurs in this chapter: "for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted" ([Luke 14:11](./10.md)).
