# manure pile

People use manure to fertilize gardens and fields. Salt without taste is so useless it is not even worth mixing with manure. AT: "compost heap" or "fertilizer"

# It is thrown away

This can be stated in active form. AT: "Someone just throws it away" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# He who has ears to hear, let him hear

It may be more natural in some languages to use the second person: "You who have ears to hear, hear" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# He who has ears to hear

Possible meanings are 1) "Everyone," since normal people have ears, or 2) "Whoever has the ability to understand," which refers to those who are willing to listen to God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# let him hear

"he should listen well" or "he should pay attention to what I say"
