# manure pile

People use manure to fertilize gardens and fields. Salt without taste is so useless it is not even worth mixing with manure. Alternate translation: "compost heap" or "fertilizer"

# It is thrown away

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "Someone just throws it away" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# He who has ears to hear, let him hear

Jesus is emphasizing that what he has just said is important and may take some effort to understand and put into practice. The phrase "ears to hear" here is a metonym for the willingness to understand and obey. See how you translated this phrase in [Luke 8:8](../08/08.md). Alternate translation: "Let the one who is willing to listen, listen" or "The one who is willing to understand, let him understand and obey" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# He who ... let him 

Since Jesus is speaking directly to his audience, you may prefer to use the second person here. See how you translated this phrase in [Luke 8:8](../08/08.md). Alternate translation: "If you are willing to listen, listen" or "If you are willing to understand, then understand and obey" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
