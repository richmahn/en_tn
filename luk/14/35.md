# manure pile

People use manure to fertilize gardens and fields. Salt without taste is so useless it is not even worth mixing with manure. Alternate translation: "compost heap" or "fertilizer"

# It is thrown away

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "Someone just throws it away" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# He who has ears to hear, let him hear

Jesus is emphasizing that what he has just said is important. You may need to use the second person. The word "ear" here is a metonym for either 1) the ability to hear his message. Alternate translation: "Let everyone who can hear what I am saying listen carefully" or "Since you can hear what I am saying, listen carefully" or 2) the desire to listen and obey. Alternate translation: "Let the one who is willing to listen, listen" or "Since you are willing to listen, listen" See how these words are translated in [Luke 8:8](../08/08.md). (See [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# let him hear

"he should listen well" or "he should pay attention to what I say"
