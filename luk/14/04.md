## translationNotes

* **But they kept silent** - The religious leaders refused to answer Jesus' question.
* **Jesus put his hands on the man** - "Jesus touched the man"
* **Which of you who has a son or an ox â€¦ will not immediately pull him out** - This was a rhetorical question. He wanted them to admit that they would help their son or ox, even on the Sabbath, so therefore, it was right for him to heal people even on the Sabbath. This can be translated as "If one of you had a son or an ox that fell into a well on the Sabbath, you would surely pull him out immediately." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]]).
* **They were not able to answer** - This can be translated as "they had nothing to say." It's not that they did not know the answer to Jesus' question. Rather, they knew that he was right and they did not want to say anything about it.
