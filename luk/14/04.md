# But they kept silent

The religious leaders refused to answer Jesus' question.

# So Jesus took hold of him

"So Jesus took hold of the man who suffered from edema"

# Which of you who has a son or an ox ... will not immediately pull him out?

Jesus uses a question because he wanted them to admit that they would help their son or ox, even on the Sabbath. Therefore, it was right for him to heal people even on the Sabbath. AT: "If one of you has a son or an ox ... you would surely pull him out immediately" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# They were not able to give an answer

They knew the answer and that Jesus was right, but they did not want to admit that he was correct. AT: "They had nothing to say"
