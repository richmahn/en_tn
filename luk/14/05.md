# Which of you who has a son or an ox ... will not immediately pull him out?

Jesus uses a question because he wanted them to admit that they would help their son or ox, even on the Sabbath. Therefore, it was right for him to heal people even on the Sabbath. AT: "If one of you has a son or an ox ... you would surely pull him out immediately." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
