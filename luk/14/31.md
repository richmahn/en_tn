# General Information:

Jesus continues to explain to the crowd that it is important to count the cost of being a disciple.

# Or

Jesus used this word to introduce another situation where people count the cost before making a decision.

# what king ... will not sit down first and take advice ... men?

Jesus uses another question to teach the crowd about counting the cost. AT: "you know that a king ... would sit down first and take counsel ... men." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# take advice

Possible meanings are 1) "think carefully " or 2) "listen to his advisors."

# ten thousand ... twenty thousand

"10,000 ... 20,000" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])

# If not

It may be helpful to state more information. AT: "If he realizes that he will not be able to defeat the other king" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# conditions of peace

"terms to end the war" or "what the other king wants him to do in order to end the war"

# any one of you who does not give up all that he has cannot be my disciple

This can be stated with positive verbs. AT: "only those of you who give up all that you have can be my disciples" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])

# give up all that he has

"leave behind all that he has"
