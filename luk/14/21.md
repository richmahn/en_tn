## translationNotes

* Jesus continues telling his parable.
* **became angry** - "became angry with the people he had invited"
* **The servant said** - It may be necessary to state clearly the implied information that the servant did what the master commanded him as  in the UDB: "After the servant went out and did that, he came back and said."  (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
