Jesus finishes speaking to the crowd.

# For see

# the days are coming

"there will soon be a time"

# in which they will say

"when people will say"

# the barren

"women who have not given birth to children"

# the wombs that did not bear ... the breasts that did not nurse

These clauses are used to more fully describe "the barren." Those women neither gave birth nor nursed children. It may be helpful to combine these together with "the barren." Alternate translation: "the women who have never given birth to children or nursed babies"

# they

This can refer to either the Romans or the Jewish leaders, or no one in particular.
