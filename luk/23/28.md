# turning to them

This indicates that Jesus turned to face the women and address them directly.

# Daughters of Jerusalem

The "daughter" of a city means the women of the city. This was not rude. It was a normal form of address to a group of women from one location. AT: "You women who are from Jerusalem"

# do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children

The person is a metonym for what happens to the person. AT: "do not weep about the bad things that will happen to me. Instead, weep because worse things will happen to you and to your children" or "you are weeping because bad things are happening to me, but you will weep even more when worse things happen to you and your children" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
