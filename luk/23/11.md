## translationNotes

* **clothed him in beautiful clothing** - The translation should not imply that this was done to honor or care for Jesus. They did it to mock Jesus and to make fun of him.
* **And Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day.** - The implied information is that they became friends because Herod appreciated Pilate allowing him to judge Jesus. You could make this explicit: "And Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day because Pilate had sent Jesus to Herod for judgment." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
* **Before** - "Before that day"
