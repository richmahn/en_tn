## And Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day. ##

The implied information is that they became friends because Herod appreciated Pilate allowing him to judge Jesus. You could make this explicit: "And Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day because Pilate had sent Jesus to Herod for judgment." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
