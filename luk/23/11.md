# Herod with his soldiers

"Herod and his soldiers"

# dressed him in elegant clothes

"put beautiful clothes on him." The translation should not imply that this was done to honor or care for Jesus. They did it to mock Jesus and to make fun of him.

# Herod and Pilate had become friends with each other that very day

# before this they had been enemies with each other
