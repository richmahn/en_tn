# heard this

"heard that Jesus began to teach in Galilee"

# he asked whether the man was a Galilean

Pilate wanted to know from which area Jesus came because he wanted to have a lower-ranking government official judge Jesus. If Jesus were from Galilee, Pilate could have Herod judge Jesus because Herod had authority over Galilee.

# the man

This refers to Jesus.
