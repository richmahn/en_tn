# General Information:

This is the next part of the story. Joseph asks Pilate for Jesus' body. These verses give us background information about who Joseph is. It may be helpful to reorder some of this information with a verse bridge as the UDB does. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge]])

# Behold, there was a man

The word "behold" alerts us to a new person in the story. Your language may have a way of doing this. AT: "There was a man who was" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])

# the Council

"the Jewish Council"

# a good and righteous man

This can be translated as a new sentence. AT: "He was a good and righteous man"

# with the decision of the Council and their action

What the decision was can be stated clearly. AT: "with the Council's decision to kill Jesus and their action" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])

# the Judean town of Arimathea

Here "Judean town" means it was located in Judea. AT: "the town called Arimathea, which is in Judea" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
