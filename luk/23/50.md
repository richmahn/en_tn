# General Information:

Joseph asks Pilate for Jesus' body. These verses give us background information about who Joseph is. It may be helpful to reorder some of this information with a verse bridge, as the UDB does. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge]])

# Behold, there was a man

The word "behold" alerts us to a new person in the story. Your language may have a way of doing this. AT: "There was a man who was" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])

# the Council

"the Jewish Council"
