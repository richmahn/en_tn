# General Information:

Verse 19 tells us background information about who Barabbas is. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])

# they cried out all together

"All the people in the crowd shouted"

# Away with this man, and release

"Take this man away! Release." They are asking him to have his soldiers kill Jesus. Alternate translation: "Take this man away and execute him! Release" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# release to us

"us" refers to the crowd only, and not to Pilate and his soldiers. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
