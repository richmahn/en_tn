# Luke 23 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

The ULB sets the last line of this chapter apart because it is more connected with chapter 24 than with chapter 23.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Accuse #####

The chief priests and scribes accused Jesus of doing evil because they wanted Pilate to kill Jesus. But they were accusing him falsely, because Jesus had never done what they accused him of doing.

##### "The curtain of the temple was split in two" #####

The curtain in the temple was an important symbol that showed that people needed to have someone speak to God for them. They could not speak to God directly because all people are sinful and God hates sin. God split the curtain to show that Jesus' people can now speak to God directly because Jesus has paid for their sins.

##### The tomb #####

The tomb in which Jesus was buried ([Luke 23:53](./52.md)) was the kind of tomb in which wealthy Jewish families buried their dead. It was an actual room cut into a rock. It had a flat place on one side where they could place the body after they had put oil and spices on it and wrapped it in cloth. Then they would roll a large rock in front of the tomb so no one could see inside or enter.

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### "I find no fault in this man" #####

Pilate was saying that he did not know of any reason why he should punish Jesus because Jesus had not broken any laws. Pilate was not saying that Jesus was perfect.
