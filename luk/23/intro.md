# Luke 23 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

The ULB sets the last line of this chapter apart because it is more connected with chapter 24 than with chapter 23.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### "They began to accuse him" #####
These men did not just accuse Jesus of doing evil, their accusations were false. They perverted the facts to try to get Pilate to sentence Jesus to death.

##### "The curtain of the temple was split in two" #####

This is an important symbol. The curtain symbolically separated God and man. God could not be directly accessed because of his holiness. The death of Christ changed this. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/holy]])

##### Burial Practices #####

It was customary in ancient Israel to bury an important person in a tomb with a large rock to seal it.

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### "I find no fault in this man." #####
After one simple question, it appears that Pilate declares Jesus innocent too quickly. This is because Luke omits many of the details of Jesus' interaction with Pilate. This information is contained in the other gospels.
