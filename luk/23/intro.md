# Luke 23 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

The ULB sets the last line of this chapter apart because it is more connected with chapter 24 than with chapter 23.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### "They began to accuse him" #####
These men did not just accuse Jesus of doing evil, their accusations were false. They perverted the facts to try to get Pilate to sentence Jesus to death.

##### "The curtain of the temple was split in two" #####

This is an important symbol. The curtain symbolically separated God and man. God could not be directly accessed because of his holiness. The death of Christ changed this. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/holy]])

##### The tomb #####

The tomb in which Jesus was buried ([Luke 23:53](./52.md)) was the kind of tomb in which wealthy Jewish families buried their dead. It was an actual room cut into a rock. It had a flat place on one side where they could place the body after they had put oil and spices on it and wrapped it in cloth. Then they would roll a large rock in front of the tomb so no one could see inside or enter.

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### "I find no fault in this man." #####
After one simple question, it appears that Pilate declares Jesus innocent too quickly. This is because Luke omits many of the details of Jesus' interaction with Pilate. This information is contained in the other gospels.
