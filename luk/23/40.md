The criminal uses a question to scold the other criminal. AT: "You should fear God, because they are punishing you the same way they are punishing him" or "You must have no fear of God, since you mock him while you are hanging on a cross the same as he is" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
