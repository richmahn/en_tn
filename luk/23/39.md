# insulted him

"insulted Jesus"

# Are you not the Christ? Save yourself

The criminal uses a question to mock Jesus. Alternate translation: "You claim to be the Christ. Save yourself" or "If you really were the Christ, you would save yourself" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Save yourself and us

The criminal did not really think that Jesus could rescue them from the cross. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])
