# Other men, two criminals, were led away with him to be put to death

This can be stated in active form. AT: "The soldiers led away with Jesus two criminals to execute them also" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# Other men, two criminals

"Two other men who were criminals" or "two criminals." Luke avoids saying "other criminals" because Jesus was innocent, even though he was treated as a criminal. Luke calls the other two men criminals, but not Jesus.
