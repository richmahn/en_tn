# called together the chief priests and the rulers and the crowd of people

"called the chief priests and the rulers and the crowd of people to come meet together"

# the crowd of people

It is not likely that Pilate asked a crowd to come. The crowd was probably still there waiting to see what would happen to Jesus. Alternate translation: "the crowd that was still there" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
