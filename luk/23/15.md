## translationNotes

* **No, nor does Herod** - "Even Herod does not think he is guilty" (UDB)
* **for** - "because" or "we know this because"
* **he sent him back to us** - "Herod sent Jesus to return to us." The word "us" here is exclusive: it refers to Pilate and his soldiers, not to the priests and scribes who had gone to Herod with Jesus, nor to the crowd.
* **nothing worthy of death has been done by him** - This can be translated in active voice: "He has not done anything to deserve a death sentence." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
* **I will therefore punish him** - Because Pilate had found no fault in Jesus he should have released him without punishment. It is not necessary to try to make this statement fit logically into the translation. Pilate punished Jesus, whom he knew to be innocent, only because he was afraid of the crowd.
* **Now** - This could be translated as "Pilate said this because" (UDB).
* **he was obligated to release to them one prisoner** - Pilate was required to do this by political custom. This implied information can be stated explicitly: "he was obligated by custom to release to them one prisoner." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
