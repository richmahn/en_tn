# Connecting Statement:

Pilate continues speaking to the Jewish leaders and to the crowd.

# No, nor does Herod

It may be helpful to add information that is not included in the short statement. AT: "Even Herod does not think he is guilty" or "Even Herod thinks he is innocent" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# for

"because" or "we know this because"

# he sent him back to us

"Herod sent Jesus to return to us." The word "us" refers to Pilate, his soldiers, and the priests and scribes, but not those who were listening to Pilate. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

# nothing worthy of death has been done by him

This can be stated in active form. AT: "he has not done anything to deserve a death sentence" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# I will therefore punish him

Because Pilate had found no fault in Jesus he should have released him without punishment. It is not necessary to try to make this statement fit logically into the translation. Pilate punished Jesus, whom he knew to be innocent, only because he was afraid of the crowd.
