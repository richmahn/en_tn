# He said to them a third time

"Pilate said to the crowd again, for the third time" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])

# what evil has this man done?

Pilate uses this question to cause the crowd to understand that Jesus is innocent. Alternate translation: "this man has not done anything wrong!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# I have found nothing deserving the death penalty in him

"He has done nothing for which he deserves to die"

# after punishing him, I will release him

As in [Luke 23:16](./16.md), Pilate should have released Jesus without punishment because he was innocent. However, he offered to punish Jesus to appease the crowd.

# I will release him

"I will set him free"
