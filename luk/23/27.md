# A great crowd

"A large crowd"

# great crowd of the people, and of women

The woman were part of the large crowd, and not a separate crowd.

# mourned for him

"mourned for Jesus"

# were following him

This does not mean that they were Jesus' disciples. It simply means they were walking along behind him.

# turning to them

This indicates that Jesus turned to face the women and address them directly.

# Daughters of Jerusalem

The "daughter" of a city means the women of the city. This was not rude. It was a normal form of address to a group of women from one location. AT: "You women who are from Jerusalem"

# do not weep for me, but

Jesus uses hyperbole to say that they had more reason to weep for their own situation than for his. AT: "do not cry about my situation. Instead," or "you are weeping for me, but even worse things are going to happen to you, so" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# weep for yourselves and for your children

The person is a metonym for what will happen to the person. AT: "cry about what is going to happen to you and to your children" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
