## translationNotes

* **See** - This indicates a significant change in the ministry of Jesus as he goes to Jerusalem for the final time.
* **the prophets** - This refers to the Old Testament prophets.
* **will be accomplished** - "will happen" or "will occur"
* **Son of Man** - Jesus speaks of himself as "the Son of Man" and uses "he" to refer to himself.
* **on the third day** - This refers to the third day after his death. However, the disciples did not yet understand this, so it is best not to add this explanation when translating this verse.
