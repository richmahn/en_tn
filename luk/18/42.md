# Receive your sight

This is a command, but Jesus is not commanding the man to do anything. Jesus is healing the man by commanding him to be healed. AT: "You will now receive your sight" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])

# Your faith has healed you

These words are a metonym. It was because of the man's faith that Jesus healed the man. AT: "I have healed you because you believed in me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
