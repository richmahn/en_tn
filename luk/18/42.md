# Receive your sight

This is an imperative, but it did not required the man to do anything. He was healed as a result of the command. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])

# Your faith has healed you

The man's faith was the reason he was healed, but not the method of his healing. AT: "I have healed you because you believed in me"

# glorifying God

"giving glory to God" or "praising God"
