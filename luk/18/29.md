# Truly, I say to you

Jesus uses this expression to stress the importance of what he is about to say.

# there is no one who

This expression is intended to include not only the disciples, but also everyone else who has made the same sacrifices.

# there is no one who has left ... who will not receive

This could be stated in positive form. AT: "everyone who has left ... will receive" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
