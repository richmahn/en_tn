## translationNotes

* **he too became very sad** - This phrase is absent from many Greek manuscripts and so often omitted from English translations.
* **a camel to go through a needleâ€™s eye** - It is impossible for a camel to fit through the eye of a needle. Therefore, it appears that Jesus may have been using hyperbole to say "it is extremely difficult for a rich man to be saved." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
* **needle's eye** - The needle's eye is the hole in a sewing needle through which the thread is passed.
