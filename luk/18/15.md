## translationNotes

* **touch them, but** - This could also be translated as separate sentences: "touch them. But."
* **rebuked** - The disciples expressed strong disapproval of the parents who were bringing their babies to Jesus.
* **Permit** - "Allow"
* **little children** - This is a different word than "infants" which was used for the babies that the people were bringing. "Little children" were somewhat older than "infants."
* **do not forbid them** - "do not hinder them" or "do not prevent the little children"
* **belongs to such ones** - This could also be translated "belongs to people who are like these little children."
* **Truly I say to you** - "Surely I say to you." Jesus used this expression to emphasize the importance of what he was about to say.
* **as a child** - This is a simile that compares the attitude of a child to people who are entering the kingdom of God. The points of similarity are humility and trust. The simile means "they will humbly receive God's kingdom just as a child is humble and trusting." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
* **enter it** - This could also be translated as "enter into God's kingdom" (UDB).
