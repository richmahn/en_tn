# Connecting Statement:

This is the next event in the part of the story which began in [Luke 17:20](../17/20.md). Jesus welcomes the children and talks about them.

# touch them, but

This could also be translated as separate sentences: "touch them. But"

# they rebuked them

"the disciples tried to stop the parents from bringing their children to Jesus"

# Jesus called them to him

"Jesus told the people to bring their infants to him"

# Permit the little children to come to me, and do not forbid them

These two sentences have similar meaning and they are combined for emphasis. Some languages emphasize in a different way. AT: "You must certainly allow the children to come to me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# belongs to such ones

This could be stated as a simile. AT: "belongs to people who are like these little children" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# Truly I say to you

"Surely I say to you." Jesus used this expression to emphasize the importance of what he was about to say.

# whoever will not receive the kingdom of God like a child will definitely not enter it

God requires people to accept his rule over them with trust and humility. AT: "whoever wants to enter God's kingdom must receive it with trust and humility like a child" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
