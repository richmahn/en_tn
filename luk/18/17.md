# Truly I say to you

"Surely I say to you." Jesus used this expression to emphasize the importance of what he was about to say.

# whoever will not receive the kingdom of God like a child will definitely not enter it

God requires people to accept his rule over them with trust and humility. Alternate translation: "whoever wants to enter God's kingdom must receive it with trust and humility like a child" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
