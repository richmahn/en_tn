## translationNotes

* **what must I do** - "what do I need to do" or "what is required of me"
* **inherit** - "become the rightful owner of." This usually refers to the property of someone who has died. Luke uses this metaphor to show that the ruler understood that eternal life could not be earned, and that not everyone will live eternally. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **No one is good, except God alone** - This could also be translated as two sentences: "No person is truly good. God alone is good."
* **do not kill** - "do not murder"
* **All these things** - "All of these commandments"
