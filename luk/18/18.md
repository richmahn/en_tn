# Connecting Statement:

This is the next event in the part of the story which began in [Luke 17:20](../17/20.md). Jesus begins to talk with a ruler about entering the kingdom of heaven.

# A certain ruler

This introduces a new character in the story. It only identifies him by his position. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])

# what must I do

"what do I need to do" or "what is required of me"

# inherit eternal life

"receive life that does not end." The term "inherit" usually refers to the property that a man left to his children when he dies. Therefore, this metaphor may mean he understood himself to be a child of God and desired for God to give him eternal life. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Why do you call me good? No one is good, except God alone

Jesus is asking the ruler if he realizes that calling Jesus "good" implies that Jesus is God. AT: "You know that no one is good except God alone. Why do you call me good?" or "You know that no one is good except God alone. Do you understand what you are saying when you call me good?" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# do not kill

"do not murder"

# All these things

"All of these commandments"
