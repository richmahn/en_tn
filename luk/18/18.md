# Connecting Statement:

This is the next event in the part of the story which began in [Luke 17:20](../17/20.md). Jesus begins to talk with a ruler about entering the kingdom of heaven.

# A certain ruler

This introduces a new character in the story. It only identifies him by his position. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])

# what must I do

"what do I need to do" or "what is required of me"

# inherit eternal life

"receive life that does not end." The term "inherit" usually refers to the property that a man left to his children when he dies. Therefore, this metaphor may mean he understood himself to be a child of God and desired for God to give him eternal life. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
