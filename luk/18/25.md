# a camel to go through a needle's eye

It is impossible for a camel to fit through the eye of a needle. Jesus was probably using hyperbole to mean it is extremely difficult for a rich man to enter God's kingdom. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# needle's eye

The needle's eye is the hole in a sewing needle through which the thread is passed.
