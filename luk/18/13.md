(Jesus continues to speak to these people.)

## lift up his eyes to heaven ##

This is a metaphor that means "look toward heaven" or "look upward." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## hit his breast ##

This is a physical expression of great sorrow, and shows this man's repentance and humility.

## God be merciful to me a sinner ##

This could be translated as "God, please have mercy on me even though I am a terrible sinner," or "God please be merciful to me. I am a great sinner."

## this man ##

<b>this man<b>- "the tax collector"

## rather than the other ##

"rather than the other man" or "instead of the other man" or "and not the other man." This can also be translated as "but the other man was not justified."

## because everyone who exalts himself... ##

With this phrase, Jesus switches from the story to state the general principle that the story illustrates.

## exalted ##

"greatly honored"
