# Connecting Statement:

Jesus begins to tell a parable as he continues to teach his disciples. This is the same part of the story that began in [Luke 17:20](../17/20.md). Verse 1 gives us a description of the parable Jesus is about to tell. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])

# Then he

"Then Jesus"

# discouraged, saying

A new sentence could begin here: "discouraged. He said"

# a certain city

Here "certain city" is a way to let the listener know that the narrative that follows takes place in a city, but the name of the city itself is not important. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-intro]])

# did not respect people

"did not care about other people"
