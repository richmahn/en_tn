# Connecting Statement:

Jesus begins to tell a parable as he continues to teach his disciples. This is the same part of the story that began in [Luke 17:20](../17/20.md). Verse 1 gives us a description of the parable Jesus is about to tell. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])

# Then he

"Then Jesus"
