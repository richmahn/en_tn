# Now there was a widow

Jesus uses this phrase to introduce a new character to the story. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])

# widow

A widow is a woman whose husband has died. Jesus' hearers would have thought of her as a person who had no one to protect her from those who wanted to harm her.

# she came often to him

The word "him" refers to the judge.

# Help me get justice against

"Give me a just ruling against"

# my opponent

"my enemy" or "the person who is trying to harm me." This is an opponent in a lawsuit. It is not clear whether the widow is suing the man or the man is suing the widow.

# man

This refers here to "people" in general. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])

# causes me trouble

"bothers me"

# wear me out

"exhaust me"

# by her constant coming

"by continually coming to me"
