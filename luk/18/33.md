# him ... him ... he

Jesus speaks of himself as "the Son of Man." Alternate translation: "me ... me ... I" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# on the third day

This refers to the third day after his death. However, the disciples did not yet understand this, so it is best not to add this explanation when translating this verse. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
