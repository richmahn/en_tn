# Jesus called them to him

"Jesus told the people to bring their infants to him"

# Permit the little children to come to me, and do not forbid them

These two sentences have similar meaning and they are combined for emphasis. Some languages emphasize in a different way. Alternate translation: "You must certainly allow the children to come to me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# belongs to such ones

This could be stated as a simile. Alternate translation: "belongs to people who are like these little children" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
