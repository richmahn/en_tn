# General Information:

Jesus has finished telling his parable and is now commenting about it to his disciples.

# Listen to what the unjust judge says

"Think about what the unjust judge just said." Translate this in a way that people will understand that Jesus has already told what the judge said.

# Now

This word indicates that Jesus has ended the parable and has started explaining its meaning.

# will not God also bring ... night?

Jesus uses a question to teach the disciples. This can be a statement. AT: "God will also certainly ... night!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# his chosen ones

"the people he has chosen"

# Will he delay long over them?

Jesus uses a question to teach the disciples. This can be a statement. AT: "He will certainly not delay long over them!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# the Son of Man comes

Jesus is referring to himself. AT: "I, the Son of Man come"

# will he indeed find faith on the earth?

The purpose of the parable is to encourage the disciples to keep believing and pray. However, the form of the question indicates that the expected answer is negative. AT: "he will find many on earth who do not believe" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# will he indeed find

If you translated "the Son of Man" as "I, the Son of Man" you will need to say here "will I indeed find."
