# Those hearing it said

"The people who listening to Jesus said"

# Then who can be saved?

It is possible that they were asking for an answer. But it is more likely that they used the question to emphasize their surprise at what Jesus said. Alternate translation: "Then no one can be saved from sin!" or in active form: "Then God will not save anyone!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
