Jesus continues to tell the teachers of the law how they sin against God.

## you have taken away the key of knowledge ##

This is a metaphor. It means "you have prevented people from entering into the place where God's truth is stored." It can be translated as a simile as in the UDB. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]], [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

## the key ##

This represents the means of access, as to a house or storage room.

## you do not enter in yourselves ##

"You yourselves do not go in in order to get knowledge." This metaphor means "You yourselves do make use of the knowledge." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
