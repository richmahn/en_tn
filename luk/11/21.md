# When a strong man ... man's possessions

This speaks about Jesus defeating Satan and his demons as if Jesus was a stronger man who takes what belongs to a strong man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# takes away the armor from the man

"removes the man's weapons and protection"

# his goods are safe

"no one can steal his things"

# plunders the man's possessions

"steals his possessions" or "takes away anything that he wants"

# The one who is not with me is against me, and the one who does not gather with me scatters

This refers to any person or any group of people. "Anyone who is not with me is against me, and anyone who does not gather with me scatters" or "Those who are not with me are against me, and those who do not gather with me scatter"

# one who is not with me

"one who does not support me" or "one who does not work with me"

# is against me

"works against me"

# the one who does not gather with me scatters

Jesus is referring to gathering disciples who follow him. This can be stated explicitly. AT: "anyone who does not cause people to come and follow me causes them to go away from me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
