## translationNotes

* Jesus continues to speak to the crowd about demons.
* **When a strong man...** - This story is a metaphor. The image of a strong man being attacked from outside is the same as Jesus is attacking Satan's kingdom from outside by casting out the demons. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **his goods are safe** - "no one can steal his things" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **plunders the man's possessions** - This can be translated as "steals his possessions" or "takes away anything that he wants." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **who is not with me** - "who does not support me" or "who does not work with me"
* **is against me** - "works against me." This refers to those who said Jesus was working together with Satan.
