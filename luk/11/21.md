# When a strong man ... man's possessions

This speaks about Jesus defeating Satan and his demons as if Jesus was a stronger man who takes what belongs to a strong man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# takes away the armor from the man

"removes the man's weapons and protection"

# his goods are safe

"no one can steal his things"

# plunders the man's possessions

"steals his possessions" or "takes away anything that he wants"

# one who is not with me

"people who do not support me" or "people who do not work with me"

# is against me

"works against me." This refers to those who said Jesus was working together with Satan.

# the one who does not gather with me scatters

Jesus is referring to gathering disciples who follow him. This can be stated explicitly. AT: "anyone who does not cause people to come and follow me causes them to go away from me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
