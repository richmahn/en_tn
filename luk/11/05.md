Jesus continues to teach his disciples about prayer.

# lend to me three loaves of bread

"let me borrow three loaves of bread" or "give me three loaves of bread and I will pay you later." The host does not have any food ready to give to his guest.

# three loaves of bread

Bread is often used to represent food in general. Alternate translation: "enough cooked food for a meal" or "enough prepared food for a person to eat" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
