# For just as Jonah became a sign ... so too ... this generation

This means that Jesus will serve as a sign from God for the Jews of that day in exactly the same way as Jonah served as a sign from God to the people of Nineveh.

# Son of Man

Jesus is referring to himself.

# this generation

"the people living today"
