## translationNotes

* (Jesus continues to teach the crowds.)
* Jesus did not intend for everyone in the crowd to understand this teaching. Therefore, it might be best to simply translate the images, rather than explaining them.
* **a lamp** - This was a small bowl with a wick and olive oil for fuel. The important thing is that it gave light.
* **puts it in a dark closet** - "hides it in a closet"
* **on a lamp stand** - "on a table" or "they put it on a shelf"
* **Your eye is the lamp of the body** - This has several figures of speech. They eye is a metonym for vision, which is a metaphor for understanding. The body is a synecdoche for a person's life. It can be translated as "Your eye is the lamp of your life" or "Your vision is the lamp of your life." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]] and [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]]) Since Jesus was saying something that is true of everyone, it can be translated as "The eye is the lamp of a person's body."
* **When your eye is good** - "When your vision is good" or "when you see well"
* **the whole body is filled with light** - Light is a metaphor for truth. This metaphor means "your whole life is filled with the light of truth" or "his whole life is filled with truth."
* **When your eye is bad, your body is full of darkness.** - Darkness is a metaphor for falsehood. This metaphor means "When your vision is bad, your whole life is full of falsehood."
