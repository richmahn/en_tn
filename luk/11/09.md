## translationNotes

* (Jesus continues to teach his disciples about prayer.)
* **ask … seek … knock** - Jesus gave these commands to encourage his disciples to pray contiually. Use the form of "you" that would be most appropriate in this context. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]]). These commands can be translated as "keep asking … keep seeking … keep knocking".
* **ask** - Some languages may require more information with this verb. It can be translated as "Ask God for what you need." "Seek what you need from God" and "Knock on the door."
* **it will be given to you** - This can be translated with an active verb: "God will give it to you" or "you will receive it." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
* **knock** - To knock at a door is to hit it a few times to let a person inside the house know you are standing outside. It can also be translated using the way people in your culture show that they have arrived, such as "call out" or "cough" or "clap."
* **it will be opened to you** - This can be translated with an active verb: "God will open the door for you" or "God will welcome you inside."
