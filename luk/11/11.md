# Connecting Statement:

Jesus finishes teaching his disciples about prayer.

# Which father among you ... a fish?

Jesus uses questions to teach his disciples. It could also be written as a statement. AT: "None of you fathers ... a fish" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Or if he asks ... scorpion to him?

Jesus uses questions to teach his disciples. It could also be written as a statement. AT: "And you would never give him a scorpion if he asks for an egg" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# scorpion

A scorpion is similar to a spider, but it has a tail with a poisonous sting. If scorpions are not known where you are, you could translate this as "poisonous spider" or "spider that stings" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

# if you who are evil know

"since you who are evil know" or "even though you are sinful, you know"

# how much more will your Father from heaven give the Holy Spirit ... him?

"how much more certain is it that your Father in heaven will give the Holy Spirit ... him?" Jesus again uses a question to teach his disciples. This can be translated as a statement. AT: "you can be sure that your Father from heaven will give the Holy Spirit ... him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
