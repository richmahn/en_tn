## translationNotes

* Jesus continues teaching his disciples about prayer.
* Jesus asks three rhetorical questions with the same meaning: just as fathers give good gifts to their children who ask for things, God gives good gifts to us when we ask him. (See [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]]).
* **And which of you â€¦ will give him a stone instead** - This can be translated as "If your son were to ask you for a loaf, would you give him a stone instead?" or "If your son were to ask you for a loaf to eat, you certainly would not give him a stone instead!" (See [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]]).
* **loaf** - "loaf of bread" or "bread roll." If your people do not normally eat bread, you could translate this as "piece of cooked food" or "vegetable." Jesus was suggesting a possible situation; he was not talking about bread in particular. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
* **or instead of a fish, a snake?** - "Or if he were to ask for a fish, would you give him a snake instead?" (See [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]]).
* **scorpion** - A scorpion is similar to a spider, but it has a tail with a poisonous sting. If scorpions are not known where you are, you could translate this as "poisonous spider" or "spider that stings."
* **if you who are evil know** - "since you who are evil know" or "even though you are sinful, you know."
* **how much more will your Father from heaven give the Holy Spirit** - "how much more certain is it that your Father in heaven will give the Holy Spirit." This rhetorical question can also be translated as "you can be sure that your Father from heaven will give the Holy Spirit."
