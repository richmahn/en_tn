# General Information:

This is the end of the part of the story where Jesus ate at the Pharisee's house. These verses tell the reader what happens after the main part of the story ends.

# After Jesus left there

"After Jesus left the Pharisee's house"

# argued with him ... trying to trap him

The scribes and Pharisees did not argue in order to defend their views, but to try to trap Jesus so they could accuse him of breaking the law of God.

# trying to trap him in his own words

This means they wanted Jesus to say something wrong so that they could accuse him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
