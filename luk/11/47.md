# So you are witnesses and you consent

Jesus is rebuking the Pharisees and teachers of the law. They knew about the murder of the prophets, but did not condemn their ancestors for killing them. AT: "So, rather than denouncing them, you confirm and agree" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
