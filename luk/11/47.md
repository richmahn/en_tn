## translationNotes

* (Jesus continues to speak to the teachers of the law.)
* **and yet** - This calls attention to the contrast between their honoring of the prophets while ignoring the fact that their ancestors murdered them.
* **So you are witnesses and consent to the works of your ancestors** - This is an implied rebuke: "but you did not denounce them." They knew about the murder of the prophets, but did not condemn their ancestors for killing them. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
