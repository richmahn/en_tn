# you are like unmarked graves that people walk over without knowing it

The Pharisees are like unmarked graves because they look ceremonially clean, but they cause people around them to become unclean. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# unmarked graves

These graves were holes dug in the ground where a dead body was buried. They did not have the white stones that people normally place over graves so that others would see them.

# without knowing it

When the Jews walked over a grave, they would become ceremonially unclean. These unmarked graves caused them to accidentally do that. This can be stated clearly. AT: "without realizing it and become ceremonially unclean" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
