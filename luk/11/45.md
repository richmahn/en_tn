## translationNotes

* **you burden men with burdens too hard to carry** - "You put burdens on people that are too heavy for them to carry." This is a metaphor in which giving people many rules is compared to giving them heavy things to carry. It can be translated as "You burden people by giving them too many rules to follow."  (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **but you do not even touch those burdens with one of your own fingers** - "but you do not even use one of your fingers to help them carry the burdens." It means "but you do not do anything at all to help them obey your rules."
