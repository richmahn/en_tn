Jesus makes it clear that he intended to condemn the actions of the teachers of the law along with the Pharisees.

# you put people under burdens that are hard to carry

"you put burdens on people that are too heavy and they cannot carry them." Jesus speaks about someone giving people many rules as if the person were giving them heavy things to carry. AT: "you burden people by giving them too many rules to follow" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
