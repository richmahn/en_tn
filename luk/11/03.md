# Connecting Statement:

Jesus continues to teach his disciples how to pray.

# Give us

This is an imperative, but it should be translated as a request, rather than as a command. It may be helpful to add something such as "please" to them to make this clear. Alternate translation: "Please give us"

# our daily bread

Bread was an inexpensive food that people ate every day. It is used here to refer to food in general. Alternate translation: "the food we need each day" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
