## translationNotes

* (Jesus continues to speak to the crowd about demons.)
* **If Satan is divided against himself** - "If Satan and members of his kingdom are fighting among themselves."
* **how will his kingdom stand** - This is a rhetorical question. It could be translated as a statement: "Satan's kingdom cannot stand," or "Satan's kingdom will fall apart." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **For you say I cast out demons by Beelzebul** - "For you say that it is by the power of Beelzebul that that I make demons leave people." The next part of his argument can be stated explicitly: "that would mean that Satan is divided against himself." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
* **by whom do your followers drive them out** - "by whose power do you followers force demons to leave people." This is a rhetorical question. It can be translated as "then we must agree that your followers also drive out demons by Beelzebub's power." The implied evaluation of that statement can be made explicit: "But we know that that is not true."
* **They will be your judges** - "Your followers who cast out demons by God's power will judge you for saying that I cast out demons by Beelzebub's power."
* **by the finger of God** - The "finger of God" refers to God's power. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
* **then the kingdom of God has come to you** - "this shows that God's kingdom has come to you"
