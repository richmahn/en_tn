# So you are witnesses and you consent

Jesus is rebuking the Pharisees and teachers of the law. They know about the murder of the prophets, but do not condemn their ancestors for killing them. AT: "So, rather than denouncing them, you confirm and agree" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
