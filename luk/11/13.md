# if you who are evil know

"since you who are evil know" or "even though you are sinful, you know"

# how much more will your Father from heaven give the Holy Spirit ... him?

"how much more certain is it that your Father in heaven will give the Holy Spirit ... him?" Jesus again uses a question to teach his disciples. This can be translated as a statement. AT: "you can be sure that your Father from heaven will give the Holy Spirit ... him." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
