# Connecting Statement:

Jesus finishes speaking to the Pharisee.

# the front seats

"the best seats"

# respectful greetings

"you like people to greet you with special honor"

# you are like unmarked graves that people walk over without knowing it

The Pharisees were like unmarked graves because they looked ceremonially clean, but they caused people around them to become unclean. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# unmarked graves

These graves were holes dug in the ground where a dead body was buried. They did not have the white stones that people normally place over graves so that others would see them.

# without knowing it

When the Jews walked over a grave, they would become ceremonially unclean. These unmarked graves caused them to accidentally do that. This can be stated clearly. AT: "without realizing it and become ceremonially unclean" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
