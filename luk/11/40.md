# You senseless men

This expression can refer to men or women, even though all of the Pharisees to whom Jesus was speaking to here were men.

# Did not the one who made the outside also make the inside?

Jesus uses a question to rebuke the Pharisees for not understanding that what is in their hearts matters to God. This can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: "The one who made the outside also made the inside!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
