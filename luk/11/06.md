# Connecting Statement:

Jesus finishes asking a question that begins in verse 5.

# since a friend ... to set before him'?

Jesus uses a question to teach the disciples. "Suppose one of you has ... to set before him'." or "Suppose you have ... to set before him'." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# just came in from the road

It is implied that the visitor has come far from his home. Alternate translation: "was traveling and just came to my house" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# anything to set before him

"any food ready to give him"
