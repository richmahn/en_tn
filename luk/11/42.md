## translationNotes

* Jesus continues to speak to the Pharisees.
* **you tithe the mint and rue and every other garden herb** - "you give God one tenth of your mint and rue and other herbs from your garden."  Jesus was giving an example of how extreme the Pharisees were in giving a tenth of their income.
* **mint and rue** - These are herbs. People put just a little bit of these leaves into their other food to give it flavor.  If people do not know what mint and rue are, you can use the name of herbs they know or a general expression such as "herbs."
* **every other garden herb** - Possible meanings are 1) "every other vegetable" 2) "every other garden herb" or 3) "every other garden plant."
* **without failing to do the other things also** - This could be translated as a positive statement: "and to always do the other good things as well."
