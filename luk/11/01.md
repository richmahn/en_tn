## translationNotes

* **It happened** - This phrase is used here to mark the beginning of a new part of the story. If your language has a way for doing this, you could consider using it here.
* **when he finished praying** - In some languages it is more natural to use Jesus' name rather than the pronoun "he." It may also be more natural to state that Jesus was praying before saying "when he finished praying." (See UDB)
