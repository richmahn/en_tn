# General Information:

Jesus begins to speak to the Pharisee using a metaphor. He compares the way they clean cups and bowls to how they clean themselves. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the outside of cups and bowls

Washing of the outside of containers was a part of the ritual practices of the Pharisees. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# but the inside of you is filled with greed and evil

This part of the metaphor contrasts the careful way they clean the outside of the dishes with the way they ignore their own internal condition. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
