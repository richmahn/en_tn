## translationNotes

* **the outside of cups and bowls** - Washing of the outside of containers was a part of the ritual practices of the Pharisees.
* **but the inside of you is filled with greed and wickedness** - This is a metaphor that compares the way they ignore the inside of the container to how they ignore their own internal condition. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **Did not the one who made the outside also make the inside?** - This is a rhetorical question. Jesus was rebuking the Pharisees for not understanding that what is in their hearts matters to God. It can be translated as a statement as it is in the UDB. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **give to the poor what is inside** - "Give what is inside to poor people." The meaning is "focus on using the inside for God instead of only cleaning the outside."
