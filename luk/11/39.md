# General Information:

Jesus begins to speak to the Pharisee using a metaphor. He compares the way they clean cups and bowls to how they clean themselves. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the outside of cups and bowls

Washing of the outside of containers was a part of the ritual practices of the Pharisees. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# but the inside of you is filled with greed and evil

This part of the metaphor contrasts the careful way they clean the outside of the dishes with the way they ignore their own internal condition. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# You senseless men

This expression can refer to men or women, even though all of the Pharisees to whom Jesus was speaking to here were men.

# Did not the one who made the outside also make the inside?

Jesus uses a question to rebuke the Pharisees for not understanding that what is in their hearts matters to God. This can be translated as a statement. AT: "The one who made the outside also made the inside!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Give to the poor what is inside

This refers to what they should be doing with their cups and bowls. AT: "Give to the poor what is inside your cups and bowls" or "Be generous to the poor" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# all things will be clean for you

"you will be completely clean" or "you will be clean both inside and outside"
