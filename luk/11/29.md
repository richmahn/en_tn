# Connecting Statement:

Jesus continues teaching the crowd.

# As the crowds were increasing

"As more people were joining the crowd" or "As the crowd was growing larger"

# This generation is an evil generation. It seeks ... to it

Here "generation" refers to the people in it. AT: "The people living at this time are evil people. They seek ... to them" or "You people living at this time are evil people. You seek ... to you"

# It seeks a sign

The information about what kind of sign it seeks can be made explicit. AT: "It wants me to perform a miracle as proof that I have come from God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# no sign will be given to it

This can be stated in active form. AT: "God will not give it a sign" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# the sign of Jonah

"what happened to Jonah" or "the miracle that God did for Jonah"

# For just as Jonah became a sign ... so too ... this generation

This means that Jesus will serve as a sign from God for the Jews of that day in exactly the same way as Jonah served as a sign from God to the people of Nineveh.

# Son of Man

Jesus is referring to himself.

# this generation

"the people living today"
