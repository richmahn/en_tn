## This generation ##

"The people living at this time" (UDB)

## It seeks a sign ##

"They want me to give them a sign" or "Many of you want me to give you a sign." The information about what kind of sign they wanted can be made explicit as in the UDB. (See:  [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

## no sign will be given to it ##

"God will not give them a sign" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## the sign of Jonah ##

This could be translated as "what happened to Jonah" or "the miracle that God did for Jonah" (UDB).

## For just as Jonah became a sign...so too ##

This means that Jesus will serve as a sign from God for the the Jews of that day in exactly the same way as Jonah served as a sign from God to the people of Nineveh.

## Son of Man ##

Jesus is referring to himself.
