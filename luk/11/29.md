## translationNotes

* **This generation** - "The people living at this time" (UDB)
* **It seeks a sign** - "They want me to give them a sign" or "Many of you want me to give you a sign." The information about what kind of sign they wanted can be made explicit as in the UDB. (See:  [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
* **no sign will be given to it** - "God will not give them a sign" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
* **the sign of Jonah** - This could be translated as "what happened to Jonah" or "the miracle that God did for Jonah" (UDB).
* **For just as Jonah became a sign...so too** - This means that Jesus will serve as a sign from God for the the Jews of that day in exactly the same way as Jonah served as a sign from God to the people of Nineveh.
* **Son of Man** - Jesus is referring to himself.
