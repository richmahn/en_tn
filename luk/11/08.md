# I say to you

Jesus was speaking to the disciples. The word "you" is plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# give bread to you because you are ... your ... you ... you need

Jesus addresses the disciples as if they were the ones asking for bread. Alternate translation: "give bread to him because he is ... his ... he ... he needs"

# because of your shameless persistence

The phrase can be reworded to eliminate the abstract noun "persistence." Alternate translation: "because you persist shamelessly" or "because you boldly continue to ask him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
