Jesus continues speaking to his disciples about the future.

## resolve in your heart ##

"make up your mind" or "decide firmly"

## not to prepare your defense ##

"not to figure out what you will say in order to defend yourself against their accusations"

## words and wisdom ##

"words of wisdom" or "wise words." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])

## I will give you words and wisdom ##

"I will tell you what wise things to say"

## which all your adversaries will not be able to resist or contradict ##

This means "Your adversaries will not be able to argue against these words or say that these words are wrong."
