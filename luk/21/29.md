# Connecting Statement:

As Jesus continues teaching his disciples, he tells them a parable. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])

# When they sprout buds

"When new leaves start to grow"

# summer is already near

"summer is about to start." Summer in Israel follows the sprouting of fig tree leaves and is the time when the figs ripen. AT: "harvest time is ready to start" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# So also, when you see these things happening

The appearance of the signs that Jesus just described signal the arrival of the kingdom of God just as appearance of the leaves of the fig tree signal the arrival of summer.

# the kingdom of God is near

"God will soon establish his kingdom." AT: "God will soon rule as king" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
