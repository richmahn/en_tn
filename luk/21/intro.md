# Luke 21 General Notes

#### Structure and formatting

Jesus told his disciples much about what would happen before he returned.

#### Special concepts in this chapter

##### "For many will come in my name, saying, 'I am he,'"

Jesus taught that before he returned many people would falsely claim to be him returning. It will also be a time when many people will hate Jesus' followers and even want to kill them.

##### "Until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled"

The Jews spoke of the time between when the Babylonians forced their ancestors to go to Babylon and the time when the Messiah would come as "the times of the Gentiles," the time when the Gentiles would rule over the Jews.

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter

##### "Son of Man"

Jesus refers to himself as the "Son of Man" in this chapter ([Luke 21:27](../../luk/21/27.md)). Your language may not allow people to speak of themselves as if they were speaking about someone else. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sonofman]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
