# Truly I say to you

This means that what Jesus was about to say was very important.

# I say to you

Jesus was talking to his disciples. The word "you" is plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# this poor widow put in more than all of them

God considers her gift, a small amount of money, more significant than the large amounts of money the men gave. AT: "the small gift of this widow is more valuable than the larger gifts of the rich men" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
