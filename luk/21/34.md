The "heart" here refers to the mind and thoughts of the person. AT: "so that you are not occupied" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# are not burdened

Jesus here speaks of the following sins as if they were a physical weight that a person had to carry. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the effects of drinking

"what drinking too much wine will do to you" or "drunkenness"

# the worries of life

"worrying too much about this life"

# then that day will close on you suddenly like a trap

Just as a trap closes on an animal when the animal does not expect it, that day will happen when people do not expect it. AT: "that day will happen when you are not expecting it, as when a trap closes suddenly on an animal" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# that day will close on you suddenly

The coming of that day will appear to be sudden and unexpected to those who are not ready and watching for it. AT: "life. For if you are not careful, that day will close on you suddenly" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# that day

This refers to the day when the Messiah returns. AT: "the day when the Son of Man comes"
