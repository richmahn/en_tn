Jesus is referring to himself. AT: "me, the Son Man, coming" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# coming in a cloud

"coming down in a cloud"

# with power and great glory

Here "power" probably refers to his authority to judge the world. Here "glory" may refer to a bright light. God sometimes shows his greatness with a very bright light. AT: "powerfully and gloriously" or "and he will be powerful and very glorious"
