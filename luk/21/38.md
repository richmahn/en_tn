# All of the people

The word "all" is probably an exaggeration to emphasize that the crowd was very large. Alternate translation: "A very large number of people in the city" or "Almost everyone in the city" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# came early in the morning

"would come early each morning"

# to hear him
