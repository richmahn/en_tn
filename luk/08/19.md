# brothers

These were Jesus' younger brothersâ€”the other sons of Mary and Joseph who were born after Jesus. Since the Father of Jesus was God, and their father was Joseph, they were technically his half-brothers. This detail is not normally translated.

# He was told

This can be stated in active form. AT: "People told him" or "Someone told him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# wanting to see you

"and they want to see you"

# My mother and my brothers are those who hear the word of God and do it

This metaphor expresses that the people who were coming to listen to Jesus were as important to him as his own family was. AT: "Those who hear the word of God and obey it are like a mother and brothers to me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the word of God

"the message God has spoken"
