## translationNotes

* (Jesus continues to explain the meaning of the parable.)
* **they become choked with the caresâ€¦** - "the cares and riches and pleasures of this life choke them" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]]) or "as weeds prevent good plants from growing, the cares, riches, and pleasures of this life keep these people from becoming mature" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **cares** - "the things that people worry about"
* **pleasures of this life** - "the things in this life that people enjoy"
* **so they bring no fruit to maturity** - "they do not bear ripe fruit." This metaphor can be translated as a simile: "so like a plant that does not become mature and bear fruit, they do not become mature and produce good works."
* **produce fruit with perseverance** - "produce fruit by persevering." This metaphor can be translated as a simile: "like healthy plants that produce good fruit, they produce good works by persevering."
