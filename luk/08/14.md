# they are choked ... pleasures of this life

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "the cares and riches and pleasures of this life choke them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# cares

things that people worry about

# pleasures of this life

"the things in this life that people enjoy"

# they are choked by the cares and riches and pleasures of this life, and their fruit does not mature

This metaphor refers to the way weeds cut off light and nutrients from plants and keep them from growing. Alternate translation: "as weeds prevent good plants from growing, the cares, riches, and pleasures of this life keep these people from becoming mature" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# their fruit does not mature

"they do not bear ripe fruit." Mature fruit is a metaphor for good works. Alternate translation: "so like a plant that does not produce mature fruit, they do not produce good works" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
