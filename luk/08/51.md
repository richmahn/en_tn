# When he came to the house

"When they came to the house." Jesus went there with Jairus. Also some of Jesus' disciples went with them.

# he allowed no one ... except Peter and John and James, and the father of the child and her mother

This could be stated positively. AT: "Jesus allowed only Peter, John, James, and the girl's father and mother to go inside with him"

# the father of the child

This refers to Jairus.

# all were mourning and wailing for her

This was the normal way of showing grief in that culture. AT: "all the people there were showing how sad they were and crying loudly because the girl had died" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# laughed at him, knowing that she

"laughed at him because they knew the girl"
