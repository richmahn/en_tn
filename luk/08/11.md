(Jesus continues speaking to his disciples. He explains the meaning of the parable.)

## the devil comes and takes away the word from their heart ##

This means that he causes them to forget the word of God that they have heard.

## takes away ##

In the parable this was a metaphor of a bird snatching away the seeds. Try to use words in your language that keep that image. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## so that they might not believe and be saved ##

This can be translated with an active verb: "so they might not believe with the result that God saves them." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]]) Since this is the devil's purpose, it can be translated as "because the devil thinks, 'They must not believe and they must not be saved.'"

## during the time of testing they fall away ##

"when they experience hardship they fall away from the faith" or "when they experience hardship they stop believing"
