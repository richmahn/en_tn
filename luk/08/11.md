# Connecting Statement:

Jesus begins to explain the meaning of the parable of the soils to his disciples.

# The seed is the word of God

"Word of God" here is a metonym for the message from God. AT: "The seed is the message from God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# The ones along the path are those

"The seeds that fell along the path are those." Jesus tells what happens to the seeds as it relates to people. AT: "The seeds that fell along the path represent people" or "In the parable, the seeds that fell along the path represent people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# are those who

Jesus speaks of the seeds showing something about people as if the seeds were the people. AT: "show what happens to people who" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts

Here "hearts is a metonym for "thoughts and intentions," and "word" is a synecdoche for "message of God." AT: "the devil comes and takes away the message of God from their inner thoughts and how they intend to act." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# takes away

In the parable this was a metaphor of a bird snatching away the seeds. Try to use words in your language that keep that image. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# so they may not believe and be saved

Since this is the devil's purpose, it can be translated as: AT: "because the devil thinks, 'They must not believe and they must not be saved'" or "so they will not believe with the result that God saves them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# The ones on the rock are those

"The seeds that fell on the rocky soil are those." Jesus tells what happens to the seeds as it relates to people. AT: "The seeds that fell on the rocky soil represent people" or "In the parable the seeds that fell on the rocky soil represent people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# the rock

"the rocky soil"

# in a time of testing

"when they experience hardship"

# they fall away

This idiom means "they stop believing" or "they stop following Jesus" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
