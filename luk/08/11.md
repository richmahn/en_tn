## translationNotes

* (Jesus continues speaking to his disciples. He explains the meaning of the parable.)
* **the devil comes and takes away the word from their heart** - This means that he causes them to forget the word of God that they have heard.
* **takes away** - In the parable this was a metaphor of a bird snatching away the seeds. Try to use words in your language that keep that image. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **so that they might not believe and be saved** - This can be translated with an active verb: "so they might not believe with the result that God saves them." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]]) Since this is the devil's purpose, it can be translated as "because the devil thinks, 'They must not believe and they must not be saved.'"
* **during the time of testing they fall away** - "when they experience hardship they fall away from the faith" or "when they experience hardship they stop believing"
