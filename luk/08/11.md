# Connecting Statement:

Jesus begins to explain the meaning of the parable of the soils to his disciples.

# The seed is the word of God

"The seed represents the word of God"

# The ones along the path are

"the seeds that fell along the path." Jesus speaks of what happens to the seeds as if he were speaking about the seeds themselves. AT: "What happens to the seeds along the path" or "The part of the parable about the seeds that fell along the path" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# are those who

Jesus speaks of the seeds showing something about people as if the seeds were the people. AT: "show what happens to people who" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts

This means that he causes them to forget the word of God that they have heard.

# takes away

In the parable this was a metaphor of a bird snatching away the seeds. Try to use words in your language that keep that image. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# so they may not believe and be saved

Since this is the devil's purpose, it can be translated as: AT: "because the devil thinks, 'They must not believe and they must not be saved'" or "so they will not believe with the result that God saves them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# The ones on the rock

"The seeds that fell on the rocky soil." Jesus speaks of what happens to the seeds as if he were speaking about the seeds themselves. AT: "What happens to the seeds on the rocky soil" or "The part of the parable about the seeds that fell on the rocky soil" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# the rock

"the rocky soil"

# in a time of testing

"when they experience hardship"

# they fall away

This idiom means "they stop believing" or "they stop following Jesus" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
