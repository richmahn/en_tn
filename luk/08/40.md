## translationNotes

* **the crowd welcomed him** - This could be translated as "the crowd joyfully greeted him."
* **And behold, there came a man named Jairus** - The word "behold" alerts us to Jairus as a new person in the story. Your language may have a way of doing this. English uses "There was a man who was named Jairus.”
* **one of the leaders of the synagogue** - "one of the leaders at the local synagogue" or "a leader of the people who met at the synagogue in that area"
* **he fell down at Jesus' feet** - 1) “bowed down at Jesus feet” or 2) “lay down on the ground at Jesus feet.” Jairus did not fall accidentally. He did this as a sign of humility and respect for Jesus.
* **she was dying** - "she was about to die" or "she was near death"
* **But as he was going** - Some translators may need to first say "So Jesus agreed to go with the man." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
* **the crowds of people were pressing against him** - "the people were crowding tightly around Jesus"
