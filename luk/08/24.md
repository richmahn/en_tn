## translationNotes

* **Master** - The Greek word that is translated here as “Master” is a not the normal word for “Master.” This one refers to someone who has authority, and not to  someone who owns someone else. You could also translate it as "Boss" or "Foreman" or with a word that is commonly used to address a person in authority, such as “Sir.”
* **rebuked** - "spoke sharply to"
* **they ceased** - "the wind and the waves stopped"
* **Where is your faith?** - This is a rhetorical question. Jesus was rebuking them mildly because they did not trust him to take care of them. It can be translated as "You should have had faith" or "You should have trusted me." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **Who is this** - This can be translated as "What kind of man is this."
* **that he commands** - This can be the beginning of a new sentence: "He commands."
