# the crowds of people ... are pressing in against you

By saying this, Peter was implying that anyone could have touched Jesus. This implicit information can be made explicit if necessary. AT: "there are many people crowding around you and pressing in against you, so any one of them might have touched you!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# Someone did touch me

It may be helpful to distinguish this intentional "touch" from the accidental touches of the crowd. AT: "I know that someone deliberately touched me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# I know that power has gone out from me

Jesus did not lose power or become weak, but his power healed the woman. AT: "I know that healing power went out from me" or "I felt my power heal someone" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
