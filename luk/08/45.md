## translationNotes

* Jesus is still on the way to heal Jairus' daughter.
* **Master** - The word that is translated here as “Master” is a not the normal word for “Master.” This one refers to someone who has authority, and not to  someone who owns someone else. You could also translate it as "Boss" or "Foreman" or with a word that is commonly used to address a person in authority, such as “Sir.”
* **the crowds of people are pressing in on you and crowding you** - By saying this, Peter was implying that anyone could have touched Jesus. This implicit information can be made explicit if necessary as in the UDB. (See [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
* **I knew that power was going out from me** - "I felt healing power go out from me." Jesus did not lose power or become weak, but his power healed the woman.
