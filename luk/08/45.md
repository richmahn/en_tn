# the crowds of people ... are pressing in against you

By saying this, Peter was implying that anyone could have touched Jesus. This implicit information can be made explicit if necessary. AT: "there are many people crowding around you and pressing in against you, so any one of them might have touched you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
