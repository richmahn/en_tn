## translationNotes

* Jesus continues telling his parable.
* **choked them** - The thorn plants took all the nutrients, water, and sunlight, so the farmer's plants could not grow well.
* **produced a crop** - "grew a harvest" or "grew more seeds"
* **Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear** - It may be more natural in some languages to use the second person: "You who have ears to hear, hear." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
* **Whoever has ears to hear** - "Whoever can hear" or "Whoever hears me"
* **let him hear** - "let him listen well" or "let him pay attention to what I say"
