# Connecting Statement:

Jesus finishes telling the parable to the crowd.

# choked it

The thorn plants took all the nutrients, water, and sunlight, so the farmer's plants could not grow well.

# produced a crop

"grew a harvest" or "grew more seeds"

# a hundred times greater

This means a hundred times more than the seeds that were sown. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear

It may be more natural in some languages to use the second person: "You who have ears to hear, hear" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# Whoever has ears to hear

Possible meanings are 1) "Everyone" since everyone has ears or 2) "Whoever has the ability to understand" which refers to those who are willing to listen to God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# let him hear

"he should listen well" or "he should pay attention to what I say"
