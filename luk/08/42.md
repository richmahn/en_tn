# was dying

"was about to die"

# As Jesus was on his way

Some translators may need to first say that Jesus had agreed to go with Jairus. Alternate translation: "So Jesus agreed to go with him. As he was on his way" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# the crowds of people pressed together around him

"the people were crowding tightly around Jesus"
