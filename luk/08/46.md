# Someone did touch me

It may be helpful to distinguish this intentional "touch" from the accidental touches of the crowd. Alternate translation: "Someone deliberately touched me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# I know that power has gone out from me

Jesus did not lose power or become weak, but his power healed the woman. Alternate translation: "I know that healing power went out from me" or "I felt my power heal someone" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
