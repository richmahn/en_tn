# Connecting Statement:

Jesus continues with another parable then he finishes speaking to his disciples as he emphasizes the role of his family in his work.

# No one

This marks the beginning of another parable. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])

# the one who does not have ... will be taken away from him

It is clear from the context that Jesus is talking about understanding and believing. This can be stated clearly and changed to active form. Alternate translation: "But whoever does not have understanding will lose even what understanding he thinks he has" or "But God will cause those who do not believe the truth not to understand even the little that they think they have understood" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
