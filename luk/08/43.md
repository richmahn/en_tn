(This event happens on the way to heal Jairus' daughter.)

## had been bleeding ##

"had a flow of blood." She was probably bleeding from her womb even when it was not the normal time for it. Some cultures may have a polite way of referring to this condition. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])

## but could not be healed by any of them ##

"but none of them could cure her"

## touched the border of his garment ##

"touched the fringe of his robe." Jewish men wore tassels on the edges of their robes as a part of their ceremonial dress, as commanded in God's Law. This is likely what she touched.
