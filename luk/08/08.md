# produced a crop

"grew a harvest" or "grew more seeds"

# a hundred times greater

This means a hundred times more than the seeds that were sown. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# He who has ears to hear, let him hear

Jesus is emphasizing that what he has just said is important and may take some effort to understand and put into practice. The phrase "ears to hear" here is a metonym for the willingness to understand and obey. Alternate translation: "Let the one who is willing to listen, listen" or "The one who is willing to understand, let him understand and obey" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# He who ... let him 

Since Jesus is speaking directly to his audience, you may prefer to use the second person here. Alternate translation: "If you are willing to listen, listen" or "If you are willing to understand, then understand and obey" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
