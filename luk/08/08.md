# produced a crop

"grew a harvest" or "grew more seeds"

# a hundred times greater

This means a hundred times more than the seeds that were sown. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# He who has ears to hear, let him hear

Jesus is emphasizing that what he has just said is important. You may need to use the second person. The word "ear" here is a metonym for either 1) the ability to hear his message. Alternate translation: "Let everyone who can hear what I am saying listen carefully" or "Since you can hear what I am saying, listen carefully" or 2) the desire to listen and obey. Alternate translation: "Let the one who is willing to listen, listen" or "Since you are willing to listen, listen" (See [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
