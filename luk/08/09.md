## seeing they will not really see ##

If the verbs require an object it could be translated as "though they see things, they will not understand them" or "though they see things happen, they will not understand what they mean." (See: the section about https://door43.org/en/ta/vocabulary/verbs#verbs-and-objects on [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-verbs]])

## hearing they will not really understand ##

"though they hear, they will not understand." If the verbs require an object it could be translated as "though they hear instruction, they will not understand the truth."
