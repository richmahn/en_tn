# Luke 08 General Notes

#### Structure and formatting

Several times in this chapter Luke changes his topic without marking the change. You should not try to make these rough changes smooth.

#### Special concepts in this chapter

##### Miracles

Jesus made a storm stop by speaking to it, he made a dead girl alive by speaking to her, and he made evil spirits leave a man by speaking to them. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/miracle]])

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter

##### Parables

The parables were short stories that Jesus told so that people would easily understand the lesson he was trying to teach them. He also told the stories so that those who did not want to believe in him would not understand the truth ([Luke 8:4-15](./04.md)).

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter

##### Brothers and sisters

Most people call those who have the same parents "brother" and "sister" and think of them as the most important people in their lives. Many people also call those with the same grandparents "brother" and "sister." In this chapter Jesus says that the most important people to him are those who obey his Father in heaven.
