## If you are the Son of God ##

The devil was probably challenging Jesus to prove that he was the Son of God.

## this stone ##

The devil was either holding a stone in his hand or pointing to a nearby stone.

## It is written ##

AT: "Moses has written in the scriptures." The quotation is from Deuteronomy [Deuteronomy 8:3](../../deu/08/03.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## Man will not live on bread alone ##

This could be translated as "People cannot live on just bread" or "It is not just food that makes a person live." The word "bread" is used to refer to food in general. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]]) The point is that food is not enough to sustain a person. People need to obey God. Jesus was quoting the scripture to say why he would not turn the stone into bread.
