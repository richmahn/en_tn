# If you are the Son of God

The devil challenges Jesus to do this miracle in order to prove that he is "the Son of God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])

# this stone

The devil either holds a stone in his hand or points to a nearby stone.

# Jesus answered him

Jesus' rejection of the devil's challenge is clearly implied in his answer. It may be helpful to state this clearly for your audience, as the UDB does: "Jesus replied, 'No, I will not do that'" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# It is written

The quotation is from Moses' writings in the Old Testament. This can be stated in active form. AT: "Moses has written in the scriptures" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# Man does not live on bread alone

The word "bread" refers to food in general. Food as compared to God, by itself, is not enough to sustain a person. Jesus quotes the scripture to say why he would not turn the stone into bread. AT: "People cannot live on just bread" or "It is not just food that makes a person live" or "God says there are more important things than food" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
