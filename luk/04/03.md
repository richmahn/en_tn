## translationNotes

* **If you are the Son of God** - The devil was probably challenging Jesus to prove that he was the Son of God.
* **this stone** - The devil was either holding a stone in his hand or pointing to a nearby stone.
* **It is written** - "it is written in the scriptures" or "the scriptures say" or "in the scriptures God said." The quotation is from Deuteronomy [[:en:bible:notes:deu:08:03]].
* **Man will not live on bread alone** - This could be translated as "People cannot live on just bread" or "It is not just food that makes a person live." The word "bread" is used to refer to food in general. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]]) The point is that food is not enough to sustain a person. People need to obey God. Jesus was quoting the scripture to say why he would not turn the stone into bread.
