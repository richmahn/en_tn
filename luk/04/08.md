# It is written

Jesus refused to do what the devil asked. It may be helpful to state this clearly. Alternate translation: "No, I will not worship you, because it is written" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# answered and said to him

"responded to him" or "replied to him"

# It is written

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "Moses has written in the scriptures" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# You will worship the Lord your God

Jesus was quoting a command from the scriptures to say why he would not worship the devil.

# You

This refers to the people in the Old Testament who received God's Law. You could use the singular form of 'you' because each person was to obey it, or you could use the plural form of 'you' because all of the people were to obey it. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# him

The word "him" refers to the Lord God.
