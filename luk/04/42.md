# Connecting Statement:

Though the people wanted Jesus to stay in Capernaum, he goes to preach in other Judean synagogues.

# When daybreak came

"At sunrise" or "At dawn"

# a solitary place

"a deserted place" or "a place where there were no people"

# to many other cities

"to the people in many other cities"

# this is the reason I was sent here

This can be stated in active form. AT: "this is the reason God sent me here" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# Judea

Since Jesus had been in Galilee, the term "Judea" here probably refers to the entire region where the Jews lived at that time. AT: "where the Jews lived"
