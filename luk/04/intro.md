# Luke 04 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations of the Old Testament. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 4:10-11, 18-19, which are quotations from the Old Testament.

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### Jesus was tempted by the devil #####
While it is true that the devil sincerely believed that he could persuade Jesus to obey him, it is important not to imply that Jesus actually ever really wanted to obey him.
