# Luke 04 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations indent each line of poetry to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetry in 4:10-11, 18-19, which is quoted from the OT.

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### Jesus was tempted by the devil #####
While it is true that the devil sincerely believed that he could persuade Jesus to obey him, it is important not to imply that Jesus actually ever really wanted to obey him.
