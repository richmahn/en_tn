# General Information:

Nazareth is the town in which Jesus grew up.

# Surely

"Certainly" or "Without doubt." This is a strong affirmation.

# Doctor, heal yourself

If someone claims to be able to heal diseases that he himself has, there is no reason to believe he is really a doctor. People will speak this proverb to Jesus to say that they will only believe he is a prophet if they see him do what they have heard that he did in other places. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-proverbs]])

# Whatever we heard ... do the same in your hometown

The people of Nazareth do not believe Jesus is a prophet because of his low status as Joseph's son. They will not believe unless they personally see him do miracles.

# Truly I say to you

"It is certainly true." This is an emphatic statement about what follows.

# no prophet is received in his own hometown

Jesus makes this general statement in order to rebuke the people. He means that they are refusing to believe the reports of his miracles in Capernaum. They think they already know all about him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-proverbs]])

# own hometown

"homeland" or "native city" or "country where he grew up"
