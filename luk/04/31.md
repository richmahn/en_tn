# Connecting Statement:

Jesus then goes to Capernaum, teaches the people in the synagogue there, and commands a demon to leave a man.

# Then he

"Then Jesus." This indicates a new event. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])

# went down to Capernaum

The phrase "went down" is used here because Capernaum is lower in elevation than Nazareth.

# Capernaum, a city in Galilee

"Capernaum, another city in Galilee"
