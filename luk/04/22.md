# amazed at the gracious words which were coming out of his mouth

"surprised about the gracious things that he was saying." Here "gracious" may refer to 1) how well or how persuasively Jesus spoke, or 2) that Jesus spoke words about God's grace.

# Is this not the son of Joseph?

People thought that Joseph was Jesus' father. Joseph was not a religious leader, so they were surprised that his son would preach what he did. Alternate translation: "This is just Joseph's son!" or "His father is only Joseph!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
