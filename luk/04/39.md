# a high fever ... rebuked the fever

"very hot skin ... heat" or "very hot skin ... rebuked the hotness"

# So he stood

The word "So" makes it clear that he did this because the people pleaded with him on behalf of Simon's mother-in-law.

# stood over her

"went to her and leaned over her"

# rebuked the fever, and it left her

"spoke sternly to the fever, and it left her" or "commanded the fever to leave her, and it did." It may be helpful to state clearly what he told the fever to do. Alternate translation: "commanded that her skin should become cool, and it did" or "commanded the sickness to leave her, and it did" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# started serving them

Here this means she began to prepare food for Jesus and the other people in the house.
