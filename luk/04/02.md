# for forty days he was tempted

Most versions say that the temptation was throughout the forty days. The UDB states "While he was there, the devil kept tempting him" to make this clear.

# forty days

"40 days" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])

# he was tempted by the devil

This can be stated in active form, and you can make explicit what it was the devil tempted him to do. AT: "the devil tried to persuade him disobey God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# He ate nothing

The word "he" refers to Jesus.
