# The Spirit of the Lord is upon me

"The Holy Spirit is with me in a special way." When someone says this, he is claiming to speak the words of God.

# he anointed me

In the Old Testament, ceremonial oil was poured on a person when they were given power and authority to do a special task. Jesus uses this metaphor to refer to the Holy Spirit being on him to prepare him for this work. Alternate translation: "the Holy Spirit is upon me to empower me" or "the Holy Spirit gave me power and authority" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
