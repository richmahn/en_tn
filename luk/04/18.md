(This is what Jesus read on the scroll from Isaiah [Isaiah 61:1](../../isa/61/01.md).)

## The Spirit of the Lord is upon me ##

"God is with me in a special way." Someone saying this is claiming to speak the words of God.

## to proclaim freedom to the captives ##

This could be translated as "to tell people who are being held captive that they can go free" or "to set free the prisoners of war."

## recovery of sight to the blind ##

"to proclaim that the blind shall see" or "to give sight to the blind" or "to make the blind be able to see again"

## to set free those who are oppressed ##

"to set free  those who are treated harshly"

## to proclaim the favorable year of the Lord ##

This could be translated as "to announce that this is the year that the Lord will show his kindness" or "to tell everyone that the Lord is ready to bless his people."
