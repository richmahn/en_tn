# For it is written

The devil implies that his quote from the Psalms means Jesus will not be hurt if he is the Son of God. This can be stated clearly, as the UDB does. Alternate translation: "You will not be hurt, because it is written" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# it is written

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "the writer has written" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# He will give orders

"He" refers to God. The devil partially quoted from the Psalms in an effort to persuade Jesus to jump off the building.
