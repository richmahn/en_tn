# until another time

"until another occasion"

# had finished testing Jesus

This does not imply that the devil was successful in his temptationâ€”Jesus resisted every attempt. This can be stated clearly. AT: "had finished trying to persuade Jesus to sin" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
