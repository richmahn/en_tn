# Jesus answered him, "It is written ... alone.'"

Jesus' rejection of the devil's challenge is clearly implied in his answer. It may be helpful to state this clearly for your audience, as the UDB does. Alternate translation: "Jesus replied, 'No, I will not do that because it is written ... alone.'" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# It is written

The quotation is from Moses' writings in the Old Testament. This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "Moses has written in the scriptures" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# Man does not live on bread alone

The word "bread" refers to food in general. Food as compared to God, by itself, is not enough to sustain a person. Jesus quotes the scripture to say why he would not turn the stone into bread. Alternate translation: "People cannot live on just bread" or "It is not just food that makes a person live" or "God says there are more important things than food" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
