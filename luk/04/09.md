# the very highest point

This was the corner of the temple roof. If someone fell from there, they would be seriously injured or die.

# If you are the Son of God

The devil is challenging Jesus to prove that he is the Son of God.

# Son of God

This is an important title for Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])

# throw yourself down

"jump down to the ground"

# For it is written

The devil implies that his quote from the Psalms means Jesus will not be hurt if he is the Son of God. This can be stated clearly, as the UDB does: AT: "You will not be hurt, because it is written" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# it is written

This can be stated in active form. AT: "the writer has written" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# He will give orders

"He" refers to God. The devil partially quoted from the Psalms in an effort to persuade Jesus to jump off the building.
