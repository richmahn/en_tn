Jesus returns to Galilee, teaches in the synagogue, and tells the people there that he is fulfilling scripture of Isaiah the prophet.

# Then Jesus returned

This begins a new event in the story. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])

# in the power of the Spirit

"and the Spirit was giving him power." God was with Jesus in a special way, enabling him to do things that humans usually could not.
