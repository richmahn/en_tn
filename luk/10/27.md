# You will love ... neighbor as yourself

The man is quoting what Moses wrote in the law.

#  with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind

Here "heart" and "soul" are metonyms for a person's inner being. These four phrases are used together to mean "completely" or "earnestly." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# your neighbor as yourself

This simile can be stated more clearly. AT: "love your neighbor as much as you love yourself" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
