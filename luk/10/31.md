# By chance

This was not something that any person had planned.

# a certain priest

This expression introduces a new person in the story, but does not identify him by name. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])

# when he saw him

"when the priest saw the injured man." A priest is a very religious person, so the audience would assume that he would help the injured man. Since he did not, this phrase could be stated as "but when he saw him" to call attention to this unexpected result. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# he passed by on the other side

It is implied that he did not help the man. Alternate translation: "he did not help the injured man but instead walked past him on the other side of the road" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
