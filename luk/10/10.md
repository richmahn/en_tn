## translationNotes

* (Jesus continues to give directions to the 70 people he was sending out.)
* **and they do not receive you** - "if they reject you"
* **Even the dust from your city that clings to our feet, we wipe off against you!** - This can be translated as "Just as you rejected us, we thoroughly reject you. We even reject the dust from your city that clings to our feet." Since Jesus was sending these people out in groups of two, it would be two people saying this. So languages that have a dual form of 'we' would use it. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_pluralpronouns]])
* **But know this, that the kingdom of God had drawn near** - This phrase introduces a warning. It means "Even though you reject us, it does not change the fact that the kingdom of is here!"
* **the kingdom of God has drawn near** - "the kingdom of God is all around you."
* **I say to you** - Jesus was saying this to the 70 people he was sending out. He said this to show that he was about to say something very important.
* **the judgment day** - The phrase simply says "that day." But the disciples would have understood that this refers to the time of final judgment of sinners. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
* **it will be more tolerable for Sodom, than for that city** - "Sodom will not be judged as severely as that city will be judged." This means "that city will be judged more severely than Sodom."
