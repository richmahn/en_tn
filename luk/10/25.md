# Connecting Statement:

Jesus replies with a story to a Jewish teacher who wants to test Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])

# Behold, a certain teacher

This alerts us to a new event and a new person in the story. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])

# test him

"challeng Jesus"

# What is written in the law? How do you read it?

Jesus is not seeking information. He uses these questions to test the Jewish teacher's knowledge. AT: "Tell me what Moses wrote in the law" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# What is written in the law?

This can be asked in active form. AT: "What did Moses write in the law?" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# How do you read it?

"What have you read in it?" or "What do you understand it to say?"

# You will love ... neighbor as yourself

The man is quoting what Moses wrote in the law.

# with all your heart, with all your soul

The idiom "with all ... heart" means "completely" and "with all ... soul" means "with all ... being." See how you translated these two phrases in [Deuteronomy 4:29](../../deu/04/29.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# with all your mind

The mind is what people use to think.

# your neighbor as yourself

This simile can be stated more clearly. AT: "love your neighbor as much as you love yourself" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
