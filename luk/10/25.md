## translationNotes

* **Behold** - This event happens at a later time. You can make this clear to the reader as in the UDB: "One day as Jesus was teaching people."
* **And behold, a certain teacher** - The word "behold" alerts us to a new person in the story. Your language may have a way of doing this. English uses "There was a certain teacher…”
* **tested him** - "tested Jesus"
* **What is written in the law** - This can be translated with an active verb: "What did Moses write in the law" or "What do the scriptures say?" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
* **How do you read it?** - "What have you read in it?" or "What do you understand it to say?"
* **You must love...** - The man replied by quoting portions of Deuteronomy [[:en:bible:notes:deu:06:04]] and Leviticus [[:en:bible:notes:lev:19:17]].
* **your neighbor** - This refers to a member of your community. It can be translated as your "your fellow-citizen" or "the people of your community."
