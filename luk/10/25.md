# Connecting Statement:

Jesus replies with a story to an expert in the Jewish law who wants to test Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])

# Behold, a certain expert

This alerts us to a new event and a new person in the story. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])

# test him

"challenge Jesus"

# to inherit

"so that God will give me"
