## translationNotes

* **he said privately** - "to them alone." This was possibly at a later time. The UDB makes this explicit: "Then when his disciples were alone with him." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
* **blessed are those who see the things that you see** - This can be translated as "How good it is for those who see the things that you are seeing." This probably refers to all of the people who were coming to listen to Jesus.
* **the things that you see** - "the things you have seen me do"
* **the things that you hear** - "the things that you have heard me say"
