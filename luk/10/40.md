## do you not care ##

Martha was complaining that the Lord was allowing Mary to sit listening to him when there was so much work to do. She respected the Lord, so she used a rhetorical question to soften her complaint. It can be translated as "It seems like you do not care." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## which will not be taken away from her ##
