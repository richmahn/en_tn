## translationNotes

* **do you not care** - Martha was complaining that the Lord was allowing Mary to sit listening to him when there was so much work to do. She respected the Lord, so she used a rhetorical question to soften her complaint. It can be translated as "It seems like you do not care." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **which will not be taken away from her** - Possible meanings are 1) "I will not take this opportunity away from her" or 2) "She will not lose what she has gained as she listening to me."
