## translationNotes

* (Jesus begins to speak directly to his Father in the presence of the disciples.)
* **Lord of heaven and earth** - "Master over everyone and everything in heaven and earth"
* **these things** - This refers to Jesus' previous teaching about the authority of the disciples. It may be best to simply say "these things" and let the reader determine the meaning.
* **the wise and understanding** - "from people who are wise and understanding." This can be translated as "from people who think they are wise and understanding." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
* **untaught, like little children** - The term in the Greek refers to a very young child. Possible meanings are 1) "untaught" (ULB) or 2) "who accept your truth readily" (UDB).
* **like little children** - This is a simile for people who are not wise and knowledgable, or people who know that they are not wise and knowledgable. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
* **for so it was well-pleasing in your sight** - "for you saw that it was good to do that"
