# The seventy returned

Some languages will need to say that the seventy actually went out first as the UST does. This is implicit information that can be made explicit. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# seventy

You may want to add a footnote: "Some versions have '72' instead of '70.'" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])

# in your name

Here "name" refers to Jesus' power and authority. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
