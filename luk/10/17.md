## translationNotes

* (After some time passes, the seventy disciples return to where Jesus was.)
* **seventy** - You may want to add a footnote: "Some versions have '72' instead of '70.'"
* **The seventy returned** - Some languages will need to say that the seventy actually went out first as the UDB does. This is implicit information that can be made explicit. (See [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]].)
* **I was watching Satan fall from heaven as lightening** - Jesus used a simile to describe how God was defeating Satan when his 70 disciples were preaching in the towns.
* **authority to tread on serpents and scorpions** - "authority to step on snakes and crush scorpions." Possible meanings are 1) this refers to actual snakes and scorpions or 2) snakes and scorpions are a metaphor for evil spirits. The UDB translates this as referring to evil spirits: "I have given you the right to attack evil spirits." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **tread on serpents and scorpions** - This implies that they would do this and not be injured. You can make this explicit: "walk on snakes and scorpions and not be hurt."
* **over all the power of the enemy** - "I have given you authority to crush the power of the enemy" or "I have given you authority to defeat the enemy." The enemy is Satan.
* **rejoice in this** - The words "in this" refer to the following phrase "that the spirits submit to you."
* **your names are engraved in heaven** - This can be translated as an active verb "God has written your names in heaven" or "your names are on the list of people who are citizens of heaven."
