## translationNotes

* (Jesus turns from speaking to the 70 disciples and speaks to the people of three cities.)
* **Woe to you Chorazin! Woe to you Bethsaida** - Jesus spoke as if the people of the cities of Chorazin and Bethsaida were there listening to him, but they were not. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_apostrophe]])
* **if the mighty works which were done in you** - This can be translated with an active verb as it is in the UDB: "If the miracles that I had performed for you." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
* **were done in Tyre and Sidon** - This can be translated with an active verb: "if someone had done them in Tyre and Sidon."
* **they would have repented long ago** - "the wicked people who lived there would have shown that they were sorry for their sins" (UDB)
* **sitting in sackcloth and ashes** - "wearing sackcloth and sitting in ashes." When people were very sad, they would wear a garment made of itchy coarse cloth, and put ashes on their head, and even sit in the ashes. They would also do this when they were very sad that they had sinned against God.
* **it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon â€¦ than for you** - "God will punish you more severely than the people of Tyre and Sidon." The reason for this can be made explicit as in the UDB: "because you did not repent and believe in me even though you saw me do miracles!" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
* **in the judgment** - "on that final day when God judges everyone" (UDB)
* **And you, Capernaum** - Jesus now speaks to the people in the city of Capernaum as if they were listening to him, but they were not.
* **do you think you will be exalted to heaven** - This is a rhetorical question in which Jesus rebukes the people of Chorazin for their pride. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]]) It can be translated with an active verb "will you go up to heaven" or "do you think that God will honor you?" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
* **will be exalted** - To be exalted is an idiom meaning "will be honored." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
