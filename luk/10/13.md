# Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida!

Jesus speaks as if the people of the cities of Chorazin and Bethsaida are there listening to him, but they are not. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# If the mighty works which were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon

Jesus is describing a situation that could have happened in the past but did not. AT: "If someone had performed the miracles for the people of Tyre and Sidon that I performed for you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# they would have repented long ago, sitting

"the wicked people who lived there would have shown that they were sorry for their sins by sitting"

# sitting in sackcloth and ashes

"wearing sackcloth and sitting in ashes"
