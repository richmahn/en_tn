## translationNotes

* Jesus turns from speaking to the 70 disciples and speaks to the people of three cities.
* **Woe to you Chorazin! Woe to you Bethsaida** - Jesus spoke as if the people of the cities of Chorazin and Bethsaida were there listening to him, but they were not. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_apostrophe]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
* **if the mighty works which were done in you** - This can be translated with an active verb as it is in the UDB: "If the miracles that I had performed for you." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
* **were done in Tyre and Sidon** - This can be translated with an active verb: "if someone had done them in Tyre and Sidon."
* **they would have repented long ago** - "the wicked people who lived there would have shown that they were sorry for their sins" (UDB)
* **sitting in sackcloth and ashes** - "wearing sackcloth and sitting in ashes"
* **it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon â€¦ than for you** - "God will punish you more severely than the people of Tyre and Sidon." The reason for this can be made explicit as in the UDB: "because you did not repent and believe in me even though you saw me do miracles!" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
* **in the judgment** - "on that final day when God judges everyone" (UDB)
* **And you, Capernaum** - Jesus now speaks to the people in the city of Capernaum as if they were listening to him, but they were not.
* **do you think you will be exalted to heaven** - This is a rhetorical question in which Jesus rebukes the people of Capernaum for their pride. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]]) It can be translated with an active verb "will you go up to heaven" or "do you think that God will honor you?" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
* **will be exalted** - To be exalted is an idiom meaning "will be honored." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
