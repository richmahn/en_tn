# only one thing is necessary

Jesus is contrasting what Mary is doing with what Martha is doing. It may be helpful to make this explicit. AT: "the only thing that is really necessary is to listen to my teaching" or "listening to my teaching is more necessary than preparing a meal" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# which will not be taken away from her

Possible meanings are 1) "I will not take this opportunity away from her" or 2) "she will not lose what she has gained as she was listening to me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
