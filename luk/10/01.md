# seventy

"70." Some versions say "seventy-two" or "72." You may want to include a footnote that says that. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])

# sent them out two by two

"sent them out in groups of two" or "sent them out with two people in each group"

# He said to them

This was before the men actually went out. AT: "He had said to them" or "Before they went out he told them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-events]])

# The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few

"There is a big crop, but not enough workers to bring it in." Jesus means there are many people ready to enter God's kingdom, but there are not enough disciples to go teach and help the people. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
