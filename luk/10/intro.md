# Luke 10 General Notes #

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Harvest #####

Harvest is when people go out to get the food they have planted so they can bring it to their houses and eat it. Jesus used this as a metaphor to teach his followers that they need to go and tell other people about Jesus so those people can be part of God's kingdom. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]])

##### Neighbor #####

A neighbor is anyone who lives nearby. The Jews helped their Jewish neighbors who needed help, and they expected their Jewish neighbors to help them. Jesus wanted them to understand that people who were not Jews were also their neighbors, so he told them a parable ([Luke 10:29-36](./29.md)). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])
