# I was watching Satan fall from heaven as lightning

Jesus used a simile to compare how God was defeating Satan when his 70 disciples were preaching in the towns to the way lightning strikes. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# fall from heaven as lightning

Possible meanings are 1) fell as quickly as lighting strikes, or 2) fell down from heaven as lightning strikes downward. Since both meaning are possible, it may be best to keep the image.
