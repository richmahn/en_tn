# He said to them

This was before the men actually went out. AT: "He had said to them" or "Before they went out he told them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-events]])

# The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few

"There is a big crop, but not enough workers to bring it in." Jesus means there are many people ready to enter God's kingdom, but there are not enough disciples to go teach and help the people. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
