## translationNotes

* (Jesus continues to give directions to the 70 people he was sending out.)
* **May peace be on this house** - "May the people in this household receive peace." This was both a greeting and a blessing.
* **a person of peace** - "a peaceful person." This is a person who wants peace with God and with people.
* **your peace will rest upon him** - This can be translated as "he will have the peace you blessed him with."
* **if not** - "if there is no person of peace there" or "if the owner of the house is not a peaceful person"
* **it will return to you** - "you will have that peace"
* **Remain in that same house** - This could be translated as "Continue to sleep at that house." Jesus was not saying that they should stay in the house all day, but that they should sleep at the same house every night they were there.
* **for the laborer is worthy of his wages** - This is a general principle that Jesus was applying to the men he was sending out. Since they would be teaching and healing the people, the people should provide them with a place to stay and food.
* **Do not go from house to house** - This means "Do not go sleep at a different house each night."
