# You, Capernaum

Jesus now speaks to the people in the city of Capernaum as if they are listening to him, but they are not. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# do you think you will be exalted to heaven?

Jesus uses a question to rebuke the people of Capernaum for their pride. AT: "you will certainly not go up to heaven!" or "God will not honor you!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# exalted to heaven

This expression means "greatly exalted."

# you will be brought down to Hades

This can be stated in active form. AT: "you will go down to Hades" or "God will send you to Hades" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
