# I send you out as lambs in the midst of wolves

Wolves attack and kill sheep. This metaphor therefore means that there are people who would attempt to harm the disciples that Jesus is sending out. The names of other animals could be substituted. AT: "when I send you out, people will want to harm you, as wolves attack sheep" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# Carry no bag ... no traveler's bag, no sandals, and greet no one
