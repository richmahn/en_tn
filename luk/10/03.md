# Go on your way

"Go to the cities" or "Go to the people"

# I send you out as lambs in the midst of wolves

Wolves attack and kill sheep. This metaphor therefore means that there are people who would attempt to harm the disciples that Jesus is sending out. The names of other animals could be substituted. Alternate translation: "when I send you out, people will want to harm you, as wolves attack sheep" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
