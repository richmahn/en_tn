# But a certain Samaritan

This introduces a new person in the story without giving his name. We know only that he was from Samaria. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])

# a certain Samaritan

The Jews despised the Samaritans and would have assumed that he would not help the injured Jewish man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# When he saw him

"When the Samaritan saw the injured man"

# he was moved with compassion

"he felt sorry for him"
