# he went up

"he went forward" or "he approached the dead man"

# the wooden frame on which they carried the body

This was a stretcher or bed used to move the body to the burial place. It did not have to be something in which the body was buried. Other translations may have the less common "bier" or "funeral couch."

# I say to you, arise

Jesus says this to emphasize that the young man needs to obey him. "Listen to me! Arise"
