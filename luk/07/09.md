# he was amazed at him

"he was amazed at the centurion"

# I say to you

Jesus said this to emphasize the surprising thing that he was about to tell them.

# not even in Israel have I found such faith

The implication is that Jesus expected Jewish people to have this kind of faith, but they did not. He did not expect Gentiles to have this kind of faith, yet this man did. You may need to add this implied information. AT: "I have not found any Israelite who trusts me as much as this Gentile does!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# those who had been sent

It is understood that these were the people the centurion sent. This can be stated. AT: "the people whom the Roman officer had sent to Jesus" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
