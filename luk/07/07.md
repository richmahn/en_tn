# just say a word

The servant understood that Jesus could heal the servant just by speaking. Here "word" refers to a command. Alternate translation: "just give the order" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# my servant will be healed

The word that is translated here as "servant" is normally translated as "boy." It may indicate that the servant was very young or show the centurion's affection for him.
