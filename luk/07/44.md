# Jesus turned to the woman

Jesus directed Simon's attention to the woman by turning to her.

# You gave me no water for my feet

It was a basic responsibility of a host to provide water and a towel for guests to wash and dry their feet after walking on dusty roads. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# You ... but she

Jesus twice uses these phrases to contrast Simon's lack of courtesy with the woman's extreme actions of gratitude.

# she has wet my feet with her tears

The woman used her tears in place of the missing water.

# wiped them with her hair

The woman used her hair in place of the missing towel.
