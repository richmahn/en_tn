"he said to himself"

# If this man were a prophet, then he would know ... a sinner

The Pharisee thought that Jesus was not a prophet because he allowed the sinful woman to touch him. AT: "Apparently Jesus is not a prophet, because a prophet would know that this woman who is touching him is a sinner"

# that she is a sinner

Simon assumed that a prophet would never allow a sinner to touch him. This part of his assumption can be stated clearly. AT: "that she is a sinner, and he would not allow her to touch him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# Simon

This was the name of the Pharisee who invited Jesus into his home. This was not Simon Peter.
