# General Information:

Luke, the author of this book, comments on how people responded to John and Jesus.

# When all the people ... baptism of John

This verse could be reordered to be more clear. Alternate translation: "When all the people who had been baptized by John, including the tax collectors, heard this, they declared that God is righteous"

# they declared that God is righteous

"they said that God had shown himself to be righteous" or "they declared that God had acted righteously"

# because they had been baptized with the baptism of John

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "because they had let John baptize them" or "because John had baptized them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
