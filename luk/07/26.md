# But what ... A prophet?

This leads to a positive answer. "Did you go out to see a prophet? Of course you did!" This can also be written as a statement. AT: "But you actually went out to see a prophet!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Yes, I say to you

Jesus says this to emphasize the importance of what he will say next.

# more than a prophet

This phrase means that John was indeed a prophet, but that he was even greater than a typical prophet. AT: "not just an ordinary prophet" or "much more important than a normal prophet"
