# eating no bread

Possible meanings are 1) "frequently fasting" or 2) "not eating normal food."

# you say, 'He has a demon.'

Jesus was quoting what people were saying about John. This can be stated without the direct quote. AT: "you say that he has a demon." or "you accuse him of having a demon." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])

# The Son of Man

Jesus expected the people to understand that he was referring to himself. AT: "I, the Son of Man" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# you say, 'Look, he is a gluttonous man and a drunkard ... sinners!'

This can be translated as an indirect quote. AT: "you say that he is a gluttonous man and a drunkard ... sinners." or "you accuse him of eating and drinking too much and of being ... sinners." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])

# you say, 'Look, he is a gluttonous man and a drunkard ... sinners!'

If you translated "The Son of Man" as "I, the Son of man," you can state this as an indirect statement and use the first person. AT: "you say that I am a gluttonous man and a drunkard ... sinners." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# he is a gluttonous man

"he is a greedy eater" or "he continually eats too much food"

# a drunkard

"a drunk" or "he continually drinks too much alcohol"

# wisdom is justified by all her children

This appears to be a proverb that Jesus applied to this situation, probably to teach that wise people would understand that the people should not have rejected Jesus and John.
