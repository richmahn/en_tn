(Jesus continues speaking to the people. He explains why he compared them to children.)

## you say, 'He has a demon' ##

Jesus was quoting what people were saying about John. It can be translated as an indirect quote: "you say that he has a demon" or "you accuse him of having a demon." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])

## not eating bread ##

"not eating food." This can be translated as "frequently fasting." It does not mean that John never ate food.

## The Son of Man ##

Since Jesus expected the people there to understand that he was the Son of Man, it could also be translated as "I, the Son of Man."

## you say, 'Behold, he is a gluttonous man ##

Jesus was quoting what the people were saying about him as the Son of Man. This can be translated as an indirect quote: "you say that he is a gluttonous man" or "you accuse him of eating too much." If you translated "The Son of Man" as "I, the Son of man", the indirect quote could be translated as "you say that I am a gluttonous man."

## he is a gluttonous man ##

"he is a greedy eater" or "he habitually eats too much food"

## a drunkard ##

"a drunk" or "a habitual drunk"

## wisdom is justified by all of her children ##

This is probably a proverb that Jesus was applying to this situation, because the people who rejected both him and John were not being wise. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/proverb]])
