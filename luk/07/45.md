# You did not give me a kiss

A good host in that culture would greet his guest with a kiss on the cheek. Simon did not do this. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# did not stop kissing my feet

"has continued to kiss my feet"

# kissing my feet

The woman kissed the feet of Jesus rather than his cheek as a sign of extreme repentance and humility.
