# You did not ... but she

Jesus continues to contrast Simon's poor hospitality with the actions of the woman.

# anoint my head with oil

"put oil on my head." This was the custom to welcome an honored guest. AT: "welcome me by anointing my head with oil" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# anointed my feet

The woman greatly honored Jesus by doing this. She demonstrated humility by anointing his feet instead of his head.

# I say to you

This emphasizes the importance of the statement that follows.

# her sins, which were many, have been forgiven

This can be stated in active form. AT: "God has forgiven her many sins" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# for she loved much

Her love was the evidence that her sins were forgiven. Some languages require that the object of "love" be stated. AT: "for she greatly loves the one who forgave her" or "for she loves God very much"

# the one who is forgiven little

"anyone who is forgiven only a few things." In this sentence Jesus states a general principle. However, he expected Simon to understand that he showed very little love for Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
