# You did not ... but she

Jesus continues to contrast Simon's poor hospitality with the actions of the woman.

# anoint my head with oil

"put oil on my head." This was the custom to welcome an honored guest. Alternate translation: "welcome me by anointing my head with oil" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# anointed my feet

The woman greatly honored Jesus by doing this. She demonstrated humility by anointing his feet instead of his head.
