(Jesus continues speaking to Simon.)

## anoint my head with oil ##

"put oil on my head." This was a way of welcoming an honored guest. It could be translated as "welcome me by anointing my head with oil."

## anointed my feet ##

Though this was probably not a common practice, the woman greatly honored Jesus by doing this.

## has been forgiven much ##

This can also be translated in the active voice with "who has received much forgiveness" or "whom God has forgiven much."

## has also loved much ##

"has also loved much the one who forgave her" or "has also love God much." Some languages require that the object of "love" be stated.

## He who is being forgiven only a little ##

"He who is forgiven little" or "Anyone who is forgiven little." In this sentence Jesus states a general principle. However, Simon was expected to understand that Jesus was saying that Simon had loved little.
