# Connecting Statement:

Jesus continues speaking to the people about John the Baptist.

# To what, then, can I compare ... they like?

Jesus uses these questions to introduce a comparison. They can be written as a statement. Alternate translation: "This is what I compare this generation to, and what they are like." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# I compare ... What are they like

These are two ways of saying that this is a comparison. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# the people of this generation

The people living when Jesus spoke.
