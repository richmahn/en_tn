# Connecting Statement:

Jesus continues speaking to the people about John the Baptist.

# To what, then, can I compare ... they like?

Jesus used these questions to introduce a comparison. They can be written as a statement. AT: "This is what I compare this generation to, and what they are like" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# I compare ... What are they like

These are two ways of saying that this is a comparison. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# the people of this generation

The people living when Jesus spoke.

# They are like

These words are the beginning of Jesus' comparison. Jesus is saying that the people were like children who were never satisfied with the way other children acted. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
