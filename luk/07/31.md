## translationNotes

* (Jesus talks about the people who have rejected him and John the Baptizer.)
* **To what should I compare** - This is the start of a rhetorical question. Jesus used it to introduce a comparison that he was about to make. This whole question could also be translated as, "This is what I will compare this generation to. This is what they are like." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **the people of this generation** - "the people living now" or "these people" or "you people of this generation"
* **They are like** - This is the beginning of Jesus' comparison. This is a simile (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]]). Jesus is saying that the people of this generation were like children who were never satisfied with the way other children acted.
* **marketplace** - This was a large, open-air area where people would come to sell their goods.
* **flute** - This is a long, hollow musical instrument which is played by blowing air in or over one end.
* **and you did not dance** - "but you did not dance to the music"
* **and you did not weep** - "but you did not weep with us"
