(Jesus talks to the people about John the Baptist.)

## What did you go out to see ##

Jesus used this phrase in three rhetorical questions to cause the people to think about what kind of person John the Baptist was. It could be translated as "Did you go out to see …? Of course not!" or "Surely you did not go out to see …!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## a reed shaken by the wind ##

This metaphor could also be translated as a simile: "a man who was like a reed shaken by the wind." It has two possible interpretations. 1) Reeds are easily moved by the wind, so it could refer to a person who is easily motivated to change his mind. 2) Reeds make noise when the wind rattles them, so it could refer to a person who talks a lot but his speech does not result in anything important (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]]).

## dressed in soft clothes ##

"wearing expensive clothing." Rich people wore this kind of clothing.

## kings' palaces ##

A palace is a large, expensive house that a king lives in.

## But ##

"If you did not go out to see that, then"

## I say to you ##

Jesus said this to emphasize the importance of what he would say next.

## much more than a prophet ##

"not an ordinary prophet" or "more important than a normal prophet"
