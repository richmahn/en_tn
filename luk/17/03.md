## translationNotes

* **If your brother sins** - This is a conditional statement that talks about an event that will probably happen in the future.
* **your brother** - This normally includes "your fellow-believer" as well as actual "brothers" who were born to the same mother and father.
* **rebuke him** - "warn him strongly" or "tell him strongly that what he did was wrong" or "correct him"
* **If he sins against you seven times** - This is a hypothetical future situation. It may never happen, but even if it does, Jesus tells people to forgive.
* **seven times in the day** - This could be translated as "many times in a day." The number seven in the Bible is a symbol for completeness.
