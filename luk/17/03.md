# If your brother sins

This is a conditional statement that talks about an event that will probably happen in the future.

# your brother

"brother" is here used in the sense of someone with the same belief. AT: "a fellow believer"

# rebuke him

"tell him strongly that what he did was wrong" or "correct him"

# If he sins against you seven times

This is a hypothetical future situation. It may never happen, but even if it does, Jesus tells people to forgive. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])

# seven times in the day, and seven times

The number seven in the Bible is a symbol for completeness. AT: "many times in a day, and each time" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
