# Connecting Statement:

This is the end of the part of the story about Jesus healing the 10 lepers.

# Then Jesus said

Jesus responded to what the man did, but he was speaking to the group of people around him. Alternate translation: "So Jesus said to the crowd" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# Were not the ten cleansed?

This is the first of three rhetorical questions. Jesus used them to show the people around him how surprised and disappointed he was that only one of the ten men came back to glorify God. Alternate translation: "Ten men were healed." or "God healed ten men." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Where are the nine?

"Why did not the other nine come back?" This can be a statement. Alternate translation: "The other nine men should have come back, too." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
