## Where there is a body, there will the vultures also be gathered together ##

Apparently this is a proverb that means "It will be obvious" or "You will know it when it happens." It can also be translated as a simile: "As vultures gathering shows that there is a dead body, so these things show that the Son of Man is being revealed." (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/proverb]], [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

## vultures ##

Vultures are large birds that fly together and eat the flesh of dead animals that they find. You could describe birds this way or use the word for a local bird that does this.
