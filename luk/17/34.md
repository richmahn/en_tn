# I tell you

As Jesus continues to address his disciples, he emphasizes the importance of what he is telling them.

# in that night

This refers to what will happen if he, the Son of Man, comes during the night.

# there will be two people in one bed

The emphasis is not on these two people, but on the fact that some people will be taken away and the others will be left.

# bed

"couch" or "cot"

# One will be taken, and the other will be left

"One person will be taken and the other person will be left behind." This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "God will take one person and leave the other" or "Angels will take one and leave behind the other" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
