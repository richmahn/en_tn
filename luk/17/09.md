## translationNotes

* (Jesus continues to teach his disciples.)
* **He does not thank** - Depending on how you translated the previous two verses, this could also be translated as "He would not thank" or "You would not thank."
* **the things that were commanded** - "the things you commanded him to do"
* **does he?** - This could be translated as "right?" or "Isn't this true?" With this rhetorical question, Jesus encourages his disciples to acknowledge that what he is saying is obviously true. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]].)
* **you also** - Jesus was speaking to his disciples, so languages that have a plural form of "you" would use it. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
* **should say** - "should say to God"
* **We are unworthy servants** - This could be translated as "We are ordinary slaves" or "We servants to do not deserve your praise."
