# Connecting Statement:

Jesus finishes teaching. This is the end of this part of the story.

# He does not thank the servant ... commanded, does he?

Jesus uses this question to show how people treat servants. This can be a statement. AT: "He would not thank the servant ... commanded" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# the things that were commanded

This can be stated in active form. AT: "the things you commanded him to do" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# does he?

"right?" or "is this not true?"

# you also

Jesus was speaking to his disciples, so languages that have a plural form of "you" would use it. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# that you are commanded

This can be stated in active form. AT: "that God has commanded you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# We are unworthy servants

This is an exaggeration to express that they did not do anything worthy of praise. AT: "We are ordinary slaves" or "We servants do not deserve your praise" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
