# Were there no others who returned to give glory to God, except this foreigner?

This can be a statement. Alternate translation: "No one but this foreigner came back to give glory to God!" or "God healed ten men, yet only this foreigner came back to give glory to God!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# this foreigner

Samaritans had non-Jewish ancestors and they did not worship God in the same way that the Jews did.
