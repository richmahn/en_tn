# Luke 17 General Notes #

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Old Testament Examples #####

Jesus used the lives of Noah and of Lot to teach his followers. Noah was ready for the flood when it came, and they needed to be ready for him to return, because he would not warn them when he came. Lot's wife loved the evil city she had been living in so much that God also punished her when he destroyed it, and they needed to love Jesus more than anything else,

Those who read your translation may need help so they can understand what Jesus was teaching here.

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter ####

##### Hypothetical situations #####

Hypothetical situations are situations that have not actually happened. Jesus used a special type of hypothetical situation to teach that what will happen to those who cause others to sin will be worse than being drowned ([Luke 19:1-2](./01.md)) and another to scold the disciples because they had little faith ([Luke 19:6](../../luk/19/06.md)). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])

##### Rhetorical Questions #####

Jesus asked his disciples three questions ([Luke 17:7-9](./07.md)) to teach them that even those who serve him well are righteous only because of his grace. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/grace]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]])

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### "Son of Man" #####

Jesus refers to himself as the "Son of Man" in this chapter ([Luke 17:22](../../luk/17/22.md)). Your language may not allow people to speak of themselves as if they were speaking about someone else. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sonofman]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

##### Paradox #####

A paradox is a true statement that appears to describe something impossible. A paradox occurs in this chapter: "Whoever seeks to gain his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life will save it" ([Luke 17:33](../../luk/17/33.md)).
