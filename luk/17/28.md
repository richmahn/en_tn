# Likewise even as it happened in the days of Lot

The "days of Lot" refers to the time just before God punished the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah. AT: "Another example is how it happened in the days of Lot" or "As people were doing when Lot lived" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# they were eating and drinking

"the people of Sodom were eating and drinking"

# it rained fire and sulfur from heaven

"fire and burning sulfur fell from the sky like rain"

# destroyed them all

This does not include Lot and his family. AT: "destroyed all those who stayed in the city"
