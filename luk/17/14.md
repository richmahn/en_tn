# show yourselves to the priests

Lepers were required to have the priests verify that their leprosy was healed. Alternate translation: "show yourselves to the priests so they can examine you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# they were cleansed

When people were healed, they were no longer ceremonially unclean. This can be made explicit. Alternate translation: "they were healed of their leprosy and so became clean" or "they were cured of their leprosy" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
