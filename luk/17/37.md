# General Information:

The disciples ask Jesus a question about his teaching and he answers them.

# Where, Lord?

"Lord, where will this happen?"

# Where there is a body, there will the vultures also be gathered together

Apparently this is a proverb that means "It will be obvious" or "You will know it when it happens." AT: "As vultures gathering shows that there is a dead body, so these things show that the Son of Man is coming" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-proverbs]])

# vultures

Vultures are large birds that fly together and eat the flesh of dead animals that they find. You could describe birds this way or use the word for a local bird that does this. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
