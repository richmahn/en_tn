# you also

Jesus was speaking to his disciples, so languages that have a plural form of "you" would use it. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# that you are commanded

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "that God has commanded you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# We are unworthy servants

This is an exaggeration to express that they did not do anything worthy of praise. Alternate translation: "We are ordinary slaves" or "We servants do not deserve your praise" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
