# General Information:

We do not know where this event takes place; it simply happens one day when Jesus is talking with the Pharisees.

# Being asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come,

This is the beginning of a new event. Some translations start it with "One day" or "Once." It can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "One day the Pharisees asked Jesus, 'When will the kingdom of God come?'" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])

# The kingdom of God does not come with careful observing

People thought that they would be able to see signs of the kingdom coming. The idea of signs can be stated clearly. Alternate translation: "The kingdom of God does not come with signs that people can observe" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
