# But which of you, who ... sheep, will say ... sit down to eat'?

Jesus asks his disciples a question to help them think about the role of a servant. This could be translated as a statement. AT: "But none of you who ... sheep would say ... sit down to eat.'" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
