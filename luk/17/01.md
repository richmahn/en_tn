# Connecting Statement:

Jesus continues teaching, but he directs his attention back to his disciples. This is still the same part of the story and the same day that began in [Luke 15:3](../15/03.md).

# It is certain there will be things that can cause us to sin

"Things that tempt people to sin will certainly happen"

# to that person through whom they come

"to anyone who causes the temptations to come" or "to any person who causes people to be tempted"
