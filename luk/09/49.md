# John answered

"In reply, John said" or "John replied to Jesus." John was responding to what Jesus had said about being the greatest. He was not answering a question.

# we saw

John speaks of himself but not Jesus, so "we" here is exclusive. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

# in your name

This means the person was speaking with the power and authority of Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# Do not stop him

This can be stated positively. AT: "Allow him to continue"

# whoever is not against you is for you

Some modern languages have sayings that mean the same thing. AT: "if a person does not hinder you, it is as if they were helping you" or "if someone is not working contrary to you, he is working in your favor"
