# Do not stop him

This can be stated positively. Alternate translation: "Allow him to continue"

# whoever is not against you is for you

Some modern languages have sayings that mean the same thing. Alternate translation: "if a person does not keep you from working, it is as if he were helping you" or "if someone is not working against you, he is working with you"
