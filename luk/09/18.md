# Connecting Statement:

Jesus is praying, with only his disciples near him, and they begin to talk about who Jesus is. Jesus tells them that he will soon die and resurrect and urges them to follow him even if it becomes very hard to do that.

# It came about

This phrase is used here to mark the beginning of a new event. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])

# praying by himself

"praying alone." The disciples were with Jesus, but he was praying personally and privately by himself.
