# No one ... fit for the kingdom of God

Jesus responds with a proverb to teach the man about being his disciple. Jesus means that a person is not suitable for the kingdom to God if he focuses on people in his past instead of following Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-proverbs]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# No one who puts his hand to the plow

Here "puts his hand to" something is an idiom that means the person starts to do something. AT: "No one who starts to plow his field" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

# looks back

Anyone who is looking back while plowing cannot guide the plow where it needs to go. That person must focus on looking forward in order to plow well.

# fit for the kingdom of God

"useful for the kingdom of God" or "suitable for the kingdom of God"
