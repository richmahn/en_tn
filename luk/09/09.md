# I beheaded John. Who is this

Herod assumes that it is impossible for John to rise from the dead. This can be stated clearly. Alternate translation: "It cannot be John because I had his head cut off. So who is this man" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# I beheaded John

Herod's soldiers would have carried out executions. Alternate translation: "I commanded my soldiers to cut off John's head" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
