## someone ##

This was not one of the disciples.

## Foxes have holesâ€¦nowhere to lay his head ##

Jesus was implying that if the the man were to follow him, that man too might not have a home. The implied information can be made explicit: "So do not expect that you will have a home." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

## Foxes ##

These are land animals similar to small dogs. They sleep in a den or a burrow in the ground.

## birds of the sky ##

"birds that fly in the air"

## Son of Man ##

Jesus is speaking about himself in the third person. AT: "I, the Son of Man." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

## nowhere to lay his head ##

"nowhere to rest my head" or "nowhere to sleep." This is a hyperbole. Jesus is exaggerating in order to get across the point that he was not welcome anywhere to live. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
