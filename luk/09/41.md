# Jesus answered and said

"Jesus answered by saying"

# You unbelieving and depraved generation

Jesus said this to the crowd that had gathered, and not to his disciples.

# depraved generation

"corrupt generation"

# how long must I be with you and put up with you?

Here "you" is plural. Jesus uses these questions to express his sadness that the people did not believe. They can be written as statements. AT: "I have been with you so long, yet you do not believe. I wonder how long I must put up with you." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Bring your son here

Here "your" is singular. Jesus is speaking directly to the father who addressed him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
