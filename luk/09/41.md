## translationNotes

* **And Jesus answered and said** - "And in answer Jesus said"
* **you unbelieving and corrupt generation** - This was addressed to the crowd that had gathered, and not to the disciples.
* **how long will I have to stay with you and bear with you?** - This is a rhetorical question. Jesus did not expect and answer. The meaning is "I have done so much and still you do not believe!" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **Bring your son here** - Here Jesus is speaking directly to the father who addressed him.
* **still coming** - "on his way" or "on the way"
* **rebuked** - "spoke harshly to"
