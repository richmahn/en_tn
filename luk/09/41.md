## And Jesus answered and said ##

"And in answer Jesus said"

## you unbelieving and corrupt generation ##

This was addressed to the crowd that had gathered, and not to the disciples.

## how long will I have to stay with you and bear with you? ##

This is a rhetorical question. Jesus did not expect and answer. The meaning is "I have done so much and still you do not believe!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## Bring your son here ##

Here Jesus is speaking directly to the father who addressed him.

## still coming ##

"on his way" or "on the way"

## rebuked ##

"spoke harshly to"
