# saw this

"saw that the Samaritans did not receive Jesus"

# command fire to come down from heaven and destroy them

James and John suggested this method of judgment because they knew that this was how the prophets such as Elijah had judged people who rejected God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# he turned and rebuked them

"Jesus turned and rebuked James and John." Jesus did not condemn the Samaritans, as the disciples expected.
