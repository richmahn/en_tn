## saw this ##

"saw that the Samaritans did not receive Jesus"

## command fire to come down from heaven and destroy them ##

James and John suggested this method of judgment because they kew that this was how the prophets such as Elijah had judged people who rejected God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

## he turned and rebuked them ##

"Jesus turned and rebuked James and John." Jesus did not condemn the Samaritans, as the disciples expected.
