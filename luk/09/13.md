# five loaves of bread

A loaf of bread is a lump of dough that is shaped and baked.

# two fishâ€”unless we go and buy food for all these people

If "unless" is difficult to understand in your language, you could make a new sentence. "two fish. In order to feed all these people, we would have to go and buy food"
