# What good is it ... forfeit himself?

The implied answer to this question is that it is not good. Alternate translation: "It will not benefit someone at all to gain the whole world, and yet lose himself." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# to gain the whole world

"to get everything in the world"

# lose or forfeit himself

"ruin himself or give up his life"
