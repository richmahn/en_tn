# You see, a spirit

The phrase "You see" introduces us to the evil spirit in the man's story. Your language may have a way of doing this. Alternate translation: "There is an evil spirit that" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])

# he foams at the mouth

"foam comes out of his mouth." When a person has a seizure, they can have trouble breathing or swallowing. This causes white foam to form around their mouths.
