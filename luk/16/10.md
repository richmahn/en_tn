# He who is faithful ... is also faithful ... he who is unrighteous ... is also unrighteous

"People who are faithful ... are also faithful ... people who are unrighteous ... are also unrighteous." This would include women. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])

# faithful in very little

"faithful even with small things." Make sure this does not sound like they are not very faithful.

# unrighteous in very little

"unrighteous even in small things." Make sure this does not sound like they are not often unrighteous.
