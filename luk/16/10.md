# worldly wealth

See how you translated this in [Luke 16:09](./08.md). Possible meanings are 1) Jesus uses metonymy when he calls money "unrighteous" because people sometimes earn it or use it in unrighteous ways. AT: "even money that you earned dishonestly" or 2) Jesus uses hyperbole when he calls money "unrighteous" because it has no eternal value. AT: "money, which has no eternal value" or "by using worldly money" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# who will trust you with true wealth?

# true wealth

This refers to wealth that is more genuine, real, or lasting than money.

# who will give you money of your own?

Jesus uses this question to teach the people. AT: "no one will give you wealth for yourself." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
