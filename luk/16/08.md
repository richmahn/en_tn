# Connecting Statement:

Jesus finishes telling the parable about the master and the manager of his debtors. In verse 9, Jesus continues to teach his disciples.

# The master then commended

The text does not say how the master learned of the manager's action.

# commended

"praised" or "spoke well of" or "approved of"

# he had acted shrewdly

"he had acted cleverly" or "he had done a sensible thing"

# the children of this world

This refers to those like the unrighteous manager who do not know or care about God. AT: "the people of this world" or "worldly people"

# the children of light

Here "light" is a metaphor for everything godly. AT: "the people of God" or "godly people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
