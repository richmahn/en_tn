#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter ####

##### Allusion #####
Abraham is recorded as saying "neither will they be persuaded if someone rises from the dead." This is an allusion to the fact that Jesus will soon rise from the dead and they will not be persuaded by this fact.

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### "The law and the prophets were in effect until John came" #####
The phrase does not mean the regulations of the law of Moses ended during the time of John the Baptist. It is clear from the gospels that Jesus lived and ministered under the law. What has changed was the message being proclaimed. This is why the UDB states, "The laws that God gave Moses and what the prophets wrote were proclaimed until John the Baptizer came." (See: [Luke 16:16](./16.md) and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]])
