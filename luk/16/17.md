# it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one stroke of a letter of the law to become invalid

This contrast could be stated in the reverse order. Alternate translation: "even the smallest stroke of the letter of the law will last longer than heaven and earth will exist"

# than for one stroke of a letter

A "stroke" is the smallest part of a letter. It refers to something in the law that may seem to be insignificant. Alternate translation: "than for even the smallest detail of the law" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# become invalid

"disappear" or "cease to exist"
