# What is this that I hear about you?

The rich man uses a question to scold the manager. Alternate translation: "I have heard what you are doing." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Give an account of your management

"Set your records in order to pass on to someone else" or "Prepare the records you have written about my money"
