# unrighteous wealth

See how you translated this in [Luke 16:09](../16/09.md). Possible meanings are 1) Jesus uses metonymy when he calls money "unrighteous" because people sometimes earn it or use it in unrighteous ways. Alternate translation: "even money that you earned dishonestly" or 2) Jesus uses hyperbole when he calls money "unrighteous" because it has no eternal value. Alternate translation: "money, which has no eternal value" or "by using worldly money" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# who will trust you with true wealth?

Jesus uses a question to teach the people. Alternate translation: "no one will trust you with true wealth." or "no one will give you true wealth to manage." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# true wealth

This refers to wealth that is more genuine, real, or lasting than money.
