# longing to eat what fell

"wishing he could eat the scraps of food that fell"

# Even the dogs came

The word "Even" here shows that what follows is worse than what has already been told about Lazarus. Alternate translation: "In addition to that, the dogs came" or "Worse yet, the dogs came"

# dogs

The Jews considered dogs to be unclean animals. Lazarus was too sick and weak to stop the dogs from licking his wounds.
