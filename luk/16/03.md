(Jesus continues telling his story.)

## What should I do? ##

The manager asks this of himself, as a means of reviewing his options.

## my master ##

This refers to the wealthy man. It could also be translated as "my employer." The manager was not a slave.

## I do not have strength to dig ##

"I am not strong enough to dig the ground" or "I am not able to dig"

## when I am removed from my management job ##

This could also be translated as, "when I lose my management job."
