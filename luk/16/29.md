# Connecting Statement:

Jesus finishes telling the story about the rich man and Lazarus.

# They have Moses and the prophets

It is implied that Abraham refused to send Lazarus to the rich man's brothers. This could be stated. AT: "No, I will not do that, because your brothers have what Moses and the prophets wrote long ago" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# Moses and the prophets

This refers to their writings. AT: "what Moses and the prophets wrote" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# let them listen to them

"your brothers should pay attention to Moses and the prophets"
