# Connecting Statement:

Jesus begins telling another parable. It is about a master and the manager of his debtors. This is still the same part of the story and the same day that began in [Luke 15:3](../15/03.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])

# Jesus also said to the disciples

The last section was directed at Pharisees and scribes, though Jesus' disciples may have been part of the crowd listening.

# There was a certain rich man

This introduces a new character in the parable. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])

# it was reported to him

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "people reported to the rich man" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# wasting his possessions

"foolishly managing the rich man's wealth"
