# General Information:

This is a break in Jesus teachings, as verse 14 tells us background information about how the Pharisees ridiculed Jesus. In verse 15, Jesus continues teaching and responds to the Pharisees. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])

# Now

This word marks a shift to the background information.

# who were lovers of money

"who loved having money" or "who where very greedy for money"

# they ridiculed him

"the Pharisees ridiculed Jesus"
