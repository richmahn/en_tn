# General Information:

This is a break in Jesus teachings, as verse 14 tells us background information about how the Pharisees ridiculed Jesus. In verse 15, Jesus continues teaching and responds to the Pharisees. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])

# Now

This word marks a shift to the background information.

# who were lovers of money

"who loved having money" or "who where very greedy for money"

# they ridiculed him

"the Pharisees ridiculed Jesus"

# He said to them

"And Jesus said to the Pharisees"

# You justify yourselves in the sight of men

"You try to make yourselves look good to people"

# God knows your hearts

Here "hearts" refers to the desires of people. AT: "God understands your true desires" or "God knows your motives" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# That which is exalted among men is detestable in the sight of God

This can be stated in active form. AT: "Those things that men think are very important are things that God hates" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
