# neither will they be persuaded if someone rises from the dead

Abraham states what would happen if the hypothetical situation occurred. It can be stated in active form. AT: "neither will a person who comes back from the dead be able to convince them" or "they will not believe even if a person comes back from the dead" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# rises from the dead
