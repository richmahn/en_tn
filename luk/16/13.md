## No servant can ##

This can also be translated as, "A servant cannot."

## devoted ##

"dedicated" or "loyal"

## despise the other ##

"hold the other in contempt" or "sneer at at other" or "hate the other"

## You cannot serve ##

Jesus was talking to a group of people, so languages that have a plural form of "you" would use that. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

## serve ##

"be a slave to"

## he will hate ##

"the servant will hate"
