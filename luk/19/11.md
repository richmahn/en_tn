# General Information:

Jesus begins to tell a parable to the crowd. Verse 11 gives background information about why Jesus tells the parable. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])

# that the kingdom of God was about to appear immediately

The Jews believed that the Messiah would establish the kingdom as soon as he came to Jerusalem. AT: "that Jesus would immediately begin to rule over God's kingdom" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# A certain nobleman

"A certain man who was a member of the ruling class" or "A certain man from an important family"

# to receive for himself a kingdom

This is the image of a lesser king going to a greater king. The greater king would give the lesser king the right and authority to rule over his own country. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
