# Connecting Statement:

Jesus continues to tell the parable he began in [Luke 19:11](../19/11.md).

# He called

"The nobleman called." It may be helpful to state that the man did this before he left to receive his kingdom. Alternate translation: "Before he left, he called"

# gave them ten minas

"gave each of them one mina"

# ten minas

A mina was 600 grams, probably of silver. Each mina was equal to 100 days' wages, what people would be paid for about four months' work, so ten minas would have been about three years' wages. Alternate translation: "ten valuable coins" or "a large amount of money" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bweight]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])

# Conduct business

"Trade with this money" or "Use this money in order to earn more"
