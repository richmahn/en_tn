## translationNotes

* (Jesus continues telling his parable.)
* **a severe man** - "a harsh man"
* **that I am a severe man, taking upâ€¦** - The nobleman was repeating what the servant had said about him. He was not saying that it was true.
* **Why did you not put my money** - This starts a rhetorical question. It is used as a rebuke. It can be translated as "You should have put my money." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **put my money in the bank** - This can be translated as  "lent my money to a bank." Cultures that do not have banks might translate it as "let someone borrow my money."
* **bank** - A bank is a business that safely holds money for people. Banks lend that money to others for a profit. Therefore it pays an extra amount, or interest, to the people who keep their money in the bank.
* **I would have collected it with interest** - This can be translated as "I could have collected that amount plus the interest it would have earned" (UDB) or "I would gain a profit from it."
* **interest** - Interest is money that a bank pays people who put their money in the bank.
