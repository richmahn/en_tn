# Connecting Statement:

Jesus continues to tell the parable he began in [Luke 19:11](../19/11.md).

# By your own words

His "words" refer to all that he had said. Alternate translation: "Based on what you have said" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# You knew that I am a demanding person

The nobleman was repeating what the servant had said about him. He was not saying that it was true. Alternate translation: "You say that I am a demanding person"
