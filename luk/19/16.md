# Connecting Statement:

Jesus continues to tell the parable he began in [Luke 19:11](./11.md).

# The first

"The first servant" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])

# came before him

"came before the nobleman"

# your mina has made ten minas more

It is implied that the servant was the one who caused the profit. AT: "I used your mina to make a profit of ten more minas" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# mina

A mina was 600 grams, probably of silver. Each mina was equal to 100 days' wages, what people would be paid for about four months' work. See how you translated this in [Luke 19:13](./13.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bweight]])

# Well done

"You have done well." Your language may have a phrase that an employer would use to show approval, such as "Good job."

# very little

This refers to the one mina, which the nobleman apparently did not consider to be a lot of money.
