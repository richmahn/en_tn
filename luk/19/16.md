(Jesus continues telling his parable.)

## The first ##

"The first servant"

## came before him ##

The word "him" refers to the nobleman.

## mina ##

See how you translated this in [Luke 19:13](./13.md).

## Well done ##

"You have done well." Your language may have a phrase that an employer would use to show approval, such as "Good job."
