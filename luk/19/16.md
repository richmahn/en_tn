# The first

"The first servant" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])

# came before him

"came before the nobleman"

# your mina has made ten minas more

It is implied that the servant was the one who caused the profit. AT: "I used your mina to make a profit of ten more minas" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# mina

A mina is 600 grams. Each mina was worth about what someone would be paid in four months. See how you translated this in [Luke 19:13](./13.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bweight]])

# Well done

"You have done well." Your language may have a phrase that an employer would use to show approval, such as "Good job."

# very little

This refers to the one mina, which the nobleman apparently did not consider to be a lot of money.
