## translationNotes

* **When he had said these things** - The word "he" refers to Jesus, not to the king in the previous parable. Some versions make this clear by translating it as "When Jesus had said these things."
* **going up to Jerusalem** - Jerusalem is about 975 meters higher in elevation then Jericho.
