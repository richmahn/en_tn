## rebuke your disciples ##

AT: "tell your disciples to stop doing these things"

## I tell you ##

Jesus said this to emphasize what he would say next.

## If these were silent ##

This is a hypothetical situation. Some translators may need to  make it clear what Jesus was implying when he said this: "No, I will not rebuke them, for if these people were to be silentâ€¦" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]], [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

## the stones would cry out ##

"the stones would call out praises"
