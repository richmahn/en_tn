## translationNotes

* **rebuke your disciples** - AT: "tell your disciples to stop doing these things"
* **I tell you** - Jesus said this to emphasize what he would say next.
* **If these were silent** - This is a hypothetical situation. Some translators may need to  make it clear what Jesus was implying when he said this: "No, I will not rebuke them, for if these people were to be silentâ€¦" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]], [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
* **the stones would cry out** - "the stones would call out praises"
