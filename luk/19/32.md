# Those who were sent

This can be stated in active form. AT: "The two disciples that Jesus sent" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# the owners

"the owners of the colt"

# Why are you untying ... Lord has need of it

This is the question and answer that Jesus predicted in [Luke 19:31](./29.md) and should be translated the same as in that verse.

# threw their cloaks upon the colt

"put their robes on the young donkey." Cloaks are outer robes.

# set Jesus on it

"helped Jesus get up on and ride on the colt"

# they spread their cloaks

"people spread their cloaks." This is a sign of giving honor to someone. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
