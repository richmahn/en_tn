# Connecting Statement:

Jesus continues to tell the parable he began in [Luke 19:11](./11.md).

# I say to you

This was the king speaking. Some translators may want to start this verse with "And the king replied, 'I say to you'" or "But the king said 'I tell you this'" .

# everyone who has will be given more

It is implied that what he has is the money he earned by using his mina faithfully. This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "everyone who uses well what he has been given, I will give him more" or "to everyone who uses well what I have given him I will give more" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# from him that has not

It is implied that the reason he does not have money is because he did not use his mina faithfully. Alternate translation: "from the person who does not use well what I have given him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# will be taken away

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "I will take away from him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
