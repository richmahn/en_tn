# Connecting Statement:

Jesus continues to tell the parable he began in [Luke 19:11](./11.md).

# The second

"The second servant" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])

# Your mina, lord, has made five minas

It is implied that the servant was the one who caused the profit. AT: "Lord, I used your mina to make a profit of five more minas" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# mina

A mina was 600 grams, probably of silver. Each mina was equal to 100 days' wages, what people would be paid for about four months' work. See how you translated this in [Luke 19:13](./13.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bweight]])

# You take charge over five cities

"You will have authority over five cities"
