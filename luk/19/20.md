Jesus continues telling his parable.

## mina ##

See how you translated this in [Luke 19:13](./13.md).

## a severe man ##

"a stern man" or "a man who expects a lot from his servants" or "a hard man" (UDB)

## you take up that which you did not lay down ##

This can be translated as "you take out what you did not put in" or "you take what is not yours." It was a proverb describing a greedy person. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/proverb]])

## reap that which you did not sow ##

"reap what you did not plant." This is a metaphor. The servant was comparing his master to a farmer who takes food that someone else planted. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## reap ##

"harvest" or "collect" or "gather"
