# the days will come upon you

This indicates that they would experience difficult times. Some languages do not talk about time coming. AT: "in the future these things will happen to you" or "soon you will endure troublesome times"

# you

The word "you" is singular because Jesus was speaking to the city. But if this would be unnatural in your language, you could use a plural form of "you" to refer to the people of the city. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# barricade

This refers to a wall to keep the people from getting out of the city.

# They will strike you down to the ground

Since Jesus was speaking to the city, this refers to the walls and buildings of the city. AT: "They will destroy your walls" or "They will destroy your city"

# your children with you

This refers to the people who lived in the city. AT: "they will kill you people in the city"

# They will not leave one stone upon another

"They will not leave any of the stones in place." This is a hyperbole to express that the enemies would completely destroy the city, which was built of stones. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# you did not recognize it

"you did not acknowledge"
