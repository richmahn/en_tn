# Luke 19 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

After Jesus helped a man named Zacchaeus repent of his sins ([Luke 19:1-10](./01.md)), he taught his followers that when he began to rule as king they would need to tell them what they had done with the things he had given them to take care of ([Luke 19:11-27](./11.md)). He did this by telling them a parable. After that, he rode into Jerusalem on a colt ([Luke 19:28-48](./28.md)). (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/kingdomofgod]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### "Sinner" #####
The Pharisees refer to a group of people as "sinners." The Jewish leaders thought these people were sinful, but in reality the leaders were also sinful. This can be taken as irony. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])

##### Servants #####

God expects his people to remember that everything in the world belongs to God. God gives his people things so they can serve him. He wants them to please him by doing what he wants them to do with everything he has given them. One day Jesus will ask his servants what they have done with everything he gave them to use. He will give a reward to those who have done what he wanted them to do, and he will punish those who have not.

##### The donkey and the colt #####

Jesus rode into Jerusalem on an animal. In this way he was like a king who came into a city after he had won an important battle. Also, the kings of Israel in the Old Testament rode on a donkeys. Other kings rode on horses. So Jesus was showing that he was the king of Israel and that he was not like other kings.

Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John all wrote about this event. Matthew and Mark wrote that the disciples brought Jesus a donkey. John wrote that Jesus found a donkey. Luke wrote that they brought him a colt. Only Matthew wrote that there were both a donkey had a colt. No one knows for sure whether Jesus rode the donkey or the colt. It is best to translate each of these accounts as it appears in the ULT without trying to make them all say exactly the same thing. (See: [Matthew 21:1-7](../../mat/21/01.md) and [Mark 11:1-7](../../mrk/11/01.md) and [Luke 19:29-36](../../luk/19/29.md) and [John 12:14-15](../../jhn/12/14.md))

##### Spreading garments and branches #####

When king would enter the cities they ruled, people would cut branches from trees and take off the clothes that they wore to stay warm in cold weather and spread them all on the road so the king would ride over them. They did this to honor the king and show that they loved him. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/honor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])

##### The merchants in the temple #####

Jesus forced the people who were selling animals in the temple to leave. He did this to show everyone that he had authority over the temple and that only those who were righteous, who did what God said was good, could be in it. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]])
