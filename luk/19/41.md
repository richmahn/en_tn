# the city

This refers to Jerusalem.

# he wept over it

The word "it" refers to the city of Jerusalem, but it represents the people who lived in that city. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# If only you had known ... bring you peace

Jesus expressed his sadness that the people of Jerusalem had missed the opportunity to be at peace with God.

# you

The word "you" is singular because Jesus was speaking to the city. But if this would be unnatural in your language, you could use a plural form of "you" to refer to the people of the city. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# they are hidden from your eyes

"your eyes" refer to the ability to see. This can be stated in active form. AT: "you can no longer see them" or "you are unable to know it" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
