# If anyone asks you ... need of it

Jesus tells the disciples how to answer a question that has not yet been asked. However, people in the village will soon ask the question. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])

# If anyone asks you, 'Why are you untying it?' say

The inner quote can also be translated as an indirect quote. Alternate translation: "If any one asks you why you are untying it, say" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
