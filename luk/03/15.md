## translationNotes

* **as the people** - This refers to the same people who came to John. This could be translated as "because the people."
* **I baptize you with water** - "I baptize using water" or "I baptize by means of water"
* **not worthy even to untie the strap of his sandals** - This could be translated as "not important enough even to loosen the straps of his sandals." Untying the straps of sandals was a duty of a slave. John was saying that the one who would come is so great that John was not even worthy enough to be his slave.
* **sandals** - "shoes" or "flip-flops" or "thongs"
* **He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire** - This metaphor compares literal baptism that brings a person into contact with water to a spiritual baptism that brings them into contact with the Holy Spirit and with fire. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **fire** - Here this refers to God's power. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
