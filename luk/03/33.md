This is a continuation of the list of Jesus' ancestors. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

## the son of Amminadab, the son of Admin... ##

This could be translated as “who was the son of Amminadab, who was the son of Admin...” or “Levi was the son of Amminadab, Simeon was the son of Admin...” or “Nashon's father was Amminadab, Amminadab's father was Admin....” Use the same wording as you used in the previous verses.
