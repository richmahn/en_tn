# Herod the tetrarch

Herod was a tetrarch, not a king. He had only limited rule over the region of Galilee.

# for marrying his brother's wife Herodias

"because Herod married Herodias, his own brother's wife." This was evil because Herod's brother was still alive. This can be stated clearly. Alternate translation: "because he married his brother's wife, Herodias, while his brother was still alive" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
