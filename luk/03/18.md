# General Information:

The story tells what is going to happen to John but has not happened at this time. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])

# With many other exhortations

"With many other strong urgings"

# Herod the tetrarch

Herod was a tetrarch, not a king. He had only limited rule over the region of Galilee.

# for marrying his brother's wife Herodias

"because Herod married Herodias, his own brother's wife." This was evil because Herod's brother was still alive. This can be stated clearly. AT: "because he married his brother's wife, Herodias, while his brother was still alive" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# he locked John up in prison

Because Herod was tetrarch, he probably locked John up by ordering his soldiers to lock John up. AT: "he had his soldiers lock John up in prison" or "he told his soldiers to put John in prison" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
