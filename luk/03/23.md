Consider how people normally list ancestors in your language. You should use the same wording throughout the whole list. Possible formats are 1) "who was the son of Heli, who was the son of Matthat, who was the son of Levi" or 2) "Joseph was the son of Heli, Heli was the son of Matthat, Matthat was the son of Levi" or 3) "Heli's father was Matthat, Matthat's father was Levi" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
