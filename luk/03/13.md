# Do not collect more money

"Do not ask for more money" or "Do not demand more money." Tax collectors had been collecting more money than they should have been collecting. John tells them to stop doing that.

# than you have been ordered to collect

This is passive to show that the tax collector's authority comes from Rome. Alternate translation: "than what the Romans have authorized you to take" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
