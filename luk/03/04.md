## translationNotes

* **As it is written … prophet** - This could be translated as "This happened as Isaiah the prophet had written in his book" or "John fulfilled the words that the prophet Isaiah had written in his book." Verses 4-6 are a quotation from Isaiah [[:en:bible:notes:isa:40:03]].
* **the way** - "the path" or "the road"
* **Make ready….make his paths straight** - This section is in the style of Hebrew poetry, which often repeats important phrases in similar words. "Make ready the way of the Lord" is therefore another way to say "Make his paths straight." The main difference is the first indicates it happens once, while the second should continue to be done.
* **Make ready the way of the Lord** - This metaphor of a road means "Repent and be ready for when the Lord comes." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **Make his paths straight** - This image of a path is also a metaphor that means "Be continually ready for the Lord to come."
