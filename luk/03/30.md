This is a continuation of the list of Jesus' ancestors. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

## the son of Simeon, the son of Judah… ##

This could be translated as “who was the son of Simeon, who was the son of Judah…” or “Levi was the son of Simeon, Simeon was the son of Judah…” or “Levi's father was Simeon, Simeon's father was Judah….” Use the same wording as you used in the previous verses.
