# produce fruits that are worthy of repentance

In this metaphor, a person's behavior is compared to fruit. Just as a plant is expected to produce fruit that is appropriate for that kind of plant, a person who says that he has repented is expected to live righteously. Alternate translation: "produce the kind of fruit that shows that you have repented" or "do the good things that show that you have turned away from your sin" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# to say within yourselves

"saying to yourselves" or "thinking"

# We have Abraham for our father

"Abraham is our ancestor" or "We are Abraham's descendants." If it is unclear why they would say this, you may also add the implied information: "so God will not punish us." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# raise up children for Abraham

"create children for Abraham"

# from these stones

John was probably referring to the actual stones along the Jordan River.
