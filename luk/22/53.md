# I was daily with you

"I was among you every day"

# in the temple

Only priests entered the temple. Alternate translation: "in the temple courts" or "at the temple"

# lay your hands on me

In this verse, to lay hands on someone is to arrest that person. Alternate translation: "arrest me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# this is your hour

"this is the time for you to do whatever you want"

# the authority of darkness

It may be helpful to repeat the reference to time. "Darkness" is a metonym for Satan. Alternate translation: "the time of the authority of darkness" or "the time when God is allowing Satan to do whatever he wants" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]] and  [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
