# Then you are the Son of God?

The council asked this question because they wanted Jesus to explicitly confirm their understanding that he was saying he was the Son of God. Alternate translation: "So when you said that, did you mean that you are the Son of God?" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# Son of God

This is an important title for Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])

# You say that I am

"Yes, it is just like you say"
