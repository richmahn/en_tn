# if I ask you, you will not answer

This is the second hypothetical statement. It was a way for Jesus to rebuke them without giving them a reason to convict him. These words, along with "If I tell you, you will not believe" (verse 67), show that Jesus did not believe that the council was really looking for the truth. Your language may have a way of indicating that the action has not actually happened. Jesus is saying that whether he speaks or asks them to speak, they will not respond correctly.
