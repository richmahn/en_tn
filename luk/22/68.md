# If I tell you ... if I ask you

Jesus is saying that whether he speaks or asks them to speak, they will not respond correctly. These two phrases together show that Jesus did not believe that the council was really looking for the truth.

# if I ask you, you will not answer

This is the second hypothetical statement. It was a way for Jesus to rebuke them without giving them a reason to convict him. Your language may have a way of indicating that the action has not actually happened. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
