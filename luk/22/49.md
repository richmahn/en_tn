# those who were around Jesus

This refers to Jesus' disciples.

# what was happening

This refers to the priests and soldiers coming to arrest Jesus.

# strike with the sword

The question is about the type of fight they should engage in (a sword fight), not what weapon they should use (the swords that they brought, [Luke 22:38](./38.md)), but your translation may need to speak of the weapons they brought. AT: "fight against them with the swords we brought" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
