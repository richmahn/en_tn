# insisted and said

"said insistently" or "said loudly"

# Truly this man

Here "this man" refers to Peter. The speaker probably did not know Peter's name.

# he is a Galilean

The man could probably tell Peter was from Galilee from the way he talked. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# Man

Peter did not know the man's name. He was not insulting him by calling him "Man." If people would think he was insulting him, you could use a culturally acceptable way for a man to address a man he does not know, or you could leave out the word. See how you translated this in [Luke 22:58](./56.md).

# I do not know what you are saying

"I do not know what you are talking about." This expression means that Peter completely disagree with the man. AT: "what you said is not true at all" or "what you said is completely false" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# while he was speaking

"while Peter was speaking"

# a rooster crowed

Roosters often crow just before the sun appears in the morning. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Luke 22:34](./33.md).
