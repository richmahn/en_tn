Jesus used this word to tell them to pay close attention and to do exactly what he tells them.

# a man bearing a pitcher of water will meet you

"you will see a man carrying a pitcher of water"

# bearing a pitcher of water

"carrying a jar with water in it." He probably would have carried the jar on his shoulder.

# Follow him into the house

"Follow him, and go into the house"
