# General Information:

Jesus speaks directly to Simon.

# Simon, Simon

Jesus said his name twice to show that what he was about to say to him was very important.

# to have you, that he might sift you

The word "you" refers to all of the apostles. Languages that have different forms of "you" should use the plural form. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# sift you as wheat

This means that Satan wanted to test the disciples to find something wrong. AT: "test you like someone passes grain through a sieve" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
