(Jesus speaks directly to Simon.)

## Simon, Simon ##

Jesus said his name twice to show that what he was about to say to him was very important.

## to have you that he might sift you ##

The word "you" refers to all of the apostles. Languages that have different forms of "you" should use the plural form. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

## sift you as wheat ##

This is a metaphor that means "test you to find something wrong." The meaning can be made clear as in the UDB: "test you." And it can be translated as a simile: "like someone shakes grain in a sieve" as in the UDB. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## But I have prayed for you ##

The word "you" here refers specifically to Simon. Languages that have different forms of you should use the singular form.

## that your faith will not fail ##

This can be expressed positively as "that you will continue to have faith" or "that you will continue to trust me." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## your brothers ##

This refers to the other disciples. This can be translated as "your fellow believers" or "your brothers in the faith" or "the other disciples."
