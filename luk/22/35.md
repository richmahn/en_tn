# Connecting Statement:

Jesus turns his attention back to speaking to all of his disciples.

# Jesus said to them, "When ... did you lack anything?" They answered, "Nothing."

Jesus uses a question to help the apostles remember how well the people provided for them as they traveled. Though this is a rhetorical question and Jesus is not asking for information, you should translate it as a question unless only a statement would cause the disciples to reply that they had lacked nothing.  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# When I sent you out

Jesus was talking to his apostles. So languages that have different forms of "you" should use the plural form. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# purse

A purse is a bag for holding money. Here it is used to refer to "money." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# a bag of provisions

"travelers' bag" or "bag of food"

# Nothing

It may be helpful to some audiences to include more about the conversation. AT: "We did not lack anything" or "We had everything we needed" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# The one who does not have a sword should sell his cloak

Jesus was not referring to a specific person who did not have a sword. AT: "If anyone does not have a sword, he should sell his cloak"

# cloak

"coat" or "outer garment"
