## what is written about me ##

"what a prophet wrote about me in the scriptures" (UDB)

## must be fulfilled ##

The apostles would have understood that God would cause everything written in the scriptures to happen. You could make this explicit by rewording the entire phrase: "God will cause everything that is written in the scriptures to be fulfilled." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

## he was considered with the lawless ##

"People considered him to be one of the lawless people." Some languages may need to state explicitly "This is written in the scripture. 'And he was considered with the lawless." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

## the lawless ##

"those who break the law" or "criminals"

## For what is predicted about me is being fulfilled ##

This phrase is not clear in the Greek. Another possible meaning is "My life is coming to an end."

## they said ##

This refers to at least two of Jesus' apostles.

## It is enough ##

Possible meanings are 1) "That is enough swords" or 2) "That is enough talk about this." When Jesus said that they should buy swords, he was mainly telling them about the danger they would all face. He may not have really wanted them to buy swords and fight.
