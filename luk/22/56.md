## looked straight at him and said ##

"looked straight at Peter and said to the other people in the courtyard"

## This man also was with him ##

The woman was telling the people about Peter being with Jesus. She probably did not know Peter's name.

## But Peter denied it ##

"But Peter said that it was not true"

## Woman, I do not know him ##

Peter did not know the woman's name. He was not insulting her by calling her "woman." If people would think he was insulting her, you could use a culturally acceptable way for a man to address a woman he does not know, or you could leave out the word.

## Man, I am not ##

See the note above about "woman."
