# prepare

This is a general word meaning "make ready." Jesus was not necessarily telling Peter and John to do all the cooking.

# so that we may eat it

Jesus was including Peter and John when he said "we." Peter and John would be part of the group of the disciples that would eat the meal. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-inclusive]])
