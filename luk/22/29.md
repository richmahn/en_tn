# I give to you a kingdom, even as my Father has given a kingdom to me

Some languages may need to change the order. Alternate translation: "Just as my father has given a kingdom to me, I give a kingdom to you"

# I give to you a kingdom

"I make you rulers in God's kingdom" or "I give you authority to rule in the kingdom" or "I will make you kings"

# even as my Father has given a kingdom to me

"just as my Father has given me authority to rule as king in his kingdom"
