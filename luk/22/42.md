# Father, if you are willing

Jesus will bear the guilt of every person's sin on the cross. He prays to his Father, asking if there is another way.

# Father

This is an important title for God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])

# remove this cup from me

Jesus refers to what he will soon experience as if it were a cup of bitter liquid that he would have to drink. Alternate translation: "allow me to not drink from this cup" or "allow me to not experience what is about to happen" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Nevertheless not my will, but yours be done

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "However, do what is according to your will rather than what is according to my will" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
