# Do you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs?

"Do you come out with swords and clubs because you think I am a robber?" Jesus uses this question to scold the Jewish leaders. AT: "You know that I am not a robber, yet you come out to me bringing swords and clubs." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
