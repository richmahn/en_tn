## translationNotes

* **The Day of Unleavened Bread** - "The Day of Bread without Yeast" or "The Day of Flatbread." This was the day the Jews would take all bread made with yeast out of their homes. Then they would celebrate the Festival of Unleavened Bread for seven days.
* **the Passover lamb must be sacrificed** - "people had to kill the lamb for the Passover meal." Each family or group of people would kill a lamb and eat it together, so many lambs were killed.
* **so that we may eat it** - Jesus was including Peter and John when he said "we." Peter and John would be part of the group that would eat the meal. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive]])
* **prepare** - This is a general word meaning "make ready." Jesus was not necessarily telling Peter and John to do all the cooking.
* **you want us to make preparations** - The word "us" does not include Jesus. Jesus would not be part of the group that would prepare the meal. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]])
* **make preparations** - "make preparations for the meal" or "prepare the meal"
