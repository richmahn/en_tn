# Connecting Statement:

Jesus continues teaching his apostles.

# it must not be like this with you

"you should not act like that"

# the youngest

Older people were respected in that culture. The leaders were usually older people and were called "elders." The youngest person would be the least likely to lead, and the least important. AT: "the least important" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the one who serves

"a servant"

# For

This connects Jesus' commands in verse 26 with the whole of verse 27. It means that the most important person should serve because Jesus is a servant.

# For who is greater ... serves?

"For who is more important ... serves?" Jesus uses this question to begin to explain to the apostles who is truly great. AT: "I want you to think about who is greater ... serves." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# the one who sits at the table

"the one who is dining"

# Is it not the one who sits at the table?

Jesus uses another question to teach the disciples. AT: "Of course the one who sits at the table is more important than the servant!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Yet I am among you as one who serves

"But I am with you to be a servant" or "But I am with you to show you how a servant acts." The word "yet" is here because there is a contrast between what people would expect Jesus to be like and what he really was like.
