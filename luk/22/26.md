# Connecting Statement:

Jesus continues teaching his apostles.

# it must not be like this with you

"you should not act like that"

# the youngest

Older people were respected in that culture. The leaders were usually older people and were called "elders." The youngest person would be the least likely to lead, and the least important. Alternate translation: "the least important" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the one who serves

"a servant"
