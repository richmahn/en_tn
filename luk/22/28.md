## translationNotes

* Jesus continues to teach his disciples.
* **have continued with me in my temptations** - "have stayed with me through my struggles"
* **I give to you a kingdom even as my Father has given a kingdom to me** - Some languages may need to change the order. "Just as my father has given a kingdom to me, I give it to you."
* **I give to you a kingdom** - "I make you rulers in God's kingdom" (UDB) or "I give you authority to rule in the kingdom" or "I will make you kings"
* **even as my Father has given a kingdom to me** - "just as my Father gave me authority to rule as king in his kingdom"
* **you will sit on thrones** - "Sit on thrones" is a metonym for "do the work of kings." This means "you will work as kings" or "you will do the work of kings." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
* **thrones** - This can be translated as "kings' chairs" or "chairs made for kings."
