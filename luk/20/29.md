## translationNotes

* The Sadducees continue speaking and tell Jesus a story.
* **There were seven brothers** - This may have happened, but it is probably a story that they made up to test Jesus.
* **died childless** - "died without having any children" or "died, but did not have any children"
* **the second as well** - This can be translated as "the second married her and the same thing happened" or "the second brother married her and died without having any children."
* **The third took her** - "the third married her"
* **likewise the seven also left no children, and died** - This can be translated as "in the same way the rest of the seven brothers married her and had no children and died."
* **In the resurrection** - "when people are raised from the dead" or "when dead people will become alive again" (UDB). Some languages have a way of showing that the Sadducees did not believe that there would be a resurrection, such as "In the supposed resurrection" or "When dead people are supposedly raised from the dead."
