# Connecting Statement:

The Sadducees finish asking Jesus their question.

# General Information:

The Sadducees tell Jesus a short story in verses 29-32. This is a story they made up as an example. In verse 33, they ask Jesus a question about the story they told.

# There were seven brothers

This may have happened, but it is probably a story that they made up to test Jesus.

# the first ... the second ... The third

"brother number one ... brother number two ... Brother number three" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])

# died childless

"died without having any children" or "died, but did not have any children"

# the second as well

They did not repeat many of the details to keep the story short. AT: "the second married her and the same thing happened" or "the second brother married her and died without having any children" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# The third took her

"The third married her"

# likewise the seven also left no children, and died

They did not repeat many of the details to keep the story short. AT: "in the same way the rest of the seven brothers married her and had no children and died" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# the seven

"all seven of the brothers" or "each of the seven brothers"

# In the resurrection

"When people are raised from the dead" or "When dead people will become alive again." Some languages have a way of showing that the Sadducees did not believe that there would be a resurrection, such as "In the supposed resurrection" or "When dead people are supposedly raised from the dead."
