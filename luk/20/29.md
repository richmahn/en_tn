The Sadducees tell Jesus a short story in verses 29-32. This is a story they made up as an example. In verse 33, they ask Jesus a question about the story they told.

# Connecting Statement:

The Sadducees finish asking Jesus their question.

# There were seven brothers

This may have happened, but it is probably a story that they made up to test Jesus.

"brother number one ... brother number two ... Brother number three" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
