## translationNotes

* (Jesus continues telling his parable.)
* **treated him shamefully** - "humiliated him"
* **wounded him** - "injured him"
* **yet a third** - "even a third servant." The word "yet" hints at the fact that the landowner should not have had to send the second servant, but he went beyond that and sent a third servant.
