# General Information:

Jesus responds to the chief priests, scribes, and elders.

# He answered and said to them

"Jesus replied"

# Was it from heaven or from men?

Jesus knew that John's authority came from heaven. He asked the question so the Jewish leaders would have to tell what they thought to all who were listening. AT: "Do you think John's authority to baptize people came from heaven or from men?" or "Do you think God told John to baptize people, or did people tell him to do it?"

# from heaven

"from God." Jewish people avoided referring to God by his name "Yahweh." Often they used the word "heaven" to refer to him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
