# Connecting Statement:

Jesus begins to answer the Sadducees.

# The sons of this world

"The people of this world" or "The people of this time." This is in contrast with those in heaven or the people who live after the resurrection.

# marry and are given in marriage

In that culture they spoke of men marrying women and women being given in marriage to their husband. This can also be stated in active form. AT: "get married" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
