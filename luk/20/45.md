Jesus now directs his attention to his disciples and speaks mainly to them.

# Beware of

"Be on guard against"

# who desire to walk in long robes

Long robes would show that they were important. AT: "who like to walk around wearing their important robes" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# They also devour widows' houses

"They also eat up widows' houses." The scribes are spoken of as if they were hungry animals that eat up the widows' houses. The word "houses" is a synecdoche for both where the widow lives and all the possessions she puts in her home. AT: "They also take away from widows all their possessions" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# for a show they make long prayers

"they pretend to be righteous and make long prayers" or "they make long prayers so that people will see them"

# Men like this will receive greater condemnation

"They will receive a more severe judgment." This can be stated in active form. AT: "God will certainly punish them very severely" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
