# Now

This word is used here to mark a break in the main teaching. Here Jesus explains how this story proves that people rise from the dead.

# he is not the God of the dead, but of the living

These two sentences have similar meaning said twice for emphasis. Some languages have different ways of showing emphasis. AT: "the Lord is the God of living people only" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# but of the living

"but the God of living people." Since these people died physically, they must still be alive spiritually. AT: "but the God of people whose spirits are alive, even though their bodies may have died" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# because all live to him

"because in God's sight they all are still alive" or "because their spirits are alive in God's presence"
