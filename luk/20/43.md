# until I make your enemies your footstool

The Messiah's enemies are spoken of as if they were furniture on which he would rest his feet. This was an image of submission. Alternate translation: "until I make your enemies like a footstool for you" or "until I conquer your enemies for you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
