# They also devour widows' houses

"They also eat up widows' houses." The scribes are spoken of as if they were hungry animals that eat up the widows' houses. The word "houses" is a synecdoche for both where the widow lives and all the possessions she puts in her home. Alternate translation: "They also take away from widows all their possessions" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# for a show they make long prayers

"they pretend to be righteous and make long prayers" or "they make long prayers so that people will see them"

# Men like this will receive greater condemnation

"They will receive a more severe judgment." This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "God will certainly punish them very severely" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
