## translationNotes

* **How do they say** - This is a rhetorical question. It can be translated as "Why do they say" or "Let's think about them saying" or "I will talk about them saying." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **David's son** - "King David's descendant." The word "son" is used here to refer to a descendant. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]]) In this case it refers to the one who would reign over God's kingdom.
* **The Lord said to my Lord** - This can be translated as "The Lord God said to my Lord" or "God said to my Lord." This is a quotation from Psalm [[:en:bible:notes:psa:110:001]] which says "Yahweh said to my Lord." But the Jews stopped saying "Yahweh" and often said "Lord" instead.
* **my Lord** - David was referring to the Christ as "my Lord."
* **my right hand** - The right side is the place of honor. God was honoring the Messiah by saying "Sit at my right hand."
* **until I make your enemies your footstool** - This is a metaphor. It can be translated as "until I make your enemies like a footstool for you" or "until I conquer your enemies for you." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **footstool** - A footstool is something people rest their feet on.
* **so how is he David's son?** - "so how can the Christ be David's son?" This is a rhetorical question. It can be translated as "This shows that the Christ is not merely David's descendant."
