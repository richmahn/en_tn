# Connecting Statement:

Jesus finishes answering the Sadducees.

# But that the dead are raised, even Moses showed

The word "even" is here because the Sadducees might not have been surprised that some scriptures say that the dead are raised, but they did not expect Moses to have written something like that. Alternate translation: "But even Moses showed that dead people rise from the dead" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# the dead are raised

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "God causes the dead to live again" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# in the place concerning the bush

"in the part of scripture where he wrote about the burning bush" or "in the scripture about the burning bush" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# where he calls the Lord

"where Moses called the Lord"

# the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob

"the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob." They all worshiped the same God.
