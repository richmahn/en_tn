## translationNotes

* (Jesus continues speaking)
* **But that the dead are raised, even Moses showed** - "But even Moses showed that dead people are raised from death." The word "even" is here because the Sadducees might not have been surprised that some scriptures say that the dead are raised, but they did not expect Moses to have written something like that.
* **in the place concerning the bush** - "In the part of scripture where he wrote about the burning bush" or "in the scripture about the burning bush"
* **when he calls the Lord** - "when Moses called the Lord"
* **the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob** - "The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob." They all worshipped the same God.
* **Now he is not the God of the dead** - "The Lord is not the God of dead people" or "The Lord is not the God of people who have died and whose spirits are also dead"
* **but of the living** - "but the God of living people" or "the God of people whose spirits are alive." If this is unclear, you may need to add the implied information: "even though their bodies may have died." (See [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
* **because all live to him** - "because in God's sight they all are still alive." This can also be translated as "because God knows that their spirits are alive."
