# General Information:

This is the next part of the story. We do not know where this take places, though it is possible they are in the temple courtyard. Jesus is talking with some Sadducees.

# the ones who say that there is no resurrection

This phrase identifies the Sadducees as being the group of Jews that say that no one would rise from the dead. It does not imply that some Sadducees believed that there is a resurrection and some did not. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish]])

# if a man's brother dies, having a wife, and being childless

"if a man's brother dies when he has a wife but does not have children"

# the man should take the brother's wife

"the man should marry his dead brother's widow"

# have a child for his brother

The Jews considered the children born from this kind of second marriage to belong to the dead man. They inherited his property and possessions and carried on his name. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
