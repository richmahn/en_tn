# Connecting Statement:

Jesus continues teaching the crowd.

# But Jesus looked at them

"But Jesus stared at them" or "But he looked straight at them." He did this to hold them accountable to understand what he was saying.

# What is the meaning of that which is written: 'The stone ... cornerstone'?

Jesus uses a question to teach the crowd. Alternate translation: "You should be able to understand that which is written: 'The stone ... cornerstone.'" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# that which is written

"this scripture"

# The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone

This is the first of three metaphors in a prophecy from the book of Psalms. This one refers to the Messiah as if he were a stone that builders chose not to use, but that God made the most important stone. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# The stone that the builders rejected

"The stone that the builders said was not good enough to use for building." In those days people used stones to build the walls of houses and other buildings.

# the builders

This refers to the religious rulers who are rejecting Jesus as Messiah.

# the cornerstone

"the chief stone of the building" or "the most important stone of the building"
