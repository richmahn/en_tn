# The Lord said to my Lord

This is a quotation from the book of Psalms which says "Yahweh said to my Lord." But the Jews stopped saying "Yahweh" and often said "Lord" instead. AT: "The Lord God said to my Lord" or "God said to my Lord"

# my Lord

David was referring to the Christ as "my Lord."

# Sit at my right hand

To sit at the "right hand of God" is a symbolic action of receiving great honor and authority from God. AT: "Sit in the place of honor beside me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
