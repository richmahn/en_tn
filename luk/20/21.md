## translationNotes

* **but you teach the truth about the way of God** - This is part of what the spy was saying that they knew about Jesus.
* **are not influenced by anyone** - Possible meanings are 1) "you tell the truth even if important people do not like it" (UDB) or 2) "you do not favor one person over another." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
* **Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar** - They hoped that Jesus would say either "yes" or "no." If he said "yes," then the Jewish people would be angry with him for telling them to pay taxes to a foreign government. If he said "no," then the religious leaders could tell the Romans that Jesus was teaching the people to break the Roman laws.
* **Is it lawful** - They were asking about God's law, not about Caesar's law. This can also be translated "Does our law permit us."
* **Caesar** - Because Caesar was the ruler of the Roman government, they could refer to the Roman government by Caesar's name. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
