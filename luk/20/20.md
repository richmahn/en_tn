# they sent out spies

"the scribes and chief priests sent spies to watch Jesus"

# that they might find fault with his speech

"because they wanted to accuse Jesus of saying something bad"

# to the rule and to the authority of the governor

"Rule" and "authority" are two ways of saying that they wanted the governor to judge Jesus. It can be translated with one or both expressions. Alternate translation: "so that the governor would punish Jesus" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
