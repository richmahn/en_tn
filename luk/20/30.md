# the second as well

Jesus kept the story short by not repeating many of the details. Alternate translation: "the second married her and the same thing happened" or "the second brother married her and died without having any children" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# the second

"brother number two" or "the oldest brother who was still alive" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
