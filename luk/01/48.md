## translationNotes

* (Mary continues to praise God:)
* **lowly** - "unimportant" or "ordinary" or "simple" or "poor." Mary did not have high social standing.
* **paid attention** - "thought about" or "remembered." It could be translated as "did not forget." This is not an issue of God's ability to remember, but his choosing to remember.
* **from now on** - “now and in the future”
* **the Mighty One** - This refers to God. It could be translated as "God, the Powerful One."
* **his name** - "he"
