## translationNotes

* This concludes the angel's speech to Mary.
* **your relative** - If you need to state a specific relationship, Elizabeth was probably Mary's aunt or great-aunt.
* **also has conceived a son in her old age** - "has also become pregnant with a son, even though she is already very old" or "even though she is old, has also become pregnant and will bear a son" Make sure it doesn't sound as though both Mary and Elizabeth were old when they conceived.
* **nothing is impossible for God!** - "because God can do anything" What God had done for Elizabeth was proof that God was able to do anything, and that he could  even enable Mary to become pregnant without her having sexual relations. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
* **I am the Lord's servant** - "I am a servant of the Lord" Choose an expression that shows her humility and obedience to the Lord. She was not boasting about being the Lord's servant.
* **Let this happen to me** - Mary was expressing her willingness for the things to happen the angel had told her were about to happen.
