The angel continues speaking to Zechariah

## For ##

"Because" or "In addition to this"

## he will be great in the sight of the Lord ##

AT:  "he will do very important things for the Lord"

## He will be filled with the Holy Spirit ##

“The Holy Spirit will empower him” or “The Holy Spirit will guide him” Make sure it does not sound similar to what an evil spirit might do to a person. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## even while in his mother's womb ##

The word “even” here indicates that this is especially surprising news. People had been filled with the Holy Spirit before, but no one had heard of an unborn baby's being filled with the Holy Spirit.
