# Fear came on all who lived around them

"All who lived around Zechariah and Elizabeth were afraid." It may be helpful to state clearly why they were afraid. AT: "All who lived around them were in awe of God because he had done this to Zechariah" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# all who lived around them

The word "all" here is a generalization. AT: "those who lived around them" or "many who lived in that area" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# All these matters were spread throughout all the hill country of Judea

The phrase "these matters were spread" is a metaphor for people talking about them. The passive verb here can also be translated in active form. AT: "All these matters were talked about by people throughout all the hill country of Judea" or "People throughout the hill country of Judea talked about all these matters" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
