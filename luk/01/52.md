# He has thrown down princes from their thrones

A throne is a chair that a ruler sits on, and it is a symbol of his authority. If a prince is brought down from his throne, it means he no longer has the authority to reign. Alternate translation: "He has taken away the authority of princes" or "He has made rulers stop ruling" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# raised up those of low condition

In this word picture, people who are important are higher than people who are less important. Alternate translation: "has has made humble people important" or "has given honor to people whom others have not honored" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# of low condition

"in poverty." See how you translated this in [Luke 1:48](../01/48.md).
