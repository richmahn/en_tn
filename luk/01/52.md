## translationNotes

* Mary continues to praise God.
* **He has pulled down rulers from their thrones** - AT: "He has taken away the authority of kings" or AT: "He has made rulers stop ruling" A throne is a chair that a king sits on, and it is a symbol of his authority. If a king is brought down from his throne, it means he no longer has the authority to reign as king.
* **has raised up lowly people** - In this word picture, people who are important are higher than people who are less important. If your language does not have this kind of metaphor, you could translate this as AT: "has made humble people important" or AT: "has given honor to people whom others have not honored" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **given good things** - AT: "given good food"
