While Zechariah does his duty in the temple, an angel comes from God to give him a message.

# Now

This word marks the beginning of the action in the story.

# appeared to him

"suddenly came to him" or "was suddenly there with Zechariah." This expresses that the angel was present with Zechariah, and not simply a vision.

# Zechariah ... was terrified ... fear fell on him

These two phrases mean the same thing, and emphasize how afraid Zechariah was.

# When Zechariah saw him

# Do not be afraid

"Stop being afraid of me" or "You do not need to be afraid of me"

# your prayer has been heard
