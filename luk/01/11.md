# Connecting Statement:

While Zechariah does his duty in the temple, an angel comes from God to give him a message.

# Now

This word marks the beginning of the action in the story.

# appeared to him

"suddenly came to him" or "was suddenly there with Zechariah." This expresses that the angel was present with Zechariah, and not simply a vision.

# Zechariah ... was terrified ... fear fell on him

These two phrases mean the same thing, and emphasize how afraid Zechariah was.

# When Zechariah saw him

"when Zechariah saw the angel." The source of the fear was the frightening nature of the angel. Zechariah had not done anything wrong.

# fear fell on him

Fear is described as if it was something that attacked or overpowered Zechariah. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Do not be afraid

"Stop being afraid of me" or "You do not need to be afraid of me"

# your prayer has been heard

"God has heard what you asked." The following is implied and could be added: "and will grant it." God did not just hear what Zechariah prayed for; he was also going to do it. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# bear you a son

"have a son for you" or "give birth to your son"
