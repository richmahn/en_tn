# Now

This marks a shift in the story from what happened inside the temple to what happened outside. AT: "While that was happening" or "While the angel and Zechariah were talking"

# They realized that he had seen a vision while he was in the temple. He kept on making signs to them and remained silent

These things probably happened at the same time, and Zechariah's signs helped the people understand that he had had a vision. It might be helpful to your audience to change the order to show that. AT: "He kept on making signs to them and remained silent. So they realized that he had seen a vision while he was in the temple"

# a vision

The earlier description indicated that Gabriel actually came to Zechariah in the temple. The people, not knowing that, assumed Zechariah saw a vision.

# It came about

This phrase moves the story ahead to when Zechariah's service was ended.

# he went to his house

Zechariah did not live in Jerusalem, where the temple was located. He traveled to his home town.
