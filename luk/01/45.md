# Blessed is she who believed ... that were told her from the Lord

Elizabeth is talking about Mary to Mary. AT: "Blessed are you who believed ... that were told you from the Lord"(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# Blessed is she who believed

The passive verb can be translated in active form. AT: "God will bless her because she believed" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# there would be a fulfillment of the things

"the things would actually happen" or "the things would come true"

# the things that were told her from the Lord

The word "from" is used here instead of "by" because it was the angel Gabriel whom Mary actually heard speak (see [Luke 1:26] (../01/26.md)), but the message ("the things") came ultimately from the Lord. This can be stated in active form. AT: "the message that she heard from the Lord" or "the Lord's message that the angel told her" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
