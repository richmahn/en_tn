# Do not be afraid, Mary

The angel does not want Mary to be afraid of his appearance, because God sent him with a positive message.

# you have found favor with God

The idiom "to find favor" means to be positively received by someone. The sentence can be altered to show God as the actor. Alternate translation: "God has decided to give you his grace" or "God is showing you his kindness" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
