## translationNotes

* **before God** - "in God's presence." For clarity, some translators might want to add the implied information "in the temple at Jerusalem." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
* **their custom** - "their tradition" or "their usual way of making important decisions"
* **chose him by lot** - A lot was a marked stone that was thrown or rolled on the ground in order to help them decide something. The priests believed that God guided the lot to show them which priest he wanted them to choose. (See: [[:en:ta:customs:religious:bylot]])
* **the whole assembly of the people** - "a large number of people" or "many people"
* **outside** - This could be translated as â€œoutside the temple building" or "in the courtyard outside the temple." The courtyard was the enclosed area surrounding the temple.
