# Why has it happened to me that the mother of my Lord should come to me?

Elizabeth is not asking for information. She was showing how surprised and happy she was that the mother of the Lord had come to her. Alternate translation: "How wonderful it is that the mother of my Lord has come to me!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# the mother of my Lord

It can be made clear that Elizabeth was calling Mary "the mother of my Lord" by adding the word "you." Alternate translation: "you, the mother of my Lord" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
