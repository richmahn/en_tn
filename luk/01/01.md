# General Information:

Luke explains why he writes to Theophilus.

# of the things that have been fulfilled among us

"about those things that have happened among us" or "about those events that have happened among us"

# among us

No one knows for sure who Theophilus was. If he was a Christian, the word "us" here would include him and so be inclusive, and if not, it would be exclusive. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-inclusive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
