# General Information:

Luke explains why he writes to Theophilus.

# to set in order a narrative

"to write a narrative" or "to write an account"

# about those matters that have been fulfilled among us

"about those things that have happened among us" or "about those events that have happened among us"

# among us

No one knows for sure who Theophilus was. If he was a Christian, the word "us" here would include him and so be inclusive, and if not, it would be exclusive. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-inclusive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

# they handed them to us

Here "handed them" is a metaphor for telling about the events. AT: "they told them to us" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# handed them to us

The word "us" in this phrase does not include Theophilus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

# handed them

"gave them" or "delivered them"

# servants of the message

You may need to specify what the message is. AT: "have served God by telling people his message" or "have taught people the good news about Jesus" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# accurately investigated

"carefully researched." Luke was careful to find out exactly what happened. He probably talked to the different people who saw what happened to make sure that what he wrote down about these events was correct.

# most excellent Theophilus

Luke said this to show honor and respect for Theophilus. This may mean that Theophilus was an important government official. This section should use the style that your culture uses to address people of high status. Some people may prefer to also put this greeting at the beginning and say, "To ... Theophilus" or "Dear ... Theophilus."

# most excellent

"honorable" or "noble"

# Theophilus

This name means "friend of God." It may describe this man's character or it may have been his actual name. Most translations have it as a name. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
