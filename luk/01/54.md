The UST rearranges these verses into a verse bridge in order to keep the information about Israel together. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge]])

"The Lord has helped"

# Israel his servant

If readers confuse this with the man named Israel, it could be translated as "his servant, the nation of Israel" or "Israel, his servants."

"in order to"

# to remember

God cannot forget. When God "remembers," it is an idiom that means God acts upon his earlier promise. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
