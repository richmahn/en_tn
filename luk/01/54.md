# General Information:

The UDB rearranges these verses into a verse bridge in order to keep the information about Israel together. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge]])

# He has given help to

"The Lord has helped"

# Israel his servant

"in order to"

God cannot forget. When God "remembers," it is an idiom that means God acts upon his earlier promise. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# as he said to our fathers

"just as he promised our ancestors he would do." This phrase supplies background information about God's promise to Abraham. AT: "because he promised our ancestors he would be merciful" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])

# his descendants

"Abraham's descendants"
