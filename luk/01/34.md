# How will this happen

Though Mary did not understand how it could happen, she did not doubt that it would happen. AT: "How is this possible?"

# I have not slept with any man

Mary used this polite expression to say that she had not engaged in sexual activity. AT: "I am a virgin." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])

# The Holy Spirit will come upon you

The process of Mary's conception would begin with the Holy Spirit coming to her.

# will come upon

"will overtake" or "will happen to"

# the power of the Most High

It was God's "power" that would supernaturally cause Mary to become pregnant even while she still remained a virgin. Make sure this does not imply any physical or sexual unionâ€”this was a miracle.

# will come over you

"will cover you like a shadow"

# So the holy one to be born will be called the Son of God

This can be stated in active form. AT: "So they will call the holy one who will be born the Son of God" or "So the baby that will be born will be holy, and people will call him the Son of God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# the holy one

"the holy child" or "the holy baby"

# Son of God

This is an important title for Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
