# a virgin engaged to ... Joseph

Mary's parents had agreed that Mary would marry Joseph. Though they had not had sexual relations, Joseph would have thought and spoken of her as his wife.

# He belonged to the house of David

"He belonged to the same tribe as David" or "He was a descendant of King David"

# the virgin's name was Mary

This introduces Mary as a new character in the story. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
