# Luke 01 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations set each line of poetry further to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetry in 1:46-55, 68-79.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### "He will be called John" #####
It was unusual in the ancient Near East to use a name for a child that was not the name of a relative. Since Elizabeth and Zechariah did not have a person named "John" in their family, this name was very surprising to other people.

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter ####

Luke does not use a lot of complex wording. His language is simple and straightforward.
