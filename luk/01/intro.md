# Luke 01 General Notes

#### Structure and formatting

Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 1:46-55, 68-79.

#### Special concepts in this chapter

##### "He will be called John"

Most people in the ancient Near East would give a child the same name as someone in their families. People were surprised that Elizabeth and Zechariah named their son John because there was no one else in their family with that name.

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter

Luke's language is simple and straightforward. He does not use many figures of speech.
