# Luke 01 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations prefer to set apart long prayers or prophesies. For this reason, the ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 1:46-55, 68-79.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### "He will be called John" #####
It was unusual in the ancient Near East to use a name for a child that was not the name of a relative. Since Elizabeth and Zechariah did not have a person named "John" in their family, this name was very surprising to other people.

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter ####

Luke does not use a lot of complex wording. His language is simple and straightforward.
