# General Information:

Mary begins a song of praise to the Lord her Savior.

# My soul praises

Both "soul" and "spirit" refer to the spiritual part of a person. Mary is saying that her worship comes from deep inside her. Alternate translation: "My inner being praises" or "I praise" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
