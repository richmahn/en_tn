## My soul…my spirit ##

These could be translated as "Oh how I" or "how I" which express deep emotion. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]]) Mary is using a form of poetry where she states the same thing in two slightly different ways. Both "soul" and "spirit" refer to the spiritual part of a person. She is saying that her worship comes from deep inside her. If possible, translate these with two slightly different words or phrases that have that similar meaning. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
