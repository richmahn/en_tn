* **like the rising sun** - "like the sunrise" or "like the dawn." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
* **He will shine upon** - This is a metaphor that means "He will give knowledge to." This could be translated as "He will give spiritual light to." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **people who sit in darkness** - This is a metaphor that means "people who do not know the truth".
* **and (who sit in) the shadow of death** - This is a metaphor that means "who are about to die" or "and who are afraid that they will soon die."
* **guide** - This is a metaphor for "teach."
* **our feet** - This is a synecdoche and refers to the whole person, not just the feet. It could be translated as "us." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
* **into the path of peace** - This is a metaphor that means "into a peaceful life" or "into a life at peace with God." It could be translated as "to walk along a path that leads to peace" or "to live in a way that brings peace with God." Make sure your translation of this fits with how you translate "our feet."
