# For he will be great

"This is because. he will be great" Zechariah and the "many" will rejoice because John will be "great in the sight of the Lord." The rest of verse 15 tells how God wants John to live.

# he will be great in the sight of the Lord

"he will be a very important person for the Lord" or "God will consider him to be very important"

# he will be filled with the Holy Spirit

This can be stated in active form. AT: "the Holy Spirit will empower him" or "the Holy Spirit will guide him" Make sure it does not sound similar to what an evil spirit might do to a person. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# from his mother's womb

"even while he is in his mother's womb" or "even before he is born"
