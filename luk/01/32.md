# the Son of the Most High

Mary will bear "a son" who will be called "the Son of the Most High." Jesus is therefore a human son born of a human mother, and he is also the Son of God. These terms should be translated very carefully.

# will be called

Possible meanings are 1) "people will call him" or 2) "God will call him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
