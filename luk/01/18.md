# How can I know this?

"How can I know for sure that what you said will happen?" Here, "know" means to learn by experience, suggesting Zechariah was asking for a sign as proof. AT: "What can you do to prove to me that this will happen?"

# I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God

This is stated as a rebuke to Zechariah. The presence of Gabriel, coming directly from God, should be enough proof for Zechariah.

# who stands

"who serves"

# I was sent to speak to you

This can be stated in active form. AT: "God sent me to speak to you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# Behold

"Look" or "Listen." This word adds emphasis to what is said next. AT: "Pay attention to what I am about to tell you"

# silent, unable to speak

These mean the same thing, and are repeated to emphasize the completeness of his silence. AT: "completely unable to speak" or "not able to speak at all" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# not believe my words

"not believe what I said"

# at the right time

"at the appointed time"
