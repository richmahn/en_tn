# Behold

"Pay attention, because what I am about to say is both true and important"

# silent, unable to speak

These mean the same thing, and are repeated to emphasize the completeness of his silence. Alternate translation: "completely unable to speak" or "not able to speak at all" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# not believe my words

"not believe what I said"

# at the right time

"at the appointed time"
