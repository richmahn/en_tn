Zechariah continues to prophesy, but now he speaks directly to his newborn son.

## will be called the prophet ##

At: "will be the prophet" This means he actually will be the prophet, not just called a prophet, and people will know him as such.

## of the Most High ##

AT: "who serves the Most High" or AT: "who speaks for God Most High"

## how they can be saved through the forgiveness of their sins ##

AT: "how God will save them by forgiving their sins" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
