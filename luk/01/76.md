## translationNotes

* (Zechariah continues to prophecy, but now he speaks directly to his newborn son:)
* **will be called the prophet** - This means he actually will be the prophet and people will know him as such. To make that clear, this could be translated as "will be the prophet."
* **of the Most High** - This could be translated as "who serves the Most High" or "who speaks for God Most High."
* **how they can be saved through the forgiveness of their sins** - This can be translated as "how God will save them by forgiving their sins."
