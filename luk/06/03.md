## Have you not even read ##

This is the beginning of a rhetorical question. Jesus is mildly rebuking them for not learning from it. It could be translated as "Certainly you have read." (UDB) or "You should learn from what you have read" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## the ceremonial bread ##

"the holy bread" or "the bread that was offered to God"

## Son of Man ##

This could be translated as "I, the Son of Man." Jesus was referring to himself.

## Lord of the Sabbath ##

"owner of the Sabbath." It could be translated as "has the authority to determine what is right for people to do on the Sabbath!" (UDB)
