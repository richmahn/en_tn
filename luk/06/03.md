# Have you not even read ... him?

Jesus is rebuking the Pharisees for not learning from the scriptures. This can be written as a statement. Alternate translation: "You should learn from what you have read ... him!" or "Certainly you have read ... him!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
