# became a traitor

It may be necessary to explain what "traitor" means in this context. Alternate translation: "betrayed his friend" or "turned his friend over to enemies" (usually in return for money paid) or "exposed a friend to danger by telling enemies about him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
