# what credit is that to you?

"what reward will you receive?" or "what praise will you receive for doing that?" This can be written as a statement. Alternate translation: "you will not receive any reward for that." or "God will not reward you for that." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
