# To him who strikes you

"If anyone hits you"

# on the one cheek

"on one side of your face"

# offer him also the other

It may be helpful to state what the attacker will do to the person. AT: "turn your face so that he can strike the other cheek also" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# do not withhold

"do not prevent him from taking"
