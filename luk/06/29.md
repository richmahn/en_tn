Jesus continues to teach the crowd to love their enemies.

## To him who strikes you ##

"If anyone hits you"

## on the one cheek ##

"on one side of your face"

## offer him also the other ##

This can be translated as "turn your face so that he can hit the other side, too."

## do not withhold ##

"do not prevent him from taking"

## Give to everyone who asks you ##

This can be translated as "If anyone asks you for something, give it to him."

## do not ask him ##

"do not require him" or "do not demand"
