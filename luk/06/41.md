# Why do you look ... brother's eye, but you do not notice the log that is in your own eye?

Jesus uses this question to challenge the people to pay attention to their own sins before they pay attention to another person's sins. Alternate translation: "Do not look ... brothers eye while you ignore the log that is in your own eye." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# the tiny piece of straw that is in your brother's eye

This is a metaphor that refers to the less important faults of a fellow believer. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# tiny piece of straw

"speck" or "splinter" or "bit of dust." Use a word for the smallest thing that commonly falls into a person's eyes.

# brother

Here "brother" refers to a fellow Jew or a fellow believer in Jesus.

# the log that is in your own eye

This is a metaphor for a person's most important faults. A log could not literally go into a person's eye. Jesus exaggerates to emphasize that a person should pay attention to his own more important faults before he deals with another person's less important faults. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# log

"beam" or "plank"
