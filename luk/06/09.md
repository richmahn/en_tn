# to them

"to the Pharisees"

# I ask you, is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do harm, to save a life or to destroy it?

Jesus asks this question to force the Pharisees to admit that he was right to heal on the Sabbath. The intent of the question is thus rhetorical: to get them to admit what they all know is true rather than to obtain information. However, Jesus says, "I ask you," so this question is not like other rhetorical questions that might need to be translated as statements. This should be translated as a question. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# to do good or to do harm

"to help someone or to harm someone"
