# is it lawful ... save a life ... destroy it?

Jesus wanted to correct the Pharisees' understanding that it was wrong to heal on the Sabbath. He asked the question as a contrast between doing good and doing evil in order to make it obvious which one is lawful and which one is wrong. AT: "which action does God's law permitâ€”to do good and heal, or to do harm and destroy a life?" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
