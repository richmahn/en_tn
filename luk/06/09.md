## Is it lawful ##

This is the beginning of a rhetorical question. Jesus wanted the Pharisees to think about it and acknowledge that it is lawful to heal on the Sabbath. This could be translated as "Which is lawful? To do good" or "Which does the law of Moses permit us to do?" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## to do good or to do harm ##

"to help someone or to harm someone"

## stretch out your hand ##

"hold out your hand" or "extend your hand"

## restored ##

"healed"
