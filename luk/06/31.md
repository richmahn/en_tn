(Jesus continues to teach the crowd to love their enemies.)

## as you want people to do to you, you should do the same to them ##

In some languages it may be more natural to reverse the order. "You should do to people the same as what you want them to do to you" or "Treat people they way you want them to treat you."

## what credit is that to you? ##

This is a rhetorical question. It could be translated with a statement "You will not receive any credit for that.  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])  This could be translated as "What praise will you receive for doing that? or "Will anyone think that you have done something special?" Another possible meaning is "What reward will you receive?"
