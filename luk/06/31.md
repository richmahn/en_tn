# As you want people to do to you, you should do the same to them

In some languages it may be more natural to reverse the order. AT: "You should do to people the same as what you want them to do to you" or "Treat people they way you want them to treat you"

# what credit is that to you?

"What reward will you receive?" or "What praise will you receive for doing that?" This can be written as a statement. AT: "You will not receive any reward for that." or "God will not reward you for that." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# to get back the same amount

The law of Moses commanded the Jews not to receive interest on money they loaned to each other. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
