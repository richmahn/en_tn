## translationNotes

* (Jesus continues to teach the crowd not to judge people.)
* **For** - "because." This links the fact that our character will be exposed as the reason why we should not judge our brother.
* **good tree** - "healthy tree"
* **rotten** - "decaying." It could be translated as "bad".
* **each tree is known** - "recognized." This could be translated with an active verb, as in "people know a tree" or "people recognize a tree."
* **fig** - the sweet-tasting fruit of the fig tree. The fig tree does not have thorns on it.
* **thornbush** - a plant or shrub that has thorns
* **grape** - the sweet-tasting fruit of the grape vine. The grape vine does not have thorns on it.
* **briar bush** - a vine or shrub that has thorns
* These verses are a metaphor about how people's actions show what they are really like. If necessary, it could be explained as it is in the last sentence of the UDB with "In the same way â€¦." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]], [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
