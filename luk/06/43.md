People can tell if a tree is good or bad, and what type of tree it is, by the fruit it produces. Jesus uses this as an unexplained metaphorâ€”we know what kind of person someone is when we see his actions. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# For there is

"This is because there is." This indicates that what follows is the reason why we should not judge our brother.
