(Jesus continues to teach the crowd not to judge people.)
These verses are a metaphor that compares the thoughts of a person to treasures that people store in a safe place. It could be translated without the figure of speech as in the UDB. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## The good man ##

"The good person." The word "good" here refers to righteousness or moral goodness. The word "man" here refers to a person, male or female. It could be translated as "A good person" or "Good people" (UDB).

## the good treasure of his heart ##

"the good things he keeps in his heart" or "what he values"

## brings out ##

This could be translated without the metaphor as "lives his life" or "demonstrates" or "shows" (UDB).

## that which is good ##

"good things"

## from the abundance of his heart his mouth speaks ##

"what he thinks in his heart affects what he says with his mouth" or "what he values in his heart determines what he says with his mouth." It could be translated without reference to the mouth and heart, as in "what a person says shows what he constantly thinks about" or "what he thinks about affects what he says."
