This phrase is used here to mark the beginning of a new part of the story. If your language has a way for doing this, you can consider using it here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])

# grainfields

In this case, these are large sections of land where the people had scattered wheat seed to grow more wheat.

# heads of grain

This is the topmost part of the grain plant, which is a kind of large grass. It holds the mature, edible seeds of the plant.

# rubbing them between their hands

They did this to separate the grain seeds. This can be stated clearly. AT: "They rubbed them in their hands to separate the grains from the husks" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
