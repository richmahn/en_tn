(Jesus continues to teach his disciples.)

## woe to you ##

“how terrible it is for you ” or “trouble will come to you” or “how sad you should be” or “what sorrow you will have”

## when all men ##

That is "when all people," or "when everyone."

## treated the false prophets in the same way ##

"spoke well of the false prophets"
