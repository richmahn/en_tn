Jesus continues to teach his disciples.

## Woe to you ##

“How terrible it is for you ” or “Trouble will come to you” or “How sad you should be” or “What sorrow you will have”

## when all men ##

That is "when all people," or "when everyone."

## treated the false prophets in the same way ##

"spoke well of the false prophets"
