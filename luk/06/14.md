## translationNotes

* This is a list of the twelve men Jesus chose to be his apostles.
* **These were their names** - This phrase introducing the names was added to the ULB to clarify what the list is.  Some translators may prefer not to write it.
* **his brother Andrew** - "Simon's brother Andrew"
* **Zealot** - Possible meanings are 1) "the Zealot" or 2) "the zealous one." The first meaning indicates he was part of the group of people who wanted to free the Jewish people from Roman rule. This could be translated as "patriot" or "nationalist." The second meaning indicates that he was zealous for God to be honored. It could be translated as "passionate."
* **became a traitor** - This could be translated as "betrayed his friend" or "turned his friend over to enemies" or "exposed a friend to danger by telling enemies about him."
