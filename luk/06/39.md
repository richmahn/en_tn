# Connecting Statement:

Jesus includes some examples to make his point. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])

# Can a blind person guide another blind person?

Jesus used this question to get the people to think about something that they already know. This can be written as a statement. AT: "We all know that a blind person cannot guide another blind person." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# blind person

The person who is "blind" is a metaphor for a person who has not been taught as a disciple. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# If he did

Some languages might prefer, "if one did." This is an absurd situation that is not likely to actually happen. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])

# they would both fall into a pit, would they not?

This can be written as a statement. AT: "both of them would fall into a hole." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
