# it will be given to you

Jesus does not say exactly who will give. Possible meanings are 1) "someone will give it to you" or 2) "God will give it to you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# A generous amount—pressed down, shaken together and spilling over—will pour into your lap

Jesus speaks either of God or of people giving generously as if he were speaking of a generous grain merchant. AT: "God will pour into your lap a generous amount—pressed down, shaken together and spilling over" or "Like a generous grain merchant who presses down the grain and shakes it together and pours in so much grain that it spills over, they will give generously to you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# A generous amount

"A large amount"

# it will be measured back to you

Jesus does not say exactly who will measure. Possible meanings are 1) "they will measure things back to you" or 2) "God will measure things back to you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
