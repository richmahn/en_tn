# Connecting Statement:

Jesus continues to speak to his disciples and the crowd who is listening to him as well.

# to you who are listening

Jesus now begins to speak to the entire crowd, rather than just to his disciples. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])

# love ... do good

Each of these commands is to be followed continually, not just a single time.

# love your enemies

This does not mean they were to only love their enemies and not their friends. This can be stated. Alternate translation: "Love your enemies, not only your friends" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
