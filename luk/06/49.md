# General Information:

Jesus compares the person who hears but does not obey his teaching to a man who builds a house that has no foundation and so will collapse when the flood comes. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# But the person

"But" shows a strong contrast to the previous person who built with a foundation.

# on top of the ground without a foundation

Some cultures may not know that a house with a foundation is stronger. Additional information may be helpful. AT: "but he did not dig down and build first a foundation" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# foundation
