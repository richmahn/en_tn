Closing (13:11–13)\n\n### Who wrote the Book of 2 Corinthians?\n\nPaul was the author. He was from the city of Tarsus. He had been known as Saul in his early life. Before becoming a Christian, Paul was a Pharisee. He persecuted Christians. After he became a Christian, he traveled several times throughout the Roman Empire telling people about Jesus.\n\nPaul started the church in Corinth. He was staying in the city of Ephesus when he wrote this letter.\n\n### What is the Book of 2 Corinthians about?\n\nIn 2 Corinthians, Paul continued to write about the conflicts among the Christians in the city of Corinth. It is clear in this letter that the Corinthians had obeyed his previous instructions to them. In 2 Corinthians, Paul encouraged them to live in a way that would please God.\n\nPaul also wrote to assure them that Jesus Christ sent him as an apostle to preach the Gospel. Paul wanted them to understand this, because a group of Jewish Christians opposed what he was doing. They claimed Paul was not sent by God and he was teaching a false message. This group of Jewish Christians wanted Gentile Christians to obey the law of Moses.\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nTranslators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “Second Corinthians.” Or they may choose a clearer title, such as “Paul’s Second Letter to the Church in Corinth.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### What was the city of Corinth like?\n\nCorinth was a major city located in ancient Greece. Because it was near the Mediterranean Sea, many travelers and traders came to buy and sell goods there. This resulted in the city having people from many different cultures. The city was famous for having people who lived in immoral ways. The people worshipped Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love. As part of the ceremonies honoring Aphrodite, her worshipers had sexual intercourse with temple prostitutes.\n\n### What did Paul mean by “false apostles” (11:13)?\n\nThese were Jewish Christians. They taught that Gentile Christians had to obey the law of Moses in order to follow Christ. Christian leaders had met in Jerusalem and decided on the matter (See: Acts 15). However, it is clear that there were still some groups that disagreed with what the leaders in Jerusalem decided.\n\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\n\n### Singular and plural “you”\n\nIn this book, the word “I” refers to Paul. Also, the word “you” is almost always plural and refers to the believers in Corinth. There are two exceptions to this: 6:2 and 12:9. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])\n\n### How are the ideas of “holy” and “sanctify” represented in 2 Corinthians in the ULT?\n\nThe scriptures use such words to indicate any one of various ideas. For this reason, it is often difficult for translators to represent them well in their versions. In translating into English, the ULT uses the following principles:\n* Sometimes the meaning in a passage implies moral holiness. Especially important for understanding the gospel is the fact that God considers Christians to be sinless because they are united to Jesus Christ. Another related fact is that God is perfect and faultless. A third fact is that Christians are to conduct themselves in a blameless, faultless manner in life. In these cases, the ULT uses “holy,” “holy God,” “holy ones,” or “holy people.”\n* The meaning in most passages in 2 Corinthians is a simple reference to Christians without implying any particular role filled by them. In these cases, the ULT uses “believer” or “believers.” (See: 1:1; 8:4; 9:1, 12; 13:13)\n* Sometimes the meaning in the passage implies the idea of someone or something set apart for God alone. In these cases, the ULT uses “set apart,” “dedicated to,” “reserved for,” or “sanctified.”\n\nThe UST will often be helpful as translators think about how to represent these ideas in their own versions.\n\n### What did Paul mean by expressions like “in Christ” and “in the Lord”?\n\nThis kind of expression occurs in 1:19, 20; 2:12, 17; 3:14; 5:17, 19, 21; 10:17; 12:2, 19; and 13:4. Paul meant to express the idea of a very close union with Christ and the believers. At the same time, he often intended other meanings as well. See, for example, “A door was opened for me in the Lord,” (2:12) where Paul specifically meant that a door was opened for Paul by the Lord.\n\nPlease see the introduction to the Book of Romans for more details about this kind of expression.\n\n### What does it mean to be a “new creation” in Christ (5:17)?\n\nPaul’s message was that God makes Christians part of a “new world” when a person believes in Christ. God gives a new world of holiness, peace, and joy. In this new world, believers have a new nature that has been given them by the Holy Spirit. Translators should try to express this idea.\n\n### What are the major issues in the text of the Book of 2 Corinthians?\n* “and in your love for us” (8:7). Many versions, including the ULT and UST, read this way. However, many other versions read, “and in our love for you.” There is strong evidence that each reading is original. Translators should probably follow the reading preferred by other versions in their region.\n\n(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
2CO	1	intro	tsh3			0		# 2 Corinthians 1 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>The first paragraph reflects a common way to begin a letter in the ancient Near East.<br><br>## Special Concepts<br><br>### Paul’s integrity<br><br>People were criticizing Paul and saying he was not sincere. He refutes them by explaining his motives for what he was doing.<br><br>### Comfort<br><br>Comfort is a major theme of this chapter. The Holy Spirit comforts Christians. The Corinthians probably were afflicted and needed to be comforted.<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Rhetorical question<br><br>Paul uses two rhetorical questions to defend himself against a charge of not being sincere. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### We<br><br>Paul uses the pronoun “we”. This likely represents at least Timothy and himself. It may also include other people.<br><br>### Guarantee<br><br>Paul says the Holy Spirit is the guarantee, which means pledge or down-payment, of a Christian’s eternal life. Christians are securely saved. But they will not experience all of God’s given promises until after they die. The Holy Spirit is a personal guarantee that this will happen. This idea comes from a business term. A person gives some valuable item to another person as a “guarantee” that they will repay money.

2CO	2	intro	hy3h			0		# 2 Corinthians 2 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n3. Interrupted travel plans (1:15–2:13)\n      * The interruption and the reason for it (1:15–2:4)\n      * The person who caused grief (2:5–11)\n      * Travel to Troas and Macedonia (2:12–13)\n4. Paul’s ministry (2:14–7:4)\n      * The fragrance of Christ (2:14–17)\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### The previous letter\n\nIn [2:3–4](../02/03.md), [9](../02/09.md), Paul refers to a letter that he had already written and sent to the Corinthians. While a few scholars think this letter is 1 Corinthians, most likely we do not have this previous letter. Paul acknowledges that this previous letter might have “grieved” them, but he wants them to know that he wrote the letter because of his love for them. In your translation, make sure that these verses refer to a letter that Paul previously wrote, not to 2 Corinthians. \n\n### “Grieving” others\n\nPaul refers to “sorrow,” “grief,” and “grieving” others multiple times in [2:1–8](../02/01.md). These words refer to how people who are close friends can “grieve” or hurt each other by what they say and do. These words do not refer to physically hurting someone. Rather, they refer to hurting someone inside. Paul acknowledges that his letter might have “grieved” them, and he also indicates that one of the Corinthians has “grieved” fellow believers. Consider a natural way to refer to one person hurting or injuring another person inside. \n\n### The person who caused grief\n\nIn [2:5–11](../02/05.md), Paul refers to a person who has caused grief. Almost certainly, he has one specific person in mind. Paul is not clear about what this person did to cause the grief. He or she may have committed a sexual sin or stolen money from the church or opposed Paul’s authority. Whatever the person did, Paul chooses not to be specific about the person or what he or she did. Perhaps this is because he wants the Corinthians to forgive and show love to this person now that he or she has properly been disciplined by the church. In your translation, use general words for both the person and what the person did. \n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Aroma and fragrance\n\nIn [2:14–16](../02/14.md), Paul identifies himself and those who serve with him as an “aroma” or “fragrance.” Paul could be thinking in general of smells and odors, or he could be referring to the smell from incense and sacrifices offered during a “triumphal procession” (see [2:14](../02/14.md)), or he could be referring to the smell from sacrifices offered at the temple. Whatever exact smells Paul has in mind, he is clear that he and those with him are a smell that comes from Christ, and people react to it very differently: some think it is the smell of death, while others think it is the smell of life. Paul speaks in this way because smells spread throughout a whole area, and people have to react to them. Just like that, he and those with him spread the gospel throughout the world, and people have to respond to it. Further, just as some people like a smell and others hate it, so some people believe the gospel and receive life from God, while others reject the gospel and perish. If possible, preserve the “aroma” and “fragrance” language. If necessary, you could use a simile to express the idea. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Paul’s use of pronouns\n\nIn [2:1–13](../02/01.md), Paul consistently uses the first person singular to refer to himself and the second person plural to refer to the Corinthians. The only exception is in [2:11](../02/11.md), where Paul uses “we” to refer to himself and the Corinthians. However, in [2:14–17](../02/14.md), Paul uses “we” to refer to himself and those preaching the gospel with him. In these verses, “we” does not include the Corinthians. It is unclear exactly whom Paul includes in “we”: it could be just he and Titus, or he and the group that works with him, or he and everyone else who preaches the gospel. Consider natural ways to represent these changes in reference throughout the chapter. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])\n\n### Paul’s travel\n\nIn [2:12–13](../02/12.md), Paul describes some of his travels. Troas is a city on the west coast of what is now Turkey. Since Troas was a port city, most likely Paul sailed from there to Macedonia, which is the northern part of what is now Greece. Since Corinth is in southern Greece, Paul was not too far away from the Corinthians. Paul continues the description of what happened in Macedonia in [7:5–7](../07/05.md). Consider what information your readers need to know to understand Paul’s travels, and include what is necessary in your translation or in a footnote. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/troas]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/names/macedonia]])

2CO	2	1	ma6n	figs-explicit	πάλιν	1		Here, the word **again** implies that Paul has already visited the Corinthians **in sorrow**. He does not give many details about this visit. It cannot be the first time that he visited the Corinthians, so he must have visited them again **in sorrow** sometimes between when he first met them and when he wrote this letter. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the implication more explicit. Alternate translation: “a second time” or “yet again” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

2CO	2	2	q4aq	grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical	εἰ…ἐγὼ λυπῶ ὑμᾶς	1		Here Paul refers to a situation that has not happened and which he intends to keep from happening. He refers to the situation using the conditional form to indicate what would result from the situation if it did happen.

Paul does not ask this question because he is looking for information. Rather, he asks it to involve the Corinthians in what he is arguing. The question implies that the answer is “there is no one else.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea by using a strong negation. Alternate translation: “then there is no one cheering me up, except the one being grieved by me.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
2CO	2	2	mbbo	figs-genericnoun	τίς ὁ εὐφραίνων με, εἰ μὴ ὁ λυπούμενος	1		Here the author uses the singular form **the one** to refer in general to people, particularly to the Corinthians.

Most likely, he wrote this letter sometime between 1 Corinthians and 2 Corinthians, but we do not have the letter. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make it clearer that Paul is referring to a letter that he already sent to the Corinthians. Alternate translation: “I wrote in my last letter” or “I sent you the previous letter that said” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2CO	2	3	e7c4	writing-pronouns	 τοῦτο αὐτὸ	1		Here, the phrase **this same {thing}** refers to what Paul wrote in the previous letter.

2CO	2	4	y0t3	figs-infostructure	οὐχ ἵνα λυπηθῆτε, ἀλλὰ τὴν ἀγάπην ἵνα γνῶτε, ἣν ἔχω περισσοτέρως εἰς ὑμᾶς	1		If your language would not naturally put the negative statement before the positive statement, you could reverse the two clauses here. Alternate translation: “so that you might know the love that I have more abundantly for you, not so that you would be grieved” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
2CO	2	4	uc77	figs-activepassive	λυπηθῆτε	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

2CO	2	5	xomm	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	δέ	1		Here, the word **But** introduces a contrast with how Paul did not want to “grieve” them. Here he addresses how someone has **caused grief**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a contrast.

2CO	2	5	xlxc	grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἰ…τις λελύπηκεν, οὐκ…λελύπηκεν	1		Here Paul is speaking as if someone causing **grief** were a hypothetical possibility, but he means that it is actually true. If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, and if your readers might misunderstand and think that what Paul is saying is not certain, then you could express the idea by indicating that someone has indeed **caused grief**. Alternate translation: “the person who caused grief has not grieved only” or “if anyone has caused grief, and it has happened, he has not grieved only” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
2CO	2	5	ln83	figs-abstractnouns	λελύπηκεν	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **grief**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “grieve.” Alternate translation: “has grieved people” or “has caused others to grieve” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2CO	2	5	j6bn	figs-gendernotations	οὐκ…λελύπηκεν	1		Here, Paul may be referring specifically to a man, especially if the way that he has **grieved** others is by sinning sexually. However, it is not certain that Paul is referring to a man here. Consider using a form that does not specify the gender of this person. Alternate translation: “that individual has not grieved only” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
2CO	2	5	d7fx	figs-explicit	οὐκ ἐμὲ λελύπηκεν	1		Here Paul could be indicating that the person has: (1) **grieved** Paul some, but mostly the person has **grieved** the Corinthians. Alternate translation: “he has not grieved me much” (2) not **grieved** Paul at all but only the Corinthians.

2CO	2	5	rvpt	figs-idiom	ἀπὸ μέρους	1		Here, the phrase **in part** indicates that only some of an action or group is involved. In this case, Paul could be using **in part** to refer to: (1) how many of the Corinthians have been **grieved**.

Alternate translation: “he has partially grieved you” or “you also in part” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
2CO	2	5	iva7	figs-infostructure	ἀπὸ μέρους, ἵνα μὴ ἐπιβαρῶ πάντας ὑμᾶς	1		There are several ways to understood how the pieces of the sentence go together. You could translate the sentence so that: (1) **in order that I might not burden all of you** indicates the reason why Paul uses the phrase **in part**, which would refer to the Corinthians. Alternate translation: “you in part, which I say so that I might not burden all of you” (2) **in part** and **all of you** go together, and **in order that I might not burden** is a parenthetical statement explaining why Paul says **in part**. Alternate translation: “in part—which I say so that I might not burden—all of you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
2CO	2	5	or46	figs-metaphor	μὴ ἐπιβαρῶ	1		Here, to **burden** someone refers to placing a heavy object on someone’s back. Paul could be using the phrase **I might not burden** to refer to: (1) how he is trying to avoid saying too much about the situation. In other words, Paul uses the phrase **in part** because he does not want to make his words too strong, which would make the words like a person carrying a heaven load. Alternate translation: “I might not say too much about” or “I might not exaggerate about” (2) how he wants to avoid troubling or distressing all of them, which would be like “burdening” them with a heavy object. Alternate translation: “I might not distress” or “I might not trouble” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2CO	2	6	wr3k	figs-abstractnouns	τῷ τοιούτῳ ἡ ἐπιτιμία αὕτη	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **punishment**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “punish.” Alternate translation: “How such a person has been punished” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2CO	2	6	iy4r	figs-extrainfo	ἡ ἐπιτιμία αὕτη	1	This punishment of that person by the majority is enough	Here, the word **This** indicates that both Paul and the Corinthians knew what the **punishment** was. However, Paul never states exactly what the punishment was. You should use a word or phrase that is as general as what Paul used. Alternate translation: “That punishment” or “The punishment” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])
2CO	2	6	g3eo	writing-pronouns	τῷ τοιούτῳ	1		Here Paul speaks in general terms about **such a {person}**. However, he is referring more specifically to the person that he mentioned in the previous verse, the one who “grieved” the Corinthians (see [2:5](../02/05.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this reference more explicit. Alternate translation: “on the person we are talking about” or “on that individual” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
2CO	2	6	z2dt	translate-unknown	τῶν πλειόνων	1		Here, the word **majority** refers to more than half of a group. Often it means most of the group. If it would be helpful in your language, you could clarify that Paul is referring to “most” of the Corinthians. Alternate translation: “almost all of you” or “the majority of your group” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
2CO	2	6	d7b7	figs-extrainfo	τῶν πλειόνων	1		Here the phrase **the majority** implies a “minority.” These are some of the Corinthians who either did not agree with the **punishment** or who thought that the person had done nothing wrong. Paul does not give any information about this “minority,” however, so you should use a word or phrase that refers to most of the people in a group. Alternate translation: “all but a few of you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])
2CO	2	6	a7c4	figs-explicit	ἱκανὸν	1	is enough	Here, the word **sufficient** could indicate that the **punishment**: (1) has been severe enough. Alternate translation: “is severe enough” or “is sufficiently strong” (2) has lasted long enough. Alternate translation: “has lasted long enough” or “can end now” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2CO	2	7	we1i	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	τοὐναντίον μᾶλλον ὑμᾶς χαρίσασθαι	1		Here, the words **on the contrary** and **rather** indicate that Paul wishes the Corinthians to do now the opposite of what they were doing. Instead of “punishing” the person, Paul wants them now to **forgive and comfort** the person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use words that naturally indicate such a change in behavior. Alternate translation: “in contrast, you should instead forgive” or “instead of doing that, you should change your behavior and forgive” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
2CO	2	7	w4n6	figs-gendernotations	παρακαλέσαι…τῇ	1		Here, just as in [2:5](../02/05.md), Paul may be referring specifically to a man, especially if the way that he has “grieved” others is by sinning sexually. However, it is not certain that Paul is referring to a man here. Consider using a form that does not specify the gender of this person. Alternate translation: “comfort the individual … any” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
2CO	2	7	vpx1	figs-activepassive	μή πως τῇ περισσοτέρᾳ λύπῃ, καταποθῇ ὁ τοιοῦτος	1	he is not overwhelmed by too much sorrow	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “so that excessive sorrow might not overwhelm such a person” or “so that such a person might not experience overwhelming and excessive sorrow” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2CO	2	7	i3dm	figs-metaphor	μή  πως τῇ περισσοτέρᾳ λύπῃ καταποθῇ ὁ τοιοῦτος	1		Here Paul speaks as if a person could be **overwhelmed** or swallowed up by **sorrow**. He speaks in this way to indicate that a person can experience so much **sorrow** that it controls and destroys them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable figure of speech or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “so that such a person might not be overcome by excessive sorrow” or “so that such a person might not despair because of his excessive sorrow” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2CO	2	7	me4y	writing-pronouns	ὁ τοιοῦτος	1		Here Paul speaks in general terms about **such a {person}**. However, he is referring more specifically to the person that he has already mentioned, the one who “grieved” the Corinthians (see [2:5](../02/05.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this reference more explicit. See how the translated this phrase in [2:6](../02/06.md). Alternate translation: “the person we are talking about” or “that individual” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
2CO	2	7	cgil	figs-abstractnouns	τῇ περισσοτέρᾳ λύπῃ	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **sorrow**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “sorrowful” or “sad.” Alternate translation: “as he is excessively sorrowful” or “because he is excessively sad” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2CO	2	8	r916	grammar-connect-logic-result	διὸ	1	Connecting Statement:	Here, the word **So** introduces an exhortation that is based on what Paul said in the previous verse about “forgiving” and “comforting” the person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces an exhortation or inference. Alternate translation: “Because of that,” or “So then” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
2CO	2	8	ii0x	figs-infostructure	κυρῶσαι εἰς αὐτὸν ἀγάπην	1		Here, the phrase **for him** could go with: (1) **love**. Alternate translation: “to reaffirm the love that you have for him” (2) **reaffirm**. Alternate translation: “to reaffirm to him your love” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
2CO	2	8	yi2z	figs-abstractnouns	εἰς…ἀγάπην	1	publicly affirm your love for him	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **love**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “love.” Alternate translation: “that you love” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2CO	2	8	vlmy	figs-gendernotations	αὐτὸν	1		Here, just as in [2:5](../02/05.md), [7](../02/07.md), Paul may be referring specifically to a man, especially if the way that he has “grieved” others is by sinning sexually. However, it is not certain that Paul is referring to a man here. Consider using a form that does not specify the gender of this person. Alternate translation: “that individual” or “the person” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])\n
2CO	2	9	oadd	grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1		Here, the word **Indeed** introduces more information about the letter that Paul wrote to them (see [2:3–4](../02/03.md)). It does not identify a close link with the previous verse. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different word or phrase that introduces further explanation, or you could leave **Indeed** untranslated. Alternate translation: “In fact” or “As a matter of fact” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
2CO	2	9	lc78	figs-explicit	καὶ ἔγραψα	1		Here, the phrase **I also wrote** again refers to the letter that Paul sent to them before he wrote 2 Corinthians. See how you translated “I wrote” in [2:3–4](../02/03.md). Alternate translation: “I also wrote that letter” or “I also sent that previous letter” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2CO	2	9	pp4j	figs-doublet	εἰς τοῦτο…ἵνα	1		Here, the phrases **for this reason** and **so that** both introduce the purpose for which Paul **wrote** the previous letter. Paul uses this repetition to emphasize his purpose. If the repetition would be confusing in your language, and if it would not emphasize the purpose, you could combine the two phrases and provide emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “so that” or “in order that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
2CO	2	9	eebj	translate-unknown	τὴν δοκιμὴν ὑμῶν	1		Here, the word **proof** refers primarily to the results of a test or trial. In this case, Paul is saying that he wants to **know** how they passed the test, which were the commands he included in the previous letter. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to the results of a test. Alternate translation: “how you responded to my commands” or “your character” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
2CO	2	9	uzsx	figs-possession	τὴν δοκιμὴν ὑμῶν	1		Here Paul uses the possessive form to describe a **proof** that the Corinthians give or provide. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in a more natural way. Alternate translation: “the prove you provide” or “the proof from you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
2CO	2	9	gs2t	figs-abstractnouns	τὴν δοκιμὴν ὑμῶν	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **proof**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “prove.” Alternate translation: “what you would prove to me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2CO	2	9	xw5t	figs-explicit	ὑπήκοοί	1	you are obedient in everything	Here, Paul does not state to whom they are **obedient**. He could be implying that they are **obedient** to: (1) him as an apostle. Alternate translation: “obedient to me” (2) God and God’s commands. Alternate translation: “obedient to God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2CO	2	10	r7ib	grammar-connect-words-phrases	δέ	1		Here, the word **Now** introduces a development in Paul’s argument. In this case, Paul is concluding his discussion about the previous letter. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a development or a conclusion, or you could leave **Now** untranslated. Alternate translation: “Finally,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
2CO	2	10	o14x	figs-explicit	ᾧ…τι χαρίζεσθε, κἀγώ	1		Here Paul could be making: (1) a specific statement about forgiving the person who “grieved” the Corinthians. Alternate translation: “to that person to whom you forgive anything, I also forgive” (2) a general concluding statement about forgiveness. Alternate translation: “to any person to whom you forgive anything, I also forgive” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2CO	2	10	uzvm	figs-ellipsis	κἀγώ	1		This clause leaves out some words that many languages might need to be complete. If it would be helpful in your language, you could supply these words from the first half of the sentence. Alternate translation: “I also forgive it” or “I also forgive them for it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
2CO	2	10	tzn1	grammar-connect-words-phrases	καὶ γὰρ	1		Here, the phrase **for indeed** indicates that Paul is adding more information (**indeed**) that supports what he said in the previous clause (**for**). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use words that introduce added information that supports a previous statement. Alternate translation: “further,” or “and in fact,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
2CO	2	10	d9ah	figs-infostructure	καὶ γὰρ ἐγὼ ὃ κεχάρισμαι, εἴ τι κεχάρισμαι, δι’ ὑμᾶς	1		Here Paul includes the comment **if I have forgiven anything** in the middle of his sentence. Consider what may be a natural place to include extra information like this. Alternate translation: “for indeed, if I have forgiven anything, what I have forgiven is for your sake” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
2CO	2	10	avqv	figs-explicit	εἴ τι κεχάρισμαι	1		This clarification fits with what Paul said in [2:5](../02/05.md) about how the person did not “grieve” him but rather the Corinthians. Much like there, Paul could be saying that: (1) he does not have very much to forgive, since the person only hurt him a little. Alternate translation: “what little I had to forgive” (2) he really has nothing to forgive, since the person hurt the Corinthians, not him. Alternate translation: “although there was nothing to forgive” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2CO	2	10	cbm6		δι’ ὑμᾶς	1	forgiven for your sake	Here, the phrase **for your sake** could mean that: (1) Paul forgives the person to benefit or help the Corinthians. Alternate translation: “is for your benefit” (2) Paul forgives the person because the Corinthians forgave him. Alternate translation: “is because of you” or “is because you forgave”
2CO	2	10	b6uy	figs-explicit	ἐν προσώπῳ Χριστοῦ	1		Here, the phrase **in {the} presence of Christ** could indicate that: (1) Paul forgives because he knows that **Christ** sees or knows what he does. So, he acts in a way that pleases **Christ**. Alternate translation: “as Christ desires” or “with Christ watching” (2) Paul forgives with **Christ** as witness. Alternate translation: “with Christ as witness” or “with Christ guaranteeing it” (3) Paul forgives as someone who represents **Christ**. Alternate translation: “as one who represents Christ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2CO	2	10	nq4n	figs-abstractnouns	ἐν προσώπῳ Χριστοῦ	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **presence**, you could express the idea by using a phrase that refers to being close to or in front of **Christ**. Alternate translation: “in front of Christ” or “before Christ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2CO	2	11	xaoc	grammar-connect-words-phrases	ἵνα	1		Here, the phrase **so that** introduces the purpose for which Paul and Corinthians should “forgive” others (see [2:10](../02/10.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a purpose. Alternate translation: “in order that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
2CO	2	11	xoaw	figs-activepassive	μὴ πλεονεκτηθῶμεν ὑπὸ τοῦ Σατανᾶ	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “Satan would not take advantage of us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2CO	2	11	x3p2	translate-unknown	μὴ πλεονεκτηθῶμεν	1		Here, the phrase **taken advantage of** refers to when someone gains power or control over someone else, usually by using some area in which that person is weak. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to how someone gains power or control over someone else. Alternate translation: “we would not be exploited” or “we would not be dominated” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
2CO	2	11	z6no	grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1		Here, the word **For** introduces a further explanation of what Paul said in the first half of verse about **Satan**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different word or phrase that introduces further explanation. Alternate translation: “because” or “inasmuch as” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
2CO	2	11	m46t	figs-litotes	οὐ…αὐτοῦ τὰ νοήματα ἀγνοοῦμεν	1	For we are not ignorant of his plans	Here the author uses a figure of speech that expresses a strong positive meaning by using a negative word together with a word that is the opposite of the intended meaning. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning positively. Alternate translation: “we are fully aware of his schemes” or “we are very knowledgeable about his schemes” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
2CO	2	12	nh7u	grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1		Here, the word **Now** introduces a new section. Paul has finished speaking about the person that he and the Corinthians should forgive. He now returns to the topic of his travel plans and why he has not visited the Corinthians (see [1:8–23](../01/08.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a new topic or section, or you could leave **Now** untranslated. Alternate translation: “Moving on,” or “I wish to speak again about my journeys:” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
2CO	2	12	l6vd	figs-go	ἐλθὼν…εἰς	1	Connecting Statement:	Here, the phrase **having come to** refers to arriving in one place or city from another, in this case probably traveling on land. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to this kind of movement. Alternate translation: “having traveled to” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])
2CO	2	12	c14o	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	εἰς τὸ εὐαγγέλιον τοῦ Χριστοῦ, καὶ θύρας…ἀνεῳγμένης	1		This clause gives information that contrasts with what Paul will say in the previous verse about how he left **Troas**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could indicate this contrast with a natural form. Alternate translation: “and although a door for the gospel of Christ had been opened” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
2CO	2	12	a1ti	figs-metaphor	εἰς τὸ εὐαγγέλιον τοῦ Χριστοῦ, καὶ θύρας μοι ἀνεῳγμένης	1	a door for the gospel of Christ was opened to me in the Lord	Here Paul speaks of God providing opportunities for him to preach the **gospel** as if God were “opening” a **door** for the **Gospel**. The image is of God opening a door so that Paul can go in and preach the message about Christ. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “and an opportunity to preach the gospel of Christ having been given to me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2CO	2	12	n9cr	figs-activepassive	εἰς τὸ εὐαγγέλιον τοῦ Χριστοῦ, καὶ θύρας μοι ἀνεῳγμένης ἐν Κυρίῳ	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. In this case, Paul could be stating the the **Lord** did it, or he could be implying that “God” did it **in {the} Lord**. See the note about **in {the} Lord**. Alternate translation: “and the Lord having opened a door for the gospel of Christ for me” or “and God having opened a door for the Gospel of Christ for me in the Lord” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2CO	2	12	vtg5	figs-possession	τὸ εὐαγγέλιον τοῦ Χριστοῦ	1		Here Paul uses the possessive form to describe **the gospel** that could: (1) be about **Christ**. Alternate translation: “the gospel concerning Christ” (2) belong to **Christ**. Alternate translation: “Christ’s gospel” or “the gospel from Christ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
2CO	2	12	fcf7	figs-metaphor	ἐν Κυρίῳ	1		Here Paul uses the spatial metaphor **in {the} Lord** to describe his union with Christ. In this case, being **in {the} Lord**, or united to the Lord, shows that the **door** was **opened** to Paul: (1) by the **Lord**. Alternate translation: “by the Lord” (2) so that he could continue to serve in his union with the **Lord**. Alternate translation: “in my union with the Lord” or “so that I can do what the Lord wants” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2CO	2	12	m7x6	figs-explicit	Κυρίῳ	1		Here, the word **Lord** could refer to: (1) Jesus the Messiah. Alternate translation: “the Lord, the Messiah” (2) God generally. Alternate translation: “the Lord God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2CO	2	13	rjy9	figs-idiom	οὐκ ἔσχηκα ἄνεσιν τῷ πνεύματί μου	1	I had no relief in my spirit	Here, the clause **I had no relief in my spirit** indicates that Paul was anxious or concerned. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable form or plain language. Alternate translation: “my mind could not rest” or “I was concerned” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
2CO	2	13	k7k9	figs-explicit	οὐκ ἔσχηκα ἄνεσιν τῷ πνεύματί μου	1		Here Paul does not clarify what he was concerned or anxious about. He clarifies later in [7:5–16](../07/05.md) that he was anxious to know how Titus’ visit to the Corinthians went. The Corinthians would have made this inference, since Titus had already visited them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this information more explicit. Alternate translation: “I had no relief in my spirit about Titus’ visit to you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2CO	2	13	trp2	figs-abstractnouns	οὐκ ἔσχηκα ἄνεσιν τῷ πνεύματί μου	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **relief**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “restful” or “relieved.” Alternate translation: “my spirit was not restful” or “my spirit was not relieved” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2CO	2	13	w79i	figs-explicit	μὴ εὑρεῖν με Τίτον τὸν ἀδελφόν μου	1		Here Paul is stating that **Titus** was not in Troas, not that he simply could not find him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that shows that **Titus** was not in the city of Troas when Paul visited there. Alternate translation: “as I found out that my brother Titus was not there” or “as my brother Titus was not in the city” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2CO	2	13	xd5h	figs-metaphor	Τίτον τὸν ἀδελφόν μου	1	my brother Titus	Here Paul speaks of **Titus** as if he were his **brother** (probably a younger **brother**). He speaks in this way to indicate that **Titus** is a fellow believer and that he and Paul are as close as if they they were brothers. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a simile or plain language to express this idea. Alternate translation: “Titus, who is like my own brother,” or “my very dear friend and fellow believer Titus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2CO	2	13	wq6j	figs-explicit	ἀποταξάμενος αὐτοῖς	1	So I left them	Here Paul refers to how he **said farewell** to the people from Troas, but he also means that he left their city. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “having said farewell to them and departed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2CO	2	13	j9je	writing-pronouns	αὐτοῖς	1		Here, the word **them** refers to the friends that Paul made in the city of “Troas” (see [2:12](../02/12.md)). Most likely, these people were fellow believers. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make to whom **them** refers more explicit. Alternate translation: “to the people from Troas” or “to my friends in Troas” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
2CO	2	13	gxp2	figs-go	ἐξῆλθον εἰς	1		Here, the phrase **went on to** refers to travel in which a person leaves one area and goes to another area. Use a word or phrase that refers to this kind of movement in your language. Alternate translation: “I departed from there to go to” or “I went from there to” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])
2CO	2	14	s6k3	grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1		Here, the word **But** introduces a new section. Paul will not speak again about Titus and his travel plans until [7:5](../07/05.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a new section or topic, or you could leave **But** untranslated. Alternate translation: “But now,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
2CO	2	14	g39s	figs-idiom	τῷ…Θεῷ χάρις	1		Here, the phrase **thanks {be} to God** is a way to indicate that one is praising God for something. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this phrase with a normal way in your language to thank or praise someone for what that person has done. Alternate translation: “we thank God” or “we give glory to God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
2CO	2	14	qgok	figs-exclusive	ἡμᾶς…ἡμῶν	1		Here, the word **us** does not include the Corinthians. It could refer to: (1) Paul and those who proclaim the gospel with him. Alternate translation: “us who preach … us” (2) just Paul. Alternate translation: “me … me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
2CO	2	14	gpd2	figs-metaphor	τῷ πάντοτε θριαμβεύοντι ἡμᾶς	1	God, who in Christ always leads us in triumph	Here Paul speaks as if **God** were a leader who had won a victory and set up a parade or **triumphal procession** to celebrate. In this parade, Paul and those with him could be either or both of the following: (1) prisoners who have been conquered and who are put in the parade to illustrate the victory. This is the normal meaning of the word in other places. Alternate translation: “always parading us as his captives” or “always showing that he leads us” (2) soldiers who helped win the victory and who are celebrating. This is not the normal meaning of the word, but it is possible and fits the context well. Alternate translation: “always having us participate in his triumphal parade” or “always helping us to conquer” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2CO	2	14	so2k	figs-metaphor	ἐν τῷ Χριστῷ	1		Paul uses the spatial metaphor **in Christ** to describe the union of believers with Christ. In this case, being **in Christ**, or united to Christ, explains why or how they are involved in the **triumphal procession**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a phrase that indicates that union with Christ is the reason or the means for participating in the **procession**. Alternate translation: “because of our union with Christ” or “by means of our union with Christ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2CO	2	14	l1nr	figs-exmetaphor	τὴν ὀσμὴν τῆς γνώσεως αὐτοῦ, φανεροῦντι δι’ ἡμῶν ἐν παντὶ τόπῳ	1	Through us he spreads the sweet aroma of the knowledge of him everywhere	Here Paul speaks as if **the knowledge of him** were an **aroma**, a smell or odor. In this case, the context implies that this is a pleasing or good smell. He speaks in this way to indicate that everyone hears and reacts to the message about Christ, just like everyone smells and reacts to a strong odor. Also, just like a smell fills a whole room, so the good news fills **every place** on earth. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea by using a simile or plain language. Consider using a form that you can continue to use in the following two verse, in which Paul continues the **aroma** metaphor. Alternate translation: “making known through us and in every place the knowledge of him, which is like an good smell” or “powerfully revealing through us the knowledge of him, which is spreading into every place” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])
2CO	2	14	tlqe	figs-possession	τὴν ὀσμὴν τῆς γνώσεως αὐτοῦ	1		Here Paul uses the possessive form to describe an **aroma** that is **knowledge**. In other words, the possessive indicates what the **aroma** stands for. Then, Paul indicates that this **knowledge** is about **him**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the ideas in a more natural way. Alternate translation: “the aroma, which is knowledge about him” or “the aroma, that is, knowing him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
2CO	2	14	ihbw	figs-abstractnouns	τῆς γνώσεως αὐτοῦ	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **knowledge**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “know.” Alternate translation: “that is knowing him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2CO	2	14	lxlc	writing-pronouns	αὐτοῦ	1		Here, the word **him** could refer to: (1) God generally. Alternate translation: “of God” (2) Christ specifically. Alternate translation: “of Christ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
2CO	2	14	eq21	figs-hyperbole	ἐν παντὶ τόπῳ	1	he spreads … everywhere	Here Paul speaks as if God used him and those with him to make God known **in every place**. The Corinthians would have understood him to mean that God uses them to make God known in many places, or in every place that they visit. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea clearer. Alternate translation: “in every place we go” or “throughout the world” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
2CO	2	15	cjjj	grammar-connect-words-phrases	ὅτι	1		Here, the word **For** introduces an explanation of what Paul said in the previous verse about “the aroma” ([2:14](../02/14.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces further explanation. Alternate translation: “Indeed,” or “Here is what I mean:” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
2CO	2	15	yfx6	figs-exclusive	ἐσμὲν	1		Here, just as in [2:14](../02/14.md), the word **we** does not include the Corinthians. It could refer to: (1) Paul and those who proclaim the gospel with him. Alternate translation: “we who preach are” (2) just Paul. Alternate translation: “I am” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
2CO	2	15	x6nn	figs-exmetaphor	Χριστοῦ εὐωδία ἐσμὲν τῷ Θεῷ	1	we are to God the sweet aroma of Christ	Here Paul continues to speak about **fragrance** and good smells (see [2:14](../02/14.md)). Here, he identifies himself and those with him as a **fragrance** that comes from **Christ** and which goes toward **God**. By speaking in this way, he shows that **we** are those who represent or declare who Christ is in the presence of God. Just like everyone smells a good smell and knows where it comes from, so everyone notices Paul and those with him and realizes that they represent **Christ** before **God**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a simile or express the idea in plain language. Make sure that your translation fits with the previous and the following verses. Alternate translation: “we are like a good odor that spreads from Christ before God” or “we represent Christ before God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])
2CO	2	15	b1k1	figs-possession	Χριστοῦ εὐωδία	1	the sweet aroma of Christ	Here Paul uses the possessive form to indicate that the **fragrance** could: (1) come or spread from **Christ**. Alternate translation: “a fragrance from Christ” (2) be presented or offered by **Christ**. Alternate translation: “a fragrance that Christ presents” or “a fragrance that Christ offers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
2CO	2	15	itc8	figs-activepassive	τοῖς σῳζομένοις	1	those who are saved	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who does the action, Paul implies that “God” does it. Alternate translation: “the ones whom God is saving” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2CO	2	15	ze7n	figs-extrainfo	τοῖς ἀπολλυμένοις	1		Christians disagree over whether God causes people to “perish” or whether people cause themselves to “perish.” The word that Paul uses here intentionally does not include the person who causes the **perishing**. If possible, your translation also should avoid stating who causes the “perishing.” Alternate translation: “the ones on the path to destruction” or “the ones who are not being saved” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])
2CO	2	16	zrae	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	οἷς μὲν…οἷς δὲ	1		Here, the word **indeed** indicates that the author is introducing the first of two parts. The word **but** introduces the second part. The author uses this form to contrast “the ones perishing” and “the ones being saved” (see [2:15](../02/15.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that naturally contrasts two groups of people. Alternate translation: “on one hand, to the ones … but on the other hand, to the others” or “to the ones … but to the others” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
2CO	2	16	pv6o	figs-infostructure	οἷς μὲν ὀσμὴ ἐκ θανάτου εἰς θάνατον, οἷς δὲ ὀσμὴ ἐκ ζωῆς εἰς ζωήν	1		Here Paul refers to “the ones perishing” before he refers to “the ones being saved,” which is the opposite of the order he used in [2:15](../02/15.md). This was good style in his culture. If reversing the order from [2:15](../02/15.md) would be confusing for your readers, and if it would not be good style, you could reverse the order here to match that in [2:15](../02/15.md). Alternate translation: “to the ones indeed, an aroma from life to life, but to the others, an aroma from death to death” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
2CO	2	16	t3vw	writing-pronouns	οἷς	-1		Here, the phrase **to the ones** refers to “the ones perishing,” and the phrase **to the {others}** refers to “the ones being saved” (see [2:15](../02/15.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could clarify to whom these phrases refer. Alternate translation: “to the latter … to the former” or “to the ones perishing … to the ones being saved” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
2CO	2	16	dwk6	figs-exmetaphor	ὀσμὴ	-1	an aroma	Here Paul continues to speak about **fragrance** and good smells (see [2:14–15](../02/14.md)). He specifically explains what kind of **aroma** he and those with him are. Those who do not believe think that the **aroma** smells bad, while those who do believe think that the **aroma** smells good. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a simile or express the idea plainly. Make sure that your translation fits with how you translated the “smelling” language in [2:14–15](../02/14.md). Alternate translation: “we smell like an aroma … we smell like an aroma” or “our message is … our message is” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])
2CO	2	16	ud2u	figs-idiom	ἐκ θανάτου εἰς θάνατον…ἐκ ζωῆς εἰς ζωήν	1	an aroma from death to death	Here Paul uses the words **from** and **to** with the same word. He could be using this form because: (1) **from** indicates the source of the **aroma**, and **to** indicates the effects of the **aroma**. Alternate translation: “that smells like death and leads to death … that smells like life and leads to life” or “of death causing death … of life causing life” (2) **from** and **to** together emphasize that the **aroma** is characterized completely by either **death** or **life**. Alternate translation: “of death … of life” or “characterized completely by death … characterized completely by life” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
2CO	2	16	yau5	figs-abstractnouns	ἐκ θανάτου εἰς θάνατον…ἐκ ζωῆς εἰς ζωήν	1		If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **death** and **life**, you could express the ideas by using verbs such as “die” and “live” or adjectives such as “dead” and “alive.” Make sure your translation fits with the option you chose in the previous note. Alternate translation: “that comes from something dying and that leads to people dying … that comes from something living and leads to people living” or “that smells like something dead … that smells like something alive” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2CO	2	16	cdr3	writing-pronouns	πρὸς ταῦτα	1	a fragrance from life to life	Here, the phrase **these {things}** refers back to what those who proclaim the good news must do, things that Paul has outlined in [2:14–16](../02/14.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could make explicit what **these {things}** refers to. Alternate translation: “to do what I have said” or “to preach the gospel like this” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
2CO	2	16	be6x	figs-rquestion	πρὸς ταῦτα τίς ἱκανός?	1	who is worthy of these things?	Paul does not ask this question because he is looking for information. Rather, he asks it to involve the Corinthians in what he is arguing. The question could imply that the answer is that: (1) no one is **sufficient**. Alternate translation: “for these things, nobody is sufficient!” (2) Paul and those with him are **sufficient**. Alternate translation: “for these things, we are indeed sufficient” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
2CO	2	17	h7y1	grammar-connect-logic-result	γάρ	1		Here, the word **For** could introduce: (1) a basis or proof for why he and those with him are not “sufficient,” as the previous question implied (see [2:16](../02/16.md)). Alternate translation: “You can tell that we are not sufficient because” (2) an answer to the previous question that indicates that Paul and those with him are “sufficient.” Alternate translation: “But we are sufficient, because” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
2CO	2	17	pmpz	figs-exclusive	ἐσμεν…λαλοῦμεν	1		Here, just as in [2:14–15](../02/14.md), the word **we** does not include the Corinthians. It could refer to: (1) Paul and those who proclaim the gospel with him. Alternate translation: “we who preach are … we speak” (2) just Paul. Alternate translation: “I am … I speak” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
2CO	2	17	a5sa	figs-metonymy	τὸν λόγον	1	who sell the word of God	Here, the word **word** represents what someone says in words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “the words” or “the communication” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
2CO	2	17	u7ui	figs-nominaladj	οἱ πολλοὶ	1		Paul is using the adjective **many** as a noun in order to refer **many** people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this one with a noun phrase. Alternate translation: “the many people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
2CO	2	17	yf8u	translate-unknown	καπηλεύοντες	1		Here, the word **peddling** refers to the practice of selling goods that one has. The word implies that the person who is **peddling** is trying to make as much profit as they can, both by honest and deceitful means. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to selling something for as much money as possible. Alternate translation: “trading in” or “selling off” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
2CO	2	17	ohh8	figs-possession	τὸν λόγον τοῦ Θεοῦ	1		Here Paul uses the possessive form to describe **the word** that could be: (1) from **God**. Alternate translation: “the word from God” (2) about **God**. Alternate translation: “the word about God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
2CO	2	17	u4iy	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	ἀλλ’ ὡς	-1		Here Paul uses **but as** to introduce a contrast with **the many** who “peddle” God’s word. Paul repeats **but as** to continue and emphasize this contrast, not to contrast **sincerity** and **from God**. If the repetition of **but as** would be confusing, you could use **but as** once and express the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “but instead as … and even more as” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
2CO	2	17	x86y	figs-abstractnouns	ἐξ εἰλικρινείας	1	sincerity	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **sincerity**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “sincere.” Alternate translation: “those who are sincere” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2CO	2	17	f9x4	figs-explicit	ὡς ἐκ Θεοῦ	1		Here, the phrase **as from God** indicates that God sent Paul and those with him to **speak** the gospel. The word **as** indicates how they **speak**. It does not mean that they are not really **from God**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “as those whom God has sent” or “as ones sent by God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2CO	2	17	aizg	figs-explicit	λαλοῦμεν	1		Here, Paul implies that they are speaking **the word of God** that he already mentioned. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make what they **speak** more explicit. Alternate translation: “we speak the word of God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2CO	2	17	vpdc	figs-explicit	κατέναντι Θεοῦ	1		Here, the phrase **in {the} presence of God** could indicate that: (1) they **speak** as they do because they know that **God** sees or knows what they do. So, they speak in a way that pleases **God**. Alternate translation: “as God desires” or “with God watching” (2) they **speak** with **God** as a witness guaranteeing what they say. Alternate translation: “with God as witness” or “with God guaranteeing it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2CO	2	17	q4dc	figs-abstractnouns	κατέναντι Θεοῦ	1	before God	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **presence**, you could express the idea by using a phrase that refers to being close to or in front of **God**. Alternate translation: “in front of God” or “before God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2CO	2	17	u2zb	figs-metaphor	ἐν Χριστῷ	1	we speak in Christ	Paul uses the spatial metaphor **in Christ** to describe the union of believers with **Christ**. In this case, being **in Christ**, or united to Christ, explains how they **speak**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a phrase that indicates that they **speak** as those who are united to **Christ**. Alternate translation: “as Christians” or “as those united to Christ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2CO	3	1	mdwx	figs-exclusive	ἀρχόμεθα…ἑαυτοὺς…μὴ χρῄζομεν	1		Here, just as in [2:14–15](../02/14.md), [17](../02/17.md), the word **we** does not include the Corinthians. It could refer to: (1) Paul and those who proclaim the gospel with him. Alternate translation: “Are we who preach beginning … ourselves … we do not need … do we” (2) just Paul. Alternate translation: “Am I beginning … myself … I do not need … do I” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
2CO	3	intro	f7rh			0		# 2 Corinthians 3 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n4. Paul’s ministry (2:14–7:4)\n      * Qualification for ministry (3:1–6)\n      * Ministry of Moses and ministry of Paul (3:7–4:6)\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Letters of recommendation\n\nIn [3:1–3](../03/01.md), Paul refers to “letters of recommendation.” These were letters that a person carried with them when they traveled to a new place. Someone that the traveler knew would write down that the traveler could be trusted and should be welcomed, and the traveler would give this letter to people that he or she visited. If something like this is not a common practice in your culture, you may need to explain it for your readers in a footnote. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/letter]])\n\n### Letter and Spirit\n\nIn [3:6–8](../03/06.md), Paul contrasts “letter” and “Spirit.” In these verses, the word “letter” refers to the letters in the alphabet, and the word “Spirit” refers to the Holy Spirit. Paul’s point is that whatever is characterized by the “letter” is something that is only written down and does not have any power. Whatever is characterized by the “Spirit” has power and can change people. Although it also might be written down, the “Spirit” gives it power. Paul uses this contrast to describe one of the differences between the old covenant (“letter”) and the new covenant (“Spirit”). Consider a natural way to express this contrast in your language. \n\n### Glory\n\nThroughout this chapter, Paul speaks extensively of “glory.” He indicates that the old covenant and ministry had glory, but the new covenant and ministry have much more glory. The word “glory” refers to how great, powerful, and amazing someone or something is. Consider what term will express this idea throughout the chapter. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/glory]])\n\n### Veiling of the glory on Moses’ face\n\nIn [3:7](../03/07.md), [13](../03/13.md), Paul refers to a story about what happened when Moses received the Ten Commandments from God. Because he met God and spoke with him, Moses’ face became bright or shining. Because of that, Moses would cover his face with a veil or cloth after he spoke with God. You can read this story in [Exodus 34:29–35](../exo/34/29.md). Paul also notes that the brightness or “glory” on Moses’ face would fade away. This detail cannot be found directly in the story in Exodus. Paul either inferred it from the story, or it was tradition to say that the “glory” faded away. If your readers would not understand what Paul refers to in these verses, you could include a footnote or explanatory information. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/veil]])\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### The Corinthians as a letter of recommendation\n\nIn [3:2–3](../03/02.md), Paul describes the Corinthians as a letter of recommendation for him and those with him. He speaks in this way because anyone who knows the Corinthians will know that they believed because of Paul and those who worked with him. In this way, the Corinthians “recommend” Paul as a true apostle of Jesus. If possible preserve the metaphor of a letter of recommendation or express the idea with a simile. \n\n### The “veil”\n\nAfter he introduces how Moses put an actual “veil” over his face, Paul begins to use the word “veil” and related words in figurative ways (see [3:14–18](../03/14.md)). He claims that people who are not united to Christ cannot understand the Old Testament, and he describes this as a “veil” that covers their hearts. In other words, just as the Israelites could not see the glory on Moses’ face, so anyone who hears the Old Testament without believing in Jesus cannot fully understand it. However, Paul says that this “veil” is taken away when someone believes in Jesus. Because of that, those who believe have no “veil” and can reflect God’s glory even more than Moses’ did. This is a complex figure of speech that connects directly to the story about Moses and his veil. Because of that, it is important to preserve the “veil” language. If your readers would not understand that Paul is speaking figuratively, you could use a simile to express the idea. \n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### “The Lord is the Spirit”\n\nIn [3:17](../03/17.md), Paul states that “the Lord is the Spirit.” Scholars have understood this sentence in three primary ways. First, Paul could be defining who he meant when he referred to “the Lord” in the previous verse ([3:16](../03/16.md)). Second, Paul could be stating that the way that believers experience “the Lord” is as the Holy Spirit. Third, Paul could be stating that “the Lord” is a spirit or is spiritual. It is most likely true that Paul is defining who “the Lord” he has referred to is, so it is recommended that you follow the first option. See the notes on this verse for translation possibilities. 
2CO	3	1	um8x	figs-rquestion	ἀρχόμεθα πάλιν ἑαυτοὺς συνιστάνειν?	1	Are we beginning to praise ourselves again?	Paul does not ask this question because he is looking for information. Rather, he asks it to involve the Corinthians in what he is arguing. The question implies that the answer is “no, we are not.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea by using a strong negation. Alternate translation: “We are certainly not beginning to commend ourselves again!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
2CO	3	1	ogwa	translate-unknown	ἑαυτοὺς συνιστάνειν	1		Here, phrase **commend ourselves** refers to the practice of stating why one should be trusted and welcomed. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to giving reasons why people should welcome and trust a person. Alternate translation: “to speak favorably of ourselves” or “to vouch for ourselves” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
2CO	3	1	fuds	figs-explicit	πάλιν	1		Here, the word **again** implies that Paul and those with him had already “commended themselves” at some point in the past. Most likely, this happened when they first met the Corinthians. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that makes this more explicit. Alternate translation: “once more” or “again, like we did at first” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2CO	3	1	noiz	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	ἢ	1		The word **Or** introduces an alternate to what Paul asked in the first question. In that question, he implied that they were not “commending” themselves again. With **Or**, then, Paul asks a question that introduces the incorrect alternative: they might need **letters of recommendation**. He introduces this incorrect alternate to show that the implication of his first question is true: they are not “commending” themselves again. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express **Or** with a word that signifies a contrast or gives an alternative. Alternate translation: “Rather,” or “Quite the contrary:” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
2CO	3	1	y8yc	figs-rquestion	ἢ μὴ χρῄζομεν, ὥς τινες, συστατικῶν ἐπιστολῶν πρὸς ὑμᾶς ἢ ἐξ ὑμῶν?	1	We do not need letters of recommendation to you or from you, like some people, do we?	Paul does not ask this question because he is looking for information. Rather, he asks it to involve the Corinthians in what he is arguing. The question implies that the answer is “we do not need them.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea by using a strong negation. Alternate translation: “In fact, we certainly do not need, like some, letters of recommendation to you or from you.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
2CO	3	1	syny	writing-pronouns	ὥς τινες	1		Here, the word **some** refers generally to other people besides Paul and those with him. Paul may more specifically have in mind the people who opposed him in Corinth, but he does not make this explicit. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to other people besides Paul and those who serve with him. Alternate translation: “like some others” or “like some people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
2CO	3	1	ad1u	figs-possession	συστατικῶν ἐπιστολῶν	1	letters of recommendation	Here Paul uses the possessive form to refer to **letters** that gave a **recommendation** for the person who had the letter. Many people in Paul’s culture would ask friends to write these letters, and then they would show the letters to people they visited to prove that they were trustworthy and could be welcomed. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that naturally refers to this kind of letter. Alternate translation: “reference letters” or “letters of introduction” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
2CO	3	1	dygq	figs-abstractnouns	συστατικῶν ἐπιστολῶν	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **recommendation**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “recommend.” Alternate translation: “letters that recommend us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2CO	3	2	ty59	figs-metaphor	ἡ ἐπιστολὴ ἡμῶν ὑμεῖς ἐστε ἐνγεγραμμένη ἐν ταῖς καρδίαις ἡμῶν, γινωσκομένη καὶ ἀναγινωσκομένη ὑπὸ πάντων ἀνθρώπων	1	You yourselves are our letter of recommendation	Here Paul continues to speak about “letters,” but now he tells the Corinthians that they are the **letter** of recommendation for Paul and those with him. This **letter** is not a physical document, but is **written** in their **hearts**, and **all men** can **read** it. Paul speaks in this way to indicate that the recommendation he relies on is the Corinthian believers. In other words, the fact that they believe and that they are close with Paul (**in our hearts**) shows that Paul is trustworthy and a true apostle. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea with a simile or in some other natural way. Alternate translation: “You yourselves are like our letter of recommendation, which you wrote on us and that is known and read by all men” or “We do not need a letter of recommendation because you yourselves are the recommendation that is in our hearts and that is known and understood by all men” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2CO	3	2	f8s8	figs-rpronouns	ὑμεῖς ἐστε	1		Here, the word translated **yourselves** emphasizes **You**. Consider using a natural way to emphasize **You** in your language. Alternate translation: “You indeed are” or “It is you who are” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns]])
2CO	3	2	a7xl	figs-exclusive	ἡ ἐπιστολὴ ἡμῶν…ταῖς καρδίαις ἡμῶν	1		Here, just as in [3:1](../03/01.md), the word **our** does not include the Corinthians. It could refer to: (1) Paul and those who proclaim the gospel with him. Alternate translation: “the letter for us who preach the gospel … our hearts” (2) just Paul. Alternate translation: “my letter … my heart” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
2CO	3	2	ygx8	figs-possession	ἡ ἐπιστολὴ ἡμῶν…ἐνγεγραμμένη	1		Here Paul uses the possessive form to describe a **letter** that could: (1) recommend “us.” Alternate translation: “the letter for us written” or “a letter that recommends us written” (2) be written by “us.” Alternate translation: “a letter written by us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
2CO	3	2	v2e7	figs-metonymy	ἐνγεγραμμένη ἐν ταῖς καρδίαις ἡμῶν	1	written on our hearts	In the Paul’s culture, **hearts** are the places where humans think and plan. What Paul means is that the recommendation from the Corinthians is not written down on paper but is rather part of their relationship with Paul. If it would be helpful in your language, you could refer to the place where humans think in your culture or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “written inside us” or “expressed by our relationship” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
2CO	3	2	ko7w	figs-activepassive	ἐνγεγραμμένη	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Paul states in the following verse that “Christ” did it (see [3:3](../03/03.md)). Alternate translation: “that Christ has written” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2CO	3	2	bu1u	figs-activepassive	γινωσκομένη καὶ ἀναγινωσκομένη ὑπὸ πάντων ἀνθρώπων	1	written on our hearts	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the ideas in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “which all men know and read” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2CO	3	2	pzpz	figs-doublet	γινωσκομένη καὶ ἀναγινωσκομένη	1		Here, the words **known** and **read** express very similar ideas. It is likely that **known** indicates that people are aware that there is a **letter**, while **read** indicates that they know what the **letter** says. If you do not have words that express these distinctions, and if the repetition would be confusing in your language, you could express the idea with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “read” or “noticed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
2CO	3	2	dr5k	figs-gendernotations	πάντων ἀνθρώπων	1	known and read by all people	Although the word **men** is masculine, Paul is using it to refer to all people, both men and women. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a non-gendered word or refer to both genders. Alternate translation: “every person” or “all men and women” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
2CO	3	3	s717	figs-explicit	φανερούμενοι	1	you are a letter from Christ	Here, the phrase **making known** could: (1) indicate that something is well-known or obvious to people. Alternate translation: “being clear” or “so it is evident” (2) state that the Corinthians show or reveal something to others. Alternate translation: “you making it clear” or “you revealing” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2CO	3	3	aylw	figs-metaphor	ἐστὲ ἐπιστολὴ Χριστοῦ, διακονηθεῖσα ὑφ’ ἡμῶν, ἐνγεγραμμένη οὐ μέλανι, ἀλλὰ Πνεύματι Θεοῦ ζῶντος, οὐκ ἐν πλαξὶν λιθίναις, ἀλλ’ ἐν πλαξὶν καρδίαις σαρκίναις	1		Here Paul continues to speak as if the Corinthians were a **letter**. Here, he states that this **letter** was written by **Christ** and **administered** by Paul and those with him. What he means by this is that **Christ** is the one who enabled the Corinthians to believe, and he worked through Paul and those with him to do that. Paul then contrasts a **letter** written with **ink** and on **tablets of stone** with a **letter** written by the power of the **Spirit** and on **hearts of flesh**. What he means by this is that the letter is the Corinthians, not some written document, and that the message is communicated by the **Spirit**, not by letters written with **ink**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea with a simile or in some other natural way. Alternate translation: “you are like a letter of Christ having been administered by us, not written with ink but as if with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but as if on tablets of hearts of flesh” or “you are a message from Christ having been administered by us, not communicated by ink but by the Spirit of the living God, not presented on tablets of stone but on tablets of hearts of flesh” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2CO	3	3	hlap	figs-possession	ἐπιστολὴ Χριστοῦ	1		Here Paul uses the possessive form to indicate that the **letter** is from or written by **Christ**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in a more natural way. Alternate translation: “a letter from Christ” or “a letter written by Christ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
2CO	3	3	wrk4	figs-activepassive	διακονηθεῖσα ὑφ’ ἡμῶν	1	cared for by us	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “that we have administered” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2CO	3	3	dsxa	translate-unknown	διακονηθεῖσα ὑφ’ ἡμῶν	1		Here, the phrase **having been administered by us** could indicate that: (1) “we” delivered the **letter**. Alternate translation: “having been delivered by us” or “having been sent by us” (2) “we” helped **Christ** compose the **letter**. Alternate translation: “having been composed with our help” or “that we wrote down” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
2CO	3	3	bfsl	figs-exclusive	ἡμῶν	1		Here, just as in [3:1–2](../03/01.md), the word **us** does not include the Corinthians. It could refer to: (1) Paul and those who proclaim the gospel with him. Alternate translation: “us who preach the gospel” (2) just Paul. Alternate translation: “me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
2CO	3	3	akc6	figs-infostructure	ἐνγεγραμμένη οὐ μέλανι, ἀλλὰ Πνεύματι Θεοῦ ζῶντος, οὐκ ἐν πλαξὶν λιθίναις, ἀλλ’ ἐν πλαξὶν καρδίαις σαρκίναις	1		If your language would not put the negative statements before the positive statements, you could reverse them. Alternate translation: “written with the Spirit of the living God, not with ink, on tablets of hearts of flesh, not on tablets of stone” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
2CO	3	3	vyuh	figs-ellipsis	ἀλλὰ Πνεύματι Θεοῦ ζῶντος, οὐκ ἐν πλαξὶν λιθίναις, ἀλλ’ ἐν πλαξὶν καρδίαις σαρκίναις	1		These phrases leaves out some words that many languages might need to be complete. If it would be helpful in your language, you could supply the word **written** from earlier in the sentence in some or all of the phrases. Alternate translation: “but written with the Spirit of the living God, not written on tablets of stone but written on tablets of hearts of flesh” or “but with the Spirit of the living God, not written on tablets of stone but on tablets of hearts of flesh” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
2CO	3	3	q96q	figs-activepassive	ἐνγεγραμμένη οὐ	1	It was written not with ink … on tablets of human hearts	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Paul implies that “Christ” did it. Alternate translation: “which Christ wrote not” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2CO	3	3	qt5g	translate-unknown	μέλανι	1	It was written not with ink but by the Spirit of the living God	Here, the word **ink** refers to liquid that people in Paul’s culture used to write letters and words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use whatever term naturally refers to what people use to write letters and words. Alternate translation: “with a pen” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
2CO	3	3	t5ah	figs-idiom	Θεοῦ ζῶντος	1	not on tablets of stone, but on tablets of human hearts	Here, the phrase **living God** identifies God as the one who “lives” and possibly as the one who gives “life.” The primary point is that **God** actually “lives,” unlike idols and other things that people call “god.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that emphasizes that God really “lives.” Alternate translation: “of the God who lives” or “of the true God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])\n
2CO	3	3	ana2	translate-unknown	ἐν πλαξὶν	-1		Here, the word **tablets** refers to thin, flat pieces of stone on which people would write words, especially important words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to what people use to write something important on. Paul may be referring here to the **tablets** on which Moses wrote God’s commandments (see [Exodus 34:1–4](../exo/34/01.md)), so if possible use a word that could refer to those **tablets**. Alternate translation: “on flat pieces … on flat pieces” or “on plaques … on plaques” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

Alternate translation: “of the Spirit, not of the letter” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
2CO	3	6	poyq	figs-explicit	οὐ γράμματος, ἀλλὰ Πνεύματος	1		When Paul contrasts **letter** and **Spirit**, he implies that **letter** describes the old covenant and **Spirit** describes the new covenant. What he means is that the old covenant was only written down and could not change people on the inside. On the other hand, the new covenant is empowered by the Holy **Spirit**, who can change people on the inside. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this contrast more explicit. Alternate translation: “not a covenant of the letter that is powerless, but a covenant of the powerful Spirit” or “not one that is only written down but one that the Spirit puts inside people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

He speaks in this way to indicate that **the letter** (which refers to the old covenant and its regulations) does not have the power to give life but instead can only condemn people to die. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable figure of speech or plain language. Alternate translation: “the letter is like someone who kills” or “the letter dooms people to die” or “the letter causes death” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
2CO	3	7	lyf7	grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1	Connecting Statement:	Here, the word **Now** introduces a development of the ideas from the previous verse.

2CO	3	7	yzhq	grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἰ	1		Paul is speaking as **if** the **glory** of the **ministry** of **death** were a possibility, but he means that it is actually true. If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, and if your readers might think that what Paul is saying is not certain, then you can introduce the clause with a word such as “since” or “given that.” Alternate translation: “since” or “given that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
2CO	3	7	rife	figs-possession	ἡ διακονία τοῦ θανάτου	1		Here Paul uses the possessive form to describe a **ministry** that leads to **death**.

Alternate translation: “the system of this death” or “the laws that led to death” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2CO	3	7	ut6r	figs-abstractnouns	ἡ διακονία τοῦ θανάτου	1	Now if the ministry that produced death … came in such glory	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **ministry** and **death**, you could express the ideas by using verbs such as “administer” and “die.” Alternate translation: “the old covenant, which was administered in a way that causes people die” or “what was administered, which caused people to die” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2CO	3	7	j1hp	figs-activepassive	ἐν γράμμασιν ἐντετυπωμένη λίθοις	1	engraved in letters on stones	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Paul implies that “God” did it (see also [Exodus 34:1](../exo/34/01.md)). Alternate translation: “which God engraved in letters on stones” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2CO	3	7	rx13	figs-explicit	ἐν γράμμασιν ἐντετυπωμένη λίθοις	1		Here Paul refers to how God **engraved** or carved the regulations for the **ministry** on **stones** or tablets. Much like in the previous verse, **letters** refers to the alphabet, so the point is that God used writing. Paul is probably referring to the story about how Moses met God on a mountain, and God carved the regulations of the covenant on two pieces of stone. You can read this story in [Exodus 34:1–28](../exo/34/01.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “engraved in writing by God onto two stone slabs” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

When Moses returned to talk to the Israelites, his face shone brightly because he had been talking to God. In other words, some of God’s **glory** became part of Moses’ **face**, and the Israelites could not **look intently** at his face because it was a little like looking at God. You can read this story in [Exodus 34:29–35](../exo/34/29.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the idea more explicit or include a footnote explaining the story. Alternate translation: “so that the sons of Israel were not able to look carefully at the face of Moses because of the fading glory on his face that came from talking with God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2CO	3	7	s9zp	figs-gendernotations	τοὺς υἱοὺς	1		Although the word **sons** is masculine, Paul is using it to refer to any children or descendants, both men and women. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a non-gendered word or refer to both genders. Alternate translation: “the sons and daughters” or “the children” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
2CO	3	7	mh54	translate-kinship	τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἰσραὴλ	1		Here the author uses the word **sons** to refer in general to all the descendants of **Israel**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to descendants in general. Alternate translation: “the descendants of Israel” or “those descended from Israel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship]])
2CO	3	7	enwt		διὰ τὴν δόξαν τοῦ προσώπου αὐτοῦ, τὴν καταργουμένην	1		Here, the reason why the Israelites **were not able to look intently** at Moses’ face could be that: (1) Moses’ face was very “glorious.” Alternate translation: “because of the glory of his face, even though it was fading” (2) the **glory of his face** was **fading**. Alternate translation: “because the glory of his face was fading”
2CO	3	7	pqbi	figs-abstractnouns	τὴν δόξαν τοῦ προσώπου αὐτοῦ, τὴν καταργουμένην	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **glory**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “glorious” or “shining.” Alternate translation: “how his face was shining, even though that was fading” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2CO	3	7	ewkr	figs-explicit	τὴν δόξαν τοῦ προσώπου αὐτοῦ, τὴν καταργουμένην	1		Here, the word **fading** could describe: (1) the **glory** of Moses’ **face**. Alternate translation: “the glory of his face that faded” (2) the **ministry of {this} death**. Alternate translation: “the glory of his face, although that ministry was fading away” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2CO	3	8	xxn6	figs-rquestion	πῶς οὐχὶ μᾶλλον ἡ διακονία τοῦ Πνεύματος ἔσται ἐν δόξῃ?	1	Will the ministry of the Spirit not be with much more glory?	Paul does not ask this question because he is looking for information. Rather, he asks it to involve the Corinthians in what he is arguing. The question implies that the answer is “yes, it has much more glory.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea by using a strong affirmation. Alternate translation: “then the ministry of the Spirit will certainly be with much more glory.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
2CO	3	8	wkvl	figs-pastforfuture	οὐχὶ…ἔσται	1		Here Paul could use the future tense because: (1) he is stating an inference from something in the past, so the inference is future. Paul does not mean that the **ministry** will only have **glory** in the future. Alternate translation: “then is … not” (2) he is stating that the **ministry** will have **glory** in the future. He could mean that it only has **glory** in the future, or he could mean that it has **glory** in the present and will also have **glory** in the future. Alternate translation: “will … in the future not be” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture]])
2CO	3	8	wq1v	figs-possession	ἡ διακονία τοῦ Πνεύματος	1	the ministry of the Spirit	Here Paul uses the possessive form to describe **the ministry** that could: (1) lead to people receiving the **Spirit**.

In this case, the word refers to the new covenant or its principles.

2CO	3	8	o30n	figs-abstractnouns	ἡ διακονία τοῦ Πνεύματος	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **ministry**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “administer.” See how you translated this word in [3:7](../03/07.md).

Alternate translation: “Further,” or “Even more,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
2CO	3	9	p7p5	grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἰ	1		Paul is speaking as **if** the **glory** of the **ministry of {this} condemnation** were a possibility, but he means that it is actually true. If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, and if your readers might think that what Paul is saying is not certain, then you can introduce the clause with a word such as “since” or “given that.” Alternate translation: “since” or “given that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])

In this case, the word refers to a covenant or its principles. Alternate translation: “the system of this condemnation … the system of this righteousness” or “the law that leads to condemnation … the principle that leads to righteousness” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2CO	3	9	k779	figs-possession	τῇ διακονίᾳ τῆς κατακρίσεως	1	the ministry of condemnation	Here Paul uses the possessive form to describe a **ministry** that leads to **condemnation**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in a more natural way. Alternate translation: “the ministry that caused this condemnation” or “the ministry that ended in this condemnation” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
2CO	3	9	tcxw	figs-abstractnouns	τῇ διακονίᾳ τῆς κατακρίσεως, δόξα	1		If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **ministry**, **condemnation**, and **glory**, you could express the idea in another way.

2CO	3	9	if33	figs-exclamations	πολλῷ μᾶλλον περισσεύει ἡ διακονία τῆς δικαιοσύνης δόξῃ	1	how much more does the ministry of righteousness abound in glory!	Here, the phrase **much more** marks this clause as an exclamation, not a question. Paul uses this exclamation to emphatically contrast the two “ministries.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in a way that naturally contrasts the two “ministries.” Alternate translation: “then certainly much more the ministry of this righteousness abounds in glory.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations]])
2CO	3	9	egmy	figs-possession	ἡ διακονία τῆς δικαιοσύνης	1		Here Paul uses the possessive form to describe a **ministry** that leads to **righteousness**.

Alternate translation: “the new covenant, which is administered in a way that makes people righteous, is even more great,” or “what is administered that leads to people being righteous is even more glorious,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2CO	3	10	q8bg	grammar-connect-words-phrases	καὶ γὰρ	1		Here, the phrase **for indeed** indicates that Paul is adding more information (**indeed**) that supports what he said about **glory** in [3:7–9](../03/07.md) (**for**). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use words that introduce added information that supports a previous statement.

Alternate translation: “what had been glorified is not glorified, and here is why:” or “what had been glorified is not glorified in this way” (2) **{what} had been glorified**. In other words, the old covenant was **glorified** only “partially.” Alternate translation: “what had been glorified in part is not glorified” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])

Paul uses both elements because he wants to make his point very clear. If the repetition would not make the point clearer, and if using both elements would be confusing in your language, you could use one word or phrase that introduces how what was **glorified** is **not glorified**. Alternate translation: “because of” or “in comparison to” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
2CO	3	10	pvbx	figs-abstractnouns	τῆς ὑπερβαλλούσης δόξης	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **glory**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “glorious” or “great.” Alternate translation: “what was much more glorious” or “what was even greater” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

Alternate translation: “Further,” or “As it is,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
2CO	3	11	r7c9	grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἰ	1		Paul is speaking as if the **glory** of **{what} is fading away** were a possibility, but he means that it is actually true. If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, and if your readers might think that what Paul is saying is not certain, then you can introduce the clause with a word such as “since” or “given that.” Alternate translation: “since” or “given that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
2CO	3	11	ym37		τὸ καταργούμενον	1		Here, the words translated **{what} is fading away** could indicate: (1) that something is disappearing or temporary without stating that anyone is making it disappear. Alternate translation: “what is passing away” (2) that God is causing something to disappear or pass away. Alternate translation: “what is being abolished” or “what God is abolishing”
2CO	3	11	zwb2	figs-metaphor	τὸ καταργούμενον	1	that which was fading away	Here, the phrase **fading away** translates the same word that Paul used in [3:7](../03/07.md) to refer to how the glory was “fading” from Moses’ face. Paul means that, just like the glory on Moses’ face was temporary, so the old covenant that God made through Moses was temporary. See how you translated this idea in [3:7](../03/07.md) and use similar language if possible. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea using a simile. Alternate translation: “what is temporary” or “what is fading, like the glory on Moses’ face,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2CO	3	11	hm9d	figs-explicit	τὸ καταργούμενον…τὸ μένον	1		Here, the phrase **{what} is fading away** refers to the old covenant, while the phrase **{what} remains** refers to the new covenant. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make explicit what these phrases refer to. Alternate translation: “the old covenant that is fading away … the new covenant that remains” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2CO	3	11	wtht	figs-abstractnouns	διὰ δόξης…ἐν δόξῃ	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **glory**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “glorious” or “great” or an adverb such as “gloriously.” Alternate translation: “was great … is great” or “came gloriously … will come gloriously” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2CO	3	11	wrf4	figs-exclamations	πολλῷ μᾶλλον τὸ μένον ἐν δόξῃ	1		Here, the phrase **much more** marks this clause as an exclamation, not a question. Paul uses this exclamation to emphatically contrast the two covenants. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in a way that naturally contrasts the two covenants. Alternate translation: “then certainly much more what remains will come with glory.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations]])
2CO	3	12	tnc1	grammar-connect-logic-result	οὖν	1	Since we have such a hope	Here, the word **Therefore** introduces an inference from what Paul has already said, especially what he has said about the ministry of “glory” in [3:4–11](../03/04.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces an inference from a previous section. Alternate translation: “Because of that” or “Because of this ministry of glory” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
2CO	3	12	ib35	grammar-connect-logic-result	ἔχοντες	1		Here, the word **having** introduces a reason why Paul and those with him **act with much boldness**.

2CO	3	12	j76k	figs-abstractnouns	ἔχοντες…τοιαύτην ἐλπίδα	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **hope**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “hope” or an adjective such as “hopeful.” Alternate translation: “being hopeful in such a way” or “hoping in that way” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2CO	3	12	u5qa	writing-pronouns	τοιαύτην ἐλπίδα	1	such a hope	Here, the word **such** refers to back to what Paul has said about the “glory” of the ministry in [3:7–11](../03/07.md). In other words, the **hope** is based on the glorious ministry and covenant. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make explicit what **such** refers to. Alternate translation: “that kind of hope” or “hope in such a covenant” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
2CO	3	12	rf9h	figs-exclusive	χρώμεθα	1		Here, just as in [3:1–6](../03/01.md), the word **we** does not include the Corinthians.

Alternate translation: “I act” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
2CO	3	12	zbff	figs-explicit	χρώμεθα	1		Here Paul does not exactly what it is that **we** do. He implies that it is the “ministry” that he has referred to in [3:7–11](../03/07.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could make what **we** do more explicit. Alternate translation: “we perform the ministry” or “we proclaim the good news” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2CO	3	12	b5ql	figs-abstractnouns	πολλῇ παρρησίᾳ	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **boldness**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “bold” or an adverb such as “boldly.” Alternate translation: “as very bold people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2CO	3	13	fb59	figs-explicit	καὶ οὐ καθάπερ Μωϋσῆς	1		Here Paul contrasts the **boldness** that he and those with him show with how **Moses** could not show God’s glory openly. In other words, Paul and those with him can reveal God’s glory openly, in contrast to Moses, who could not. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this contrasts more explicit. Alternate translation: “and without hiding the glory, like Moses” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2CO	3	13	p1y3	figs-explicit	Μωϋσῆς ἐτίθει κάλυμμα ἐπὶ τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ, πρὸς τὸ μὴ ἀτενίσαι τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἰσραὴλ, εἰς τὸ τέλος τοῦ καταργουμένου	1		Here Paul refers to a story in [Exodus 34:29–35](../exo/34/29.md) that describes how Moses’ face shone with God’s glory after Moses spoke with him. Moses would hide his face with a **veil** when **his face** shone like this. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make what Paul is writing about more explicit. See how you translated the similar phrases in [3:7](../03/07.md), where Paul has already referred to this story. Alternate translation: “Moses wearing a veil to hide his face so that the sons of Israel would not look directly at it when the glory on his face, which came from talking with God, disappeared” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2CO	3	13	boui	figs-gendernotations	τοὺς υἱοὺς	1		Although the word **sons** is masculine, Paul is using it to refer to any children or descendants, both men and women. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a non-gendered word or refer to both genders. Alternate translation: “the sons and daughters” or “the children” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
2CO	3	13	pdnk	translate-kinship	τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἰσραὴλ	1		Here the author uses the word **sons** to refer in general to all the descendants of **Israel**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to descendants in general. Alternate translation: “the descendants of Israel” or “those descended from Israel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship]])
2CO	3	13	vuyk	figs-explicit	τὸ τέλος	1		Here, the word **end** could refer to: (1) the result of the **fading**, which was that the “glory” completely stopped shining from Moses’ face. Alternate translation: “the cessation” or “the termination” (2) the purpose or implication of how the “glory” ceased shining from Moses’ face, which was that the old covenant too would cease. Alternate translation: “the result” or “the meaning” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2CO	3	13	p5u2	figs-explicit	τοῦ καταργουμένου	1	the end of that which was fading away	Here, the phrase **{what} was fading away** could refer to: (1) the “glory” that shone from the **face** of Moses. In this case, Paul could also be implying that the old covenant would also “fade.” Alternate translation: “of the glory that was fading from his face” (2) the old covenant, that would “fade away” when God instituted a new covenant. Alternate translation: “of the covenant that would fade away” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2CO	3	13	mczg	figs-possession	τὸ τέλος τοῦ καταργουμένου	1		Here Paul uses the possessive form to describe how **{what} was fading away** completely ceased or “ended.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in a more natural way. Alternate translation: “how what was fading away ended” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
2CO	3	13	fe5r	figs-abstractnouns	τὸ τέλος τοῦ καταργουμένου	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **end**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “end” or “cease.” Alternate translation: “how what was fading away ended” or “what ceased after fading away” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2CO	3	14	kb8y	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	ἀλλὰ	1		Here, the word **But** could introduce a contrast between: (1) being able to “look intently” and having **hardened** minds.

Alternate translation: “In contrast to Moses,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
2CO	3	14	csl1	writing-pronouns	τὰ νοήματα αὐτῶν	1		Here, the word **their** refers to “the sons of Israel” that Paul mentioned in [3:13](../03/13.md).

2CO	3	14	khkq	figs-activepassive	ἐπωρώθη τὰ νοήματα αὐτῶν	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If it is possible, avoid stating who did the “hardening,” since Paul is emphasizing the fact that their minds were “hard,” not who did the “hardening.” If you must state who did the action, Paul could be implying that: (1) the Israelites did it to themselves. Alternate translation: “they hardened their minds” or “their minds became hard” (2) God did it to them. Alternate translation: “God hardened their minds” (3) Satan did it to them. Alternate translation: “Satan hardened their minds” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2CO	3	14	zvf5	figs-metaphor	ἐπωρώθη τὰ νοήματα αὐτῶν	1	But their minds were hardened	Here Paul speaks as if people’s **minds** were a soft substance that could be **hardened**. He speaks in this way to indicate that their **minds** could not know or understand what was happening, unlike a soft substance that changes when something hits it. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable figure of speech or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “they could not realize what was true” or “they could not think properly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2CO	3	14	tzbd	grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1		Here, the word **For** introduces a further explanation of what Paul has said about how **their minds were hardened**.

He speaks in this way to identify the inability of people to understand the **old covenant** with how Moses’ kept the Israelites from looking at his face with a **veil**. Just as the **veil** kept them from seeing the glory on his face, so a **veil** keeps people from understanding **the reading of the old covenant**. Since Paul uses this figure of speech to connect what he is saying with what he has said about Moses, you should preserve the metaphor or express the idea with a simile. Alternate translation: “their lack of understanding is a like a veil that remains at the reading of the old covenant, not being lifted” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2CO	3	14	wcbv	figs-infostructure	τὸ αὐτὸ κάλυμμα ἐπὶ τῇ ἀναγνώσει τῆς παλαιᾶς διαθήκης μένει,  μὴ ἀνακαλυπτόμενον	1		Here, the phrase **not being lifted** could: (1) explain how the veil **remains**. Alternate translation: “the same veil remains at the reading of the old covenant, and it is not lifted” (2) go with **remains** and explain what **remains**. Alternate translation: “the same veil remains not having been lifted at the reading of the old covenant” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
2CO	3	14	wymg	figs-explicit	τὸ αὐτὸ κάλυμμα	1		Here, the phrase **same veil** could refer to: (1) the veil that Moses wore (see [3:13](../03/13.md)).

2CO	3	14	gl8l	figs-activepassive	μὴ ἀνακαλυπτόμενον	1	It has not been removed, because only in Christ is it taken away	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

Alternate translation: “and the veil remains because” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
2CO	3	14	m7lk	figs-metaphor	ἐν Χριστῷ	1		Here Paul uses the spatial metaphor **in Christ** to describe the union of believers with **Christ**. In this case, being **in Christ**, or united to Christ, explains why and how the **veil** is “lifted.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a phrase that indicates that being united to Christ leads to the “lifting” of the **veil**. Alternate translation: “only when a person is united to Christ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2CO	3	14	r1lt	figs-explicit	καταργεῖται	1		Here, the phrase **fading away** is the same phrase that Paul used to describe how the “glory” was “fading” from Moses’ face (see [3:13](../03/13.md)).

What Paul says in the rest of the verse repeats many of the ideas from the first parts of [3:14](../03/14.md). Consider whether a contrast word or a connecting word expresses the idea most clearly. Alternate translation: “However,” or “In fact,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
2CO	3	15	rjh5	figs-idiom	ἕως σήμερον	1	But even today	Here the phrase **until today** refers to all the time before and including the present day, which is the time when Paul wrote this letter.

2CO	3	15	bb5u	figs-metaphor	κάλυμμα ἐπὶ τὴν καρδίαν αὐτῶν κεῖται	1		Here Paul continues to refer to a **veil** that keeps people from understanding the Scriptures. Express the metaphor as you did in [3:14](../03/14.md). Alternate translation: “their lack of understanding is like a veil that lies over their heart” or “they do not understand, as if a veil lies over their heart” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2CO	3	15	gwp9	figs-metonymy	ἐπὶ τὴν καρδίαν αὐτῶν	1	a veil lies over their heart	In Paul’s culture, the **heart** is the place where humans think and feel.

2CO	3	18	l3xw	figs-metaphor	ἀνακεκαλυμμένῳ προσώπῳ, τὴν δόξαν Κυρίου κατοπτριζόμενοι	1	with unveiled faces, see as a reflection the glory of the Lord	Here the author speaks as if believers do not have a “veil” over their “faces” and can thus “reflect” God’s **glory**. Since the veiling language is an important part of what Paul is saying, you should preserve the figure of speech or express the idea by using a simile. Paul is indicating a contrast that could be: (1) with Moses, who had to veil the glory on his face. Unlike him, believers do not need to veil their faces. Alternate translation: “revealing the glory of the Lord like those who have unveiled faces” (2) the Israelites, who could not look directly at the glory of God. Unlike them, believers can see God’s glory directly without a “veil.” Alternate translation: “seeing the glory of the Lord, unlike those who could only see a veil” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2CO	3	18	ui8y	translate-unknown	κατοπτριζόμενοι	1		Here, the word translated **reflecting** could refer to: (1) acting as a mirror that “reflects” an image. Alternate translation: “mirroring” (2) seeing something that is “reflected” in a mirror. Alternate translation: “seeing in a mirror” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
2CO	3	18	mdu9	figs-abstractnouns	τὴν δόξαν Κυρίου	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **glory**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “great” or “glorious.” Alternate translation: “how great the Lord is” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2CO	3	18	brpu	figs-explicit	Κυρίου	1		Here, just as in [3:16–17](../03/16.md), the word **Lord** could refer to God generally or to Jesus specifically. Express the idea the same way you did in those verses. Alternate translation: “of God the Lord” or “of the Lord Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2CO	3	18	rc9x	figs-activepassive	μεταμορφούμεθα	1	are being transformed into the same image	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who does the action, Paul implies that “God” does it. Alternate translation: “are those whom God is transforming into” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2CO	3	18	cq3i	figs-explicit	τὴν αὐτὴν εἰκόνα	1		Here, the phrase **the same image** refers to the **image** that belongs to the **Lord**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “into his image” or “the that image” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2CO	3	18	g0ku	figs-abstractnouns	τὴν αὐτὴν εἰκόνα…ἀπὸ δόξης εἰς δόξαν	1		If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **image** and **glory**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “reflect” and an adjective such as “glorious” or “great.” Alternate translation: “people who reflect the Lord from what is glorious to what is glorious” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2CO	3	18	bx5b	figs-idiom	ἀπὸ δόξης εἰς δόξαν	1	from glory to glory	Here Paul uses the words **from** and **to** with the same word, much like he did in [2:16](../02/16.md). He could be using this form because: (1) **from** indicates the source of the transformation, and **to** indicates the effects of the transformation. Alternate translation: “by someone who has glory so that we also have glory” (2) **from** and **to** together emphasize that the transformation is characterized completely by **glory**. Alternate translation: “with great glory” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
2CO	3	18	mw3v		καθάπερ ἀπὸ	1	just as from the Lord	Here, the phrase **just as from** indicates the source of the transformation. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in a more natural way. Alternate translation: “and this is from” or “even as it is accomplished by”
2CO	3	18	wlp1		Κυρίου, Πνεύματος	1		Here, Paul could be using this phrase to: (1) identify the **Lord** as the **Spirit**, just as he did in [3:17](../03/17.md). Just as in that verse, he could mean that the **Lord** is the **Spirit**, or he could mean that the **Lord** is experienced as the **Spirit**. Alternate translation: “the Lord, that is, the Spirit” or “the Lord, whom we experience as the Spirit” (2) name the Holy Spirit as “the Spirit of the Lord,” as he did in [3:17](../03/17.md). Alternate translation: “the Spirit of the Lord” (3) refer to the **Lord** to whom the **Spirit** belongs or who sends the **Spirit**. Alternate translation: “the Lord of the Spirit”
2CO	3	18	mmdd	figs-explicit	Πνεύματος	1		Here, the word **Spirit** could refer to: (1) the Holy Spirit. Alternate translation: “God’s Spirit” (2) what is “spiritual” as opposed to what is written or fleshly. Alternate translation: “who is spiritual” or “who is a spirit” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2CO	4	intro	rx1c			0		# 2 Corinthians 4 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n4. Paul’s ministry (2:14–7:4)\n      * Ministry of Moses and ministry of Paul (3:7–4:6)\n      * Suffering and ministry (4:7–18)\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Life and death\n\nIn [4:7–14](../04/07.md), Paul refers to life, death, and resurrection. When he refers to how he and those with him experience “death” or “dying,” he is referring to how they suffer and experience things related to death. When he refers to how he and those with him experience “life” or being “raised,” he is most likely referring to how God will resurrect them. He could also be referring to how God delivers them from “death” when they suffer or are persecuted. Consider what forms you could use to refer to experiences related to death and resurrection. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/life]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/death]])\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Light and darkness\n\nIn [4:3–6](../04/03.md), Paul describes a lack of understanding and belief in the gospel as “veiling,” “blinding,” and “darkness.” He describes understanding and belief in the gospel as “shining” and “light.” These figures of speech compare believing and understanding to seeing. If possible, preserve these figures of speech, but you could express the ideas in plain language if necessary. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/light]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/darkness]])\n\n### “Outer” and “inner” man\n\nIn [4:16](../04/16.md), Paul refers to two different parts of himself and those with him: their “inner man” and their “outer man.” The “inner” and the “outer” are probably not directly related to the spiritual and physical parts of people. Rather, the “inner” is connected to what is “not seen,” and the “outer” is connected to what is “seen” (see [4:18](../04/18.md)). Consider what form you can use to refer to the parts of a person that people can observe and the parts of a person that they cannot observe. Make sure that your translation does not simply distinguish between the skin and what is under the skin. It is more important to use words that suggest that what people observe is not always what is really true about a person. \n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Exclusive “we”\n\nThroughout this chapter, Paul uses the first person plural. When he uses these words, he does not include the Corinthians unless a note specifies otherwise. He could be referring to: (1) himself and those who preach the gospel with him. (2) just himself. It is recommended that you follow the first option, but both are possible. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])\n\n### The contrasts in [4:8–12](../04/08.md).\n\nIn these verses, Paul contrasts bad things that happen to him and those with him with good things that happen to them. Paul wrote these verses as one long sentence with short clauses because this was a powerful form in his culture. Consider using a form that is powerful in your culture. The UST expresses the idea with many short sentences because this is one kind of powerful form in English.
2CO	4	1	lyi4	grammar-connect-logic-result	διὰ τοῦτο	1	Connecting Statement:	Here, the word **Therefore** introduces a conclusion based on what Paul has said, particularly what he said in [3:4–18](../03/04.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a conclusion based on what has been said.

2CO	4	1	uoxl	figs-abstractnouns	ἔχοντες τὴν διακονίαν ταύτην	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **ministry**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “minister.” Alternate translation: “being able to minister in this way” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])\n
2CO	4	1	h1ud	figs-explicit	καθὼς ἠλεήθημεν	1	and just as we have received mercy	Here, this phrase could indicate: (1) the way that Paul and those with him received the **ministry**. Alternate translation: “which we received by God’s mercy” (2) what led to Paul and those with him receiving the ministry, which was their conversions. Alternate translation: “which we received after God had mercy on us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2CO	4	1	que0	figs-abstractnouns	ἠλεήθημεν	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **mercy**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “merciful” or an adverb such as “mercifully.” Alternate translation: “God acted mercifully toward us” or “God was merciful to us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2CO	4	1	ix7n	translate-unknown	οὐκ ἐνκακοῦμεν	1	having this ministry	Here, the word **discouraged** could refer to: (1) losing motivation and confidence.

Alternate translation: “Instead of that” or “On the other hand” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
2CO	4	2	z4c2	figs-explicit	τὰ κρυπτὰ τῆς αἰσχύνης	1	the shameful hidden things	Here, the phrase **shameful hidden {things}** could refer to: (1) things that people “hide” because they are **shameful**.

Alternate translation: “anything that is shameful and hidden” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2CO	4	2	ey75	figs-metaphor	μὴ περιπατοῦντες	1	walking in craftiness	Paul speaks of behavior in life as if it were **walking in** something.

Alternate translation: “not acting” or “not behaving” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2CO	4	2	vvzc	figs-abstractnouns	ἐν πανουργίᾳ	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **craftiness**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “crafty” or an adverb such as “craftily.” Alternate translation: “craftily” or “in a crafty way” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2CO	4	2	lzn0	translate-unknown	δολοῦντες	1		Here, the word **distorting** refers to changing something so that it is different than how it started. In this case, Paul is referring to changing **the word of God** so that it is not purely what God said. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to changing something or making it less pure. Alternate translation: “perverting” or “altering” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
2CO	4	2	gcqm	figs-possession	τὸν λόγον τοῦ Θεοῦ	1		Here Paul uses the possessive form to describe a **word** that comes from **God**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in a more natural way. Alternate translation: “the word that comes from God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
2CO	4	2	gp3g	figs-metonymy	τὸν λόγον	1	not distorting the word of God	Here, the word **word** represents what someone says in words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language.

2CO	4	2	mrri	figs-possession	τῇ φανερώσει τῆς ἀληθείας	1		Here Paul uses the possessive form to describe a **manifestation** that reveals **the truth**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in a more natural way. Alternate translation: “by revealing the truth” or “by making the truth known** (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
2CO	4	2	e7y7	figs-abstractnouns	τῇ φανερώσει τῆς ἀληθείας	1		If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **manifestation** and **truth**, you could express the ideas by using a verb such as “reveal” and an adjective such as “true.” Alternate translation: “by revealing what is true” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2CO	4	2	rqin	translate-unknown	συνιστάνοντες ἑαυτοὺς	1		Here, phrase **commend ourselves** refers to the practice of stating why one should be trusted and welcomed. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to giving reasons why people should welcome and trust a person. See you how you translated the similar phrase in [3:1](../03/01.md). Alternate translation: “speaking favorably of ourselves” or “vouching for ourselves” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
2CO	4	2	aj24	figs-gendernotations	ἀνθρώπων	1	commending ourselves to every person’s conscience	Although the word **man’s** is masculine, Paul is using it to refer to any person, either man or woman. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a non-gendered word or refer to both genders. Alternate translation: “person’s” or “to man’s and woman’s” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
2CO	4	2	f6n1	figs-metaphor	ἐνώπιον τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	before God	Here, Paul refers to being **before God** to indicate a close connection to God. The phrase could indicate that: (1) God testifies or bears witness to Paul and those with him. Alternate translation: “with God testifying about us” (2) people can recognize that Paul preaches the gospel only when they are **before God** or in God’s presence. Alternate translation: “that is in God’s presence” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2CO	4	3	lu2h	grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1		Here, the word **But** introduces a development from what Paul said in the previous verse ([4:2](../04/02.md)). In this verse, he explains that, although they reveal “the truth,” it may be **veiled** to some people. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces this kind of development. Alternate translation: “Now” or “However,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
2CO	4	3	m82q	grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἰ…καὶ	1		Here Paul could be using **even if** to introduce: (1) something that he thinks really is true. Alternate translation: “even though” (2) something that he thinks might be true. Alternate translation: “supposing that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])

A **gospel** that **is veiled** is one that people do not understand or believe in. If possible, express the idea the same way you did in [3:12–18](../03/12.md). Alternate translation: “it is as if a veil hides our gospel, this happens to the ones perishing” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2CO	4	3	hz2f	figs-activepassive	εἰ…ἔστιν κεκαλυμμένον τὸ εὐαγγέλιον ἡμῶν, ἐν…ἐστὶν κεκαλυμμένον	1	if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If possible, avoid stating who does the “veiling” and instead refer to how a “veil” hides the **gospel**. Alternate translation: “if a veil covers our gospel, this happens for” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2CO	4	3	e5yu	figs-extrainfo	τοῖς ἀπολλυμένοις	1	our gospel	Christians disagree over whether God causes people to “perish” or whether people cause themselves to “perish.” The word that Paul uses here intentionally does not include the person who causes the perishing. If possible, your translation also should avoid stating who causes the “perishing.” See how you translated the similar phrase in [2:15](../02/15.md). Alternate translation: “the ones on the path to destruction” or “the ones who are not being saved” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])
2CO	4	4	m71d	figs-explicit	ὁ θεὸς τοῦ αἰῶνος τούτου	1		Here, the phrase **the god of this age** refers to Satan, or the devil. Paul describes him in this way because God has allowed Satan to have some control or power in **this age**, which refers to the world as it is right now. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “the god of this age, Satan,” or “the devil, who rules over this age” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2CO	4	4	ptb6	figs-possession	ὁ θεὸς τοῦ αἰῶνος τούτου	1		Here Paul uses the possessive form to describe a **god** who rules over or controls **this age**.

If **minds** are **blinded**, they cannot understand something. If **minds** can see **light**, they can understand something. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use simile or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “has made the minds of the unbelievers to be like blind eyes, so that they do not understand the gospel of the glory of Christ … just like blind eyes cannot see light” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2CO	4	4	squ9	grammar-connect-logic-result	ἀπίστων, εἰς τὸ	1		Here, the phrase **so that** could introduce: (1) the result of **the god of this age** blinding people’s minds.

What he means is that the **light** either is or comes from the **gospel**, and the **gospel** is about the **glory of Christ**. In this last phrase, **glory** describes what **Christ** is like. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in a more natural form. Alternate translation: “the light, which is the gospel about the glorious Christ” or “the light that comes from the gospel concerning how glorious Christ is” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
2CO	4	4	hj21	figs-abstractnouns	τῆς δόξης τοῦ Χριστοῦ	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **glory**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “glorious” or “great.” Alternate translation: “of the great Christ” or “Christ, the glorious one,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2CO	4	4	fmaq	figs-abstractnouns	ὅς ἐστιν εἰκὼν τοῦ Θεοῦ	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **image**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “reflect” or “represent.” Alternate translation: “who reflects God” or “who represents God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2CO	4	4	tx9h	figs-possession	εἰκὼν τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	the god of this world	Here Paul uses the possessive form to describe how **Christ** functions as the **image** that shows what **God** is like. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in a more natural way. Alternate translation: “the image that shows what God is like” or “the image that reflects God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
2CO	4	5	nvg2	grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1		Here, the word **For** introduces a further explanation of what Paul said about “the gospel of the glory of Christ” in [4:4](../04/04.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces further explanation, or you could leave **For** untranslated. Alternate translation: “As you can see,” or “Indeed,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
2CO	4	5	ddw1	figs-ellipsis	ἀλλὰ Ἰησοῦν Χριστὸν Κύριον, ἑαυτοὺς δὲ δούλους ὑμῶν	1	but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your servants	These two clauses leave out some words that many languages might need to be complete. If it would be helpful in your language, you could supply these words from the first half of the verse. Alternate translation: “but we proclaim the Lord Christ Jesus, and we proclaim ourselves as your servants” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
2CO	4	5	xvs8		Ἰησοῦν Χριστὸν Κύριον	1		Here, the phrase **Lord Christ Jesus** could: (1) give a title or name for Jesus. Alternate translation: “the Lord, who is Christ Jesus” (2) state that **Christ Jesus** is the **Lord**. Alternate translation: “Christ Jesus as Lord”
2CO	4	5	t8du	figs-explicit	διὰ Ἰησοῦν	1	for Jesus’ sake	Here Paul could be indicating that he and those with him are **servants** because of: (1) who Jesus is. Alternate translation: “because of who Jesus is” (2) what Jesus has done. Alternate translation: “because of what Jesus has done” (3) what Jesus wants Paul and those with him to do. Alternate translation: “because that is what Jesus wants” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2CO	4	6	nbpt	grammar-connect-logic-result	ὅτι	1		Here, the word **For** introduces the reason why Paul and those with him “do not proclaim” themselves but rather Jesus. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a reason or basis. Alternate translation: “That is because” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
2CO	4	6	fy6h	writing-quotations	ὁ Θεὸς ὁ εἰπών	1		Here Paul introduces something that God **said**. The quotation is not directly from the Old Testament. Rather Paul is probably paraphrasing [Genesis 1:3](../gen/01/03.md), and he may also be referring to [Isaiah 9:2](../isa/09/02.md). Introduce the quotation as something that God said. If it would be helpful in your language, you could include a footnote that refers to the passages that Paul may be paraphrasing. Alternate translation: “God is the one who spoke” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
2CO	4	6	rw5z	figs-quotations	εἰπών, ἐκ σκότους φῶς λάμψει	1	Light will shine out of darkness	If you do not use this form in your language, you could translate the sentence as an indirect quote instead of as a direct quote. Alternate translation: “who said that from darkness a light will shine” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
2CO	4	6	mukf	figs-abstractnouns	ἐκ σκότους	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **darkness**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “dark.” Alternate translation: “In a dark place” or “From what is dark” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2CO	4	6	d5x7	figs-metaphor	ἔλαμψεν ἐν ταῖς καρδίαις ἡμῶν, πρὸς φωτισμὸν τῆς γνώσεως	1	He has shone … to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God	Here Paul continues the light metaphor from [4:4](../04/04.md). When God **shined** in their **hearts**, that means that he caused them to understand. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a simile or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “who caused us to understand, just as if he illuminated our hearts, the knowledge” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2CO	4	6	bj1j	figs-metonymy	ἐν ταῖς καρδίαις ἡμῶν	1	in our hearts	In the Paul’s culture, **hearts** are the places where humans think and plan. What Paul means is that God has **shined** on their thoughts or on what they think. If it would be helpful in your language, you could refer to the place where humans think in your culture or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “in our minds” or “in our thoughts” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
2CO	4	6	m6rf	figs-exclusive	ταῖς καρδίαις ἡμῶν	1		Here, the word **our** could refer to: (1) just Paul and those with him. Paul is focusing on himself and those with him, but he does not mean to exclude the Corinthians entirely. Alternate translation: “the hearts of us who preach the gospel” (2) Paul and everyone who believes, including the Corinthians. Alternate translation: “the hearts of us who believe” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
2CO	4	6	fkq3	figs-possession	φωτισμὸν τῆς γνώσεως τῆς δόξης τοῦ Θεοῦ	1		Here Paul uses the possessive form multiple times in a row. What he means is that the **illumination** either is or comes from the **knowledge**, and the **knowledge** is about the **glory of God**. In this last phrase, **glory** describes what **God** is like. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in a more natural form.

He speaks in this way to indicate how unimportant or insignificant the **affliction** is compared with how important or significant the **glory** is. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea plainly.

2CO	5	intro	s14p			0		# 2 Corinthians 5 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n4. Paul’s ministry (2:14–7:4)\n      * Confidence in the resurrection (5:1–10)\n      * The gospel (5:11–6:2)\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Resurrection bodies\n\nIn [5:1–5](../05/01.md), Paul speaks about new bodies that believers will receive when Jesus comes back. Right now, he and those with him “groan” while they have their current bodies. That is because these bodies are weak and will eventually die. However, Paul and those with him do not want to just get rid of their bodies. Rather, they are looking forward expectantly to receiving new bodies that will not die. Paul expresses these ideas by using building and clothing language. See the sections below that address how this language functions. Make sure that your translation clearly contrasts old bodies with new bodies and does not suggest that Paul just wants to get rid of his body. \n\n### The intermediate state?\n\nIn [5:6–9](../05/06.md), Paul speaks about being “away from the body” and “with the Lord.” As the previous section has illustrated, Paul’s goal is to have a new body, not to be “away from the body.” So, what is he referring to here? There are three primary options. First, many Christians believe that Paul is talking about the time period between when a believer dies and when Jesus comes back. During this time period, the believer does not have a body but is with Jesus in heaven. Then, when Jesus comes back, the believer receives a new body. Second, some Christians believe that Paul is talking about how believers receive new bodies immediately after they die. In other words, the next thing that a believer experiences after he or she dies is Jesus’ return. In this case, there is no time period between death and resurrection. Third, some Christians believe that Paul is speaking about how believers receive a temporary body for the time they are in heaven with Jesus before he comes back. If possible, your translation should allow for all three of these interpretations. Make sure that you include at least option one, since this is the option that most Christians believe. \n\n### New creation\n\nIn [5:17](../05/17.md), Paul speaks about how being “in Christ” leads to “new creation,” with “old things” passing away and “new things” coming. Paul uses very general language, and the “new creation” could identify the person who is “in Christ” or everything that God is making “new.” If it is about people primarily, Paul’s point is that they are made “new” when they are in Christ. If it is about the world in general, Paul’s point is that God makes the world “new” in Christ, and people experience this “new creation” when they too are in Christ. Since Paul’s language is so general, it is best to express the idea in such a way that both of these interpretations are possible. If you must choose one, most interpreters think that Paul is focusing on people here. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/creation]])\n\n### Reconciliation\n\nIn [5:18–20](../05/18.md), Paul speaks about how God “reconciles” people to himself and gives the “ministry of reconciliation” to Paul and those with him. The word “reconcile” refers to how someone restores a relationship with someone else so that they can be together again. In other words, when someone does something that breaks or hurts a relationship, “reconciliation” heals the broken relationship. Consider how you might naturally express this idea in your language. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/reconcile]])\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Bodies as homes\n\nIn [5:1–9](../05/01.md), Paul speaks about bodies as if they were homes. He identifies current earthly bodies as “tents,” which indicates that they do not last. He identifies resurrection bodies as “buildings” that God makes. Paul uses the language of “home” to indicate that people belong in bodies and not without bodies. However, he does seem to think that people can be without bodies for a period of time, just as people can leave their homes for a period of time (see the above discussion of the “intermediate state”). Further, he contrasts “tent” homes with “building” homes to indicate that the “building” is the home (that is, body) that will last forever and which believers should long for. If possible, preserve the “home” language in your translation, either in metaphor or simile form. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/house]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/tent]])\n\n### Bodies as clothing\n\nIn [5:2–4](../05/02.md), Paul mixes “clothing” language in with his “home” language. The “clothes” are bodies, and Paul again uses this language to indicate that people belong in bodies (“clothed”), not without bodies (“naked” or “unclothed”). He does not use “clothing” language to show that bodies are an unimportant part of who people are. If possible, preserve the “clothing” language in your translation, either in metaphor or simile form. However, if how Paul mixes together “home” and “clothing” language would be confusing, you may need to use only the “home” language and express the “clothing” language plainly or as “home” language. See the notes on these verses for translation options. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/clothed]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Exclusive “we”\n\nThroughout this chapter, Paul uses the first person plural. When he uses this form, he is focusing on himself and those with him, or just on himself (although this is less likely). However, he does not necessarily mean that what he says is not true of the Corinthians or of believers in general. Consider how you can communicate the focus on Paul and those with him without totally excluding the Corinthians. In every case where Paul may be using the first person plural in a way different than this, a note will explain the options. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])\n\n### Singular nouns in general statements\n\nIn [5:1–10](../05/01.md), Paul consistently refers to “body,” “building,” “tent,” and “home” in singular form. He does this because the singular form was a natural way to refer to these things in general. Throughout this section, the UST models how to express the ideas in plural form, since this is more natural for general statements in English. Consider how your language might naturally express a general statement about “bodies.” \n\n### Translating [5:21](../05/21.md)\n\nPaul speaks in a very compressed way in this verse, and Christians disagree about what exactly he means. What is relatively clear is that Paul has in mind what some people call an “interchange” between Christ and believers. Christ, who is “righteous,” is somehow identified with “sin,” and believers, who are “sinners,” are somehow identified with “righteousness.” The “in him” at the end of the verse indicates that this “interchange” occurs in union with Christ. For details about what it could mean for Christ to be “made sin” and for believers to “become the righteousness of God,” see the notes on this verse. If possible, however, your translation should be as general as Paul’s sentence. This means that you should express the general idea of “interchange” and allow for many of the possible interpretations listed in the notes.

2CO	5	1	v03z	figs-exclusive	οἴδαμεν…ἡμῶν…ἔχομεν	1		Here and throughout this chapter, Paul uses the first person plural. See the chapter introduction for more information on how to translate these words. Here, the words **we** and **our** could refer to: (1) just Paul and those with him. Paul is focusing on himself and those with him, but he does not mean to exclude the Corinthians entirely. Alternate translation: “we who preach the gospel … our … we have” (2) Paul and everyone who believes, including the Corinthians. Alternate translation: “all of us know … our … we have” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

2CO	5	1	z4vs	figs-exmetaphor	ἡ ἐπίγειος ἡμῶν οἰκία τοῦ σκήνους καταλυθῇ, οἰκοδομὴν ἐκ Θεοῦ ἔχομεν, οἰκίαν ἀχειροποίητον αἰώνιον ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς	1	if the earthly dwelling that we live in is destroyed, we have a building from God	Here Paul speaks as if a person’s body were a **house**, **tent**, or **building** that the person lives in. This was a common way to refer to a person’s body in Paul’s culture. He identifies the current body as a **tent** that is **torn down** because this body will die. He describes the body that a person will have when God resurrects them as a **building from God** and an **eternal house** that is **not made with hands**. This is an important metaphor in [5:1–9](../05/01.md), so preserve the **house**, **tent**, and **building** language if possible. If it would be helpful, you could use a simile or identify what the **house** is in another natural way. Alternate translation: “our earthly house of this tent, that is, our mortal body, is torn down, we have a building from God, that is, our resurrection body, an eternal house in the heavens, not made with hands” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])
2CO	5	1	zy2k	figs-activepassive	ἡ ἐπίγειος ἡμῶν οἰκία τοῦ σκήνους καταλυθῇ	1	if the earthly dwelling that we live in is destroyed	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who does the action, you could use a vague or indefinite subject. Alternate translation: “someone tears down our earthly house of this tent” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2CO	5	1	bvz6	figs-possession	ἡ ἐπίγειος ἡμῶν οἰκία τοῦ σκήνους	1		Here, Paul uses the possessive form identify the **earthly house** as a **tent**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a more natural form. Alternate translation: “our earthly house, which is a tent,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
2CO	5	1	gz3c	grammar-collectivenouns	ἡ ἐπίγειος ἡμῶν οἰκία τοῦ σκήνους καταλυθῇ, οἰκοδομὴν…οἰκίαν…αἰώνιον	1		Here and throughout [5:1–8](../05/01.md), Paul uses the singular form to refer to “bodies” in general, sometimes described as buildings or clothing. See the chapter introduction for more information. Consider what would be natural in your language and use that form throughout these verses. Alternate translation: “our earthly houses of these tents are torn down … buildings … eternal houses” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns]])
2CO	5	1	xifl	figs-explicit	ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς	1		Many people in Paul’s culture believed that the space that they called “heaven” contained multiple layers or spheres of individual heavens. Here, Paul refers to how the **eternal house** can be found **in the heavens**. Since Paul does not include details about the heavens, translate **heavens** with a word or phrase that refers to all of heavenly space, including the idea of multiple heavens if possible. Alternate translation: “in the heavenly realm” or “in the heavenly spaces” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2CO	5	1	bqi5	figs-synecdoche	ἀχειροποίητον	1	It is a house not made by human hands	Here, the word **hands** refers to the main part of the body that we use to make things. So, the phrase refers to the whole person who makes things. If it would be helpful in your language, you could clarify that **hands** refers to “humans” in general, not just their hands. Alternate translation: “not made by humans” or “not made by people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
2CO	5	1	bbvr	figs-activepassive	ἀχειροποίητον	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “which hands did not make” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2CO	5	2	mt4s	grammar-connect-words-phrases	καὶ γὰρ	1		Here, the phrase **For indeed** indicates that Paul is adding more information (**indeed**) that supports what he said in the previous verse (**For**). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use words that introduce added information that supports a previous statement. Alternate translation: “Further” or “And in fact” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
2CO	5	2	tc2j	writing-pronouns	ἐν τούτῳ	1	in this tent we groan	Here, the phrase **in this** could refer to: (1) the earthly house that is a tent, that is, the person’s current body. Alternate translation: “in this tent” or “in our bodies on earth” (2) the current time period. Alternate translation: “right now” or “in this time” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
2CO	5	2	yg6y	figs-exmetaphor	ἐν τούτῳ στενάζομεν, τὸ οἰκητήριον ἡμῶν τὸ ἐξ οὐρανοῦ ἐπενδύσασθαι ἐπιποθοῦντες	1		Here Paul continues to refer to mortal bodies and resurrection bodies as “houses” or “dwellings.” You should express the idea as you did in [5:1](../05/01.md). Paul also begins to refer to receiving new, resurrection bodies as if they were clothing that people could put on. This also is an important figure of speech for the following verses, so preserve the language if possible. If it is necessary, you could use a simile or express the idea in another natural way that fits with the “building” language. Alternate translation: “in this house, that is, our mortal body, we groan, longing to completely live in our dwelling that is from heaven, that is, our resurrection body” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])
2CO	5	2	ss6g	figs-activepassive	ἐπενδύσασθαι	1	longing to be clothed with our heavenly dwelling	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who will do the action, Paul implies that “God” will do it. Alternate translation: “for God to fully clothe us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2CO	5	3	bjau	figs-exmetaphor	ἐνδυσάμενοι, οὐ γυμνοὶ εὑρεθησόμεθα	1		Here Paul continues to speak of bodies as if they were clothing. You should express the idea as you did in [5:2](../05/02.md). Alternate translation: “we have a house to live in, we will not be found homeless” or “having a new body that is like clothing, we will not be found naked, that is, without a body” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])
2CO	5	3	da0z	grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἴ γε…ἐνδυσάμενοι	1		Here Paul is speaking as if **having clothed ourselves** were a hypothetical possibility, but he means that it will actually be true. If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, and if your readers might misunderstand and think that what Paul is saying is not certain, then you could express the idea by using a word such as “when” or “whenever.” Alternate translation: “when indeed we have clothed ourselves” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
2CO	5	3	i4es		ἐνδυσάμενοι	1	we have put it on	Here Paul could mean that: (1) **we** clothe **ourselves**. Alternate translation: “we clothe ourselves” (2) God clothes “us.” Alternate translation: “God clothes us”
2CO	5	3	ap7v	figs-activepassive	οὐ…εὑρεθησόμεθα	1	we will not be found to be naked	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Paul uses the passive form to focus on the state of being **naked** rather than on who “finds” them, so you should avoid stating a subject for **found**. Alternate translation: “we will not be” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2CO	5	4	zvz8	grammar-connect-words-phrases	καὶ γὰρ	1		Here, the phrase **For indeed** indicates that Paul is adding more information (**indeed**) that supports what he said in the previous two verses (**For**). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use words that introduce added information that supports a previous statement. Alternate translation: “Further” or “And in fact” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
2CO	5	4	bz6k	figs-exmetaphor	οἱ ὄντες ἐν τῷ σκήνει…οὐ θέλομεν ἐκδύσασθαι, ἀλλ’ ἐπενδύσασθαι	1	while we are in this tent	Here Paul continues to speak of bodies as buildings and clothing. You should express the ideas as you did in [5:1–3](../05/01.md). Alternate translation: “the ones being in this tent, that is, our mortal body … we do not want to be homeless, but to have a home” or “the ones being in this tent, that is, this body … we do not want to have no body, which is like being unclothed, but to have a resurrection body, which is like being fully clothed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])
2CO	5	4	e34b	figs-metaphor	βαρούμενοι	1	in this tent, we groan	Here Paul speaks as if he and those with were carrying a heavy “burden.” He means that something is making their lives difficult. The “burden” could be: (1) how the **tent**, that is, their current bodies, fall apart and die. Alternate translation: “being distressed by it” (2) how other people situations make life hard for them. Alternate translation: “being troubled by many people and things” or “being oppressed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2CO	5	4	g9yu	figs-activepassive	βαρούμενοι	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Paul implies that either the **tent** (their mortal bodies) or other people and things did it. Make sure your translation fits with how you chose to express the metaphor in the previous note. Alternate translation: “the tent burdening us” or “many people and things burdening us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2CO	5	4	f8rb	figs-activepassive	οὐ θέλομεν ἐκδύσασθαι, ἀλλ’ ἐπενδύσασθαι	1	We do not want to be unclothed … we want to be clothed	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Paul uses the passive form to focus on the state of being **unclothed** or **clothed** rather than on whoever clothes or unclothes them, so you should avoid stating a subject for **unclothed** and **clothed**. Alternate translation: “we do not want to be naked, but to have clothes on” or “we do not want to have no clothing, but to wear clothing” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2CO	5	4	nezo	figs-ellipsis	ἀλλ’ ἐπενδύσασθαι	1		This clause leaves out some words that many languages might need to be complete.

2CO	5	4	n78p	figs-nominaladj	τὸ θνητὸν	1	to be unclothed	Paul is using the adjective **mortal** as a noun in order to refer to all bodies that are **mortal**.

2CO	5	4	uiei	translate-unknown	τὸ θνητὸν	1		Here, the word **mortal** identifies something that will die.

2CO	5	4	e5zi	figs-activepassive	καταποθῇ τὸ θνητὸν ὑπὸ τῆς ζωῆς	1	so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “life may swallow up the mortal” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2CO	5	4	de2b	figs-metaphor	καταποθῇ	1	so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life	Here Paul refers to **the mortal** as if it were food that could be **swallowed up**.

2CO	5	5	g7yj	figs-metaphor	τὸν ἀρραβῶνα τοῦ Πνεύματος	1	who gave us the Spirit as the down payment	Here, Paul is speaking of the **Spirit** as if he were a **down payment**, that is, a partial payment for a purchase with a promise to pay the rest of the amount on a future date. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. See how you translated the similar phrase in [1:22](../01/22.md). Alternate translation: “a guarantee, which is the Spirit, that he will also give us eternal life” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2CO	5	5	kyyw	figs-possession	τὸν ἀρραβῶνα τοῦ Πνεύματος	1		Here Paul uses the possessive form to the **down payment** as the **Spirit**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in a more natural way. Alternate translation: “the Spirit as a down payment” or “the down payment that is the Spirit” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
2CO	5	6	clh5	grammar-connect-logic-result	οὖν	1	Connecting Statement:	Here, the word **Therefore** introduces a conclusion or inference from what Paul has said in [5:1–6](../05/01.md).

Instead, he introduces a parenthetical statement in the following verse and then ends the sentence. At the beginning of [5:8](../05/08.md), he repeats the word that is translated **courageous** here, which indicates that he is going to resume speaking about what he started speaking about in this verse. If you can clearly indicate that Paul does not finish this sentence, you could use that form here, as the ULT does by using a dash. If your readers would find this structure confusing, you could make this verse a complete thought on its own. Alternate translation: “we are always courageous and know that being at home in the body, we are away from the Lord,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
2CO	5	6	xv3m	figs-exmetaphor	ἐνδημοῦντες ἐν τῷ σώματι, ἐκδημοῦμεν ἀπὸ τοῦ Κυρίου	1	being at home in the body	Here Paul continues to refer to the **body** as if it were a building that a person could be **at home in**.

Alternate translation: “whether being in the body as if it were a home or out of the body” or “whether being present or being absent” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])\n
2CO	5	9	j1sl	writing-pronouns	αὐτῷ	1	to be pleasing to him	Here, the word **him** refers to the “Lord” whom Paul mentioned in the previous verse, that is, Jesus.

In Paul’s culture, people expected the Messiah to sit on this kind of seat when this world ends and decide whether to reward or punish people. Paul uses this idea to refer to how Jesus will “judge” **us all**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the idea more explicit or refer more directly to how **Christ** will “judge.” Alternate translation: “before the judgment seat that Christ will sit on when he returns” or “before Christ to be judged by him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

2CO	5	10	cr07	figs-idiom	διὰ τοῦ σώματος	1		Here, the phrase **through the body** clarifies that **the {things done}** are what people did while they had mortal bodies and lived on this earth.

Alternate translation: “we persuade men also to know the fear of the Lord” (2) to realize that he and those with him are people who know **the fear of the Lord** and are thus trustworthy. Alternate translation: “we persuade men that we are those who fear the Lord” or “we persuade men that we are trustworthy” (3) to accept the gospel. Alternate translation: “we persuade men to believe the gospel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2CO	5	11	b7dd	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	δὲ	1		Here, the word **But** introduces a contrast with how they **persuade men**. In contrast with that, they do not need to persuade God, since they are already **clearly known** by him.

2CO	5	11	y5l1	figs-idiom	ἐν ταῖς συνειδήσεσιν ὑμῶν	1	that it is also clear to your conscience	Here, the word **consciences** identifies the parts of people that can identify and recognize what is right and wrong. Paul refers to the **consciences** here because he wants the Corinthians to think about whether Paul and those with him are truly trustworthy or not. If it would be helpful in your language, you could refer to the part of the person that decides what is right and wrong, or you could use plain language. Alternate translation: “in your hearts” or “by you as consider us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

2CO	5	12	it2r	figs-metonymy	ἐν καρδίᾳ	1	those who boast about appearances but not about what is in the heart	In Paul’s culture, the **heart** is the place where humans think and feel.

2CO	5	14	y3hj	translate-unknown	συνέχει	1		Here, the word **controls** refers to how something forces or directs a person to act in a certain way.

Alternate translation: “that” or “what follows:” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
2CO	5	14	nd9g	figs-nominaladj	εἷς	1	died for all	Paul is using the adjective **one** as a noun in order to refer to **Christ**, who is **one** person.

2CO	5	14	nezi	figs-metaphor	οἱ πάντες ἀπέθανον	1		Here Paul speaks as if **all died** because or when Jesus **died**. Since the following verse states that some people are still “living,” he cannot mean that every person has physically **died**. He may mean that people have **died** to sin, or that they participated in how Christ **died**, or that who they used to be **died**. Since some or all of these interpretations are possible, preserve the metaphor or express the idea in a form that could allow for several of these interpretations, such as in simile form.

2CO	5	17	khzj	grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical	εἴ	1		Here Paul uses the conditional form to show that being **in Christ** leads to being **a new creation**.

Alternate translation: “he regarded as a sinner” (2) identified Jesus with sinners and sin. Alternate translation: “he made like a sinner” (3) caused Jesus to be a sin offering.

He could mean that **we**: (1) share the **righteousness** that God gives to those who believe. Alternate translation: “we might share in the righteousness of God” (2) are declared “righteous” by God. Alternate translation: “we might be declared to have the righteousness of God” (3) become those who live “righteously.” Alternate translation: “we might act according to the righteousness of God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2CO	5	21	kmt9	figs-possession	δικαιοσύνη Θεοῦ	1	so that we might become the righteousness of God in him	Here Paul uses the possessive form to describe **righteousness** that could: (1) come from **God**. Alternate translation: “righteousness from God” (2) belong to **God**. Alternate translation: “God’s own righteousness” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
2CO	5	21	ebz2	figs-abstractnouns	ἡμεῖς γενώμεθα δικαιοσύνη Θεοῦ	1	The one who did not know sin	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **righteousness**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “righteous.” Make sure your translation fits with how you understand what **righteousness of God** means. Alternate translation: “God might make us righteous” or “we might be righteous because of what God does” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2CO	5	21	cypg	figs-metaphor	ἐν αὐτῷ	1		Here Paul uses the spatial metaphor **in him** to describe the union of believers with Christ.

2CO	6	intro	f5qu			0		# 2 Corinthians 6 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with verses 2 and 16-18, which are words from the Old Testament.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Servants\n\nPaul refers to Christians as servants of God. God calls Christians to serve him in all circumstances. Paul describes some of the difficult circumstances in which he and his companions served God.\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### Contrasts\n\nPaul uses four pairs of contrasts: righteousness versus lawlessness, light versus darkness, Christ versus Satan, and the temple of God versus idols. These contrasts show a difference between Christians and non-Christians. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/light]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/darkness]])\n\n### Light and darkness\n\nThe Bible often speaks of unrighteous people, people who do not do what pleases God, as if they were walking around in darkness. It speaks of light as if it were what enables those sinful people to become righteous, to understand what they are doing wrong and begin to obey God. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]])\n\n### Rhetorical questions\n\nPaul uses a series of rhetorical questions to teach his readers. All of these questions make essentially the same point: Christians should not intimately fellowship with those who live in sin. Paul repeats these questions for emphasis. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### Long list\n\n### Exclusive we\n\nPaul likely uses the pronoun “we” to represent at least Timothy and himself. It may also include other people.
2CO	6	1	kf1d	grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1	Connecting Statement:	Here, the word **Now** introduces a development of the ideas from the previous verses, especially from [5:20–21](../05/20.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a development, or you could leave **Now** untranslated. Alternate translation: “Further,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
2CO	6	1	tbr6	figs-explicit	συνεργοῦντες	1	Working together	Here Paul does not directly state **with** whom he is **working**. He could be implying that he works **with**: (1) God, since God is the subject of the previous sentence. Alternate translation: “working together with God” (2) the Corinthians, since they are the ones ho is “urging.” Alternate translation: “working together with you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2CO	6	1	s8db	figs-doublenegatives	καὶ, παρακαλοῦμεν μὴ εἰς κενὸν τὴν χάριν τοῦ Θεοῦ δέξασθαι ὑμᾶς	1	we also urge you not to receive the grace of God in vain	Here Paul uses two negative terms, **not** and **in vain**, to indicate a positive meaning. If your language does not use two negative words like this, you could instead use one positive term. Alternate translation: “we also urge you to receive the grace of God so that it has results” or “we also urge you to receive the grace of God so that it produces its goal” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
2CO	6	1	wdla	figs-abstractnouns	τὴν χάριν τοῦ Θεοῦ	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **gracious**, you could express the idea by using a verbal phrase such as “act kindly” or an adverb such as “graciously.” Alternate translation: “how God acts kindly” or “how God acts graciously” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2CO	6	1	pdgo	figs-idiom	εἰς κενὸν	1		Here, **in vain** identifies a cause that does not have its intended effect. In this case, receiving **the grace of God** will not lead to salvation if the Corinthians do not persevere in living as those who have received **the grace of God**. If it would be helpful in your language, you use a word or phrase that identifies a cause that does not have its intended effect. Alternate translation: “for nothing” or “to no purpose” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
2CO	6	2	ooms	grammar-connect-logic-result	γάρ	1		Here, the word **For** introduces a reason why the Corinthians should “receive the grace of God” (see [6:1](../06/01.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different word or phrase that introduces reason for an exhortation. Alternate translation: “because” or “since” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
2CO	6	2	u9kc	writing-quotations	λέγει	1	For he says	Here, the phrase **he says** introduces words that God speaks in the Scriptures. Specifically, Paul is quoting from a Greek translation of [Isaiah 49:8](../isa/49/08.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you use a form that indicates that God speaks these words that come from Isaiah. Alternate translation: “according to Isaiah the prophet God says,” or “God speaks these words through Isaiah:” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
2CO	6	2	uqu5	figs-quotations	λέγει…καιρῷ δεκτῷ ἐπήκουσά σου, καὶ ἐν ἡμέρᾳ σωτηρίας ἐβοήθησά σοι.	1		If you do not use this form in your language, you could translate the sentence as an indirect quote instead of as a direct quote. Alternate translation: “he says that at an acceptable time he listened to you, and in a day of salvation he helped you.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
2CO	6	2	pp3i	figs-parallelism	καιρῷ δεκτῷ ἐπήκουσά σου, καὶ ἐν ἡμέρᾳ σωτηρίας ἐβοήθησά σοι. ἰδοὺ, νῦν καιρὸς εὐπρόσδεκτος; ἰδοὺ, νῦν ἡμέρα σωτηρίας	1		The two clauses in the quotation mean basically the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if the repetition might be confusing, you could connect the phrases with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Make sure that you use the same form for Paul’s interpretation of the quotation, which is also in parallel form. Alternate translation: “At an acceptable time I listened to you; yes, in a day of salvation I helped you. Behold, now is a favorable time; yes, now is a day of salvation” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
2CO	6	2	kilf	figs-idiom	καιρῷ δεκτῷ	1		Here, the phrase **an acceptable time** refers to a point in time that someone considers to proper or appropriate for doing something. Paul could be implying that this **time** is **acceptable** to: (1) God. Alternate translation: “At a time that I considered right” or “At a time appropriate for me” (2) people. Alternate translation: “At a time that people considered right” or “At a time appropriate for people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
2CO	6	2	iz3h	figs-explicit	ἐπήκουσά σου	1		Here, the word **listened** indicates that God both listened and responded. If it would be helpful in your language, you could clarify that God did not just “listen” but also acted in response. Alternate translation: “I answered you” or “I listened to you and responded” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2CO	6	2	be7i	figs-yousingular	σου…σοι	1		Because God is speaking to one person, his special servant, **you** in the quotation is singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
2CO	6	2	z6w6	figs-idiom	ἐν ἡμέρᾳ σωτηρίας	1		Here, the phrase **day of salvation** refers to the time when God will bring **salvation** for his people. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a more natural form for this idea. Alternate translation: “in the time of salvation” or “at the time when I gave salvation” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
2CO	6	2	qrdt	figs-abstractnouns	σωτηρίας	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **salvation**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “save.” Alternate translation: “when I saved” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2CO	6	2	sa94	figs-exclamations	ἰδοὺ, νῦν	-1	Look	Here, the words **Behold** and **Look** draw the attention of the audience and ask them to listen carefully. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea with words or phrases that ask the audience to listen, or you could use another form that draws the audience’s attention to the statements that follow. Alternate translation: “Pay attention! Now … Pay attention! Now” or “Listen, now … Now” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations]])
2CO	6	2	j4k4		καιρὸς εὐπρόσδεκτος…ἡμέρα σωτηρίας	1		Here, the phrases **a day of salvation** and **a favorable time** repeat the words from the quotation exactly, except Paul uses a word that emphasizes that the **time** is good (**favorable**) instead of just appropriate (**acceptable**). Use the form that you used in the quotation, although if possible use a word for “good” **time** instead of just **acceptable time**. Alternate translation: “is a time that God considers good … is a time of salvation” or “is a time appropriate for God … is a time when God gives salvation”
2CO	6	3	v3wc	figs-metaphor	μηδεμίαν ἐν μηδενὶ διδόντες προσκοπήν	1	We do not place a stumbling block in front of anyone	Paul speaks of anything that would prevent a person from trusting in Christ as if it were a physical object over which that person trips and falls. Alternate translation: “we do not want to do anything that will prevent people from believing our message” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2CO	6	3	he3c	figs-activepassive	μὴ μωμηθῇ ἡ διακονία	1	our ministry might not	The word **discredited** refers to people speaking badly about Paul’s ministry, and working against the message he proclaims. If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “no oner will be able to speak badly about our ministry” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2CO	6	4	xd9l	figs-exclusive	συνιστάντες	1	General Information:	When Paul uses **we** here, he is referring to himself and Timothy. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
2CO	6	4	p9up		ἐν παντὶ συνιστάντες ἑαυτοὺς ὡς Θεοῦ διάκονοι	1	we commend ourselves in everything as God’s servants	Alternate translation: “we prove that we are God’s servants by all that we do”

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

2CO	6	8	e4pf	figs-activepassive	ὡς πλάνοι	1	as imposters	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

But in this letter “boasting” means confidently exulting or rejoicing.<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Metaphor<br><br>In verses 3-6, Paul uses many metaphors from war.

2CO	11	intro	abce			0		# 2 Corinthians 11 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>In this chapter, Paul continues defending his authority.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### False teaching<br><br>The Corinthians were quick to accept false teachers. They taught things about Jesus and the gospel that were different and not true. Unlike these false teachers, Paul sacrificially served the Corinthians. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/goodnews]])<br><br>### Light<br><br>Light is commonly used in the New Testament as a metaphor. Paul here uses light to indicate the revealing of God and his righteousness. Darkness describes sin. Sin seeks to remain hidden from God. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/light]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/darkness]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Metaphor<br><br>Paul begins this chapter with an extended metaphor. He compares himself to the father of a bride who is giving a pure, virgin bride to her bridegroom. Wedding practices change depending on the cultural background. But the idea of helping to present someone as a grown and holy child is explicitly pictured in this passage. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/holy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])<br><br>### Irony<br><br>This chapter is full of irony. Paul is hoping to shame the Corinthian believers with his irony.<br><br>“You tolerate these things well enough!” Paul thinks that they should not tolerate the way the false apostles treated them. Paul does not think they are really apostles at all.<br><br>The statement, “For you gladly put up with fools. You are wise yourselves!” means that the Corinthian believers think they were very wise but Paul does not agree.<br><br>“I will say to our shame that we were too weak to do that.” Paul is speaking about behavior he thinks is very wrong in order to avoid it. He is speaking as if he thinks he is wrong for not doing it. He uses a rhetorical question also as irony. “Did I sin by humbling myself so you might be exalted?” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/apostle]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])<br><br>### Rhetorical questions<br><br>In refuting the false apostles claiming to be superior, Paul uses a series of rhetorical questions. Each question is coupled with an answer: “Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they descendants of Abraham? So am I. Are they servants of Christ? (I speak as though I were out of my mind.) I am more.”<br><br>He also uses a series of rhetorical questions to empathize with his converts: “Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who has caused another to fall into sin, and I do not burn within?”<br><br>### “Are they servants of Christ?”<br><br>This is sarcasm, a special type of irony used to mock or insult. Paul does not believe these false teachers actually serve Christ, only that they pretend to do so.<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Paradox<br><br>A “paradox” is a true statement that appears to describe something impossible. This sentence in verse 30 is a paradox: “If I must boast, I will boast about what shows my weaknesses.” Paul does not explain why he would boast in his weakness until 2 Corinthians 12:9.

2CO	12	intro	abcf			0		# 2 Corinthians 12 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Paul continues defending his authority in this chapter.<br><br>When Paul was with the Corinthians, he proved himself to be an apostle by his powerful deeds. He had not ever taken anything from them. Now that he is coming for the third time, he will still not take anything. He hopes that when he visits, he will not need to be harsh with them. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/apostle]])<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Paul’s vision<br><br>Paul now defends his authority by telling about a wonderful vision of heaven. Although he speaks in the third person in verses 2-5, verse 7 indicates that he was the person who experienced the vision. It was so great, God gave him a physical handicap to keep him humble. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/heaven]])<br><br>### Third heaven<br><br>Many scholars believe the “third” heaven is the dwelling place of God. This is because Scripture also uses “heaven” to refer to the sky (the “first” heaven) and the universe (the “second” heaven).<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Rhetorical questions<br><br>Paul uses many rhetorical questions as he defends himself against his enemies who accused him: “For how were you less important than the rest of the churches, except that I was not a burden to you?” “Did Titus take advantage of you? Did we not walk in the same way? Did we not walk in the same steps?” and “Do you think all of this time we have been defending ourselves to you?” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])<br><br>### Sarcasm<br><br>Paul uses sarcasm, a special type of irony, when he reminds them how he had helped them at no cost. He says, “Forgive me for this wrong!” He also uses regular irony when he says: “But, since I am so crafty, I am the one who caught you by deceit.” He uses it to introduce his defense against this accusation by showing how impossible it was to be true. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Paradox<br><br>A “paradox” is a true statement that appears to describe something impossible. This sentence in verse 5 is a paradox: “I will not boast, except about my weaknesses.” Most people do not boast about being weak. This sentence in verse 10 is also a paradox: “For whenever I am weak, then I am strong.” In verse 9, Paul explains why both of these statements are true. ([2 Corinthians 12:5](../12/05.md))

2CO	12	9	g8mi	figs-metaphor	ἐπισκηνώσῃ ἐπ’ ἐμὲ ἡ δύναμις τοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	the power of Christ might reside on me	Paul speaks of the **power of Christ** as if it were a tent built over him.

2CO	13	intro	abcg			0		# 2 Corinthians 13 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>In this chapter, Paul finishes defending his authority. He then concludes the letter with a final greeting and blessing.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Preparation<br><br>Paul instructs the Corinthians as he prepares to visit them. He is hoping to avoid needing to discipline anyone in the church so he can visit them joyfully. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/disciple]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Power and weakness<br><br>Paul repeatedly uses the contrasting words “power” and “weakness” in this chapter. The translator should use words that are understood to be opposites of each other.<br><br>### “Examine yourselves to see if you are in the faith. Test yourselves.”<br><br>Scholars are divided over what these sentences mean. Some scholars say that Christians are to test themselves to see whether their actions align with their Christian faith. The context favors this understanding. Others say these sentences mean that Christians should look at their actions and question whether they are genuinely saved.
