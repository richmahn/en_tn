JHN	front	intro	t6za			0		# Introduction to the Gospel of John<br><br>## Part 1: General Introduction<br><br>### Outline of the Gospel of John<br><br>1. Introduction about who Jesus is (1:1–18)<br>2. Jesus is baptized, and he chooses twelve disciples (1:19–51)<br>3. Jesus preaches, teaches, and heals people (2–11)<br>4. The seven days before Jesus’ death (12–19)<br>    *   Mary anoints the feet of Jesus (12:1–11)<br>    *   Jesus rides a donkey into Jerusalem (12:12–19)<br>    *   Some Greek men want to see Jesus (12:20–36)<br>    *   The Jewish leaders reject Jesus (12:37–50)<br>    *   Jesus teaches his disciples (13–17)<br>    *   Jesus is arrested and undergoes trial (18:1–19:15)<br>    *   Jesus is crucified and buried (19:16–42)<br>5. Jesus rises from the dead (20:1–29)<br>6. John says why he wrote his gospel (20:30–31)<br>7. Jesus meets with the disciples (21)<br><br>### What is the Gospel of John about?<br><br>The Gospel of John is one of four books in the New Testament that describe some of the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. These books are called “Gospels,” which means “good news.” Their authors wrote about different aspects of who Jesus was and what he did. John said that he wrote his Gospel “so that people might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God” (20:31). John’s Gospel repeatedly emphasizes that Jesus is God in human form.<br><br>John’s Gospel is very different from the other three Gospels. John does not include some of the teachings and events that the other writers included in their Gospels. Also, John wrote about some teachings and events that are not in the other Gospels.<br><br>John wrote much about the miraculous signs Jesus did to prove that what Jesus said about himself was true. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sign]])<br><br>### How should the title of this book be translated?<br><br>Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “The Gospel of John” or “The Gospel According to John.” Or they may choose a title that may be clearer, such as, “The Good News About Jesus That John Wrote.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])<br><br>### Who wrote the Gospel of John?<br><br>This book does not give the name of the author. However, since early Christian times, most Christians have thought that the Apostle John was the author. Further evidence that the Apostle John wrote this Gospel is the fact that his name does not occur once within it. Instead, this Gospel contains the phrase “the disciple whom Jesus loved” in places where the other Gospels indicate that John was involved. The Apostle John most likely referred to himself in this manner because he wanted to humbly testify to his close relationship with Jesus as part of Jesus’ inner circle of disciples who became the “pillars” of the early church (Galatians 2:9).<br><br>## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts<br><br>### Why does John write so much about the final week of Jesus’ life?<br><br>John wrote much about Jesus’ final week. He wanted his readers to think deeply about Jesus’ final week and his death on the cross. He wanted people to understand that Jesus willingly died on the cross so that God could forgive them for sinning against him. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])<br><br>## Part 3: Important Translation Issues<br><br>### What do the words “remain,” “reside,” and “abide” mean in the Gospel of John?<br><br>John often used the words “remain,” “reside”, and “abide” as metaphors. John spoke of a believer becoming more faithful to Jesus and knowing Jesus better as if Jesus’ word “remained” in the believer. John also spoke of someone being spiritually joined to someone else as if the person “remained” in the other person. Christians are said to “remain” in Christ and in God. The Father is said to “remain” in the Son, and the Son is said to “remain” in the Father. The Son is said to “remain” in believers. The Holy Spirit is also said to “remain” in the believers.<br><br>Many translators will find it impossible to represent these ideas in their languages in exactly the same way. For example, Jesus intended to express the idea of the Christian being spiritually together with him when he said, “He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me, and I in him” (John 6:56). The UST uses the idea of “will be joined to me, and I will be joined to him.” But translators may have to find other ways of expressing the idea.<br><br>In the passage, “If my words remain in you” (John 15:7), the UST expresses this idea as, “If you live by my message.” Translators may find it possible to use this translation as a model.<br><br>### What are the major issues in the text of the Gospel of John?<br><br>The following verses found in older versions of the Bible but are not included in most modern versions. Translators are advised not to translate these verses. However, if in the translators’ region, there are older versions of the Bible that include these verses, the translators can include them. If they are translated, they should be put inside square brackets (\[\]) to indicate that they were probably not original to John’s Gospel.<br><br>*   “waiting for the moving of the water. For an angel of the Lord occasionally went down into the pool and stirred the water and whoever went first after the stirring of the water, was made well from the disease they had.” (5:3-4)<br>*   “going through the midst of them, and so passed by” (8:59)<br><br>The following passage is included in most older and modern versions of the Bible. But it is not in the earliest copies of the Bible. Translators are advised to translate this passage. It should be put inside of square brackets (\[\]) to indicate that it may not have been original to John’s Gospel.<br><br>*   The story of the adulterous woman (7:53-8:11)<br><br>(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
JHN	1	intro	k29b			0		# John 1 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in [1:23](../01/23.md), which are words from the Old Testament.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### “The Word”<br><br>John uses the phrase “the Word” to refer to Jesus ([1:1, 14](../01/01.md)). John is saying that God’s most important message to all people is actually Jesus, a person with a physical body. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/wordofgod]])<br><br>### Light and Darkness<br><br>The Bible often speaks of unrighteous people, people who do not do what pleases God, as if they were walking around in darkness. It speaks of light as if it were what enables those sinful people to become righteous, to understand what they are doing wrong and begin to obey God. In [1:4–9](../01/04.md), John uses an extended metaphor in which light represents what is true and good and darkness represents what is false and evil. John applies that light metaphor to Jesus in order to show that Jesus is the embodiment of God’s truth and goodness. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]])<br><br>### “Children of God”<br><br>People are sometimes described as “children of God” because God created them. However, John uses this expression in a different sense in this chapter. He uses it to describe people who have entered into a father-child relationship with God by putting their faith and trust in Jesus. God indeed created all people, but people can only become children of God in this sense by believing in Jesus. "Children" in this usage does not refer to those who are young, but only to the relationship that people have at any age to their father. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/believe]])<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Metaphors<br><br>John uses the metaphors of light and darkness and of “the Word” to tell the reader that he will be writing more about good and evil and about what God wants to tell people through Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### “In the beginning”<br><br>Some languages and cultures speak of the world as if it has always existed, as if it had no beginning. But “very long ago” is different from “in the beginning,” and you need to be sure that your translation communicates correctly.<br><br>### “Son of Man”<br><br>Jesus refers to himself as the “Son of Man” in this chapter ([1:51](../01/51.md)). Your language may not allow people to speak of themselves as if they were speaking about someone else. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sonofman]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

JHN	1	14	fais	figs-exclusive	ἡμῖν, καὶ ἐθεασάμεθα	1		Here the pronouns **us** and **we** are exclusive, since John is speaking on behalf of himself and the other eyewitnesses to the earthly life of Jesus, but the people to whom he is writing did not see Jesus.

JHN	1	14	x8l3	figs-explicit	μονογενοῦς παρὰ πατρός	1		The phrase **the One and Only** refers to Jesus. If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “of the One and Only from the Father, Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

JHN	1	14	tg4m	figs-metaphor	πλήρης χάριτος καὶ ἀληθείας	1	full of grace	Here, John uses **full of** figuratively to describe Jesus fully possessing a quality, as if grace and truth are objects that could fill a person.

JHN	1	14	c3b4	figs-abstractnouns	πλήρης χάριτος καὶ ἀληθείας	1		If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate the abstract nouns **grace** and **truth** with equivalent expressions.

JHN	1	15	xduu		Ἰωάννης μαρτυρεῖ περὶ αὐτοῦ	1		To call attention to a development in the story, John uses the present tense in past narration. If it would not be natural to do that in your language, you can use the past tense in your translation. Alternate translation: “John testified about him”

JHN	1	15	k7rm		ὁ ὀπίσω μου ἐρχόμενος	1	He who comes after me	Here, John is speaking about Jesus.

JHN	1	15	q75h		ἔμπροσθέν μου γέγονεν	1	is greater than I am	Here, **greater** refers to being more important or having having a superior position. Alternate translation: “is more important than I am” or “is superior to me”
JHN	1	15	lrd7		ὅτι πρῶτός μου ἦν	1	for he was before me	Here, **before me** means that Jesus existed earlier in time than John. This does not mean that Jesus is more important because he is older than John in human years. Jesus is greater and more important than John because he is God the Son, who has always existed. Alternate translation: “for he existed before I was born”
JHN	1	16	punh	grammar-connect-logic-result	ὅτι	1		Here, John is using the word **For** to introduce the reason why he said that Jesus is “full of grace and truth” in verse [14](../01/14.md).

JHN	1	16	p3zg	figs-abstractnouns	 τοῦ πληρώματος αὐτοῦ	1	fullness	Here, **fullness** refers to the grace and truth which John said Jesus was full of in verse [14](../01/14.md). If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate the abstract noun **fullness** with an equivalent expression that says this explicitly. Alternate translation: “what he is full of” or “his full amount of grace and truth” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
JHN	1	16	vmyz	figs-exclusive	ἡμεῖς πάντες 	1		Here, **we** refers to John and all believers. If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “all of we believers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

JHN	1	16	b9r1	figs-abstractnouns	χάριν ἀντὶ χάριτος	1	grace after grace	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate both occurrences of the abstract noun **grace** here with equivalent expressions.

JHN	1	16	avst		χάριν ἀντὶ χάριτος	1		Here, **after** could mean: (1) the second “grace” replaces the first “grace,” which is the most common use for this word. This meaning could indicate that the first “grace” refers to “the law” and the second “grace” refers to “Grace and truth” in the next verse. Alternate translation: “grace in place of grace” or “grace instead of grace” (2) the second “grace” is in addition to the first “grace.” Alternate translation: “grace in addition to” or “grace upon grace”
JHN	1	17	iata	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	ὁ νόμος διὰ Μωϋσέως ἐδόθη, ἡ χάρις καὶ ἡ ἀλήθεια διὰ Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ ἐγένετο	1		John placed the two sentences in this verse next to each other without any connecting word in order to show a contrast between the law of Moses and the grace and truth of Jesus. This does not mean that the law of Moses did not have grace and truth. Rather, John is indicating that the grace and truth revealed by Jesus is more complete than that revealed in the law of Moses. Although God revealed himself and his will through the law of Moses, he did so much more clearly though Jesus, who is God in human form. Alternate translation: “the law was given through Moses. But grace and truth came about through Jesus Christ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
JHN	1	17	xsbj	figs-activepassive	ὁ νόμος διὰ Μωϋσέως ἐδόθη	1		If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form and indicate who did the action. Alternate translation: “God gave the law through Moses” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

Alternate translation: “the Unique God” (2) Jesus being the only child of his Father. Alternate translation: “the Only Begotten God”
JHN	1	18	r1la		 μονογενὴς Θεὸς	1		Here, **God** indicates that Jesus, who is called **the One and Only**, is God. If it would be clearer to you readers, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “the One and Only, who is God”

If it would be clearer to your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “of John the Baptist” or “of John the Immerser” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JHN	1	19	e1dz	figs-synecdoche	ἀπέστειλαν οἱ Ἰουδαῖοι ἐξ Ἱεροσολύμων	1	the Jews sent … to him from Jerusalem	Here, **the Jews** refers to the “Jewish leaders.” Alternate translation: “the Jewish leaders sent … from Jerusalem” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
JHN	1	20	b7zz		ὡμολόγησεν καὶ οὐκ ἠρνήσατο, καὶ ὡμολόγησεν	1	He confessed—he did not deny, but confessed	The phrase “he confessed” says in positive terms the same thing that **he did not deny** says in negative terms. This emphasizes that John was telling the truth and was strongly stating that he was not the Christ. Your language may have a different way of doing this. Alternate translation: “he strongly confessed” or “he solemnly testified”
JHN	1	21	f926	writing-pronouns	ἠρώτησαν	1		Here, **they** refers to “the Jews” mentioned in the previous verse. If this would be clearer in your language, you could say it explicitly. Alternate translation: “the Jews asked” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])

JHN	1	21	h2dv		καὶ λέγει	1		To call attention to a development in the story, John uses the present tense in past narration. If it would not be natural to do that in your language, you can use the past tense in your translation. Alternate translation: “And he said”
JHN	1	21	nhx9	figs-explicit	ὁ προφήτης	1		Here, **the prophet** refers to a prophet the Jews were waiting for, based on God's promise to send a prophet like Moses which is recorded in Deuteronomy 18:15.

JHN	1	22	wbd9	figs-ellipsis	τίς εἶ? ἵνα ἀπόκρισιν δῶμεν τοῖς πέμψασιν ἡμᾶς; τί	1		John is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages in order to be complete. These words can be supplied from the context and may require you to change the punctuation of the sentences. Alternate translation: “Who are you? Tell us so that we might given an answer to those who sent us. What” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
JHN	1	22	x8wz	figs-exclusive	δῶμεν…ἡμᾶς	1	we may give … us	Here, **we** and **us** refer to the priests and Levites, not to John. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
JHN	1	22	fmc8		ἵνα ἀπόκρισιν δῶμεν	1		Alternate translation: “so that we might tell your answer”
JHN	1	22	sa3t	figs-explicit	τοῖς πέμψασιν ἡμᾶς	1	they said to him	This phrase refers to the Jewish leaders in Jerusalem. If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this explicitly.

John is quoting from the book of Isaiah, and Isaiah is quoting the words of the person calling out in the wilderness. It would be best to indicate that by punctuating this material as a second-level quotation, since Luke is quoting from Scripture. However, if your language does not put one direct quotation within another, you could translate this material as an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: “I am a voice crying out in the wilderness to make the way of the Lord straight” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
JHN	1	23	iry1	figs-metaphor	εὐθύνατε τὴν ὁδὸν Κυρίου	1	Make the way of the Lord straight	This is a figurative way of telling people to get ready to listen to the Lord’s message when it comes.

These words are a metaphor for the most unpleasant work of a servant. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this plainly. Alternate translation: “me. I am not even worthy to untie the strap of his sandal” or “me, whom I am not worthy to serve in even the most unpleasant way” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JHN	1	28	r4ty	writing-background		0	General Information:	Verse 28 tells us background information about the setting of the story recorded in [1:19-27](../01/19.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])

JHN	2	intro	jav2			0		# John 2 General Notes<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Wine<br><br>The Jews drank wine at many meals and especially when they were celebrating special events. They did not believe that it was a sin to drink wine.<br><br>### Driving out the money changers<br><br>Jesus drove the money changers out of the temple to show that he had authority over the temple and over all of Israel. As the Son of God, it was his Father’s temple that was being used inappropriately for making money. Therefore, he had the authority to drive out those who were misusing the temple.<br><br>### “He knew what was in man”<br><br>Jesus knew what other people were thinking only because he was and is the Son of Man and the Son of God. As the Son of God, he had supernatural insight into what other people were thinking and could correctly judge their intentions.<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### “His disciples remembered”<br><br>John used this phrase to stop telling the main historical narrative and to tell about something that happened much later. It was right after he scolded the sellers in the temple in ([John 2:16](../../jhn/02/16.md)) that the Jewish authorities spoke to him. It was after Jesus became alive again that his disciples remembered what the prophet had written long before and that Jesus was talking about the temple of his body ([John 2:17](../../jhn/02/17.md) and [John 2:22](../../jhn/02/22.md)).

Alternate translation: “two days after Jesus called Philip and Nathaniel” (2) the day after Jesus called Philip and Nathaniel to follow him in [1:43](../01/43.md). In this case, the first day would have occurred in [1:35](../01/35.md) and the second day in [1:43](../01/43.md).

Jesus is stating a hypothetical situation in which the event in the second clause would happen if the event in the first clause took place. In this case, Jesus would certainly **raise** the **temple** up if the Jewish authorities were to **destroy** it.

JHN	2	20	qb4x	figs-rquestion	σὺ ἐν τρισὶν ἡμέραις ἐγερεῖς αὐτόν?	1		Here, the Jewish leaders are using the question form for emphasis. They think that Jesus wants to tear down the temple and rebuild it in three days. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “you cannot possibly rebuild it in three days!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
JHN	2	21	g6jx	writing-endofstory		0	General Information:	Verses 21 and 22 are a comment John made about the story that was described in [2:13–20](../02/13.md). These verses tell about something that happened later. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-endofstory]])

Alternate translation: “this statement about his body … the word about his body that Jesus had spoken” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JHN	2	22	gq2w	figs-genericnoun	τῇ Γραφῇ	1	believed	Here, John is speaking of **the Scripture** in general, not of one particular book within the Bible. Alternate translation, as in the UST: “the scriptures” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])

JHN	2	23	ipd6	grammar-connect-logic-result	θεωροῦντες αὐτοῦ τὰ σημεῖα	1		Here, **seeing** indicates the reason why the people were believing in Jesus. These people had a superficial faith, only believing in Jesus because of the miracles he performed. If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this explicitly.

JHN	2	24	cm49		οὐκ ἐπίστευεν αὑτὸν αὐτοῖς	1		Although many people were believing in him, Jesus knew that their belief was superficial and only lasted as long as he performed miracles for them.

If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “what people think” or “the thoughts and desires people have” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JHN	3	intro	i7a7			0		# John 3 General Notes<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Light and Darkness<br><br>The Bible often speaks of unrighteous people, people who do not do what pleases God, as if they were walking around in darkness. It speaks of light as if it were what enables those sinful people to become righteous, to understand what they are doing wrong, and to begin to obey God. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]])<br><br>### Born again<br><br>A major idea in this chapter is the spiritual new birth that Jesus says is necessary in order for someone to enter the kingdom of God [3:3–8](../03/03.md). Jesus also uses the following expressions to refer to being born again: “born from water and the Spirit” ([3:4](../03/05.md)) and “born from the Spirit” ([3:6, 8](../03/06.md)). (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/bornagain]])<br><br>## Possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### “Son of Man”<br><br>Jesus refers to himself as the “Son of Man” in this chapter ([John 3:13](../../jhn/03/13.md)).

JHN	3	3	svpx	figs-metaphor	γεννηθῇ ἄνωθεν	1		The phrase **born again** is a metaphor that refers to spiritual rebirth. (See the discussion of this expression in the General Notes to this chapter.)

In this case, Jesus’ words would be understood as a reference to Ezekiel 36:25–27, which Nicodemus would have been familiar with.

Alternate translation: “would be born physically and spiritually” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

JHN	3	6	gswx	figs-activepassive	τὸ γεγεννημένον ἐκ τῆς σαρκὸς	1		If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this in an active form. Alternate translation: “What flesh has given birth to” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
JHN	3	6	rru5	figs-metonymy	τῆς σαρκὸς, σάρξ ἐστιν	1		Here, Jesus is describing human beings figuratively by reference to something associated with them, the **flesh** they are made of. The word **flesh** here does not refer to sinful human nature as it does in other verses in the New Testament. Alternate translation: “a human being is a human being” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
JHN	3	6	v3g8	figs-explicit	τὸ γεγεννημένον ἐκ τοῦ Πνεύματος	1		Here, **the Spirit** refers to the Holy Spirit, who enables people to be born again.

JHN	3	8	p87y	figs-metaphor	τὸ πνεῦμα ὅπου θέλει, πνεῖ	1	The wind blows wherever it wishes	The word translated **wind** can also mean spirit. Jesus here speaks figuratively of the Holy Spirit, as if he is **wind**. Just like people in Jesus’ time could not understand how the **wind** blew but could observe the effects of the wind, people cannot understand how the Holy Spirit works but can witness the effects of his work. If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this as a simile. Alternate translation: “The Holy Spirit is like the wind that blows wherever it wants” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JHN	3	8	mxjc		οὕτως ἐστὶν	1		This phrase connects this sentence with the previous sentence.

Alternate translation: “How are these things possible” (2) a rhetorical question Nicodemus uses to add emphasis to the statement. Alternate translation: “These things cannot be!” or “These things are impossible!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
JHN	3	9	phe2	writing-pronouns	ταῦτα	1		Here, **these things** refers to all that Jesus had spoken in [3:3–8](../03/03.md). If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this explicitly.

Jesus is not asking Nicodemus a question in order to get information. He is using the question form for emphasis. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “You are a teacher of Israel, so I am surprised you do not understand these things!” or “You are a teacher of Israel, so you should understand these things!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
JHN	3	10	gbu5	figs-you	σὺ εἶ ὁ διδάσκαλος…οὐ γινώσκεις	1	Are you a teacher … yet you do not understand	The word **you** is singular and refers to Nicodemus.

Jesus used these pronouns as a contrast to Nicodemus saying **we** in [3:2](../03/02.md). While Nicodemus used **we** to refer to him and the other Jewish religious leaders, Jesus could have been referring to: (1) himself and his disciples. Alternate translation, as in the UST: “my disciples and I speak what we know … our testimony” (2) himself and the other members of the Godhead. Alternate translation: “the Father, Spirit, and I speak what we know … our testimony” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

JHN	3	12	y4e9	grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἰ τὰ ἐπίγεια εἶπον ὑμῖν	1	Connecting Statement:	John records Jesus speaking as if this were a hypothetical possibility, but he means that it is actually true. If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, and if your readers might misunderstand and think that what Jesus is saying is not certain, then you can translate his words as an affirmative statement. Alternate translation: “Since I told you earthly things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
JHN	3	12	pt4x	figs-you	εἶπον ὑμῖν…οὐ πιστεύετε, πῶς ἐὰν εἴπω ὑμῖν…πιστεύσετε	1	I told you … you do not believe … how will you believe if I tell you	Throughout this verse, **you** is plural and could refer to: (1) the Jewish people in general.

JHN	3	12	c6ia	figs-rquestion	πῶς ἐὰν εἴπω ὑμῖν τὰ ἐπουράνια, πιστεύσετε?	1	how will you believe if I tell you about heavenly things?	Here, Jesus uses a question to emphasize the disbelief of Nicodemus and the Jews. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “you certainly will not believe if I tell you about heavenly things!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
JHN	3	12	dfqi	figs-explicit	τὰ ἐπουράνια	1		Here, **heavenly things** refers to things that take place in heaven or are related to heaven.

John assumes that his readers will know that Jesus is referring to a story recorded in the Old Testament book of Numbers. In that story, the Israelites complained against God and God punished them by sending poisonous snakes to kill them. God then told Moses to make a bronze snake and raise it up on a pole so that whoever was bitten by one of the poisonous snakes and looked at the bronze snake would not die. You could indicate this explicitly if it would be helpful to your readers, particularly if they would not know the story. Alternate translation: “And just as Moses lifted up the bronze serpent on a pole when the Israelites were wandering in the wilderness” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])<br>
JHN	3	14	f9yi	figs-activepassive	ὑψωθῆναι δεῖ τὸν Υἱὸν τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου	1	in the wilderness	If it would be clearer in your language, you could state this in an active form and you could indicate who will do the action.

JHN	4	intro	j1hv			0		# John 4 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>John 4:4-38 forms one story centered on the teaching of Jesus as the “living water” who gives eternal life to all who believe in him. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/believe]])<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### “It was necessary for him to pass through Samaria”<br><br>Jews avoided traveling through the region of Samaria because Jews and Samaritans were longtime enemies who hated each other. So Jesus did what most Jews did not want to do. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/samaria]])<br><br>### “The hour is coming”<br><br>Jesus used these words to begin prophecies about times that could be shorter or longer than sixty minutes. For example, “The hour” in which true worshipers will worship in spirit and truth is longer than sixty minutes.<br><br>### The proper place of worship<br><br>Long before Jesus lived, the Samaritan people had broken the law of Moses by setting up their own temple in their land ([John 4:20](../../jhn/04/20.md)). Jesus explained to the woman that it was no longer important where people worshiped ([John 4:21-24](./21.md)).<br><br>### Harvest<br><br>Harvest is when people go out to get the food they have planted so they can bring it to their houses and eat it. Jesus used this as a metaphor to teach his followers that they need to go and tell other people about Jesus so those people can be part of God’s kingdom. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]])<br><br>### “The Samaritan woman”<br><br>John probably told this story to show the difference between the Samaritan woman, who believed, and the Jews, who did not believe and later killed Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/believe]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### “In spirit and truth”<br><br>The people who truly know who God is and enjoy worshiping him and love him for who he is are the ones who truly please him. Where they worship is not important.

JHN	5	intro	qe17			0		# John 5 General Notes<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Healing water<br><br>Many of the Jews believed that God would heal people who got into some of the pools in Jerusalem when the waters were “stirred up.”<br><br>### Testimony<br><br>Testimony is what one person says about another person. What a person says about himself is not as important as what other people say about that person. Jesus told the Jews that God had told them who Jesus was, so he did not need to tell them who he was. This was because God had told the writers of the Old Testament what his Messiah would do, and Jesus had done everything they had written that he would do.<br><br>### The resurrection of life and the resurrection of judgment<br><br>God will make some people alive again and because he gives them his grace, they will live with him forever. But he will make some people alive again and because he will treat them justly, they will live apart from him forever.<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### The Son, the Son of God, and the Son of Man<br><br>Jesus refers to himself in this chapter as the “Son” ([John 5:19](../../jhn/05/19.md)), the “Son of God” ([John 5:25](../../jhn/05/25.md)), and the “Son of Man” ([John 5:27](../../jhn/05/27.md)).

JHN	6	intro	xe4t			0		# John 6 General Notes<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### King<br><br>The king of any nation was the richest and most powerful person in that nation. The people wanted Jesus to be their king because he gave them food and so they thought he would make the Jews into the richest and most powerful nation in the world. They did not understand that Jesus came to die so God could forgive his people’s sins and that the world would persecute his people.<br><br>## Important metaphors in this chapter<br><br>### Bread<br><br>Bread was the most common and important food in Jesus’ day, and so the word “bread” was their general word for “food.” It is often difficult to translate the word “bread” into the languages of people who do not eat bread because the general word for food in some languages refers to food that did not exist in Jesus’ culture. Jesus used the word “bread” to refer to himself. He wanted them to understand that they need him so they can have eternal life. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])<br><br>### Eating the flesh and drinking the blood<br><br>When Jesus said, “Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you will not have life in yourselves,” he knew that before he died he would tell his followers to do this by eating bread and drinking wine. In the event this chapter describes, he expected that his hearers would understand that he was using a metaphor but would not understand what the metaphor referred to. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/flesh]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/blood]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Parenthetical Ideas<br><br>Several times in this passage, John explains something or gives the reader some context to better understand the story. These explanation are intended to give the reader some additional knowledge without interrupting the flow of the narrative. The information is placed inside parentheses.<br><br>### “Son of Man”<br><br>Jesus refers to himself as the “Son of Man” in this chapter ([John 6:26](../06/26.md)). Your language may not allow people to speak of themselves as if they were speaking about someone else. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sonofman]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

JHN	7	intro	l712			0		# John 7 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>This whole chapter concerns the concept of believing Jesus to be the Messiah. Some people believed this to be true while others rejected it. Some were willing to recognize his power and even the possibility that he was a prophet, but most were unwilling to believe that he was the Messiah. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/christ]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]])<br><br>Translators may wish to include a note at verse 53 to explain to the reader why they have chosen or chosen not to translate verses 7:53-8:11.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### “My time has not yet come”<br><br>This phrase and “his hour had not yet come” are used in this chapter to indicate that Jesus is in control of the events unfolding in his life.<br><br>### “Living water”<br><br>This is an important image used in the New Testament. It is a metaphor. Because this metaphor is given in a desert environment, it probably emphasizes that Jesus is able to give life sustaining nourishment. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Prophecy<br><br>Jesus gives a prophecy about his life without an explicit statement in John [John 7:33-34](./33.md).<br><br>### Irony<br><br>Nicodemus explains to the other Pharisees that the Law requires him to hear directly from a person before making a judgment about them. The Pharisees in turn made a judgment about Jesus without speaking to Jesus.<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### “Did not believe in him”<br><br>Jesus’ brothers did not believe Jesus was the Messiah. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/believe]])<br><br>### “The Jews”<br><br>This term is used in two different ways in this passage. It is used specifically in reference to the opposition of the Jewish leaders who were trying to kill him ([John 7:1](../../jhn/07/01.md)). It is also used in reference to the people of Judea in general who had a positive opinion of Jesus ([John 7:13](../../jhn/07/13.md)). The translator may wish to use the terms “Jewish leaders” and “Jewish people” or “Jews (leaders)” and “Jews (in general).”

JHN	8	intro	e667			0		# John 8 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Translators may wish to include a note at verse 1 to explain to the reader why they have chosen to translate or to not translate verses 8:1-11.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### A light and darkness<br><br>The Bible often speaks of unrighteous people, people who do not do what pleases God, as if they were walking around in darkness. It speaks of light as if it were what enables those sinful people to become righteous, to understand what they are doing wrong and begin to obey God. Here it is all Gentiles (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]])<br><br>### I AM<br><br>John records Jesus as saying these words four times in this book, three times in this chapter. They stand alone as a complete sentence, and they literally translate the Hebrew word for “I AM,” by which Yahweh identified himself to Moses. For these reasons, many people believe that when Jesus said these words he was claiming to be Yahweh. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/yahweh]]).<br><br>### The Scribes and Pharisees’ trap<br><br>The Scribes and Pharisees wanted to trick Jesus. They wanted him to say either that they should keep the law of Moses by killing a woman whom they had found committing adultery or that they should disobey the law of Moses and forgive her sin. Jesus knew that they were trying to trick him and that they did not really want to keep the law of Moses. He knew this because the law said that both the woman and the man should die, but they did not bring the man to Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/adultery]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### “Son of Man”<br><br>Jesus refers to himself as the “Son of Man” in this chapter ([John 8:28](../../jhn/08/28.md)). Your language may not allow people to speak of themselves as if they were speaking about someone else. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sonofman]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

JHN	9	intro	hq31			0		# John 9 General Notes<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### “Who sinned?”<br><br>Many of the Jews of Jesus’ time believed that if a person was blind or deaf or crippled, it was because he or his parents or someone in his family had sinned. This was not the teaching of the law of Moses. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]])<br><br>### “He does not keep the Sabbath”<br><br>The Pharisees thought that Jesus was working, and so breaking the Sabbath, by making mud. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sabbath]])<br><br>## Important metaphors in this chapter<br><br>### Light and darkness<br><br>The Bible often speaks of unrighteous people, people who do not do what pleases God, as if they were walking around in darkness. It speaks of light as if it were what enables those sinful people to become righteous, to understand what they are doing wrong and begin to obey God. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]])<br><br>### Seeing and being blind<br><br>Jesus calls the Pharisees blind because they see that Jesus is able to heal blind people but they still do not believe that God sent him ([John 9:39-40](./39.md)). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### “Son of Man”<br><br>Jesus refers to himself as the “Son of Man” in this chapter ([John 9:35](../../jhn/09/35.md)). Your language may not allow people to speak of themselves as if they were speaking about someone else. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sonofman]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

JHN	10	intro	e8mb			0		# John 10 General Notes<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Blasphemy<br><br>When a person claims that he is God or that God has told him to speak when God has not told him to speak, this is called blasphemy. The law of Moses commanded the Israelites to kill blasphemers by stoning them to death. When Jesus said, “I and the Father are one,” the Jews thought he was blaspheming, so they took up stones to kill him. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/blasphemy]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]])<br><br>## Important metaphors in this chapter<br><br>### Sheep<br><br>Jesus spoke of people as sheep because sheep do not see well, they do not think well, they often walk away from those who care for them, and they cannot defend themselves when other animals attack them. God’s people also rebel against him and do not know when they are doing wrong.<br><br>### Sheep pen<br><br>A sheep pen was a space with a stone wall around it in which shepherds would keep their sheep. Once they were inside the sheep pen, the sheep could not run away, and animals and thieves could not easily get inside to kill or steal them.<br><br>### Laying down and taking up life<br><br>Jesus speaks of his life as if it were a physical object that he could lay down on the ground, a metaphor for dying, or pick up again, a metaphor for becoming alive again.

JHN	11	intro	tks5			0		# John 11 General Notes<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Light and darkness<br><br>The Bible often speaks of unrighteous people, people who do not do what pleases God, as if they were walking around in darkness. It speaks of light as if it were what enables those sinful people to become righteous, to understand what they are doing wrong and begin to obey God. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]])<br><br>### Passover<br><br>After Jesus made Lazarus become alive again, the Jewish leaders were trying hard to kill him, so he started traveling from place to place in secret. Now the Pharisees knew that he would probably come to Jerusalem for the Passover because God had commanded all Jewish men to celebrate the Passover in Jerusalem, so they planned to catch him and kill him then. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/passover]])<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### “One man dies for the people”<br><br>The law of Moses commanded the priests to kill animals so that God would forgive the people’s sins. The high priest Caiaphas said, “It is better for you that one man dies for the people than that the whole nation perishes” ([John 11:50](../../jhn/11/50.md)). He said this because he loved his “place” and “nation” ([John 11:48](../../jhn/11/48.md)) more than he loved the God who had made Lazarus become alive again. He wanted Jesus to die so that the Romans would not destroy the temple and Jerusalem, but God wanted Jesus to die so that he could forgive all of his people’s sins.<br><br>### Hypothetical situation<br><br>When Martha said, “If you had been here, my brother would not have died,” she was speaking of a situation that could have happened but did not happen. Jesus had not come, and her brother had died.

JHN	12	intro	qzv4			0		# John 12 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 12:38 and 40, which are words from the Old Testament.<br><br>Verse 16 is a commentary on these events. It is possible to put this entire verse in parentheses in order to set it apart from the narrative of the story.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Mary anointed Jesus’ feet<br><br>The Jews would put oil on a person’s head to make that person feel welcome and comfortable. They would also put oil on a person’s body after the person had died but before they buried the body. But they would never think to put oil on a person’s feet, because they thought that feet were dirty.<br><br>### The donkey and the colt<br><br>Jesus rode into Jerusalem on an animal. In this way he was like a king who came into a city after he had won an important battle. Also, the kings of Israel in the Old Testament rode on a donkeys. Other kings rode on horses. So Jesus was showing that he was the king of Israel and that he was not like other kings.<br><br>Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John all wrote about this event. Matthew and Mark wrote that the disciples brought Jesus a donkey. John wrote that Jesus found a donkey. Luke wrote that they brought him a colt. Only Matthew wrote that there were both a donkey had a colt. No one knows for sure whether Jesus rode the donkey or the colt. It is best to translate each of these accounts as it appears in the ULT without trying to make them all say exactly the same thing. (See: [Matthew 21:1-7](../../mat/21/01.md) and [Mark 11:1-7](../../mrk/11/01.md) and [Luke 19:29-36](../../luk/19/29.md) and [John 12:14-15](../../jhn/12/14.md))<br><br>### Glory<br><br>Scripture often speaks of God’s glory as a great, brilliant light. When people see this light, they are afraid. In this chapter John says that the glory of Jesus is his resurrection ([John 12:16](../../jhn/12/16.md)).<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### The metaphors of light and darkness<br><br>The Bible often speaks of unrighteous people, people who do not do what pleases God, as if they were walking around in darkness. It speaks of light as if it were what enables those sinful people to become righteous, to understand what they are doing wrong and begin to obey God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Paradox<br><br>A paradox is a true statement that appears to describe something impossible. A paradox occurs in 12:25: “He who loves his life will lose it; but he who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life.” But in 12:26 Jesus explains what it means to keep one’s life for eternal life. ([John 12:25-26](./25.md)).

JHN	13	intro	zk68			0		# John 13 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>The events of this chapter are commonly referred to as the last supper or the Lord’s supper. This Passover feast in many ways parallels Jesus’ sacrifice as the lamb of God. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/passover]])<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### The washing of feet<br><br>People in the ancient Near East thought that feet were very dirty. Only servants would wash people’s feet. The disciples did not want Jesus to wash their feet because they considered him their master and themselves his servants, but he wanted to show them that they needed to serve each other. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])<br><br>### I AM<br><br>John records Jesus as saying these words four times in this book, once in this chapter. They stand alone as a complete sentence, and they literally translate the Hebrew word for “I AM,” by which Yahweh identified himself to Moses. For these reasons, many people believe that when Jesus said these words he was claiming to be Yahweh. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/yahweh]]).<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### “Son of Man”<br><br>Jesus refers to himself as the “Son of Man” in this chapter ([John 13:31](../../jhn/13/31.md)). Your language may not allow people to speak of themselves as if they were speaking about someone else. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sonofman]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

It is possible to translate the words “is not of this world” as “is not from this place” or “comes from another place.”<br><br>### King of the Jews<br><br>When Pilate asked if Jesus were the King of the Jews ([John 18:33](../../jhn/18/33.md)), he was asking if Jesus were claiming to be like King Herod, whom the Romans were permitting to rule Judea. When he asked the crowd if he should release the King of the Jews ([John 18:39](../../jhn/18/39.md)), he is mocking the Jews, because the Romans and Jews hated each other. He was also mocking Jesus, because he did not think that Jesus was a king at all. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])

JHN	19	intro	u96u			0		# John 19 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 19:24, which are words from the Old Testament.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### “Purple garment”<br><br>Purple is a color like red or blue. The people were mocking Jesus, so they put him in a purple garment. This was because kings wore purple garments. They spoke and acted like they were giving honor to a king, but everyone knew that they were doing it because they hated Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])<br><br>### “You are not Caesar’s friend”<br><br>Pilate knew that Jesus was not a criminal, so he did not want to have his soldiers kill him. But the Jews told him that Jesus was claiming to be a king, and anyone who did that was breaking Caesar’s laws ([John 19:12](../../jhn/19/12.md)).<br><br>### The tomb<br><br>The tomb in which Jesus was buried ([John 19:41](../../jhn/19/41.md)) was the kind of tomb in which wealthy Jewish families buried their dead. It was an actual room cut into a rock. It had a flat place on one side where they could place the body after they had put oil and spices on it and wrapped it in cloth. Then they would roll a large rock in front of the tomb so no one could see inside or enter.<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Sarcasm<br><br>The soldiers were insulting Jesus when they said, “Hail, King of the Jews.” Pilate was insulting the Jews when he asked, “Should I crucify your king?” He was probably also insulting both Jesus and the Jews when he wrote, “Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Gabbatha, Golgotha<br><br>These are two Hebrew words. After translating the meanings of these words (“The Pavement” and “The Place of a Skull”), the author transliterates their sounds by writing them with Greek letters.

JHN	20	intro	nm1y			0		# John 20 General Notes<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### The tomb<br><br>The tomb in which Jesus was buried ([John 20:1](../../jhn/20/01.md)) was the kind of tomb in which wealthy Jewish families buried their dead. It was an actual room cut into a rock. It had a flat place on one side where they could place the body after they had put oil and spices on it and wrapped it in cloth. Then they would roll a large rock in front of the tomb so no one could see inside or enter.<br><br>### “Receive the Holy Spirit”<br><br>If your language uses the same word for “breath” and “spirit,” be sure that the reader understands that Jesus was performing a symbolic action by breathing, and that what the disciples received was the Holy Spirit, not Jesus’ breath. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/holyspirit]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Rabboni<br><br>John used Greek letters to describe the sound of the word, and then he explained that it means “Teacher.” You should do the same, using the letters of your language.<br><br>### Jesus’ resurrection body<br><br>No one is sure what Jesus’ body looked like after he became alive again. His disciples knew it was Jesus because they could see his face and touch the places where the soldiers had put the nails through his hands and feet, But he could also walk through solid walls and doors. It is best not to try to say more than what the ULT says.<br><br>### Two angels in white<br><br>Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John all wrote about angels in white clothing with the women at Jesus’ tomb. Two of the authors called them men, but that is only because the angels were in human form. Two of the authors wrote about two angels, but the other two authors wrote about only one of them. It is best to translate each of these passages as it appears in the ULT without trying to make the passages all say exactly the same thing. (See: [Matthew 28:1-2](../../mat/28/01.md) and [Mark 16:5](../../mrk/16/05.md) and [Luke 24:4](../../luk/24/04.md) and [John 20:12](../../jhn/20/12.md))
