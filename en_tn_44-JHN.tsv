Jesus rises from the dead (20:1–29)\n6. John says why he wrote his Gospel (20:30–31)\n7. Jesus meets with the disciples (21)\n\nMore detailed outlines are in the General Notes for each chapter.\n\n### What is the Gospel of John about?\n\nThe Gospel of John is one of four books in the New Testament that describe some of the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. These books are called “Gospels,” which means “good news.” Their authors wrote about different aspects of who Jesus was and what he did. John said that he wrote his Gospel “so that people might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God” ([20:31](../20/31.md)). John’s Gospel repeatedly emphasizes that Jesus is God in human form.\n\nJohn’s Gospel is very different from the other three Gospels. John does not include some of the teachings and events that the other writers included in their Gospels. Also, John wrote about some teachings and events that are not in the other Gospels.\n\nJohn wrote much about the miraculous signs Jesus did to prove that what Jesus said about himself was true. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sign]])\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nTranslators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “The Gospel of John” or “The Gospel According to John.” Or they may choose a title that may be clearer, such as, “The Good News About Jesus That John Wrote.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])\n\n### Who wrote the Gospel of John?\n\nThis book does not give the name of the author. However, since early Christian times, most Christians have thought that the Apostle John was the author. Further evidence that the Apostle John wrote this Gospel is the fact that his name does not occur once within the book. Instead, this Gospel contains the phrases “the disciple whom Jesus loved” or “the other disciple” in places where the other Gospels indicate that John was present ([13:23–25](../13/23.md); [19:26–27](../19/26.md); [20:2–8](../20/02.md); [21:7](../21/07.md), [20–24](../21/20.md)). The Apostle John most likely referred to himself in this manner because he wanted to humbly say that he had a very close relationship with Jesus. He was part of Jesus’ inner circle of disciples who became the “pillars” of the early church ([Galatians 2:9](../../gal/02/09.md)). \n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### Why does John write so much about the final week of Jesus’ life?\n\nJohn wrote much about Jesus’ final week. He wanted his readers to think deeply about Jesus’ final week and his death on the cross. He wanted people to understand that Jesus willingly died on the cross so that God could forgive them for sinning against him. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])\n\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\n\n### Why does Jesus refer to himself as the “Son of Man”?\n\nIn the Gospels, Jesus calls himself the “Son of Man.” This is a reference to [Daniel 7:13–14](../../dan/07/13.md). In that passage, there is a person who is described as like a “son of man.” That means that the person was someone who looked like a human being. God gave authority to this “son of man” to rule over the nations forever. All people will worship him forever.\n\nJews of Jesus’ time did not use “Son of Man” as a title for anyone. But Jesus used it for himself to help them understand who he truly was. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sonofman]])\n\nTranslating the title “Son of Man” can be difficult in many languages. Readers may misunderstand a literal translation. Translators can consider alternatives, such as “The Human One.” It may also be helpful to include a footnote to explain the title.\n\n### What does the word “sign” mean in the Gospel of John?\n\nWhile other New Testament writers use terms like “mighty works” or “wonders” to refer to the miracles that Jesus did, John prefers to use the term “sign.” The miracles John calls “signs” were significant displays of divine power. John called them signs to emphasize that an important purpose of Jesus’ miracles was to prove that Jesus was God and that what Jesus said about himself was true. John said that in his Gospel he only wrote about some of the signs that Jesus did. John said, “these have been written so that you would believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and so that believing, you would have life in his name” ([20:30–31](../20/30.md)).\n\n### What do the words “remain,” “reside,” and “abide” mean in the Gospel of John?\n\nJohn often used the words “remain,” “reside”, and “abide” as metaphors. John spoke of a believer becoming more faithful to Jesus and knowing Jesus better as if Jesus’ word “remained” in the believer. John also spoke of someone being spiritually joined to someone else as if the person “remained” in the other person. Christians are said to “remain” in Christ and in God. The Father is said to “remain” in the Son, and the Son is said to “remain” in the Father. The Son is said to “remain” in believers. The Holy Spirit is also said to “remain” in the believers.\n\nMany translators will find it impossible to represent these ideas in their languages in exactly the same way. For example, Jesus intended to express the idea of the Christian being spiritually together with him when he said, “He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me, and I in him” ([6:56](../06/56.md)). The UST uses the idea of “will be united with me, and I will be united with them.” But translators may have to find other ways of expressing the idea.\n\nIn the passage, “my words remain in you” ([15:7](../15/07.md)), the UST expresses this idea as, “obey what I have taught you.” Translators may find it possible to use this translation as a model.\n\n### What is double meaning in the Gospel of John?\n\nJohn occasionally used words or phrases that could have two meanings (double entendre) in the language he originally wrote this Gospel in. For example, the phrase translated “born again” in the ULT could also mean “born from above” ([3:3](../03/03.md), [7](../03/07.md)). In such cases, you may want to choose one meaning and put the other meaning in a footnote.\n\n### What are the major issues in the text of the Gospel of John?\n\nThe following verses are found in older versions of the Bible but are not included in most modern versions. Translators are advised not to translate these verses. However, if there are older versions of the Bible in the translators’ region that include these verses, the translators can include them. If they are translated, they should be put inside square brackets (\\[\\]) to indicate that they were probably not originally in John’s Gospel.\n* “waiting for the moving of the water. For an angel of the Lord went down into the pool and stirred up the water at certain times, and whoever then first stepped in after the water was stirred was healed from whatever disease he suffered from.” (5:3-4)\n* “going through the midst of them, and so passed by” ([8:59](../08/59.md))\n\nThe following passage is included in most older and modern versions of the Bible. But it is not in the earliest copies of the Bible. Translators are advised to translate this passage. It should be put inside of square brackets (\\[\\]) to indicate that it may not have been original to John’s Gospel.\n* The story of the adulterous woman ([7:53](../07/53.md)–[8:11](../08/11.md))\n\n(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
JHN	1	intro	k29b			0		# John 1 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n1. Jesus is God (1:1–5)\n2. John the Baptist was Jesus’ witness (1:6–8)\n3. Summary of Jesus’ ministry on Earth (1:9–13)\n4. Jesus is God in the flesh (1:14–18)\n5. John the Baptist prepares the way for Jesus (1:19–34)\n6. Jesus meets Andrew, Peter, Philip, and Nathaniel (1:35–51)\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in [1:23](../01/23.md), which are words from the Old Testament.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### “The Word”\n\nJohn uses the phrase “the Word” to refer to Jesus ([1:1](../01/01.md), [14](../01/14.md)). John is saying that God’s most important message to all people is actually Jesus, a person with a physical body. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/wordofgod]])\n\n### Light and Darkness\n\nIn [1:4–9](../01/04.md), John uses an extended metaphor in which light represents what is true and good and darkness represents what is false and evil. John applies that light metaphor to Jesus in order to show that Jesus is God’s truth and goodness displayed in a human body. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]])\n\n### “Children of God”\n\nPeople are sometimes described as “children of God” because God created them. However, John uses this expression in a different sense in this chapter. He uses it to describe people who have entered into a father-child relationship with God by putting their faith and trust in Jesus. God indeed created all people, but people can only become children of God in this sense by believing in Jesus. “Children” in this usage does not refer to those who are young, but only to the relationship that people have at any age to their father. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/believe]])\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### Metaphors\n\nJohn uses the metaphors of light and darkness and of “the Word” to tell the reader that he will be writing more about good and evil and about what God wants to tell people through Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### “In the beginning”\n\nSome languages and cultures speak of the world as if it has always existed, as if it had no beginning. But “very long ago” is different from “in the beginning,” and you need to be sure that your translation communicates correctly.\n\n### “Son of Man”\n\nJesus refers to himself as the “Son of Man” in this chapter ([1:51](../01/51.md)). Your language may not allow people to speak of themselves as if they were speaking about someone else. See the discussion of this concept in Part 3 of the General Introduction to the Gospel of John. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sonofman]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

JHN	1	14	z37d	figs-abstractnouns	τὴν δόξαν αὐτοῦ, δόξαν	1		If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate both occurrences of the abstract nouns **glory** with an equivalent expression.

JHN	1	14	tg4m	figs-metaphor	πλήρης χάριτος καὶ ἀληθείας	1	full of grace	Here, John uses **full of** figuratively to describe Jesus fully possessing a quality, as if grace and truth are objects that could fill a person.

JHN	1	15	lrd7		ὅτι πρῶτός μου ἦν	1	for he was before me	Here, **before me** means that Jesus existed earlier in time than John. This does not mean that Jesus is more important because he is older than John in human years. Jesus is greater and more important than John because he is God the Son, who has always existed. Alternate translation: “for he existed before I was born”
JHN	1	16	punh	grammar-connect-logic-result	ὅτι	1		Here, John is using the word **For** to introduce the reason why he said that Jesus is “full of grace and truth” in verse [14](../01/14.md).

JHN	1	16	vmyz	figs-exclusive	ἡμεῖς πάντες	1		Here, **we** refers to John and all believers. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “all of we believers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

JHN	1	17	iata	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	ὁ νόμος διὰ Μωϋσέως ἐδόθη, ἡ χάρις καὶ ἡ ἀλήθεια διὰ Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ ἐγένετο	1		John placed the two sentences in this verse next to each other without any connecting word in order to show a contrast between the law of Moses and the grace and truth of Jesus. This does not mean that the law of Moses did not have grace and truth. Rather, John is indicating that the grace and truth revealed by Jesus is more complete than that revealed in the law of Moses. Although God revealed himself and his will through the law of Moses, he did so much more clearly though Jesus, who is God in human form. Alternate translation: “the law was given through Moses. But grace and truth came about through Jesus Christ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
JHN	1	17	xsbj	figs-activepassive	ὁ νόμος διὰ Μωϋσέως ἐδόθη	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

This emphasizes that John was telling the truth and was strongly stating that he was not the Christ. Your language may have a different way of doing this. Alternate translation: “he strongly confessed” or “he solemnly testified”
JHN	1	21	f926	writing-pronouns	ἠρώτησαν	1		Here, **they** refers to “the Jews” mentioned in the previous verse. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could say it explicitly. Alternate translation: “the Jews asked” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])

These words can be supplied from the context and may require you to change the punctuation of the sentences. Alternate translation: “Who are you? Tell us so that we might given an answer to those who sent us. What” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
JHN	1	22	x8wz	figs-exclusive	δῶμεν…ἡμᾶς	1	we may give … us	Here, **we** and **us** refer to the priests and Levites, not to John. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

JHN	1	23	p7kc	figs-quotesinquotes	ἐγὼ φωνὴ βοῶντος ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ, εὐθύνατε τὴν ὁδὸν Κυρίου	1		This clause is a quotation within a quotation. John is quoting from the book of Isaiah, and Isaiah is quoting the words of the person calling out in the wilderness. It would be best to indicate that by punctuating this material as a second-level quotation, since Luke is quoting from Scripture. However, if your language does not put one direct quotation within another, you could translate this material as an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: “I am a voice crying out in the wilderness to make the way of the Lord straight” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])

John the Baptist uses this expression figurative to refer to the most unpleasant work of a servant. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could say the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “me. I am not even worthy to untie the strap of his sandal” or “me, whom I am not worthy to serve in even the most unpleasant way” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

JHN	2	intro	jav2			0		# John 2 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n1. Jesus’ first sign: he turns water into wine (2:1–12)\n2. Jesus causes controversy in the Temple (2:13–22)\n3. Jesus’ ministry in Jerusalem at Passover (2:23–25)\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Wine\n\nThe Jews drank wine at many meals and especially when they were celebrating special events. They did not believe that it was a sin to drink wine.\n\n### Driving out the money changers\n\nJesus drove the money changers out of the temple to show that he had authority over the temple and over all of Israel. As the Son of God, it was his Father’s temple that was being used inappropriately for making money. Therefore, he had the authority to drive out those who were misusing the temple.\n\n### “He knew what was in man”\n\nJesus knew what other people were thinking only because he is the Son of Man and the Son of God. Because he is the Son of God, he has supernatural insight into what other people were thinking and could correctly judge their intentions.\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### “His disciples remembered”\n\nJohn used this phrase to stop telling the main historical narrative and to tell about something that happened much later. The Jewish authorities spoke to Jesus right after he scolded the sellers in the temple in ([2:16](../02/16.md)). Jesus’ disciples remembered what the prophet had written long ago and that Jesus was talking about the temple of his body after Jesus became alive again ([2:17](../02/17.md) and [2:22](../02/22.md)).

According to the Jewish way of counting days, the first day would have been the day in [1:43](../01/43.md), making **the third day** occur two days afterward. Alternate translation: “two days after Jesus called Philip and Nathaniel” (2) the day after Jesus called Philip and Nathaniel to follow him in [1:43](../01/43.md). In this case, the first day would have occurred in [1:35](../01/35.md) and the second day in [1:43](../01/43.md).

JHN	2	4	jc75	figs-rquestion	τί ἐμοὶ καὶ σοί, γύναι?	1	why do you come to me?	Jesus is using the question form for emphasis.

JHN	2	6	y7p3	translate-bvolume	μετρητὰς δύο ἢ τρεῖς	1	two to three metretes	A **metretes** was equivalent to about 40 liters. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express the quantity in modern measurements. Alternatively, to help your readers recognize that the biblical writings come from long ago when people used different measurements, you could express the amount using the ancient measurement, the metrete, and explain the equivalent in modern measurements in a footnote. Alternate translation: “80 to 120 liters” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bvolume]])

JHN	2	7	byc0	writing-pronouns	αὐτοῖς	1		Here, **them** refers to the servants at the wedding. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “to the servants” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])

The head waiter did not know that the wine was originally water from the water pots. Use the natural form in your language for expressing background information. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])

If this might confuse your readers, you could say the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “and the cheaper wine when they have become drunk and unable to discern the quality of the wine” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JHN	2	11	sq53	writing-background		0		In this verse, John provides background information about the events described in [2:1–10](../02/01.md). Use the natural form in your language for expressing background information. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
JHN	2	11	ear7	figs-explicit	ἀρχὴν τῶν σημείων	1		John wrote much about the miraculous **signs** Jesus did. Turning water into wine at the wedding is the first of those **signs**.

JHN	2	11	r5kb	translate-names	Κανὰ	1	Cana	**Cana** is the name of a town in the region of Galilee. See how you translated this in verse [1](../02/01.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
JHN	2	11	z3tk	figs-abstractnouns	ἐφανέρωσεν τὴν δόξαν αὐτοῦ	1	revealed his glory	Here, **glory** refers to the mighty power of Jesus that enabled him to do miracles.

JHN	2	12	gw2f	writing-newevent	μετὰ τοῦτο	1		**After this** introduces a new event that happened some time after the events the story has just related.

JHN	2	12	mmkj	figs-explicit	μετὰ τοῦτο	1		Here, **this** refers to the what took place in Cana that was described in [2:1–11](../02/01.md).

JHN	2	14	sa75	figs-explicit	τοὺς πωλοῦντας βόας καὶ πρόβατα καὶ περιστερὰς	1	sellers of oxen and sheep and pigeons	These animals were used for sacrifices in the temple. People were buying animals in the temple courtyard in order to sacrifice them to God. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this explicitly.

JHN	2	14	qu9k	figs-explicit	κερματιστὰς	1	money changers	Jewish authorities required people who wanted to buy animals for sacrifices in the temple to exchange their money for special money from the **money changers**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “people who exchanged money for special money approved for temple use” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JHN	2	14	i8lv	figs-explicit	καθημένους	1	were sitting there	The next verse makes it clear that these people are in the temple courtyard. That area was intended for worship and not for commerce. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “sitting in the temple courtyard that was intended for worship” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JHN	2	15	x6et	grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ	1	So	Here John is telling his readers what Jesus did as a result of the commerce he saw going on in the temple. Alternate translation: “Consequently” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
JHN	2	15	nn6y	writing-pronouns	πάντας	1		Here, **them all** refers to the people selling the animals and the money changers. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could say this explicitly.

JHN	2	16	h6qy	figs-explicit	τὸν οἶκον τοῦ πατρός μου οἶκον ἐμπορίου	1	the house of my Father	Jesus uses **the house of my Father** to refer to the temple. If this might confuse your readers, you could say the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “the house of my Father, which is the temple, a house of commerce” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JHN	2	16	grg3	guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	τοῦ πατρός μου	1	my Father	**Father** is an important title that Jesus uses for God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
JHN	2	17	c2pu	figs-activepassive	γεγραμμένον ἐστίν	1	it was written	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.  Alternate translation: “someone had written” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
JHN	2	17	q91v	writing-quotations	γεγραμμένον ἐστίν	1		Here John uses **it is written** to introduce a quotation from an Old Testament book ([Psalm 69:9](../../psa/69/09.md)). If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable phrase that indicates that John is quoting from an important text. Alternate translation: “it had been written in the scriptures” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
JHN	2	17	pvct	figs-yousingular	τοῦ οἴκου σου	1		Here, **your** refers to God and is singular. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “for God’s house” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
JHN	2	17	ua3v	figs-explicit	τοῦ οἴκου σου	1	your house	Here, **house** refers to the temple, which is often called God’s **house** in the Bible. If this might confuse your readers, you could say the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “for your house, the temple” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JHN	2	17	gg1w	figs-metaphor	καταφάγεταί	1	consume	Here, the author uses **consume** figuratively to refer to Jesus’ intense love for the temple, as if it was a fire that burned within him. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could say the meaning plainly or use a simile. Alternate translation: “will be intense within” or “will be like a fire that consumes” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JHN	2	18	r5rw	figs-explicit	ταῦτα	1	these things	Here, **these things** refers to Jesus’ actions against the animal sellers and money changers in the temple.

JHN	2	19	mp6i	figs-imperative	λύσατε τὸν ναὸν τοῦτον, καὶ ἐν τρισὶν ἡμέραις ἐγερῶ αὐτόν	1	Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up	This is an imperative, but it should be translated as introducing a hypothetical situation rather than as a command. Jesus is stating a hypothetical situation in which the event in the second clause would happen if the event in the first clause took place. In this case, Jesus would certainly **raise** the **temple** up if the Jewish authorities were to **destroy** it. Alternate translation: “If you destroy this temple, then in three days I will raise it up” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
JHN	2	19	of4u	figs-extrainfo	λύσατε τὸν ναὸν τοῦτον, καὶ ἐν τρισὶν ἡμέραις ἐγερῶ αὐτόν	1		Here, John records Jesus using the words **Destroy** and **raise** figuratively to describe his killing and resurrection, as if tearing down and rebuilding a building. However, the Jewish leaders did not understand this and Jesus does not explain the metaphor to them. Therefore, you do not need to explain its meaning further here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])
JHN	2	20	qb4x	figs-rquestion	σὺ ἐν τρισὶν ἡμέραις ἐγερεῖς αὐτόν?	1		Here, the Jewish leaders are using the question form for emphasis. They think that Jesus wants to tear down the temple and rebuild it in three days. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “you cannot possibly rebuild it in three days!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
JHN	2	21	g6jx	writing-endofstory		0	General Information:	Verses 21 and 22 are a comment John made about the story that was described in [2:13–20](../02/13.md). These verses tell about something that happened later. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-endofstory]])
JHN	2	21	b440	writing-pronouns	ἐκεῖνος δὲ ἔλεγεν	1		Here, **that one** refers to Jesus. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “But Jesus was speaking” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
JHN	2	22	oznm	grammar-connect-logic-result	οὖν	1		**Therefore** indicates that in this verse John is giving the result of Jesus making the statement in [2:19](../02/19.md). Alternate translation: “Because Jesus said this about his body” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
JHN	2	22	jejg	figs-activepassive	ἠγέρθη ἐκ νεκρῶν	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, John implies that God did it. Alternate translation: “God raised him from the dead” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
JHN	2	22	nxug		ἐμνήσθησαν οἱ μαθηταὶ αὐτοῦ	1		Here, John is speaking about something that happened long after the event described in the previous verses. See the discussion of this in the General Notes to this chapter.
JHN	2	22	ewi1	figs-explicit	τοῦτο…τῷ λόγῳ ὃν εἶπεν ὁ Ἰησοῦς	1	this statement	Here, **this** and **the word** refer back to Jesus’ statement in [2:19](../02/19.md). If this might confuse your readers, you could say the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “this statement about his body … the word about his body that Jesus had spoken” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JHN	2	22	gq2w	figs-genericnoun	τῇ Γραφῇ	1	believed	Here, John is speaking of **the Scripture** in general, not of one particular book within the Bible. Alternate translation, as in the UST: “the scriptures” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])
JHN	2	23	kvn6	writing-newevent	ὡς δὲ ἦν ἐν τοῖς Ἱεροσολύμοις	1	Now when he was in Jerusalem	**Now** here introduces a new event that happened some time after the events the story has just related. The story does not say how long after the previous events this new event happened. Use the natural form in your language for introducing a new event. Alternate translation: “Some time later” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
JHN	2	23	n807		ἐν τῷ Πάσχα ἐν τῇ ἑορτῇ	1		These two phrases could refer to: (1) two different parts of the festival, **the Passover** referring to the first day of **the festival**, and **the festival** referring to the Festival of Unleavened Bread that begins at Passover and was one week long. Alternate translation: “at the Passover, during the Festival of Unleavened Bread” (2) the same event. Alternate translation: “at the Passover Festival”
JHN	2	23	w3qv	figs-metonymy	ἐπίστευσαν εἰς τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ	1	believed in his name	Here, **name** represents the person of Jesus. Alternate translation: “believed in him” or “trusted in him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
JHN	2	23	ipd6	grammar-connect-logic-result	θεωροῦντες αὐτοῦ τὰ σημεῖα	1		Here, **seeing** indicates the reason why the people were believing in Jesus. These people had a superficial faith, only believing in Jesus because of the miracles he performed. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “because they saw his signs” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
JHN	2	23	u65n		τὰ σημεῖα	1	the signs that he did	See how you translated **signs** in [2:11](../02/11.md). See also the discussion of **signs** in Part 3 of the General Introduction to the Gospel of John. Alternate translation: “significant miracles”
JHN	2	24	cm49		οὐκ ἐπίστευεν αὑτὸν αὐτοῖς	1		Although many people were believing in him, Jesus knew that their belief was superficial and only lasted as long as he performed miracles for them. Therefore, he did not trust them the way he trusted his true disciples. Alternate translation: “did not trust them as true disciples” or “did not believe their belief in him”
JHN	2	24	f2n7	figs-gendernotations	τὸ αὐτὸν γινώσκειν πάντας	1		Here, the word **men** represents people in general. Alternate translation: “he knew all people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
JHN	2	25	et23	figs-gendernotations	περὶ τοῦ ἀνθρώπου…τί ἦν ἐν τῷ ἀνθρώπῳ	1	about man, for he knew what was in man	Here, both instances of the word **man** represent people in general. Alternate translation: “about mankind … what was in mankind” or “about people … what was in people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])

If this might confuse your readers, you could say the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “what people think” or “the thoughts and desires people have” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JHN	3	intro	i7a7			0		# John 3 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n1. Jesus teaches Nicodemus about being born again (3:1–21)\n2. John the Baptist testifies about Jesus (3:22–36)\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Light and Darkness\n\nThe Bible often speaks of unrighteous people, people who do not do what pleases God, as if they were walking around in darkness. It speaks of light as if it were what enables those sinful people to become righteous, to understand what they are doing wrong, and to begin to obey God. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]])\n\n### The kingdom of God\n\nThe kingdom of God is a concept that is very rich in meaning. It includes the idea of eternal life in the presence of God, but it also includes the idea of what the earth will be like in the future when Jesus returns and rules everything, and the idea of life on earth right now, when and where God’s wishes are carried out fully. The unifying concept behind all of these ideas is God ruling and people embracing God’s rule over their lives. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/kingdomofgod]])\n\n### Born again\n\nA major idea in this chapter is the spiritual new birth that Jesus says is necessary in order for someone to enter the kingdom of God [3:3–8](../03/03.md). Jesus also uses the following expressions to refer to being born again: “born from water and the Spirit” ([3:4](../03/04.md)) and “born from the Spirit” ([3:6,8](../03/06.md)). (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/bornagain]])\n\n## Possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### “Son of Man”\n\nJesus refers to himself as the “Son of Man” twice in this chapter ([3:13–14](../03/13.md)). Your language may not allow people to speak of themselves as if they were speaking about someone else. See the discussion of this concept in Part 3 of the General Introduction to the Gospel of John. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sonofman]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
JHN	3	1	yl6f	writing-newevent	δὲ	1		**Now** here introduces a new event that happened some time after the events the story has just related in the previous chapter. The story does not say how long after those events this new event happened. Use the natural form in your language for introducing a new event. Alternate translation: “Some time later” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
JHN	3	1	s9p9	writing-participants	ἦν…ἄνθρωπος ἐκ τῶν Φαρισαίων, Νικόδημος ὄνομα αὐτῷ,	1	Now	Here, **there was a man** is used to introduce Nicodemus as a new character in the story. Use the natural form in your language for introducing a new character. The phrase **from the Pharisees** identifies him as member of a strict Jewish religious sect. Alternate translation: “there was a man named Nicodemus, who was a member of a strict Jewish religious group” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
JHN	3	1	fz6f	figs-explicit	ἄρχων τῶν Ἰουδαίων	1		This phrase means that Nicodemus was a member of the Jewish religious leadership, specifically the Jewish council called the Sanhedrin which made decisions about Jewish law. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/council]]) If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “a member of the Jewish ruling council” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JHN	3	2	sxo1	writing-pronouns	οὗτος	1		**This one** here refers to Nicodemus. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “Nicodemus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
JHN	3	2	n84a	writing-pronouns	πρὸς αὐτὸν	1		Here, **him** refers to Jesus. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “to Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
JHN	3	2	skq8	figs-exclusive	οἴδαμεν	1	we know	Here, **we** is exclusive. Nicodemus is only referring to himself and the other members of the Jewish council. Your language may require you to mark this form. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
JHN	3	2	hxcr	figs-metaphor	ἐὰν μὴ ᾖ ὁ Θεὸς μετ’ αὐτοῦ	1		Here, Nicodemus uses **with him** figuratively to refer to God’s help. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could say the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “without God’s help” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JHN	3	3	nz18	figs-doublet	ἀμὴν, ἀμὴν, λέγω σοι	1	Truly, truly	Jesus uses this phrase to emphasize the truth of the statement that follows. See how you translated this in [1:51](../01/51.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
JHN	3	3	svpx	figs-extrainfo	γεννηθῇ ἄνωθεν	1		The phrase **born again** is a metaphor that refers to spiritual rebirth. See the discussion of this expression in the General Notes to this chapter. Nicodemus does not understand this metaphor and Jesus does not explain it to him in this verse. Therefore, you do not need to explain its meaning further here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])
JHN	3	3	t8pt		γεννηθῇ ἄνωθεν	1	born again	Here, the word translated **again** could also be translated as “from above.” It could refer to: (1) spiritual rebirth as a second birth that takes place in addition to physical birth. Alternate translation, as in the ULT: “would be born again” (2) spiritual rebirth as a birth that is caused by God, in which case “above” is a euphemism for God. Alternate translation: “would be born from above” (3) spiritual rebirth as both a second birth and a birth caused by God. See the discussion of John’s use of double meaning in Part 3 of the Introduction to this book. Alternate translation: “would be born again by God”
JHN	3	3	i0ew	figs-metaphor	ἰδεῖν τὴν Βασιλείαν τοῦ Θεοῦ	1		Here Jesus uses **see** figuratively to refer to experiencing an event or state. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could say the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “to experience the kingdom of God” or “to participate in the kingdom of God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JHN	3	3	ikj9	figs-metaphor	τὴν Βασιλείαν τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	kingdom of God	Here this phrase refers to both the place where God currently rules in heaven and to the earth when God rules over it in the future. See the discussion of this concept in the General Notes for this chapter. Alternate translation: “the place where God rules” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JHN	3	4	z64b	figs-pastforfuture	λέγει	1	a second time	Here John uses the present tense in past narration in order to call attention to a development in the story. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture]])
JHN	3	4	wa1p	figs-rquestion	πῶς δύναται ἄνθρωπος γεννηθῆναι, γέρων ὤν?	1	How can a man be born when he is old?	Nicodemus uses this question to emphasize that this cannot happen. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “A man certainly cannot be born again when he is old!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
JHN	3	4	yk9d	figs-rquestion	μὴ δύναται εἰς τὴν κοιλίαν τῆς μητρὸς αὐτοῦ δεύτερον εἰσελθεῖν καὶ γεννηθῆναι?	1	He cannot enter a second time into his mother’s womb and be born, can he?	Nicodemus uses this question to emphasize his belief that a second birth is impossible. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could say this explicitly.

JHN	3	5	n6d7	figs-metaphor	γεννηθῇ ἐξ ὕδατος καὶ Πνεύματος	1	born of water and the Spirit	The phrase **born from water and Spirit** could refer to: (1) spiritual birth that includes cleansing from sin and spiritual transformation by the Holy Spirit. In this case, Jesus’ words would be understood as a reference to Ezekiel 36:25–27, which Nicodemus would have been familiar with. Alternate translation: “would be born again by cleansing and the Spirit.” (2) physical birth and spiritual birth. Alternate translation: “would be born physically and spiritually” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JHN	3	5	e1dj	figs-metaphor	εἰσελθεῖν εἰς τὴν Βασιλείαν τοῦ Θεοῦ	1		Here Jesus uses **enter into** figuratively to refer to experiencing something. The meaning is similar to the meaning of “see” in [3:3](../03/03.md). Alternate translation: “to experience the kingdom of God” or “to participate in the kingdom of God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JHN	3	5	m37g	figs-metaphor	τὴν Βασιλείαν τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	enter into the kingdom of God	See how you translated this phrase in [3:3](../03/03.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JHN	3	6	gswx	figs-activepassive	τὸ γεγεννημένον ἐκ τῆς σαρκὸς	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “What flesh has given birth to” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
JHN	3	6	rru5	figs-metonymy	τῆς σαρκὸς, σάρξ ἐστιν	1		Here, Jesus is describing human beings figuratively by referring to something associated with them, the **flesh** they are made of. The word **flesh** here does not refer to sinful human nature as it does in other verses in the New Testament. Alternate translation: “a human being is a human being” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
JHN	3	6	v3g8	figs-explicit	τὸ γεγεννημένον ἐκ τοῦ Πνεύματος	1		Here, **the Spirit** refers to the Holy Spirit, who enables people to be born again. If this might confuse your readers, you could say the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “what has been born again by means of the Holy Spirit” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JHN	3	6	lfg1	figs-explicit	πνεῦμά	1		Here, **spirit** refers to the new spiritual nature that God gives a person when they are born again. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/bornagain]]) If this might confuse your readers, you could say the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation, as in the UST: “a new spiritual nature” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JHN	3	7	t2sl	figs-extrainfo	γεννηθῆναι ἄνωθεν	1		See how you translated this in [3:3](../03/03.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])
JHN	3	8	p87y	figs-metaphor	τὸ πνεῦμα ὅπου θέλει, πνεῖ	1	The wind blows wherever it wishes	The word translated **wind** can also mean spirit. Jesus here speaks figuratively of the Holy Spirit, as if he is **wind**. Just like people in Jesus’ time could not understand how the **wind** blew but could observe the effects of the wind, people cannot understand how the Holy Spirit works but can witness the effects of his work. If this might confuse your readers, you could say this with a simile. Alternate translation: “The Holy Spirit is like the wind that blows wherever it wants” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JHN	3	8	mxjc		οὕτως ἐστὶν	1		This phrase connects this sentence with the previous sentence. In the same way that people cannot understand the wind but recognize its effects, people who are not born from the Spirit cannot understand those who are born from the Spirit but can recognize the effects of the new birth. Alternate translation: “So it is with” or “So it happens with”
JHN	3	8	k9ay		ὁ γεγεννημένος ἐκ τοῦ Πνεύματος	1		See how you translated this phrase in [3:6](../03/06.md).
JHN	3	8	wh4z	figs-explicit	τοῦ Πνεύματος	1		Here, **the Spirit** refers to the Holy Spirit, who enables people to be born again. If this might confuse your readers, you could say the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “the Holy Spirit” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JHN	3	9	g4ji	figs-rquestion	πῶς δύναται ταῦτα γενέσθαι?	1	How can these things be?	This question could be: (1) a genuine question that shows that Nicodemus is confused. Alternate translation: “How are these things possible” (2) a rhetorical question Nicodemus uses to add emphasis to the statement. Alternate translation: “These things cannot be!” or “These things are impossible!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
JHN	3	9	phe2	figs-explicit	ταῦτα	1		Here, **these things** refers to all that Jesus had spoken in [3:3–8](../03/03.md). If your readers would misunderstand this, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “these things you have just told me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JHN	3	10	gw2h	figs-rquestion	σὺ εἶ ὁ διδάσκαλος τοῦ Ἰσραὴλ, καὶ ταῦτα οὐ γινώσκεις	1	Are you a teacher of Israel, and yet you do not understand these things?	Jesus is not asking Nicodemus a question in order to get information. He is using the question form for emphasis. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “You are a teacher of Israel, so I am surprised you do not understand these things!” or “You are a teacher of Israel, so you should understand these things!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
JHN	3	10	gbu5	figs-you	σὺ εἶ ὁ διδάσκαλος…οὐ γινώσκεις	1	Are you a teacher … yet you do not understand	The word **you** is singular and refers to Nicodemus.

JHN	3	10	ljiy	figs-explicit	ὁ διδάσκαλος τοῦ Ἰσραὴλ	1		Here, **the teacher** indicates that Nicodemus was recognized as a master teacher and religious authority in the land of Israel. If this might confuse your readers, you could say the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “the renowned religious teacher in Israel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

JHN	3	11	upi7	figs-exclusive	ὃ οἴδαμεν λαλοῦμεν…τὴν μαρτυρίαν ἡμῶν	1	we speak	When Jesus said **we** and **our** in this verse, he was not including Nicodemus. Jesus used these pronouns as a contrast to Nicodemus saying **we** in [3:2](../03/02.md). While Nicodemus used **we** to refer to him and the other Jewish religious leaders, Jesus could have been referring to: (1) himself and his disciples. Alternate translation, as in the UST: “my disciples and I speak what we know … our testimony” (2) himself and the other members of the Godhead. Alternate translation: “the Father, Spirit, and I speak what we know … our testimony” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
JHN	3	11	j1k1	figs-you	οὐ λαμβάνετε	1	you do not accept	The word **you** is plural and could refer to: (1) the Jewish people in general. Alternate translation: “you Jews” (2) Nicodemus and his fellow Jewish leaders. Alternate translation: “you Jewish leaders” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
JHN	3	12	y4e9	grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἰ τὰ ἐπίγεια εἶπον ὑμῖν	1		John records Jesus speaking as if this were a hypothetical possibility, but he means that it is actually true. If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, and if your readers might misunderstand and think that what Jesus is saying is not certain, then you can translate his words as an affirmative statement. Alternate translation: “Since I told you earthly things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
JHN	3	12	pt4x	figs-you	εἶπον ὑμῖν…οὐ πιστεύετε, πῶς ἐὰν εἴπω ὑμῖν…πιστεύσετε	1	I told you … you do not believe … how will you believe if I tell you	Throughout this verse, **you** is plural and could refer to: (1) the Jewish people in general.

JHN	3	12	c6ia	figs-rquestion	πῶς ἐὰν εἴπω ὑμῖν τὰ ἐπουράνια, πιστεύσετε?	1	how will you believe if I tell you about heavenly things?	Here, Jesus uses a question to emphasize the disbelief of Nicodemus and the Jews. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “you certainly will not believe if I tell you about heavenly things!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
JHN	3	12	dfqi	figs-explicit	τὰ ἐπουράνια	1		Here, **heavenly things** refers to things that take place in heaven or are related to heaven. If this might confuse your readers, you could say the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “truths about what takes place in heaven” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JHN	3	13	ld0m	figs-123person	ὁ ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ καταβάς	1		Jesus is referring to himself in the third person. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this in the first person. Alternate translation: “me, the one who descended from heaven” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
JHN	3	13	ocj0	figs-explicit	ὁ Υἱὸς τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου	1		The title **Son of Man** is equivalent to “Messiah.” Jesus uses it to claim that role subtly and implicitly. You may want to translate this title directly into your language. On the other hand, if you think it would be helpful to your readers, you could state what it means. See the discussion of this phrase in Part 3 of the General Introduction to the Gospel of John. Alternate translation: “the Messiah” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JHN	3	14	tb3s	figs-simile	καὶ καθὼς Μωϋσῆς ὕψωσεν τὸν ὄφιν ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ	1	Just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up	In this verse, John records Jesus comparing his crucifixion to Moses lifting up a bronze snake. John assumes that his readers will know that Jesus is referring to a story recorded in the Old Testament book of Numbers. In that story, the Israelites complained against God and God punished them by sending poisonous snakes to kill them. God then told Moses to make a bronze snake and raise it up on a pole so that whoever was bitten by one of the poisonous snakes and looked at the bronze snake would not die. You could indicate this explicitly if it would be helpful to your readers, particularly if they would not know the story. Alternate translation: “And just as Moses lifted up the bronze serpent on a pole when the Israelites were wandering in the wilderness” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
JHN	3	14	f9yi	figs-activepassive	ὑψωθῆναι δεῖ τὸν Υἱὸν τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου	1	in the wilderness	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “it is necessary for people to lift up the Son of Man” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
JHN	3	14	savl	figs-123person	ὑψωθῆναι…τὸν Υἱὸν τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου	1		Jesus is referring to himself in the third person.

JHN	3	14	krir	figs-explicit	τὸν Υἱὸν τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου	1		See how you translated this phrase in the previous verse. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JHN	3	15	e9ls	grammar-connect-logic-goal	ἵνα	1		Here, **so that** indicates that Jesus is stating the purpose for which he would be crucified.

Alternate translation (without a comma preceding): “in order that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
JHN	3	16	vg6z	grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1		**For** here indicates that Jesus is giving a reason why the statement in the previous two verses is true. Alternate translation: “This is true because” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
JHN	3	16	h4ht		οὕτως…ἠγάπησεν ὁ Θεὸς τὸν κόσμον	1		Here, **so** could refer to: (1) the manner in which God loved the world. Alternate translation, as in the UST: “God loved the world in this way” (2) the degree to which God loved the world. Alternate translation: “God loved the world so much” (3) both the manner in which and the degree to which God loved the world. For this interpretation, see the discussion of John’s use of double meaning in Part 3 of the Introduction to this book. Alternate translation: “in this way God loved the world so much”
JHN	3	16	uxc2	figs-metonymy	τὸν κόσμον	1	God so loved the world	Here, **world** refers to the people who live in it. Alternate translation: “the people in the world” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

JHN	3	16	fqk7	figs-explicit	τὸν Υἱὸν τὸν μονογενῆ	1		Here, **One and Only Son** refers to Jesus. If this might confuse your readers, you could say the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “his One and Only Son, Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JHN	3	16	z8at	figs-explicit	τὸν Υἱὸν τὸν μονογενῆ	1		Here and throughout John’s Gospel, the phrase **One and Only** is a title for Jesus that could refer to: (1) Jesus being unique as the only member of his kind. Alternate translation: “his Unique Son” (2) Jesus being the only child of his Father. Alternate translation: “his only begotten Son” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

Use whatever form your language uses for emphasis. Alternate translation: “For God truly sent his Son into the world so that he might save it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

JHN	3	17	f5o9	writing-pronouns	ἵνα κρίνῃ	1		Here, **he** refers to God. It does not refer to Jesus. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “so that God might condemn” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])

JHN	3	17	kuow	figs-activepassive	ἵνα σωθῇ ὁ κόσμος	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, John implies that God did it. Alternate translation: “so that God might save the world” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

If your readers would misunderstand this, you could say this plainly. See how you translated it in those places where **the light** also refers to Jesus in the [1:7–9](../01/07.md).

JHN	4	intro	j1hv			0		# John 4 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n1. Jesus leaves Judea for Galilee (4:1–6)\n2. Jesus meets a Samaritan woman (4:7–14)\n3. Jesus teaches the Samaritan woman about worship (4:15–26)\n4. Jesus teaches his disciples about evangelism (4:27–38)\n5. Jesus’ ministry in Samaria (4:39–42)\n6. Jesus goes to Galilee (4:43–45)\n7. Jesus’ second sign: he heals an official’s son (4:46–54)\n\n[John 4:7–38](../04/07.md) forms one story centered on the teaching of Jesus as the “living water” who gives eternal life to all who believe in him. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/believe]])\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### “It was necessary for him to pass through Samaria”\n\nJews avoided traveling through the region of Samaria because Jews and Samaritans were longtime enemies who hated each other. So Jesus did what most Jews did not want to do. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/samaria]])\n\n### “an hour is coming”\n\nJesus used these words to begin prophecies about events that could be shorter or longer than sixty minutes. In such instances, “hour” refers to a point in time when something happens, not a set length of time. For example, “an hour … when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth” refers to the point in time when people begin to do so ([4:23](../04/23.md)).\n\n### The proper place of worship\n\nLong before Jesus came to earth, the Samaritan people had broken the law of Moses by setting up their own temple on Mount Gerizim ([4:20](../04/20.md)). Jesus explained to the Samaritan woman that in the near future it would no longer be important where people worshiped ([4:21–24](../04/21.md)).\n\n### Harvest\n\nHarvest refers to the time when people go out to get the food they have planted so they can bring it to their houses and eat it. Jesus used this as a metaphor to teach his followers that they need to go and tell other people about Jesus so those people can be part of God’s kingdom. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]])\n\n### “The Samaritan woman”\n\nJohn probably told this story to show the difference between the Samaritan woman, who believed, and the Jews, who did not believe and would later kill Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/believe]])\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### “in spirit and truth”\n\nThe people who truly know who God is and enjoy worshiping him for who the Bible says he is are the ones who truly please him. The place where they worship him is not important.

JHN	4	45	ews8		ἐδέξαντο αὐτὸν οἱ Γαλιλαῖοι	1		Since this verse gives the result of Jesus saying in the previous verse that a prophet was not honored in his own country, it is important to indicate that welcoming Jesus was not the same as honoring him.

JHN	5	intro	qe17			0		# John 5 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n1. Jesus’ third sign: he heals a paralyzed man (5:1–9)\n2. Jewish leaders oppose Jesus’ ministry (5:10–18)\n3. Jesus says he is equal with God (5:19–30)\n4. Jesus’ witnesses are John the Baptist, Jesus’ works, God, and the Scriptures (5:31–47)\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Healing water\n\nMany of the Jews believed that God would heal people who got into some of the pools in Jerusalem when the waters were “stirred up.” The man Jesus healed in this chapter was one of those people ([5:2–7](../05/02.md)).\n\n### Testimony\n\nIn the Bible, a testimony is what one person says about another person. What a person says about himself is not as important as what other people say about that person. In this chapter, Jesus tells the Jews that God had told them who Jesus was, so he did not need to tell them who he was ([5:34–37](../05/34.md)). This was because God had told the writers of the Old Testament what his Messiah would do, and Jesus had done everything they had written that he would do ([5:44–47](../05/44.md)).\n\n### The resurrection of life and the resurrection of judgment\n\nIn this chapter, Jesus mentions two resurrections, the resurrection of life and the resurrection of judgment ([5:28–29](../05/28.md)). Regarding the resurrection of life, God will make some people alive again and they will live with him forever because he gives them his grace. Regarding the resurrection of judgment, God will make some people alive again and they will live apart from him forever because he will treat them justly.\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### The Son, the Son of God, and the Son of Man\n\nJesus refers to himself in this chapter as the “Son” ([5:19](../05/19.md)), the “Son of God” ([5:25](../05/25.md)), and the “Son of Man” ([5:27](../05/27.md)). Your language may not allow people to speak of themselves as if they were speaking about someone else. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])\n\n### “Son of Man”\n\nJesus refers to himself as the “Son of Man” in this chapter ([5:27](../05/27.md)). Your language may not allow people to speak of themselves as if they were speaking about someone else. See the discussion of this concept in Part 3 of the General Introduction to the Gospel of John. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sonofman]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

JHN	5	10	o8eq	figs-explicit	οὐκ ἔξεστίν σοι ἆραι τὸν κράβαττον σου	1		Here, the Jewish leaders (who were probably Pharisees) said this because they thought that the man was doing work by carrying his mat, and so he was disobeying God’s command to rest and not work on the Sabbath.

JHN	6	intro	xe4t			0		# John 6 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n1. Jesus’ fourth sign: Jesus feeds a large crowd (6:1–14)\n2. Jesus’ fifth sign: Jesus walks on the Sea of Galilee (6:15–21)\n3. Jesus says he is the bread of life (6:22–71)\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### King\n\nThe king of any nation was the richest and most powerful person in that nation. The people wanted Jesus to be their king because he gave them food. They thought he would make the Jews into the richest and most powerful nation in the world. They did not understand that Jesus came to die so God could forgive his people’s sins and that the world would persecute his people.\n\n## Important metaphors in this chapter\n\n### Bread\n\nBread was the most common and important food in Jesus’ day, so the word “bread” was their general word for “food.” It is often difficult to translate the word “bread” into the languages of people who do not eat bread because the general word for food in some languages refers to food that did not exist in Jesus’ culture. Jesus used the word “bread” to refer to himself. He wanted them to understand that they need him so they can have eternal life, just as people need food to sustain physical life. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])\n\n### Eating the flesh and drinking the blood\n\nWhen Jesus said, “unless you would eat the flesh of the Son of Man and would drink his blood, you do not have life in yourselves,” he was speaking figuratively of believing in his sacrificial death on the cross for the forgiveness of sins. He also knew that before he died he would tell his followers to commemorate this sacrifice by eating bread and drinking wine. In the event this chapter describes, he expected that his hearers would understand that he was using a metaphor but would not understand what the metaphor referred to. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/flesh]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/blood]])\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### Parenthetical Ideas\n\nSeveral times in this passage, John explains something or gives the reader some background information to better understand the story. These explanations are intended to give the reader some additional knowledge without interrupting the flow of the narrative. This information is placed inside parentheses.\n\n### “Son of Man”\n\nJesus refers to himself as the “Son of Man” several times in this chapter. Your language may not allow people to speak of themselves as if they were speaking about someone else. See the discussion of this concept in Part 3 of the General Introduction to the Gospel of John. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sonofman]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

JHN	6	27	hmfw	figs-extrainfo	τὴν βρῶσιν τὴν μένουσαν εἰς ζωὴν αἰώνιον	1		Here, John records Jesus using the word **food** figuratively to refer to himself because he is the source of salvation who gives **eternal life** to all who trust him.

Therefore, you do not need to explain its meaning further here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])
JHN	6	27	plfi	figs-ellipsis	τὴν βρῶσιν τὴν μένουσαν εἰς ζωὴν αἰώνιον	1		John records Jesus leaving out a word that a clause would need in many languages to be complete.

JHN	6	27	czb3	figs-distinguish	ἣν ὁ Υἱὸς τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου ὑμῖν δώσει	1	eternal life which the Son of Man will give you	This phrase could give further information about: (1) “the food that endures to eternal life.” Alternate translation: “that is, the food the Son of Man will give you” (2) “eternal life.” Alternate translation: “that is, the life the Son of Man will give you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish]])

JHN	6	29	he3q	figs-explicit	τοῦτό ἐστιν τὸ ἔργον τοῦ Θεοῦ, ἵνα πιστεύητε εἰς ὃν ἀπέστειλεν ἐκεῖνος	1		Here, Jesus says which **work** one must do in order to receive “the food that endures to eternal life” that was mentioned in verse [27](../06/27.md). This **work** is not any kind of labor or deed that can be done, but faith in Jesus, which is a gift from God ([Ephesians 2:8–9](../eph/02/08.md)). If this might confuse your readers, you could say the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “This is the work of God that is required to receive the food that endures to eternal life: that you believe in the one whom that one has sent” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JHN	6	29	aevl	figs-123person	ὃν ἀπέστειλεν ἐκεῖνος	1		This phrase refers to Jesus. He is referring to himself in the third person.

JHN	6	31	t3jt	figs-explicit	οἱ πατέρες ἡμῶν τὸ μάννα ἔφαγον ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ	1		In this verse, John assumes that his readers will know that the crowd is referring to a story recorded in the Old Testament book of Exodus. In that story, the Israelites complained against Moses and Aaron because they were hungry. God responded by providing a flake-like food that fell from the sky and could be baked into bread. The people called this flake-like food “manna.” (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/manna]]) You could indicate this explicitly if it would be helpful to your readers, particularly if they would not know the story. Alternate translation: “Our fathers ate the manna when they were wandering in the wilderness after leaving Egypt” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JHN	6	31	gye7	figs-metaphor	οἱ πατέρες ἡμῶν	1	Our fathers	The crowd used **fathers** figuratively to refer to their ancestors. If this might confuse your readers, you could say the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Our ancestors” or “Our forefathers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JHN	6	31	jz9p	figs-activepassive	ἐστιν γεγραμμένον	1	heaven	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “the prophets wrote in the Scriptures” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
JHN	6	31	bc59	writing-quotations	ἐστιν γεγραμμένον	1	heaven	Here the crowd uses **it is written** to introduce a quotation from an Old Testament book ([Psalm 78:24](../../psa/78/24.md)). If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable phrase that indicates that the crowd is quoting from an important text. Alternate translation: “it had been written in the scriptures” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
JHN	6	31	gzqv	figs-quotesinquotes	ἐστιν γεγραμμένον, ἄρτον ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ ἔδωκεν αὐτοῖς φαγεῖν	1		If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “it is written that he gave them bread from heaven to eat” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
JHN	6	31	fjoo	writing-pronouns	ἄρτον ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ ἔδωκεν αὐτοῖς φαγεῖν	1		**He** here could refer to: (1) Moses, in which case the crowd was mistakenly quoting a scripture about God and applying it to Moses. This is possible because Jesus says in the next verse, “Moses has not given you the bread from heaven.” Alternate translation: “Moses gave them bread from heaven to eat” (2) God, which is who it referred to in the scripture the crowd is quoting. Alternate translation: “God gave them bread from heaven to eat” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
JHN	6	31	iiaz	figs-synecdoche	ἄρτον	1		Here, John records the crowd using the word **bread** figuratively to represent food in general that is needed to sustain life. The manna that God gave the Israelites from heaven was not **bread**, but a food that could be baked into **bread**. Alternate translation: “food” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
JHN	6	32	e6s1	figs-doublet	ἀμὴν, ἀμὴν, λέγω ὑμῖν	1	Truly, truly	Jesus uses this phrase to emphasize the truth of the statement that follows. See how you translated this is in [1:51](../01/51.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
JHN	6	32	qgs7		οὐ Μωϋσῆς δέδωκεν ὑμῖν	1		Here, John records Jesus speaking in a way that emphasizes that **Moses** was not the source of manna in the wilderness. He seems to be correcting the crowd’s incorrect understanding of the scripture they quoted in the previous verse. Use whatever form best communicates this kind of negative emphasis in your language. Alternate translation: “Moses was not the one who has given you”
JHN	6	32	qwcf	figs-synecdoche	τὸν ἄρτον	1		Here, John records Jesus using the word **bread** figuratively to represent food in general that is needed to sustain life. The manna that God gave the Israelites from heaven was not **bread**, but a food that could be baked into **bread**. See how you translated this word in the previous verse. Alternate translation: “food” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
JHN	6	32	xwqx	figs-explicit	ἀλλ’ ὁ Πατήρ μου δίδωσιν	1		This phrase serves two purposes. First, it implies that the **Father** was the source of the bread from heaven mentioned by the crowd in the previous verse, not Moses. Second, it indicates that the **Father** is still giving bread from heaven, although not the kind of bread the crowd is expecting. If this might confuse your readers, you could say the meaning explicitly. You may also want to start a new sentence. Alternate translation: “Rather, my Father has given that bread and now gives” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JHN	6	32	ega4	figs-extrainfo	ὁ Πατήρ μου δίδωσιν ὑμῖν τὸν ἄρτον ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ τὸν ἀληθινόν	1	it is my Father who is giving you the true bread from heaven	Here, John records Jesus using **true bread** figuratively to refer to himself. However, the crowd does not understand this and Jesus does not tell them this plainly until verse [35](../06/35.md). Therefore, you do not need to explain its meaning further here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])
JHN	6	32	c73l	guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	ὁ Πατήρ μου	1	my Father	**Father** an important title for God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
JHN	6	32	an7w	figs-synecdoche	ἄρτον	2		See how you translated this word earlier in this verse and in the previous verse. Alternate translation: “food” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
JHN	6	33	ri0m	figs-extrainfo	ὁ…ἄρτος τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐστιν	1		Here, John records Jesus using **bread** figuratively to refer to himself. However, the crowd does not understand this and Jesus does not tell them this plainly until verse [35](../06/35.md). Therefore, you do not need to explain its meaning further here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])
JHN	6	33	sajx	figs-possession	ὁ…ἄρτος τοῦ Θεοῦ	1		This phrase could mean: (1) the bread came from God. Alternate translation: “the bread that God gives” (2) the bread belongs to God. Alternate translation: “God’s bread” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
JHN	6	33	sfbk	figs-extrainfo	ὁ καταβαίνων ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ	1		This phrase refers to Jesus. However, the crowd does not understand this and Jesus does not tell them this plainly at this time. Therefore, you do not need to explain its meaning further here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])
JHN	6	33	rrf5	figs-explicit	ζωὴν	1	gives life to the world	Here, **life** refers to eternal life. If this might confuse your readers, you could say the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation, as in the UST: “eternal life” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JHN	6	33	k897	figs-metonymy	τῷ κόσμῳ	1	the world	Here, **the world** refers to the people who live in it. Alternate translation: “the people living in the world” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
JHN	6	34	j26s		κύριε	1		The crowd calls Jesus **Sir** in order to show respect or politeness. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lord]])
JHN	6	34	z9zv	figs-synecdoche	τὸν ἄρτον	1		Here, **bread** could refer to: (1) food in general, as the word was used by the crowd in verse [31](../06/31.md). This would mean that the crowd did not understand that Jesus was calling himself the bread from heaven. Alternate translation: “food” (2) some gift from God that the crowd was uncertain of. This would mean that the crowd recognized that Jesus was talking about something more spiritual than mere food, but did not understand that he was talking about himself. Alternate translation: “heavenly food” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
JHN	6	35	cr2m	figs-exmetaphor	ἐγώ εἰμι ὁ ἄρτος τῆς ζωῆς	1	I am the bread of life	John records Jesus continuing the **bread** metaphor to refer figuratively to himself. In Jesus’ culture, **bread** was the primary food people ate to stay alive. Just as **bread** is necessary for sustaining physical life, Jesus is necessary for giving spiritual life. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could say this explicitly or with a simile. Alternate translation: “Just as food keeps you physically alive, I can give you spiritual life” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])
JHN	6	35	yq25	figs-possession	ὁ ἄρτος τῆς ζωῆς	1		John records Jesus using the possessive form to describe what produces **life**. If this is not clear in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “the bread that produces life” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
JHN	6	35	hvpi	figs-explicit	τῆς ζωῆς	1		Here, **life** refers to eternal life. If this might confuse your readers, you could say the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “of eternal life” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JHN	6	35	lgpu	figs-exmetaphor	ὁ ἐρχόμενος πρὸς ἐμὲ, οὐ μὴ πεινάσῃ; καὶ ὁ πιστεύων εἰς ἐμὲ, οὐ μὴ διψήσει πώποτε	1		Jesus speaks about the person who trusts in him by continuing the metaphor of food that he began in verse [32](../06/32.md). You could express this metaphor as a simile if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “The one coming to me will be like a person who never gets hungry, and the one believing in me will be like a person who never gets thirsty” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])
JHN	6	35	fpgo	figs-doublet	ὁ ἐρχόμενος πρὸς ἐμὲ, οὐ μὴ πεινάσῃ; καὶ ὁ πιστεύων εἰς ἐμὲ, οὐ μὴ διψήσει πώποτε	1		These two clauses mean basically the same thing. The repetition is used to emphasize that anyone who trusts in Jesus will never lack spiritual satisfaction. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could combine these phrases. Alternate translation: “The one who trusts me will certainly never lack spiritual satisfaction again” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
JHN	6	35	a7my	figs-explicit	ὁ ἐρχόμενος πρὸς ἐμὲ	1		Here, **coming** does not mean to merely come near Jesus. It means to believe in him and be his disciple. If this might confuse your readers, you could say the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “The one coming to be my disciple” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JHN	6	35	kh35	figs-litotes	οὐ μὴ πεινάσῃ…οὐ μὴ διψήσει πώποτε	1		John records Jesus using a figure of speech twice in the same verse to expresses a strong positive meaning by using a negative word together with a word that is the opposite of the intended meaning. If this is confusing in your language, you can express the meaning positively. Alternate translation: “will always be full … will always have his thirst quenched” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
JHN	6	37	vpz8	guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	Πατὴρ	1	Father	**Father** is an important title for God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
JHN	6	37	n6bk	figs-explicit	πρὸς ἐμὲ ἥξει…τὸν ἐρχόμενον πρός ἐμὲ	1		In this verse, **come** and **coming** do not mean to merely come near Jesus, but they mean to believe in him and be his disciple. If this might confuse your readers, you could say the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “will come to be my disciples … the one coming to be my disciple” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JHN	6	37	i92s	figs-litotes	τὸν ἐρχόμενον πρός ἐμὲ, οὐ μὴ ἐκβάλω ἔξω	1	he who comes to me I will certainly not throw out	John records Jesus using a figure of speech here to expresses a strong positive meaning by using a negative word together with a word that is the opposite of the intended meaning. If this is confusing in your language, you can express the meaning positively. Alternate translation: “I will keep everyone who comes to me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
JHN	6	38	z84i	grammar-connect-logic-result	ὅτι	1	Connecting Statement:	**For** introduces the reason why Jesus will not throw out anyone who comes to him. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “This is true because” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
JHN	6	38	cpi9	figs-explicit	τοῦ πέμψαντός με	1	him who sent me	Here, **the one who sent me** refers to God. See how you translated it in [4:34](../04/34.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

JHN	6	39	x5c1	figs-litotes	πᾶν ὃ…μὴ ἀπολέσω ἐξ αὐτοῦ	1	I would lose not one of all those	John records Jesus using a figure of speech here to expresses a strong positive meaning by using a negative word together with a word that is the opposite of the intended meaning. If this is confusing in your language, you can express the meaning positively. Alternate translation: “I should keep all of them whom he has given” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
JHN	6	39	p8s0	writing-pronouns	μὴ ἀπολέσω ἐξ αὐτοῦ, ἀλλὰ ἀναστήσω αὐτὸ	1		Here, **it** refers to the whole group of believers as a whole. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could say this explicitly or use a plural pronoun. Alternate translation: “I would not lose from the group of believers … but will raise that group up” or “I would not lose from them … but will raise them up” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])

JHN	6	52	fj5p	figs-rquestion	πῶς δύναται οὗτος ἡμῖν δοῦναι τὴν σάρκα φαγεῖν?	1	How can this man give us his flesh to eat?	This remark appears in the form of a question to emphasize that the Jewish leaders are reacting negatively to what Jesus has said about **his flesh**.

JHN	6	57	nhp9	figs-explicit	κἀγὼ ζῶ διὰ τὸν Πατέρα	1		Here, **because of the Father** indicates the reason why Jesus has the ability to cause life. God the Father gave Jesus the ability to cause others to live. Jesus explained this concept in [5:25–26](../05/25.md). If this might confuse your readers, you could say the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “and I cause life because the Father has enabled me to do so” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JHN	6	57	dba2	figs-extrainfo	καὶ ὁ τρώγων με	1	so he who eats me	The phrase **eating me** is a metaphor for trusting Jesus. However, the Jews did not understand this.

JHN	6	58	i9ih	figs-metaphor	οἱ πατέρες	1	the fathers	Here Jesus uses**fathers** figuratively to refer to ancestors. If this might confuse your readers, you could say the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the ancestors” or “the forefathers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JHN	6	58	r174	figs-ellipsis	οὐ καθὼς ἔφαγον οἱ πατέρες καὶ ἀπέθανον	1		John records Jesus leaving out some of the words that a clause would need in many languages to be complete. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could supply these words from the previous clause. Alternate translation: “this bread is not just as the bread that the fathers ate and died” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
JHN	6	58	lb07	figs-explicit	ἔφαγον οἱ πατέρες καὶ ἀπέθανον	1		The phrase **ate and died** does not mean that the people died immediately after eating the bread. If this wording would confuse your readers, you could translate it in a way that shows a time gap between eating and drinking. Alternate translation: “the fathers ate and still died at a later time” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JHN	6	58	j2hx	figs-123person	ὁ τρώγων τοῦτον τὸν ἄρτον	1	He who eats this bread	Jesus spoke about himself as **this bread**. Alternate translation: “He who eats me, the bread” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
JHN	6	58	jv4c	figs-extrainfo	ὁ τρώγων τοῦτον τὸν ἄρτον	1	He who eats this bread	Here, **eating this bread** is a metaphor for trusting Jesus. However, the Jews did not understand this. Therefore, you do not need to explain its meaning further here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])

Use the natural form in your language for expressing background information. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
JHN	6	59	ukxi	figs-explicit	ταῦτα	1		Here, **these things** refers to what Jesus said to the crowd and Jewish leaders in verses [26–58](../06/26.md).

JHN	6	60	t1me	figs-ellipsis	ἀκούσαντες	1		Here, John leaves out a word that a clause would need in many languages to be complete. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could supply these words from the context. Alternate translation: “having heard this” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
JHN	6	60	wf67	figs-metonymy	ἐστιν ὁ λόγος οὗτος	1		Here, **word** stands for what Jesus had just spoken to the crowd in verses [26–58](../06/26.md). If this would be confusing in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “What he has just said is” or “These words are” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
JHN	6	60	lmcv	figs-explicit	σκληρός	1		Here, **hard** refers to something that causes a negative reaction because it is harsh or unpleasant. It does not refer to something that is difficult to understand, but something that is difficult to accept. If this might confuse your readers, you could say the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “hard to accept” or “offensive” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JHN	6	60	cp3k	figs-rquestion	τίς δύναται αὐτοῦ ἀκούειν?	1		Here, the disciples use the question form for emphasis. If this would be confusing in your language, you could translate these words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “no one is able to listen to it!” or “it is too hard to listen to!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
JHN	6	61	rn8i	figs-explicit	εἰδὼς δὲ ὁ Ἰησοῦς ἐν ἑαυτῷ	1	Does this offend you?	This phrase implies that Jesus had supernatural knowledge. It indicates that Jesus knew what his disciples were saying even though he did not hear what they said. If it would be helpful to your readers, your could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “Even though no one told Jesus, he knew” or “Even though Jesus had not heard them, he was fully aware”(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JHN	6	61	g3z7	figs-explicit	περὶ τούτου…τοῦτο	1		In this verse, **this** refers to what Jesus had just spoken to the crowd in verses [26–58](../06/26.md).

JHN	6	62	r33r	figs-ellipsis	ἐὰν…θεωρῆτε τὸν Υἱὸν τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου, ἀναβαίνοντα ὅπου ἦν τὸ πρότερον?	1		Here, John records Jesus using only one part of a conditional sentence. He leaves out the second part of the conditional sentence for emphasis. Many languages need to have both parts of a conditional sentence in order to make the sentence complete. If this is true for your language, you could supply the second clause from the previous verse. Alternate translation: “if you would see the Son of Man going up to where he was before, would it offend you?” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
JHN	6	62	v4tr	figs-123person	τὸν Υἱὸν τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου, ἀναβαίνοντα ὅπου ἦν τὸ πρότερον	1		Jesus is speaking of himself in the third person. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this in the first person. Alternate translation: “me, the Son of Man, going up to where I was before” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
JHN	6	62	ibnq	figs-explicit	τὸν Υἱὸν τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου	1		See how you translated this phrase in [1:51](../01/51.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JHN	6	62	uxe0	figs-explicit	ὅπου ἦν τὸ πρότερον	1		This phrase refers to heaven, where Jesus was **before** he came down to earth. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “to heaven, where I used to be” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JHN	6	63	nx51	figs-explicit	τὸ Πνεῦμά ἐστιν τὸ ζῳοποιοῦν	1		Here, **making alive** refers to giving eternal life, not physical life. If this might confuse your readers, you could say the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “The Spirit is the one giving eternal life” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JHN	6	63	ygqi	figs-explicit	ἡ σὰρξ	1		Here, **the flesh** could refer to: (1) human nature. Alternate translation, as in the UST: “human nature” (2) Jesus’ body. Alternate translation: “my flesh” (3) both human nature and Jesus’ body. “your nature and my flesh” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JHN	6	63	y558	figs-explicit	οὐκ ὠφελεῖ οὐδέν	1	profits	Here, **profit** means to be beneficial or useful. It does not mean to earn money. If this might confuse your readers, you could say the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “has no benefit” or “is no help at all”(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JHN	6	63	fy9p	figs-metonymy	τὰ ῥήματα…ζωή ἐστιν	1		Here, **words** stands for the teachings that Jesus had just spoken to the crowd in verses [26–58](../06/26.md).

JHN	6	63	plw8		πνεῦμά ἐστιν	1		This could mean: (1) from the Spirit. Alternate translation: “are from the Spirit” (2) about the Spirit. Alternate translation: “are about the Spirit”
JHN	6	63	gb29		καὶ ζωή ἐστιν	1		This could mean: (1) give life. Alternate translation: “and they give life” (2) about life. Alternate translation: “and they are about life”
JHN	6	63	dz25	figs-explicit	ζωή	1		Here, **life** refers to eternal life. If this might confuse your readers, you could say the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation, as in the UST: “eternal life” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

Use the natural form in your language for expressing background information. Alternate translation: “Jesus said this because he knew from the start who did not believe and who would later betray him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
JHN	6	64	rlhr	figs-explicit	οἳ οὐ πιστεύουσιν…οἱ μὴ πιστεύοντες	1		The implied object of **believe** and **believing** is Jesus or Jesus’ teaching. If your language requires an object for these words, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “who do not believe in me … the ones not believing in me” or “who do not believe what I say … the ones not believing what I say” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JHN	6	65	e9ex	figs-explicit	διὰ τοῦτο	1		Here, **this** refers the information Jesus said in the previous verse. If it would be misunderstood for your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “Because of the disbelief I have just told you about” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JHN	6	65	c3cl	figs-explicit	οὐδεὶς δύναται ἐλθεῖν πρός με	1	no one can come to me unless it is granted to him by the Father	See how you translated the identical phrase in verse [44](../06/44.md). Alternate translation: “no one is able to come to be my disciple” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JHN	6	65	ckfz	writing-pronouns	ᾖ δεδομένον αὐτῷ	1		Here, the pronoun **it** refers to the ability to come to Jesus and be his disciple. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “the ability to come to me would be have been granted to him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
JHN	6	65	uvxb	figs-activepassive	ᾖ δεδομένον αὐτῷ ἐκ τοῦ Πατρός	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “the Father would give it to him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
JHN	6	65	g4za	guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	Πατρός	1	Father	**Father** is an important title for God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
JHN	6	66	o1pd	figs-idiom	ἀπῆλθον εἰς τὰ ὀπίσω	1		This phrase is an idiom that refers to going back to living the way one lived previously. Here, these people left Jesus to go back to living the way they had lived before they met him. If this phrase would be confusing in your language, you could say its meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “returned to their former manner of living” or “went back to their previous way of life” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
JHN	6	66	h8j9	figs-metaphor	οὐκέτι μετ’ αὐτοῦ περιεπάτουν	1	no longer walked with him	Although Jesus did walk from one place to another, here **walking** is used figuratively to refer to how a person lives and behaves. These people we **no longer** living according to Jesus’ teaching and thus were no longer his disciples. If this might confuse your readers, you could say the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “no longer obeyed his teachings” or “no longer were his disciples” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JHN	6	67	bg2f	figs-nominaladj	τοῖς δώδεκα	1	the twelve	John is using the adjective **Twelve** as a noun in order to indicate a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “the 12 apostles” or “the 12 men whom he had appointed to be apostles” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
JHN	6	67	hoye	translate-names	τοῖς δώδεκα	1		Alternatively, even if your language does not ordinarily use adjectives as nouns, you may be able to do that in this case, since this is a title by which the apostles were known. Even though it is a number, if you translate it as a title, as the ULT does, follow the conventions for titles in your language. For example, capitalize main words and write out numbers rather than use digits. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
JHN	6	67	ezer	figs-explicit	μὴ καὶ ὑμεῖς θέλετε ὑπάγειν?	1		John records Jesus asking this question in a way that expects a negative response. He does this to contrast **the Twelve** from the many other disciples who had just abandoned him. If your language has a question form that assumes a negative response, you should use it here. Alternate translation: “You probably do not want to go away also, am I right?” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JHN	6	68	n5ty	translate-names	Σίμων Πέτρος	1		**Simon Peter** is the name of a man who was Jesus’ disciple. He is sometimes referred to as **Simon** or **Peter**. See how you translated this name in verse [8](../06/08.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
JHN	6	68	g9l4	figs-rquestion	Κύριε, πρὸς τίνα ἀπελευσόμεθα?	1	Lord, to whom shall we go?	**Simon Peter** uses the form of a question to emphasize that he desires to follow only Jesus. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “Lord, we could never follow anyone but you!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
JHN	6	68	tiwh	figs-possession	ῥήματα ζωῆς αἰωνίου ἔχεις	1		John records **Peter** using the possessive form to describe a **word** that gives **eternal life**. If this is not clear in your language, you could use say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “You have words that give eternal life” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
JHN	6	68	v12o	figs-metonymy	ῥήματα	1		John records Peter using the term **words** figuratively to describe the things that Jesus taught by using words. Alternate translation: “teaching” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
JHN	6	69	o3w6	figs-exclusive	ἡμεῖς	1		When Peter says **we**, he is speaking of himself and the rest of the twelve disciples, so **we** would be exclusive. Your language may require you to mark this form. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
JHN	6	69	qu0n	figs-possession	ὁ Ἅγιος τοῦ Θεοῦ	1		John records **Peter** using the possessive form to describe a **the Holy One** who comes from **God**. If this is not clear in your language, you could use say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “the Holy One from God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
JHN	6	70	m9ys	figs-rquestion	οὐκ ἐγὼ ὑμᾶς τοὺς δώδεκα ἐξελεξάμην, καὶ ἐξ ὑμῶν εἷς διάβολός ἐστιν?	1	Did not I choose you, the twelve, and one of you is a devil?	Jesus gives this remark in the form of a question in order to emphasize that one of the twelve disciples will betray him. Alternate translation: “I chose you, the Twelve, myself, and one of you is a devil!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
JHN	6	70	k335	figs-nominaladj	τοὺς δώδεκα	1		See how you translated **the Twelve** in verse [67](../06/67.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
JHN	6	70	jl5i	figs-explicit	ἐξ ὑμῶν εἷς διάβολός ἐστιν	1		The word **devil** could mean: (1) one of Jesus’ twelve disciples was a wicked person whose thoughts and actions resembled those of the **devil** or was being influenced or controlled by the **devil**. It does not mean that this person actually was the devil in human form. It also does not imply that there is more than one devil. Alternate translation: “one of you is wicked like the devil” or “one of you is controlled by the devil” (2) one of Jesus’ twelve disciples was speaking harmful and untrue things about Jesus to others. This meaning is possible because the word translated **devil** can also mean “slanderer.” Alternate translation: “one of you is a slanderer” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JHN	6	71	z9yc	writing-background		0	General Information:	In this verse, John provides background information about what Jesus said in the previous verse. Use the natural form in your language for expressing background information. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
JHN	6	71	joha	translate-names	Ἰούδαν Σίμωνος Ἰσκαριώτου	1		**Judas** and **Simon** are names of two men. This **Simon** is not the same as Simon Peter. **Iscariot** is a distinguishing term that most likely means he came from the village of Kerioth. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
JHN	6	71	lttr	figs-nominaladj	τῶν δώδεκα	1		See how you translated **the Twelve** in verse [67](../06/67.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
JHN	7	intro	l712			0		# John 7 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n1. Jesus goes to Jerusalem for the Festival of Shelters (7:1–13)\n2. Jesus says his authority is from God (7:14–24)\n3. Jesus says he came from God (7:25–31)\n4. Jesus says he will return to God (7:32–36)\n5. Jesus says he is the living water (7:37–39)\n6. The people disagree about who Jesus is (7:40–44)\n7. The Jewish leaders disagree about who Jesus is (7:45–53)\n\nTranslators may wish to include a note at [verse 53](../07/53.md) to explain to the reader why they have chosen or chosen not to translate [verses 7:53–8:11](../07/53.md). These verses are not in the best and oldest ancient manuscripts. If the translators have chosen to translate these verses, then they will want to either put them in a footnote outside of the main text or mark them in some way, such as square brackets ([ ]), to indicate that the passage may not have originally been in John’s Gospel.\n(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### “Believing in him”\n\nA recurring theme in this chapter is the concept of believing Jesus to be the Messiah. Some people believed he was the Messiah while others did not. Some were willing to recognize his power and even the possibility that he was a prophet, but most were unwilling to believe that he was the Messiah. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/christ]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]])\n\n### “My time has not yet come”\n\nThis phrase and “his hour had not yet come” are used in this chapter to indicate that Jesus is in control of the events that are happening in his life.\n\n### “Living water”\n\nThis is an important metaphor used in the New Testament to refer to the Holy Spirit. See the discussion of this metaphor in the note about “living water” for [4:10](../04/10.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### Prophecy\n\nIn [verses 33–34](../07/33.md) Jesus gives a prophecy about his return to heaven without explicitly indicating his statement as prophecy.\n\n### Irony\n\nNicodemus explains to the other Pharisees that the Law requires them to hear directly from a person before making a judgment about that person. The Pharisees in turn made a judgment about Jesus without speaking to Jesus.\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### “Did not believe in him”\n\nJesus’ brothers did not believe that Jesus was the Messiah at the time the events in this chapter took place. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/believe]])\n\n### “The Jews”\n\nThis term is used in two different ways in this passage. It is used specifically to refer to the Jewish leaders who opposed Jesus and were trying to kill him ([7:1](../07/01.md), [11](../07/11.md), [13](../07/13.md), [15](../07/15.md), [35](../07/35.md)). It is also used in [verse 2](../07/02.md) to refer to Jewish people in general. The translator may wish to use the terms “Jewish leaders” and “Jewish people” to clarify this distinction.
JHN	7	1	b99m	writing-newevent	μετὰ ταῦτα	1	After these things	This introduces a new event that happened some time after the events the story has just related. The story does not say how long after those events this new event happened. Use the natural form in your language for introducing a new event. Alternate translation: “Some time later” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
JHN	7	1	r94g	figs-synecdoche	οἱ Ἰουδαῖοι	1	the Jews	Here and throughout this chapter, **the Jews** refers to the Jewish leaders. Apart from one exception in verse [2](../07/02.md), it does not refer to the Jewish people in general. See how you translated this term in [1:19](../01/19.md). Alternate translation: “the Jewish authorities” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
JHN	7	2	n2ud	writing-background	ἦν δὲ ἐγγὺς ἡ ἑορτὴ τῶν Ἰουδαίων ἡ σκηνοπηγία	1		In this verse, John briefly stops telling about the events in the story in order to give background information about when the events happened. Use the natural form in your language for expressing background information. Alternate translation: “This event took place near the time of the Shelters Festival, the festival of the Jews” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
JHN	7	2	m4ch	figs-explicit	τῶν Ἰουδαίων	1		Unlike in the previous verse and throughout this chapter, **the Jews** here refers to the Jewish people in general. It does not refer to the Jewish leaders. If this might confuse your readers, you could say the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “of the Jewish people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JHN	7	3	x8ce	translate-kinship	οἱ ἀδελφοὶ αὐτοῦ	1	brothers	These were Jesus’ younger **brothers**, the other sons of Mary and Joseph who were born after Jesus. Since the Father of Jesus was God and their father was Joseph, they were actually his half-brothers. That detail is not normally translated, but if your language has a specific word for a man’s younger brother, it would be appropriate to use it here. Alternate translation: “his younger brothers” or “his half-brothers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship]])
JHN	7	3	id2z	figs-explicit	σοῦ τὰ ἔργα ἃ ποιεῖς	1	the works that you do	Here, **works** refers to the powerful miracles that Jesus was performing. If this might confuse your readers, you could say the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “your miracles that you do” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JHN	7	4	by1h	figs-rpronouns	ζητεῖ αὐτὸς	1		Here, Jesus’ brothers use the reflexive pronoun **himself** in order to emphasize their belief that Jesus wants to make **himself** famous. If this use of **himself** would be confusing in your language, you could use another way to show emphasis in your language. Alternate translation: “seeks for his own benefit” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns]])
JHN	7	4	uj59		ζητεῖ αὐτὸς ἐν παρρησίᾳ εἶναι	1		Alternate translation: “seeks publicity for himself” or “seeks public attention”
JHN	7	4	mc8r	grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἰ ταῦτα ποιεῖς	1		John records Jesus’ brothers speaking as if this were a hypothetical possibility, but they mean that it is actually true. Although they didn’t believe that Jesus was the Messiah at this time, they did not deny that he was doing miracles. If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, and if your readers might misunderstand and think that what the brothers are saying is not certain, then you can translate his words as an affirmative statement. Alternate translation: “Since you do these things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
JHN	7	4	f33j	figs-metonymy	τῷ κόσμῳ	1	the world	Here, **the world** is used figurative to refer to all of the people in the world. If this use of **world** would be confusing in your language, you could say the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “to all people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
JHN	7	5	mz2b	writing-background	οὐδὲ γὰρ οἱ ἀδελφοὶ αὐτοῦ ἐπίστευον εἰς αὐτὸν	1	For even his brothers did not believe in him	This sentence is a break from the main story line as John provides some background information about the brothers of Jesus. Use the natural form in your language for expressing background information. Alternate translation: “Jesus’ brothers said this because even they didn’t believe in him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
JHN	7	5	bs7f	translate-kinship	οἱ ἀδελφοὶ αὐτοῦ	1	his brothers	See how you translated this in verse [3](../07/03.md). Alternate translation: “his younger brothers” or “his half-brothers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship]])
JHN	7	6	bcul	figs-pastforfuture	λέγει	1		Here John uses the present tense in past narration in order to call attention to a development in the story. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture]])
JHN	7	6	n5bj	figs-metonymy	ὁ καιρὸς ὁ ἐμὸς οὔπω πάρεστιν	1	My time has not yet come	This could mean: (1) It was not the right **time** for Jesus to go to Jerusalem for the festival because God had not yet told him to go. This meaning explains why he eventually went to the festival in verse [10](../07/10.md). Alternate translation: “Now is not the right time for me to go to Jerusalem” (2) It was not the right **time** for Jesus to publicly reveal himself as the Messiah, which is what his brothers wanted him to do. Alternate translation: “Now is not the right time for me to publicly reveal myself as the Messiah” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
JHN	7	6	z9gv	figs-yousingular	ὁ ὑμέτερος	1		All instances of “you” and **your** in verses [6–8](../07/06.md) are plural. They only refer to Jesus’ brothers. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
JHN	7	6	shs9		ὁ δὲ καιρὸς ὁ ὑμέτερος πάντοτέ ἐστιν ἕτοιμος	1	your time is always ready	Alternate translation: “but any time is good for you”
JHN	7	7	h7kv	figs-metonymy	οὐ δύναται ὁ κόσμος μισεῖν ὑμᾶς	1	The world cannot hate you	**The world** here refers figuratively to the people who live in the world.

JHN	7	35	ef1y	figs-explicit	τὴν διασπορὰν	1		Here, **dispersion** refers to the Jewish people who were spread across the Greek-speaking world that was outside of the land of Israel. If this might confuse your readers, you could say the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “the Jews who are dispersed” or “the Jews who are scattered” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JHN	7	35	g64h	figs-possession	τὴν διασπορὰν τῶν Ἑλλήνων	1		John records the **Jews** using the possessive form to describe the Jewish people who were dispersed among **the Greeks**.

Alternate translation: “the dispersion among the Greeks” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
JHN	7	36	ib6p	figs-metonymy	τίς ἐστιν ὁ λόγος οὗτος ὃν εἶπε	1	What is this word that he said	Here, **word** is used figuratively to refer to the meaning of the message that Jesus had shared.

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
JHN	7	36	dyy1		ζητήσετέ με, καὶ οὐχ εὑρήσετέ; καὶ ὅπου εἰμὶ ἐγὼ, ὑμεῖς οὐ δύνασθε ἐλθεῖν	1		See how you translated this in verse [34](../07/34.md).
JHN	7	37	elc6			0	General Information:	About three or four days has passed since the events described in verses [14–36](../07/14.md). It is now the last day of the Festival of Shelters and Jesus speaks to the crowd.

JHN	7	37	iy9e	figs-metaphor	ἐάν τις διψᾷ	1	If anyone is thirsty	Here Jesus uses **thirst** figuratively to refer to a person’s need for God, just as someone would **thirst** for water. If this might confuse your readers, you could say the meaning plainly or use a simile. Alternate translation: “If anyone may recognize your need for God like a thirsty person desires water” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JHN	7	37	ayn6	figs-metaphor	ἐρχέσθω πρός με καὶ πινέτω	1	let him come to me and drink	Here Jesus uses **come** and **drink** figuratively to refer together to believing in Jesus.

JHN	7	38	u9cx	figs-infostructure	ὁ πιστεύων εἰς ἐμὲ, καθὼς εἶπεν ἡ Γραφή	1	He who believes in me, just as the scripture says	If it would be natural in your language, you could change the order of these phrases. You will also need to adjust some words to fit the new order. Alternate translation: “As the scripture says about anyone who believes in me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
JHN	7	38	wtl7	figs-quotesinquotes	εἶπεν ἡ Γραφή, ποταμοὶ ἐκ τῆς κοιλίας αὐτοῦ ῥεύσουσιν ὕδατος ζῶντος	1		If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “the scriptures say that rivers of living water will flow from his stomach” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
JHN	7	38	q926	figs-personification	εἶπεν ἡ Γραφή	1		Here, **scripture** is referred to as though it were a person who could speak.

Alternate translation: “the prophets spoke in the scriptures” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
JHN	7	38	uw2q	figs-metaphor	ποταμοὶ…ῥεύσουσιν ὕδατος ζῶντος	1	rivers of living water will flow	Here Jesus uses **rivers** figuratively to refer to a constant and abundant flow of **living water**. If this might confuse your readers, you could say the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “an abundance of living water will flow” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JHN	7	38	yt75	figs-extrainfo	ὕδατος ζῶντος	1	living water	Jesus uses **living water** here figuratively to refer to the Holy Spirit who works in a person to save and transform them. However, since John explains this meaning in the next verse, you do not need to explain it further here. See how you translated **living water** in [4:10](../04/10.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])
JHN	7	38	y1zb	figs-explicit	ὕδατος ζῶντος	1		Here, **living** is used figuratively to mean “giving eternal life” or “causing people to live forever.” If this might confuse your readers, you could say the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “water that gives eternal life” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JHN	7	38	ebk7	writing-pronouns	αὐτοῦ	1		The pronoun **his** could refer to: (1) the person who believes in Jesus. This meaning is used in most Bible translations and assumes that a new sentence begins at the beginning of this verse. Alternate translation, as in the ULT: “his” (2) Jesus. This meaning is used in some ancient church writings and assumes that the sentence at the end of the previous verse continues into through **the one believing in me** in this verse. Alternate translation: “my” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
JHN	7	38	cx1q	figs-metonymy	ἐκ τῆς κοιλίας αὐτοῦ	1	from his stomach	Here the **stomach** is used figuratively to refer to the non-physical part of a person.

JHN	7	39	qbr1	figs-explicit	οὔπω…ἦν Πνεῦμα	1	the Spirit had not yet been given	John implies here that **the Spirit** would later come to dwell in those who trusted in Jesus. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “the Spirit had not yet come to dwell in the believers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JHN	7	39	n599	figs-explicit	οὐδέπω ἐδοξάσθη	1		Here the word **glorified** could refer to: (1) the time when Jesus would die on the cross and rise from the dead (see John [12:23](../12/23.md)). Alternate translation: “had not yet been crucified and resurrected” (2) the time when Jesus would ascend to his Father in heaven. [Acts 1–2](../act/01/01.md) records the Holy Spirit coming after Jesus went up to heaven. Alternate translation: “had not yet returned to God in glory” (3) both the crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension of Jesus. Alternate translation: “had not yet been glorified by his death, resurrection, and return to heaven” See the discussion of double meaning in Part 3 of the Introduction to the Gospel of John. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JHN	7	40	xvts	grammar-connect-time-sequential	οὖν	1		**Then** here indicates that what follows is the continuation of the narrative from verse [38](../07/38.md), which John had interrupted with background information in verse [39](../07/39.md). If your readers would misunderstand this reference to earlier events, you could show this relationship by using a fuller phrase. Alternate translation: “After Jesus had said this about the Holy Spirit” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
JHN	7	40	schi	grammar-collectivenouns	ἐκ τοῦ ὄχλου	1		See how you translated **crowd** in [5:13](../05/13.md). Alternate translation: “some from the group of people” or “some from the many people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns]])
JHN	7	40	ifli	figs-metonymy	τῶν λόγων τούτων	1		John uses the term **words** figuratively to describe the content of what Jesus had said by referring to something associated with it, the **words** he used to communicate it. if this use of **words** might confuse your readers, you could say the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “these things he was saying” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
JHN	7	40	shq8	figs-explicit	ὁ προφήτης	1	This is indeed the prophet	See how you translated **the prophet** in [1:21](01/21.md). Alternate translation: “the prophet whom God promised to send to us” (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit)
JHN	7	41	alq3	figs-rquestion	μὴ γὰρ ἐκ τῆς Γαλιλαίας ὁ Χριστὸς ἔρχεται	1	Does the Christ come from Galilee?	John records these people using the form of a question to add emphasis. If your readers would misunderstand this type of question, you could translate these words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “Indeed, the Christ surely does not come from Galilee!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
JHN	7	42	n8nb	figs-rquestion	οὐχ ἡ Γραφὴ εἶπεν, ὅτι ἐκ τοῦ σπέρματος Δαυεὶδ, καὶ ἀπὸ Βηθλέεμ, τῆς κώμης ὅπου ἦν Δαυεὶδ, ἔρχεται ὁ Χριστός?	1	Have the scriptures not said that the Christ will come from the descendants of David and from Bethlehem, the village where David was?	This remark appears in the form of a question to add emphasis. This group of people does not believe Jesus is the Messiah because they do not think he came from Bethlehem. If your readers would misunderstand this type of question, you could translate the words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “The scriptures surely say that the Christ will come from the seed of David and from Bethlehem, the village where David was!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
JHN	7	42	ep4z	figs-personification	οὐχ ἡ Γραφὴ εἶπεν	1	Have the scriptures not said	The **Scripture** is referred to as though it were a person who could speak.

JHN	7	43	h7d3	figs-abstractnouns	σχίσμα…ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ ὄχλῳ	1		If your readers would misunderstand the abstract noun **division**, you could translate it with an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “the crowd was divided” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

JHN	7	44	yv80	writing-pronouns	τινὲς…ἐξ αὐτῶν	1		Here, **them** refers to the people in the crowd whom Jesus had just spoken with, particularly those who were opposed to him.

JHN	7	44	rc64	figs-idiom	οὐδεὶς ἐπέβαλεν ἐπ’ αὐτὸν τὰς χεῖρας	1		See how you translated this phrase in verse [30](../07/30.md). Alternate translation: “no one grabbed him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
JHN	7	47	z95z	figs-explicit	μὴ καὶ ὑμεῖς πεπλάνησθε?	1	Have you also been deceived?	**The Pharisees** ask this question in a way that expects a negative response but also expresses uncertainty about that response.

Alternate translation: “Could it be possible that you have also been deceived?” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JHN	7	47	i47o	figs-activepassive	μὴ καὶ ὑμεῖς πεπλάνησθε	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

Here, **the Pharisees** use the form of a question to add emphasis. If your readers would misunderstand this type of question, you could translate these words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way.

JHN	7	50	u5ha	writing-background	ὁ ἐλθὼν πρὸς αὐτὸν πρότερον, εἷς ὢν ἐξ αὐτῶν	1	one of the Pharisees, who came to him earlier	John provides this information to remind us of who Nicodemus is and the conversation he had with Jesus that is recorded in [chapter 3](../03/01.md). Use the natural form in your language for expressing background information. Alternate translation: “this man was a Pharisee who had spoken with Jesus at an earlier time” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
JHN	7	50	yw8i		εἷς ὢν ἐξ αὐτῶν	1		Alternate translation: “although he was one of them” or “despite being one of them”
JHN	7	50	hj1u	figs-pastforfuture	λέγει	1		Here John uses the present tense in past narration in order to call attention to a development in the story. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture]])
JHN	7	51	ia3j	figs-rquestion	μὴ ὁ νόμος ἡμῶν κρίνει τὸν ἄνθρωπον, ἐὰν μὴ ἀκούσῃ πρῶτον παρ’ αὐτοῦ, καὶ γνῷ τί ποιεῖ?	1	Does our law judge a man … what he does?	This remark appears in the form of a question to add emphasis. If your readers would misunderstand this type of question, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “Our law certainly does not judge a man unless it might first hear from him and might know what he does!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
JHN	7	51	y8df	figs-personification	μὴ ὁ νόμος ἡμῶν κρίνει τὸν ἄνθρωπον, ἐὰν μὴ ἀκούσῃ πρῶτον παρ’ αὐτοῦ, καὶ γνῷ	1	Does our law judge a man	Here, Nicodemus speaks of the **law** as if it were a person. If this use of **law** is not natural in your language, you could express this meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “It is not written in our law that we may judge a man unless we might first hear from him and might know … is it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
JHN	7	51	c2h5	figs-genericnoun	τὸν ἄνθρωπον	1		Here, **a man** does not refer to a specific man. It refers to any man in general. Alternate translation: “any man” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])
JHN	7	52	pt91	figs-rquestion	μὴ καὶ σὺ ἐκ τῆς Γαλιλαίας εἶ?	1	Are you also from Galilee?	The Jewish leaders know that Nicodemus is not **from Galilee**. They ask this question as a way of scoffing at him. If your language does not use questions in this way, use another way to express the emphasis. Alternate translation: “You must also be one of those people from Galilee!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
JHN	7	52	k6pg	figs-ellipsis	ἐραύνησον καὶ ἴδε	1	Search and see	Here, John records the Jewish leaders leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete.

JHN	7	52	jm59	figs-explicit	προφήτης ἐκ τῆς Γαλιλαίας οὐκ ἐγείρεται	1	no prophet comes from Galilee	The Jewish leaders believed that Jesus came **from Galilee** and that no **prophet** in the scriptures came **from Galilee**. Therefore, based on their reasoning Jesus could not be a **prophet**. However, what they believed was incorrect. Jesus did not originally come from Galilee, but Bethlehem in Judea. Also, the prophet Jonah came **from Galilee** ([2 Kings 14:25](../2ki/14/25.md)) and [Isaiah 9:1–7](../isa/09/01.md) said that the Messiah would be a great light rising from Galilee. If your readers might not understand what the Jewish leaders are implying, you could say it explicitly. Alternate translation: “no prophet rises up from Galilee, so this man cannot be a true prophet” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JHN	7	52	i0im		ἐγείρεται	1		Here, **rises up** means to appear. Alternate translation: “appears”
JHN	7	53	s5fi	translate-textvariants		0	General Information:	The best early texts do not have [7:53–8:11](../07/53.md). The ULT has set them apart in square brackets ([ ]) to show that John probably did not include them in his original text. Translators are encouraged to translate them, to set them apart with square brackets, and to include a footnote like the one written on [John 7:53](../07/53.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
JHN	8	intro	e667			0		# John 8 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n1. Jesus forgives the adulterous woman [8:1–11](../08/01.md)\n2. Jesus says he is the light of the world (8:12–20)\n3. Jesus says he came from above (8:21–30)\n4. Jesus says he frees people from sin (8:31–36)\n5. Jesus describes the true children of Abraham and the children of Satan (8:37–47)\n6. Jesus is greater than Abraham (8:48–59)\n\nTranslators may wish to include a note at [verse 1](../08/01.md) to explain to the reader why they have chosen to translate or to not translate [verses 8:1–11](../08/01.md). [Verses 7:53–8:11](../07/53.md) are not in the best and oldest ancient manuscripts. Those ancient texts which do have these verses also have many differences between them, which are additional evidence that these verses were not originally in the Gospel of John. If the translators have chosen to translate these verses, then they will want to either put them in a footnote outside of the main text or mark them in some way, such as square brackets ([ ]), to indicate that the passage may not have originally been in John’s Gospel. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Light and darkness\n\nGenerally in John’s Gospel, light represents what is true and good and darkness represents what is false and evil. Similar to the discussion of light in [1:4–9](../01/04.md), in [8:12](../08/12.md) Jesus applies the light metaphor to himself in order to show that he is the embodiment of God’s truth and goodness. Jesus calls himself the Light of the World because he is the one who enables people to know God’s truth and goodness. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/light]])\n\n### I AM\n\nJohn records Jesus saying these words as an independent phrase three times in this chapter ([8:24](../08/24.md), [28](../08/28.md), [58](../08/58.md)). They stand alone as a complete sentence, and they literally translate the Hebrew expression “I AM,” by which Yahweh identified himself to Moses in Exodus [3:14](../exo/03/14.md). For these reasons, many people believe that when Jesus said these words he was claiming to be Yahweh. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/yahweh]]).\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### “Son of Man”\n\nJesus refers to himself as the “Son of Man” in this chapter ([8:28](../08/28.md)). Your language may not allow people to speak of themselves as if they were speaking about someone else. See the discussion of this concept in Part 3 of the General Introduction to the Gospel of John. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sonofman]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
JHN	8	1	mkz2	translate-textvariants		0	General Information:	While some texts have [7:53–8:11](../07/53.md), the best and earliest texts do not include them. See the discussion of this textual issue in the General Notes to this chapter. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
JHN	8	12	m4ma	writing-newevent		0		Jesus is speaking to a crowd near the treasury in the temple some time after the events of [John 7:1–52](../07/01.md). John does not mark the beginning of this new event. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
JHN	8	12	k5ib	figs-metaphor	ἐγώ εἰμι τὸ φῶς τοῦ κόσμου…ἀλλ’ ἕξει τὸ φῶς	1	I am the light of the world	Here Jesus uses **light** figuratively to refer to God’s truth and goodness that are revealed to the world by Jesus. He is the embodiment of God’s truth and goodness. See the discussion of **light** and **darkness** in the General Notes to this chapter. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could use a simile. Alternate translation: “I am the one who reveals God’s truth and goodness to the world that is like a light … but will have that truth and goodness” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JHN	8	12	yc5p	figs-metonymy	τοῦ κόσμου	1	the world	Here, **world** refers figuratively to all the people in the world. If this use of **world** would be confusing in your language, you could say the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the people of the world” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
JHN	8	12	zf41	figs-idiom	ὁ ἀκολουθῶν ἐμοὶ	1	he who follows me	Here, John records Jesus using an idiom that refers to becoming Jesus’ disciple and obeying his teachings. If this use of **following** would be confusing in your language, you could say the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the one who becomes my disciple” or “the one who obeys me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
JHN	8	12	tse3	figs-metaphor	οὐ μὴ περιπατήσῃ ἐν τῇ σκοτίᾳ	1	will not walk in the darkness	Here Jesus uses the phrase **walk in the darkness** figuratively to refer to living a sinful life. If this might confuse your readers, you could use a simile. Alternate translation: “may certainly not live as if he were living in the darkness of sin” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JHN	8	12	vw7r	figs-possession	φῶς τῆς ζωῆς	1	light of life	Here, John records Jesus using the the possessive form to describe **light** that gives **life**. If this use of the possessive form is not clear in your language, you could use a different expression. Alternate translation: “light that brings life” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
JHN	8	12	lvdg	figs-explicit	τῆς ζωῆς	1		Here, **life** refers to eternal **life**. If this might confuse your readers, you could say the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “of eternal life” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JHN	8	13	ih9h	figs-explicit	σὺ περὶ σεαυτοῦ μαρτυρεῖς	1	You bear witness about yourself	The Pharisees assumed that their listeners understood that they were referring to Jesus testifying about himself without there being any other witnesses to confirm his **testimony**. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “You are testifying about yourself without any other witnesses” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JHN	8	13	mrj6	figs-explicit	ἡ μαρτυρία σου οὐκ ἔστιν ἀληθής	1	your witness is not true	The Pharisees are implying that the **testimony** of only one person **is not true** because of a rule in the law of Moses. According to Deuteronomy [19:15](../deu/19/15.md), a statement had to be confirmed by at least two witnesses in order to be considered true in legal decisions. If your audience is not familiar with the law of Moses in the Old Testament, then you can say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “your testimony about yourself cannot be true because the law of Moses requires at least two witnesses” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JHN	8	14	bh68	figs-you	ὑμεῖς δὲ οὐκ οἴδατε	1		In verses [14–20](../08/14.md) Jesus uses the plural form of **you** to indicate that he is speaking to the Pharisees. He is not speaking directly to those who believe in him. If it would be misunderstood to your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “but you Pharisees do not know” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
JHN	8	15	k92s	figs-metaphor	τὴν σάρκα	1	the flesh	Here Jesus uses **the flesh** figuratively to refer to human standards. Such standards are superficial and based on the limitations of sinful human nature. If this might confuse your readers, you could say the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “standards limited by human nature” or “superficial human standards” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JHN	8	15	j79i	figs-ellipsis	ἐγὼ οὐ κρίνω οὐδένα	1	I judge no one	This could mean: (1) Jesus does not judge anyone in the same manner as the Pharisees, that is, **according to the flesh**. Alternate translation: “I do not judge anyone according to the flesh” (2) Jesus is not judging anyone at that time. Alternate translation: “I do not judge anyone at this time” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
JHN	8	16	ys2e	figs-abstractnouns	ἡ κρίσις ἡ ἐμὴ	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for this idea, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **judgment** in another way. Alternate translation, as in the UST: “I judge” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
JHN	8	16	jb2f		ἡ κρίσις ἡ ἐμὴ ἀληθινή ἐστιν	1	my judgment is true	Here, Jesus is contrasting the nature of the Pharisees’ **judgment** with the nature of his own **judgment**. Alternate translation: “my judgment is right” or “my judgment is according to what is true”
JHN	8	16	ev1r	figs-explicit	μόνος οὐκ εἰμί	1	I am not alone	Here, Jesus implies that he is **not alone** when he judges people. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say this explicitly.

JHN	8	17	r2r8	figs-activepassive	γέγραπται	1	it is written	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Jesus implies that “Mosses” did it. Alternate translation: “Moses wrote” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
JHN	8	17	l6ln	figs-explicit	δύο ἀνθρώπων ἡ μαρτυρία ἀληθής ἐστιν	1	the testimony of two men is true	Here, Jesus is referring to a rule in the law of Moses. According to Deuteronomy [19:15](../deu/19/15.md), a statement had to be confirmed by at least two witnesses in order to be considered true in legal decisions. If it would be helpful to your readers, then you can say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “if the testimony of two men agrees, then it is valid” or “if two men say something that agrees, then it should be considered to be true” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JHN	8	18	gfd3	figs-explicit	μαρτυρεῖ περὶ ἐμοῦ ὁ πέμψας με Πατήρ	1	the Father who sent me bears witness about me	In addition to Jesus himself, God the **the Father** also **testifies about** Jesus. Jesus thus implies that his testimony is true because there are two witnesses. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “my Father who sent me also brings evidence about me. So you should believe that what we tell you is true” or “my Father who sent me also testifies about me. Therefore, my testimony is true” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

If this might confuse your readers, you could say the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “You know neither who I am nor who my Father is; if you had known who I am, you would have known who my Father is also” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

JHN	8	19	wcd1	grammar-connect-condition-contrary	εἰ ἐμὲ ᾔδειτε, καὶ τὸν Πατέρα μου ἂν ᾔδειτε.	1		Here, Jesus is making a conditional statement that sounds hypothetical, but he is already convinced that the condition is not true. He knows that the Pharisees do not know who he really is and do not really know God. Use a natural form in your language for introducing a condition that the speaker believes is not true. Alternate translation: “you do not know me, because if you did, you would also know my Father” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-contrary]])
JHN	8	20	p01r	writing-background		0		In this verse, John finishes telling about the events in the story by giving background information about where these events happened. Use the natural form in your language for expressing background information. Some languages may require the information about the setting to be placed at the beginning of this part of the story in [8:12](../08/12.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
JHN	8	20	xa7h	figs-metonymy	ταῦτα τὰ ῥήματα	1		Here, **these words** refers to what Jesus had just spoken in verses [12–19](../08/12.md).

JHN	8	20	witr	translate-unknown	τῷ γαζοφυλακίῳ	1		A **treasury** is the place where treasures are stored.

JHN	8	21	lxox	figs-extrainfo	ἐγὼ ὑπάγω…ὅπου ἐγὼ ὑπάγω	1		Two times in this verse Jesus uses **go away** figuratively to refer to his death and return to God in heaven.

JHN	8	21	d70v	figs-genericnoun	ἐν τῇ ἁμαρτίᾳ ὑμῶν	1		Here, **sin** is singular. This could refer to one: (1) the specific sin of rejecting Jesus as the Messiah.

JHN	8	21	m0w8	figs-infostructure	ὅπου ἐγὼ ὑπάγω, ὑμεῖς οὐ δύνασθε ἐλθεῖν	1		If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases. Alternate translation: “you are not able to come to where I go” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])

JHN	8	22	upxp	figs-explicit	μήτι ἀποκτενεῖ ἑαυτὸν	1		John records the Jewish leaders using the form of a question in a way that expects a negative response, but also expresses uncertainty about that response. If your language has a question form that assumes a negative response with uncertainty, you should use it here. Alternate translation: “Could it be possible that he will kill himself?” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JHN	8	22	vskt	figs-quotesinquotes	ὅτι λέγει, ὅπου ἐγὼ ὑπάγω ὑμεῖς, οὐ δύνασθε ἐλθεῖν	1		If the direct quotation inside a direct quotation would be confusing in your language, you could translate the second direct quotation as an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: “Is that why he says that where he goes, we will not be able to come” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
JHN	8	22	mi1t		ὅπου ἐγὼ ὑπάγω ὑμεῖς, οὐ δύνασθε ἐλθεῖν	1		See how you translated this clause in the previous verse.
JHN	8	23	oc6i	figs-you	ὑμεῖς ἐκ τῶν κάτω ἐστέ	1		In verses [23–30](../08/23.md) Jesus uses the plural form of **you** to indicate that he is speaking to the Jewish leaders. He is not speaking directly to those who believe in him. If it would be misunderstood to your readers, you could say this explicitly.

JHN	8	23	w3vx	figs-metonymy	τούτου τοῦ κόσμου…τοῦ κόσμου τούτου	1		Here, **this world** refers to everything in the universe that has been corrupted by sin and is hostile to God. If this use of **world** might be misunderstood by your readers, you could say the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “this sinful world … this sinful world” or “this world that opposes God … this world that opposes God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
JHN	8	24	jgw4		ἀποθανεῖσθε ἐν ταῖς ἁμαρτίαις ὑμῶν…ἐγώ εἰμι, ἀποθανεῖσθε ἐν ταῖς ἁμαρτίαις ὑμῶν	1	you will die in your sins	This phrase **you will die in your sins** is different from the similar statement in verse [21](../08/21.md) because **sins** is plural in this verse but singular in that verse. Therefore, make sure that you translate **sins** differently than how you translated “sin” in verse [21](../08/21.md).
JHN	8	24	he1k	figs-explicit	ὅτι ἐγώ εἰμι	1	that I AM	This could mean: (1) Jesus is identifying himself as Yahweh, who identified himself to Moses as “I AM” in Exodus [3:14](../exo/03/14.md). Alternate translation: “that I am the I AM” (2) Jesus expects the people to understand that he is referring to what he already has already said about himself in the previous verse: “that I am from above” See the discussion of this phrase in the General Notes for this chapter. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

JHN	8	26	n3gf	figs-extrainfo	ὁ πέμψας με…παρ’ αὐτοῦ	1		These phrases refer to God. However, since the Jewish leaders did not understand what Jesus meant when he used these phrases, you do not need to explain their meaning further here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])

JHN	8	26	lsc7	figs-metonymy	ταῦτα λαλῶ εἰς τὸν κόσμον	1	these things I say to the world	Here, John records Jesus using **the world** figuratively to refer to the people who live in **the world**.

However, since Jesus did not yet reveal what he meant when he used this phrase, but was speaking ambiguously, you do not need to explain its meaning further here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])
JHN	8	39	qp2r	figs-metaphor	ὁ πατὴρ	1	father	Here the people use **father** figuratively to refer to their ancestor. If this might confuse your readers, you could say the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Our forefather” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JHN	8	39	wg9n	figs-pastforfuture	λέγει	1		Here John uses the present tense in past narration in order to call attention to a development in the story. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture]])
JHN	8	39	v7og	figs-metaphor	τέκνα τοῦ Ἀβραάμ	1		Here Jesus uses **children** figuratively to mean “descendants.” If this might confuse your readers, you could say the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “descendants of Abraham” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JHN	8	39	xcnx	figs-possession	τὰ ἔργα τοῦ Ἀβραὰμ	1		Jesus is using the possessive form to describe **works** that were done by **Abraham**. If this is not clear in your language, you could use a different expression. Alternate translation: “the works done by Abraham” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
JHN	8	40	s615	figs-explicit	τοῦτο Ἀβραὰμ οὐκ ἐποίησεν	1	Abraham did not do this	Here, **this** refers to what Jesus said earlier in the verse about what the Jews were trying to do to him. If it would be more natural in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “Abraham did not seek to kill someone who told him the truth from God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JHN	8	41	i87r	figs-extrainfo	ὑμεῖς ποιεῖτε τὰ ἔργα τοῦ πατρὸς ὑμῶν	1	You do the works of your father	Jesus uses the phrase **your father** to refer to the devil. However, since the Jews did not understand what Jesus meant when he used this phrase, you do not need to explain its meaning further here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])
JHN	8	41	y82e	figs-explicit	ἡμεῖς ἐκ πορνείας οὐ γεγεννήμεθα	1	We were not born in sexual immorality	Here, the Jews imply that Jesus does not know who his real father is and that he is the result of an immoral sexual relationship. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “We do not know about you, but we are not illegitimate children” or “We were all born from proper marriages” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JHN	8	42	nh4m	grammar-connect-condition-contrary	εἰ ὁ Θεὸς Πατὴρ ὑμῶν ἦν, ἠγαπᾶτε ἂν ἐμέ	1		Jesus is making a conditional statement that sounds hypothetical, but he already knows that the condition is not true. Jesus knows that the Jews speaking to him here do not love him and are not true followers of God. Use a natural form in your language for introducing a condition that the speaker believes is not true. Alternate translation: “God is surely not your father, because if he were, you would love me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-contrary]])
JHN	8	42	mk2w	figs-explicit	ἀπ’ ἐμαυτοῦ ἐλήλυθα	1		Here, **from** is used to indicate Jesus’ origin. He could only have authority if he came from God. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “have I come on my own authority” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JHN	8	42	p7iv	writing-pronouns	ἐκεῖνός	1		Here, **that one** refers to God the Father. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
JHN	8	43	ig11	figs-rquestion	διὰ τί τὴν λαλιὰν τὴν ἐμὴν οὐ γινώσκετε?	1	Why do you not understand my words?	Jesus is using a rhetorical question here to emphasize the truth of what he is saying. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “I will tell you why you do not understand what I say!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
JHN	8	43	yham	figs-metaphor	οὐ δύνασθε ἀκούειν τὸν λόγον τὸν ἐμόν	1		Here, **hear** means to listen to something with the intent to heed it and respond appropriately. It does not mean simply to hear what someone says. If this might confuse your readers, you could say the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “you are not able to heed my words” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JHN	8	43	cf8v	figs-metonymy	τὸν λόγον τὸν ἐμόν	1	It is because you cannot hear my words	Here, Jesus uses **words** figuratively to refer to his teachings.

JHN	8	44	vgy1	figs-explicit	ὑμεῖς ἐκ τοῦ πατρὸς τοῦ διαβόλου ἐστὲ	1	You are of your father, the devil	The phrase **from your father** could refer to: (1) the person to whom the subject belongs, as in the UST. (2) the origin of the subject. Alternate translation: “You came from your father, the devil” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JHN	8	44	csgm	writing-pronouns	ἐκεῖνος	1		Here, **that one** refers to **the devil**. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “The devil” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
JHN	8	44	pmda	figs-explicit	ἀνθρωποκτόνος ἦν ἀπ’ ἀρχῆς	1		Here, **the beginning** refers to the time when the first humans, Adam and Eve, sinned. It does not refer to the very beginning of time. The devil tempted Eve to sin and Adam sinned as well. Because they sinned, all living things die as part of the punishment for sin. Therefore, Jesus calls **the devil** a **murderer** for starting the process that brought death to the world. You could indicate this explicitly if it would be helpful to your readers, particularly if they would not know the story. Alternate translation: “was a murderer from the time when he tempted the first people to sin” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JHN	8	44	i1e4	figs-idiom	ἐν τῇ ἀληθείᾳ οὐκ ἔστηκεν	1		The phrase **does not stand in the truth** is an idiom that means to not accept or approve of what is true. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent idiom or use plain language. Alternate translation: “does not approve of the truth” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
JHN	8	44	j6rz	figs-metaphor	οὐκ ἔστιν ἀλήθεια ἐν αὐτῷ	1		Here Jesus speaks figuratively of **truth** as if it were an object that could exist inside someone. If this might confuse your readers, you could say the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “he never speaks the truth” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JHN	8	44	hqmo		ἐκ τῶν ἰδίων λαλεῖ	1		Alternate translation: “he speaks according to his character” or “he speaks what is most natural for him to speak”
JHN	8	44	k1qu	figs-metaphor	ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ	1	the father of lies	Here Jesus uses **father** figuratively to refer to the one who originated the act of lying. Since **the devil** is the first being to tell a lie, he is called the **father** of lying. If this might confuse your readers, you could say the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the one who created it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JHN	8	44	x11i	figs-explicit	ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ	1		Here, **it** refers to the act of lying. If this might confuse your readers, you could say the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “the father of lying” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JHN	8	46	y3gz	figs-rquestion	τίς ἐξ ὑμῶν ἐλέγχει με περὶ ἁμαρτίας?	1	Which one of you convicts me of sin?	John records Jesus using a rhetorical question here to emphasize that he has never sinned. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “None of you can convict me concerning sin!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
JHN	8	46	kh6a	grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἰ ἀλήθειαν λέγω	1	If I speak the truth	John records Jesus speaking as if this were a hypothetical possibility, but he means that it is actually true. If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, and if your readers might misunderstand and think that what John is saying is not certain, then you can translate his words as an affirmative statement. Alternate translation: “Since I speak the truth” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
JHN	8	46	ibp1	figs-rquestion	διὰ τί ὑμεῖς οὐ πιστεύετέ μοι?	1	why do you not believe me?	John records Jesus using a rhetorical question here to scold the Jews for their unbelief. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “you have no reason for not believing me!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
JHN	8	47	lien	figs-explicit	ὁ ὢν ἐκ τοῦ Θεοῦ…ἐκ τοῦ Θεοῦ οὐκ ἐστέ	1		The phrase **from God** could refer to: (1) the person to whom the subject belongs, as in the UST. (2) the origin of the subject. Alternate translation: “He who came from God … you did not come from God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JHN	8	47	nmmq	figs-gendernotations	ὁ ὢν ἐκ τοῦ Θεοῦ	1		Although **He** is masculine, Jesus is using the word here in a generic sense that includes both men and women. Alternate translation: “A person who is from God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])

JHN	8	48	vu1h	figs-synecdoche	οἱ Ἰουδαῖοι	1	The Jews	See how you translated **the Jews** in verse [31](../08/31.md). Alternate translation: “the Judeans” or “the Jewish leaders” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “We certainly say rightly that you are a Samaritan and have a demon!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
JHN	8	48	ovbe	figs-explicit	Σαμαρείτης εἶ σὺ	1		Most Jewish people in Jesus’ time hated and despised Samaritans, so his Jewish opponents here called Jesus a **Samaritan** in order to insult him.

JHN	8	50	wmmd	figs-abstractnouns	ζητῶ τὴν δόξαν μου	1	there is one seeking and judging	If your readers would misunderstand the abstract noun **glory**, you could express the idea behind it with a different expression.

JHN	8	50	fg43	figs-explicit	ἔστιν ὁ ζητῶν καὶ κρίνων	1	there is one seeking and judging	Here, **one** refers to God. If this might confuse your readers, you could say the meaning explicitly.

JHN	8	50	d00s	figs-ellipsis	ὁ ζητῶν	1		Here, Jesus is leaving out some of the words that a clause would need in many languages to be complete.

JHN	9	intro	hq31			0		# John 9 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n1. Jesus’ sixth sign: he heals a blind man (9:1–12)\n2. The Pharisees question the formerly blind man whom Jesus healed (9:13–34)\n3. Jesus speaks with the formerly blind man and some Pharisees (9:35–41)\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### “Who sinned?”\n\nMany of the Jews in Jesus’ time believed that if a person was blind or deaf or crippled, it was because he, his parents, or someone else in his family had sinned. The rabbis even taught that it was possible for a baby to sin while still in the womb. This was not the teaching of the law of Moses. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]])\n\n### “A sinner”\n\nThe Pharisees call some people in this chapter “sinners.” The Jewish leaders thought these people were sinful, but in reality the leaders were also sinful. This can be taken as irony. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])\n\n### “He does not keep the Sabbath”\n\nThe Pharisees thought that Jesus was working, and so breaking the Sabbath, by healing the blind man. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sabbath]])\n\n## Important metaphors in this chapter\n\n### Light and darkness\n\nThe Bible often speaks of unrighteous people, people who do not do what pleases God, as if they were walking around in darkness. It speaks of light as if it were what enables those sinful people to become righteous, to understand what they are doing wrong and begin to obey God. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]])\n\n### Seeing and being blind\n\nJesus uses the healing of the blind man as a metaphor for spiritual blindness. Just as a blind man cannot see the physical world, a man who is spiritually blind does not recognize God’s truth, which includes his sinfulness and need for salvation. The blind man in this story is first healed from his physical blindness ([9:6–7](../09/06.md)), then from his spiritual blindness ([9:38](../09/38.md)). By contrast, the Pharisees are not physically blind but are spiritually blind. Jesus calls the Pharisees blind because they have seen him do great miracles that only someone sent from God could do, but they still refuse to believe that God sent him or that they are sinners who need to repent ([9:39–40](../09/39.md)). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### “Son of Man”\n\nJesus refers to himself as the “Son of Man” in this chapter ([9:35](../09/35.md)). Your language may not allow people to speak of themselves as if they were speaking about someone else. See the discussion of this concept in Part 3 of the General Introduction to the Gospel of John. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sonofman]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
JHN	9	1	un4h	grammar-connect-words-phrases	καὶ	1	Now	**And** here shows that John intended for the events in this chapter to be directly connected to what Jesus said in the previous chapter. In [chapter 8](../08/01.md), Jesus said that he is the Light of the World. In this chapter, Jesus demonstrates that he is the Light of the World by giving physical sight and spiritual light to a blind man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
JHN	9	2	w44c	figs-explicit	τίς ἥμαρτεν, οὗτος ἢ οἱ γονεῖς αὐτοῦ, ἵνα τυφλὸς γεννηθῇ?	1	who sinned, this man or his parents … blind?	This question reflects the ancient Jewish belief that sin caused illnesses and other deformities. See the discussion of this in the General Notes for this chapter. Alternate translation: “Teacher, we know that sin causes a person to be blind. Whose sin caused this man to be born blind? did this man himself sin, or was it his parents who sinned?” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JHN	9	2	zzh8	figs-activepassive	ἵνα τυφλὸς γεννηθῇ	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “so that he might be blind when his mother bore him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

Therefore, they believed that he was disobeying God’s command to rest and not work on the Sabbath. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/works]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sabbath]]).

The Pharisees added many regulations which they considered to be equal with those that God had given. It was these additional regulations that Jesus was disobeying, thereby making the Pharisees very angry with him. If this might confuse your readers, you could say the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “he does not obeying our Sabbath regulations” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JHN	9	16	h0tt	figs-explicit	οὐκ ἔστιν οὗτος παρὰ Θεοῦ ὁ ἄνθρωπος	1		Here, **from** is used to indicate Jesus’ origin. He could only have authority if he came **from God**.

If this might confuse your readers, you could say the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “anything like healing a man blind from birth” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JHN	9	34	da3z	figs-rquestion	ἐν ἁμαρτίαις σὺ ἐγεννήθης ὅλος, καὶ σὺ διδάσκεις ἡμᾶς?	1	You were completely born in sins, and you are teaching us?	The Jewish leaders used a question to emphasize their belief that this man was not qualified to question their opinion. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “You were completely born in sins and not qualified to teach us!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
JHN	9	34	wo1z	figs-activepassive	ἐν ἁμαρτίαις σὺ ἐγεννήθης ὅλος	1	You were completely born in sins	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “Your mother bore you completely in sins” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
JHN	9	34	mcm3	figs-explicit	ἐν ἁμαρτίαις σὺ ἐγεννήθης ὅλος	1	You were completely born in sins	The Jewish leaders mention the formerly blind man being **born in sins** to imply that the **sins** of his parents had caused his blindness. If this might confuse your readers, you could say the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “You were born blind completely because of your parents’ sins” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JHN	9	34	kl2x	figs-metaphor	ἐξέβαλον αὐτὸν ἔξω	1	they threw him out	Here, **threw him out** is a metaphor for no longer being allowed to go into the synagogue and no longer belonging to the group of people who attend services at the synagogue. When people were thrown out of the synagogue, they were shunned by their local community. If this might confuse your readers, you could say the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “he was forbidden to enter the synagogue” or “he was forbidden to belong to the synagogue community” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JHN	9	35	z6r9			0	General Information:	Jesus finds the man whom he healed in ([verses 1–7](../09/01.md)) and begins to speak to him and the crowd.

Alternate translation: “they had forbidden him from entering the synagogue” or “they had forbidden him from belonging to the synagogue community” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JHN	9	35	mxkw	figs-explicit	εὑρὼν αὐτὸν	1		Here, **found** implies that **Jesus** had first searched for the man. It does not mean that Jesus unintentionally or accidentally met the man at another time. If it would be more natural in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “having looked for him and found him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JHN	9	35	tw58	figs-extrainfo	τὸν Υἱὸν τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου	1	the Son of Man	Here, Jesus refers to himself as the “Son of Man”. However, the formerly blind man did not realize that Jesus was speaking of himself and Jesus does not explain the metaphor to him until verse [37](../09/37.md). Therefore, you do not need to explain that Jesus is speaking about himself here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])
JHN	9	35	v3a0	figs-explicit	τὸν Υἱὸν τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου	1		See how you translated this phrase in [1:51](../01/51.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

JHN	9	37	z3rk	figs-123person	καὶ ὁ λαλῶν μετὰ σοῦ ἐκεῖνός ἐστιν	1		Here, Jesus is referring to himself in third person. If this is confusing in your language, you can use the first person form.

JHN	9	38	gf4d	figs-ellipsis	πιστεύω	1		Here, the formerly blind man is leaving out some words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could supply these words from [verse 36](../09/36.md). Alternate translation: “I believe that you are the Son of Man” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
JHN	9	39	azp3	figs-abstractnouns	εἰς κρίμα	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for this idea, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **judgment** in another way. Alternate translation: “In order to judge” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
JHN	9	39	te5y	figs-metaphor	ἵνα οἱ μὴ βλέποντες, βλέπωσιν; καὶ οἱ βλέποντες, τυφλοὶ γένωνται	1	so that those who do not see may see and so that those who see may become blind	Here, **not seeing**, **see**, **seeing**, and **become blind** are metaphors. See the discussion of these metaphors in the General Notes for this chapter. If these uses of these words would confuse your readers, you could use similes or say the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “so that those who know they are spiritually blind might receive spiritual sight, and those who falsely think they have spiritual sight might remain spiritually blind” or “so that those who recognize that they don’t know God might know him, and those who falsely think they know God might continue not knowing him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JHN	9	39	t9vo	grammar-connect-logic-goal	ἵνα οἱ μὴ βλέποντες, βλέπωσιν; καὶ οἱ βλέποντες, τυφλοὶ γένωνται	1	so that those who do not see may see and so that those who see may become blind	Here, **so that** could indicate that: (1) the rest of the verse is the result of Jesus’ **judgment**, which may require starting a new sentence. Alternate translation: “The result of my judgment will be that those not seeing might see and those seeing might become blind” (2) the rest of the verse is an explanation of the **judgment** Jesus mentioned at the beginning of the verse, which may also require starting a new sentence. Alternate translation: “That judgment is that those not seeing might see and those seeing might become blind” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
JHN	9	40	d8mm	figs-rquestion	μὴ καὶ ἡμεῖς τυφλοί ἐσμεν	1	Are we also blind?	John records several **Pharisees** using a rhetorical question here to emphasize that they do not think that they are spiritually blind. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “We surely are not also blind!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
JHN	9	40	c8zs	figs-metaphor	μὴ καὶ ἡμεῖς τυφλοί ἐσμεν	1	Are we also blind?	Here to be **blind** is a metaphor for not knowing God’s truth. If this might confuse your readers, you could say the meaning plainly or use a simile. Alternate translation: “We are not also ignorant of God’s truth, are we?” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JHN	9	41	rh3l	figs-metaphor	εἰ τυφλοὶ ἦτε, οὐκ ἂν εἴχετε ἁμαρτίαν	1	If you were blind, you would have no sin	See how you translated **blind** in [verses 39–40](../09/39.md).

JHN	9	41	bj0s	figs-metaphor	οὐκ ἂν εἴχετε ἁμαρτίαν…ἡ ἁμαρτία ὑμῶν μένει	1	If you were blind, you would have no sin	In these two phrases, Jesus speaks figuratively of **sin** as if it were an object that a person could possess or that could remain with a person. If this might confuse your readers, you could say the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “you would not be sinful … you are still sinful” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JHN	9	41	jmq7	figs-metaphor	λέγετε, ὅτι βλέπομεν, ἡ ἁμαρτία ὑμῶν μένει	1		See how you translated **see** in [verse 39](../09/39.md). Alternate translation: “you say, ‘We know God’s truth,’ your sin remains” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JHN	9	41	ch0y	figs-quotesinquotes	λέγετε, ὅτι βλέπομεν	1		If the direct quotation inside a direct quotation would be confusing in your language, you could translate the second direct quotation as an indirect quotation.

JHN	10	intro	e8mb			0		# John 10 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n1. Jesus tells the Parable of the Sheep Pen (10:1–6)\n2. Jesus says he is the gate of the sheep pen (10:7–10)\n3. Jesus says he is the Good Shepherd (10:11–18)\n4. The Jewish leaders disagree about who Jesus is (10:19–21)\n5. Jesus says he is God at the Festival of Dedication (10:22–42)\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Blasphemy\n\nBlasphemy is when a person claims that he is God or that God has told him to speak when God has not told him to speak. The law of Moses commanded the Israelites to kill blasphemers by throwing stones at them until they died. When Jesus said, “I and the Father are one,” the Jews thought he was blaspheming, so they picked up stones to kill him. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/blasphemy]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]])\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### Parable\n\nParables were short stories that Jesus told so that people who wanted to believe in him could easily understand the lesson he was trying to teach them. But people who did not want to believe in him would not be able to understand the message ([10:1–6](../10/01.md)).\n\n### Sheep\n\nJesus spoke metaphorically of people as sheep because sheep do not see well, do not think well, often walk away from those who care for them, and cannot defend themselves when other animals attack them. God’s people are similar to sheep in that they also are weak and do foolish things like rebelling against God. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/sheep]])\n\n### Sheep pen\n\nA sheep pen was a space with a stone wall around it in which shepherds would keep their sheep. There were large sheep pens in which multiple flocks were kept, and also smaller sheep pens for a single flock. Once they were inside the sheep pen, the sheep could not run away, and animals and thieves could not easily get inside to kill or steal them. In [10:1–5](../10/01.md), Jesus uses the sheep pen as a metaphor for the people of Israel. Out of the “sheep pen” of the Jewish people, Jesus calls his first “sheep.”\n\n### Laying down and taking up life\n\nJesus speaks of his life as if it were a physical object that he could: (1) lay down on the ground, which is a metaphor for dying, or (2) pick up again, which is a metaphor for becoming alive again.
JHN	10	1	gzd8	figs-parables		0	General Information:	In [verses 1–5](../10/01.md), Jesus speaks a parable, which he then uses for teaching purposes in [verses 7–18](../10/07.md). Here, the “shepherd” is a metaphor for Jesus and “sheep” is a metaphor for people. “His own sheep” are the people who follow Jesus, and the **thief**, **robber**, and “strangers” are the Jewish leaders, including the Pharisees, who try to deceive the people. Since Jesus does not explain the meaning of this parable here, you should not explain the metaphors within the parable itself. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])
JHN	10	1	ab9x			0	Connecting Statement:	In [verses 1–21](../10/01.md), Jesus continues to speak to the Pharisees whom he was speaking with at the end of the last chapter. This section continues the story which began in [9:35](../09/35.md).
JHN	10	1	i3tj	figs-doublet	ἀμὴν, ἀμὴν, λέγω ὑμῖν	1	Truly, truly	Jesus uses this phrase to emphasize the truth of the statement that follows. See how you translated this is in [1:51](../01/51.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
JHN	10	1	xq1f	translate-unknown	αὐλὴν τῶν προβάτων	1	sheep pen	A **sheep pen** is a fenced area where a shepherd keeps his sheep. See the discussion of this term in the General Notes for this chapter. If your readers would not be familiar with this way of protecting livestock, you could use a general expression for a roofless space surrounded by walls or a fence. Alternate translation: “the walled area for protecting the sheep” or “the place where sheep are kept” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
JHN	10	1	zz7x	figs-explicit	κλέπτης…καὶ λῃστής	1	a thief and a robber	The words translated **thief** and **robber** describe two different kinds of criminals. A **thief** is a person who steals by stealth, but a **robber** is a person who steals by force or violence. For this reason, you may want to use “or” instead of **and** between these two terms. Alternate translation: “a thief or a robber” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JHN	10	2	ib4y	figs-possession	ποιμήν…τῶν προβάτων	1		Jesus is using the possessive form to describe a **shepherd** who takes care of **the sheep**.

JHN	10	3	q48q	figs-ellipsis	ὁ θυρωρὸς ἀνοίγει	1	The gatekeeper opens	Jesus is leaving out some of the words that a clause would need in many languages to be complete.

JHN	10	3	db3c	figs-metaphor	τὰ πρόβατα τῆς φωνῆς αὐτοῦ ἀκούει	1	The sheep hear his voice	Here, **hear** could mean: (1) all the sheep in the pen **hear** the shepherd’s **voice**, but not all of them respond to it, as in the ULT. This meaning implies that there are multiple flocks in the sheep pen. (2) the sheep that belong to the shepherd heed or obey his **voice**. This is implies that **the sheep** are identical with **his own sheep**. Alternate translation: “the sheep heed his voice” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JHN	10	3	zxsd	figs-explicit	τὰ ἴδια πρόβατα φωνεῖ κατ’ ὄνομα	1		Here, **his own sheep** are designated as a separate group among **the sheep** of the previous clause.

JHN	10	4	n1ta	figs-explicit	ἔμπροσθεν αὐτῶν πορεύεται	1	he goes ahead of them	Shepherds in Jesus’ culture led their sheep by walking in front of them. If people who take care of livestock in your culture do not do this, you might need to say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “he leads them to pasture by walking in front of them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JHN	10	5	z8dm	grammar-collectivenouns	τῶν ἀλλοτρίων τὴν φωνήν	1		Here, the word **voice** is singular in form, but it refers to all of the strangers’ voices as a group. If your language does not use singular nouns in that way, you can use a different expression. Alternate translation: “the voices of strangers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns]])

Here, Jesus uses **gate** figuratively to say that he provides access into heaven, where God dwells. If this might confuse your readers, you could use a simile. Alternate translation: “I am like the gate” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JHN	10	7	wk8s	figs-possession	ἐγώ εἰμι ἡ θύρα τῶν προβάτων	1		Jesus is using the possessive form to describe himself as a **gate** that is for **the sheep** to use.

Not every leader of Israel throughout history was wicked, but most were. If this use of **Everyone** would be confusing in your language, you could say the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “Most leaders who came before me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
JHN	10	8	hqq3	figs-metaphor	κλέπται…καὶ λῃσταί	1	a thief and a robber	Here, Jesus uses **thief** and **robber** figuratively to refer to the Jewish leaders who were deceiving the people.

Alternate translation: “I said that you are gods” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
JHN	10	35	nfly			0		Verses 35 and 36 are one sentence. In this sentence, Jesus argues by moving from a weaker reason to a stronger reason (an argument from the lesser to the greater). Based on the scripture he quoted in verse 34, Jesus argues that, since God calls humans **gods** in that verse, it is even more appropriate to call him God because he is the Son of God. You may need to change the order of the clauses in order for this idea to be clearer in your language.

If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, and if your readers might misunderstand and think that what John is saying is not certain, then you can translate his words as an affirmative statement.

JHN	10	38	k2zf	figs-explicit	τοῖς ἔργοις πιστεύετε	1	believe in the works	Here, **believe in** means to acknowledge that the **works** Jesus does are done with the authority of the Father and prove that he is God.

JHN	11	intro	tks5			0		# John 11 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n1. Jesus returns to Judea (11:1–16)\n2. Jesus’ seventh sign: Jesus makes Lazarus become alive again (11:17–46)\n3. The Jewish leaders plan to kill Jesus (11:47–57)\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Ancient Jewish burial customs\n\nAccording to the burial customs of that time, a dead person’s family would wrap the dead body with many strips of linen cloth and place it on a table inside a tomb. The tomb was either a cave or a room cut out of the side a large rock. According to Jewish tradition, the body was left to decompose in the tomb for one-year. Then the family would place the bones in a stone box. If your readers would be unfamiliar with these burial customs, then you may need to provide explanations in your translation or in a note for [verses 38–44](../11/38.md).\n\n### Passover\n\nAfter Jesus made Lazarus become alive again, the Jewish leaders were determined to kill Jesus, so he started traveling secretly from place to place. The Pharisees knew that he would come to Jerusalem for the Passover festival because God had commanded all Jewish men to celebrate the Passover in Jerusalem. Thus they planned to catch him and kill him during Passover ([11:55–57](../11/55.md)). (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/passover]])\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### “Walks in the daytime” and “walks at night”\n\nIn [verses 9–10](../11/09.md) of this chapter, Jesus uses the idea of a person working in the light of day and stumbling in the darkness of night as a metaphor for his ministry on the earth. The “daytime” refers to the length of time that Jesus would do God’s work on the earth. The “night” refers to the end of his earthly ministry. This ministry would end when he “stumbled,” which refers to his death. Jesus uses this metaphor to comfort his disciples when worry they about him going to Judea ([11:8](../11/08.md)). He reassures them that, just as the daylight has a set length of time, so does his earthly ministry, and nothing can shorten that time.\n\n### “One man dies for the people”\n\nIn the law of Moses God commanded the priests to kill animals so that God would forgive the people’s sins. In this chapter, the high priest Caiaphas says, “It is better for you that one man dies for the people than that the whole nation perishes” ([11:50](../11/50.md)). He said this because he loved his “place” and “nation” ([11:48](../11/48.md)) more than he loved the God who had made Lazarus become alive again. He wanted Jesus to die so that the Romans would not destroy the temple and Jerusalem. However, God wanted Jesus to die so that he could forgive all of his people’s sins.\n\n### “The Jews”\n\nThis term is used in three different ways in this chapter. Unlike in other parts of John’s Gospel, it is used here primarily to refer to the Jewish people who were living in Judea, especially Judean friends and relatives of Lazarus. Some of these Judeans believed in Jesus and others opposed him ([11:36–37](../11/36.md)). The term is also used specifically at least once in this chapter to refer to the Jewish leaders who opposed Jesus and were trying to kill him ([11:8](../11/08.md) and possibly [11:54](../11/54.md)). Finally, the term is used in [11:55](../11/55.md) to refer to the Jewish people in general. The translator may wish to use the terms “Judeans,” “Jewish authorities,” and “Jewish people” to clarify these distinctions.\n\n### Hypothetical situation\n\nWhen Martha and Mary said, “If you had been here, my brother would not have died,” they were speaking of a situation that could have happened but did not happen ([11:21](../11/21.md), [32](../11/32.md)). Jesus had not come, and their brother had died.

JHN	11	1	p19k	translate-kinship	Μάρθας τῆς ἀδελφῆς αὐτῆς	1		Because those who write Scripture usually list the names of siblings in order from oldest to youngest, the list in [verse 5](../11/05.md) suggests that **Martha** was the oldest and **Lazarus** was the youngest of the three siblings. If your language uses different words for **sister** depending on birth order, use the word for an older **sister** here. Alternate translation: “her older sister Martha” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship]])
JHN	11	2	c6r9	figs-events	ἦν δὲ Μαρία ἡ ἀλείψασα τὸν Κύριον μύρῳ, καὶ ἐκμάξασα τοὺς πόδας αὐτοῦ ταῖς θριξὶν αὐτῆς	1	It was Mary who anointed the Lord … her hair	Here, John refers to an event that what would happen at a time after the events recorded in this chapter ([12:1–8](../12/01.md)). If this reference to an event that had not occurred yet in the story might be misunderstood by your readers, you could translate this as a future event. Alternate translation: “Now it was Mary who would later anoint the Lord with myrrh and wipe his feet with her hair” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-events]])
JHN	11	2	xlio	translate-kinship	ὁ ἀδελφὸς Λάζαρος	1		Because those who wrote Scripture usually list the names of siblings in order from oldest to youngest, the list in [verse 5](../11/05.md) suggests that Martha was the oldest and **Lazarus** was the youngest of the three siblings. If your language uses different words for **brother** depending on birth order, use the word for a younger **brother** here.

Alternate translation: “sent messengers to him” or “sent a message to him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
JHN	11	3	g1im	figs-declarative	Κύριε, ἴδε, ὃν φιλεῖς ἀσθενεῖ	1		Here, the **sisters** are using a present statement to make a request indirectly. They tell Jesus that Lazarus is **sick** because they want Jesus to come and heal him. If this use of a statement is confusing in your language, you can use a more natural form for instruction. Alternate translation: “Sir, behold, he whom you love is sick and needs your help” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative]])
JHN	11	3	czm1	figs-metaphor	ἴδε	1		Here, **behold** means to take notice of something or pay attention to something. It is used here to emphasize the urgency of the words that follow.

JHN	11	4	q343	grammar-connect-logic-goal	ἀλλ’ ὑπὲρ τῆς δόξης τοῦ Θεοῦ	1		Jesus is stating the purpose for Lazarus’s **sickness**. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a purpose clause.

Use the natural form in your language for expressing background information. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
JHN	11	5	w6tg	translate-kinship	τὴν ἀδελφὴν	1	Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus	Because those who wrote Scripture usually list the names of siblings in order from oldest to youngest, the list in [verse 5](../11/05.md) suggests that Martha was the oldest and Lazarus was the youngest of the three siblings.

JHN	11	6	vx3p	grammar-connect-logic-result	οὖν	1		**Therefore** connects this verse to the previous verse in order to indicate that Jesus delayed going to Lazarus because he loved him and his sisters. Jesus’ delay is not in contrast to his love for them. Although Lazarus’s family would suffer for a short time, they would experience a great blessing when Jesus brought Lazarus back to life. Alternate translation: “Because Jesus loved them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
JHN	11	7	zq1l	figs-pastforfuture	λέγει	1		Here John uses the present tense in past narration in order to call attention to a development in the story. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture]])
JHN	11	8	p4x9	figs-synecdoche	οἱ Ἰουδαῖοι	1	the Jews	Here, **the Jews** refers to the Jewish leaders. It does not refer to the Jewish people in general.

Alternate translation: “the Jewish authorities” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
JHN	11	8	y4jm	figs-rquestion	πάλιν ὑπάγεις ἐκεῖ?	1	Rabbi, right now the Jews are trying to stone you, and you are going back there again?	Here, the disciples use the form of a question to emphasize that they do not want Jesus to go to Jerusalem. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate these words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “you surely should not go back there again!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
JHN	11	9	uv34	figs-rquestion	οὐχὶ δώδεκα ὧραί εἰσιν τῆς ἡμέρας?	1	Are there not twelve hours of light in a day?	Jesus uses the form of a question for emphasis. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate these words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “There are surely 12 hours in the day” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

In this metaphor, Jesus uses **the light of this world** figuratively to refer to himself, who has previously called himself “the Light of the World” in [8:12](../08/12.md) and [9:5](../09/05.md). He also uses **stumble** figuratively to refer to death. The statement in this verse has a similar meaning to Jesus’ statement in [9:4](../09/04.md). Jesus does not want his disciples to worry about him going to Judea because he will be safe as long God wants him to remain on the earth. If this metaphor would be confusing in your language, you could say the meaning plainly or use a simile. See the discussion of this passage in the General Notes for this chapter. Alternate translation: “Just as someone who walks in the daytime does not stumble because they can see in the light, so you do not need to worry about me while I, the Light of the World, am still with you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

Jesus uses the idea of **someone** walking **at night** figuratively to refer to the time when his earthly ministry would be complete and he would die and leave the earth. Jesus uses **night** figuratively to refer to the time when his ministry on earth would end. He uses **stumble** figuratively to refer to his death, and uses **light** figuratively to refer to his life. If this metaphor would be confusing in your language, you could say the meaning plainly or use a simile. See the discussion of this passage in the General Notes for this chapter. Alternate translation: “But just as someone who walks at night stumbles because there is no light, so I will die when it is time for me, the Light of the World, to leave” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])

JHN	11	11	bev5	figs-euphemism	Λάζαρος ὁ φίλος ἡμῶν κεκοίμηται	1	Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep	Jesus uses **fallen asleep** to refer to being dead. This is a polite way of referring to something unpleasant. Since Jesus explains the meaning in [verse 14](../11/14.md), you do not need to explain it here. However, If you have an idiom for this idea in your language, you may use it here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
JHN	11	11	ze1z	figs-idiom	ἀλλὰ πορεύομαι ἵνα ἐξυπνίσω αὐτόν	1	but I am going so that I may wake him out of sleep	Here, Jesus uses the phrase **wake him out of sleep** figuratively to refer to his plan to bring Lazarus back to life. If you have an idiom for this idea in your language, you may use it here. Since the disciples do not understand what Jesus is saying here, do not translate this in a non-figurative way. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
JHN	11	12	hn2j	figs-euphemism	εἰ κεκοίμηται	1	if he has fallen asleep	See how you translated **fallen asleep** in the previous verse. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])

JHN	11	14	azy3		τότε…εἶπεν αὐτοῖς ὁ Ἰησοῦς παρρησίᾳ	1	Then Jesus said to them plainly	Here, **plainly** means to say something clearly without using and metaphors or others figures of speech. Because the disciples did not understand the metaphor Jesus told them in [verse 11](../11/11.md), he told them the meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “Jesus then said to them in words that they could understand”

JHN	11	52	mle1	figs-metaphor	τὰ τέκνα τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	children of God	Here John uses the word **children** figuratively to express the relationship between God and those who trust Jesus for salvation. That relationship is like the relationship between **children** and their father. See the discussion of this phrase in the General Notes to chapter 1. Since this is an important metaphor in the Bible, you should keep it in your translation. However, you can use a simile if it might confuse your readers. Alternate translation: “those who are like God’s children” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JHN	11	52	tpe1	figs-activepassive	ἵνα καὶ τὰ τέκνα τοῦ Θεοῦ, τὰ διεσκορπισμένα συναγάγῃ εἰς ἕν	1		If your language does not use the passive voice, you could express the ideas of these two passive phrases in active forms or in another way that is natural in your language.

JHN	11	53	xyda	grammar-connect-logic-result	οὖν	1	would be gathered together into one	John is telling his readers what the Jewish leaders did as a result of what Caiaphas said in [verses 49–50](../11/49.md).

JHN	11	53	psay		ἐβουλεύσαντο	1		The word translated **plotted** could mean: (1) the Jewish leaders made plans together for how to kill Jesus. Alternate translation: “they schemed” (2) the Jewish leaders were determined to kill Jesus. Alternate translation: “they resolved”
JHN	11	54	bnd8	figs-synecdoche	παρρησίᾳ περιεπάτει ἐν τοῖς Ἰουδαίοις	1	walk openly among the Jews	Here, **the Jews** does not refer to the Jewish people in general.

JHN	11	54	s9km	figs-metaphor	παρρησίᾳ περιεπάτει ἐν τοῖς Ἰουδαίοις	1		Here, John uses **walked openly** figuratively to mean “walked around where everyone could see him.” If this might confuse your readers, you could say the meaning plainly.

JHN	11	54	h5jk	figs-explicit	κἀκεῖ ἔμεινεν μετὰ τῶν μαθητῶν	1	There he stayed with the disciples	Jesus and his disciples **stayed** in Ephraim for a short period of time. If your language requires a length of time for **stayed**, you can use a general expression. Alternate translation: “There he stayed with the disciples for a short period of time” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JHN	11	55	qd5y		ἀνέβησαν…εἰς Ἱεροσόλυμα	1	went up to Jerusalem	The phrase **went up** is used here because Jerusalem is at a higher elevation than the surrounding areas. See how you translated **went up** in [7:10](../07/10.md).
JHN	11	55	zh3j	translate-names	τὸ Πάσχα…πρὸ τοῦ Πάσχα	1		Here, **Passover** is the name of a festival. If it would be helpful for your readers, you could say this explicitly.

JHN	11	56	a5kt	figs-events		0	General Information:	The event in [verse 57](../11/57.md) occurs before the event in this verse.

JHN	11	56	kc75	writing-pronouns	ἐζήτουν…τὸν Ἰησοῦν	1	They were looking for Jesus	Here, **they** refers to the Jewish people who had traveled to Jerusalem before the Passover Celebration, as described in the previous verse. If this use of **they** might be confusing in your language, you could say the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “the Jewish people who came to Jerusalem before the Passover Celebration were looking for Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
JHN	11	56	y3xz	figs-synecdoche	ἐν τῷ ἱερῷ	1		Since only priests could enter **the temple** building, this refers to **the temple** courtyard.

JHN	11	56	i7en	figs-idiom	τί δοκεῖ ὑμῖν	1	What do you think? That he will not come to the festival?	This is an idiom used to ask for someone’s opinion. If this expression would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent idiom or use plain language. Alternate translation: “What is your opinion” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
JHN	11	56	p2wz	figs-rquestion	ὅτι οὐ μὴ ἔλθῃ εἰς τὴν ἑορτήν?	1	What do you think? That he will not come to the festival?	The people are using a rhetorical question here to emphasize that they do not think Jesus will **come** to the **Passover** Festival. The speakers here were wondering if Jesus would come to the festival since the Jewish leaders wanted to kill him. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate these words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “He will certainly not come to the festival!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
JHN	11	56	x6im	figs-ellipsis	ὅτι οὐ μὴ ἔλθῃ εἰς τὴν ἑορτήν?	1		The people are leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could supply these words from the previous sentence. Alternate translation: “Does it seem to you that he will come to the festival?” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
JHN	11	57	glb6	figs-events	δὲ οἱ ἀρχιερεῖς	1	Now the chief priests	This event occurs before that of the previous verse. If this order might confuse your readers, you can combine these verses and put the text of this verse before the text of [verse 56](../11/56.md). Another option would be to clearly state that this verse refers to an earlier event. Alternate translation: “Earlier the chief priests” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-events]])
JHN	12	intro	qzv4			0		# John 12 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n1. Mary pours perfume on Jesus (12:1–11)\n2. Jesus enters Jerusalem (12:12–19)\n3. Some Greeks come to Jesus (12:20–26)\n4. Jesus predicts his death (12:27–36)\n5. John explains the Jews’ rejection of Jesus (12:37–43)\n6. Jesus says that he is God (12:44–50)\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry sections in [12:38](../12/38.md) and [40](../12/40.md), which are quotations from the Old Testament.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Mary poured perfume on Jesus’ feet\n\nThe Jews would put oil on a person’s head to make that person feel welcome and comfortable. They would also put oil on a person’s body after the person had died but before they buried the body. However, they would never think to put oil on a person’s feet, because they thought that feet were dirty.\n\n### The donkey and the colt\n\nJesus rode into Jerusalem on an animal, which was a common practice for kings. The kings of Israel in the Old Testament rode on donkeys. So by riding on a donkey Jesus was showing that he was the king of Israel.\n\n### Glory\n\nScripture often speaks of God’s glory as a great, brilliant light. When people see this light, they are afraid. In [12:16](../12/16.md) John says that the glory of Jesus is his resurrection and possibly his return to heaven as well.\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### Light and darkness\n\nIn [12:35–36, 46](../12/35.md), Jesus uses an extended metaphor in which light represents what is true and good and darkness represents what is false and evil. He applies that light metaphor to himself in order to show that he is the embodiment of God’s truth and goodness. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]])\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### Paradox\n\nA paradox is a true statement that appears to describe something impossible. A paradox occurs in [12:25](../12/25.md): “He who loves his life will lose it; but he who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life.” But in [12:26](../12/26.md) Jesus explains what it means to keep one’s life for eternal life.\n\n### “Son of Man”\n\nJesus refers to himself as the “Son of Man” several times in this chapter. Your language may not allow people to speak of themselves as if they were speaking about someone else. See the discussion of this concept in Part 3 of the General Introduction to the Gospel of John. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sonofman]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

JHN	12	3	qblr	figs-possession	μύρου νάρδου πιστικῆς πολυτίμου	1	perfume	John is using the possessive form to describe **perfumed oil** that is made from **very precious pure nard**.

JHN	12	4	frgx	translate-names	Ἰούδας ὁ Ἰσκαριώτης	1	the one who would betray him	**Judas** is the name of a man, and **Iscariot** is a distinguishing term that most likely means he came from the village of Kerioth. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

Judas is using a rhetorical question here to emphasize that he though the **perfumed oil** should not be poured on Jesus. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “This perfume could have been sold for 300 denarii and given to the poor!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
JHN	12	5	dx9e	translate-bmoney	δηναρίων	1	denarii	The word **denarii** is the plural form of “denarius,” which was a denomination of money in the Roman Empire that was equivalent to one days’ wages. Alternate translation: “for 300 days’ wages” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney]])
JHN	12	5	tted	figs-nominaladj	πτωχοῖς	1		Judas is using the adjective **poor** as a noun in order to describe a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way.

JHN	12	6	ri5l	writing-background		0		In this verse, John interrupts the story to explain why Judas made the statement in the previous verse. Use the natural form in your language for expressing background information. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])

JHN	12	6	ol4t	figs-activepassive	τὰ βαλλόμενα	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

In this case he would be leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete. This translation would require supplying those words from Judas’ objection in [verse 5](../12/05.md) and making a new sentence. Alternate translation: “Leave her alone. She did not sell this perfumed oil so that she might keep it for the day of my burial” (2) Jesus is giving the purpose for his command in the previous clause. In this case he would be implying that there was some leftover perfumed oil which Mary could later put on his dead body. Alternate translation: “Leave her alone so that she might keep it for the day of my burial” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
JHN	12	7	dcn3	figs-explicit	ἄφες αὐτήν, ἵνα εἰς τὴν ἡμέραν τοῦ ἐνταφιασμοῦ μου, τηρήσῃ αὐτό	1	Allow her to keep what she has for the day of my burial	If Jesus is stating the reason why Mary had the perfume, then Jesus is implying that Mary’s actions can be understood as anticipating his death and **burial**. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say this explicitly. You may need to add a new sentence. Alternate translation: “Leave her alone. She did not sell this perfumed oil so that she might keep it to prepare my body for burial, as she had just done” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

He uses the death of that **grain** to refer to his death, burial, and resurrection. He also uses **fruit** to refer to those people who will trust in him for salvation after his resurrection. Just as a seed is planted and grows into a plant that will bear **much fruit**, so will many people trust in Jesus after he is killed, buried, and raised back to life. If this would confuse your readers, you could use a simile or say the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I am like a grain of wheat. Unless that grain of wheat, having fallen into the earth, dies, it remains by itself; but if it would die, it bears much fruit” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

The word “hate” here does not refer to having negative feelings about one’s life or despising oneself. If this use of **hating** would confuse your readers, you could say the meaning explicitly.

JHN	13	intro	zk68			0		# John 13 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n1. The Passover Meal Begins: Jesus washes his disciples’ feet (13:1–20)\n2. Jesus predicts that Judas will betray him (13:21–30)\n3. Jesus commands his disciples to love each other (13:31–35)\n4. Jesus predicts that Peter will deny him (13:36–38)\n\nThe events of this chapter are commonly referred to as the “Last Supper.” This Passover meal parallels in many ways Jesus’ sacrifice as the lamb of God. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lordssupper]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/passover]])\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### The washing of feet\n\nPeople in the Ancient Near East thought that feet were very dirty. Only servants would wash people’s feet. The disciples did not want Jesus to wash their feet because they considered him to be their master and themselves to be his servants and it was a servant’s job to wash the feet of guests. However, Jesus wanted to show them that his disciples need to humbly serve and love each other. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])\n\n### I AM\n\nJohn records Jesus saying these words as an independent phrase one time in this chapter ([13:19](../13/19.md)). They stand alone as a complete sentence, and they literally translate the Hebrew expression “I AM,” by which Yahweh identified himself to Moses in [Exodus 3:14](../../exo/03/14.md). For these reasons, many people believe that when Jesus said these words he was claiming to be Yahweh. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/yahweh]]).\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### “The disciple whom Jesus loved”\n\nThe Apostle John first referred to himself as the disciple “whom Jesus loved” in this chapter ([13:23](../13/23.md)). Your language may not allow people to speak of themselves as if they were speaking about someone else. If this is the case, then you will need to add a first person pronoun to these references and the other references to John in ([13:23–25](../13/23.md). If your language can retain the third person references, then you may still want to make these references to John explicit by adding “John” next to them. See the discussion of this in Part 1 of the General Introduction to the Gospel of John. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/johntheapostle]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])\n\n### “Son of Man”\n\nJesus refers to himself as the “Son of Man” in this chapter ([13:31](../13/31.md)). Your language may not allow people to speak of themselves as if they were speaking about someone else. See the discussion of this concept in Part 3 of the General Introduction to the Gospel of John. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sonofman]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

JHN	13	6	bz27	figs-rquestion	Κύριε, σύ μου νίπτεις τοὺς πόδας?	1	Lord, are you going to wash my feet?	**Peter** is using a rhetorical question here to show that he does not want Jesus to wash his feet.

He also uses **feet** figuratively to refer to daily sins, because people in Jesus’ culture had to wash their **feet** frequently due to dirty roads. If this might confuse your readers, you could say their meanings clearly or use similes. Alternate translation: “The one who has received God’s forgiveness for their sins, only needs to be forgiven for his daily sins” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

The repetition is used to emphasize that Jesus’ disciples are not more important than him, so they should humbly serve each other.

Alternate translation: “just as I have loved you, so also you must love one another” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative]])
JHN	13	35	kyd9	figs-hyperbole	πάντες	1	everyone	Here, Jesus uses **everyone** as an exaggeration that refers only to those people who would see how the disciples love each other. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

Alternate translation: “I will show myself to him after I live again” (2) Jesus will reveal his character to the minds of anyone who loves and obeys him, as suggested by his statement in [verse 23](../14/23.md). Alternate translation: “I will reveal to him what I am like” (3) Jesus will both reveal himself to his disciples after his resurrection and reveal his character to everyone who loves and obeys him. Alternate translation: “I will reveal myself to him after I live again and will reveal what I am like” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JHN	14	22	r22b	translate-names	Ἰούδας, οὐχ ὁ Ἰσκαριώτης	1	Judas (not Iscariot)	Here, **Judas** is the name of a man who was another disciple of Jesus. He was not the other disciple named **Judas** who was from the village of Kerioth and betrayed Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
JHN	14	22	qet7	figs-pastforfuture	λέγει	1		Here John uses the present tense in past narration in order to call attention to a development in the story. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture]])
JHN	14	22	a7aa	figs-explicit	τί γέγονεν, ὅτι ἡμῖν μέλλεις ἐμφανίζειν σεαυτὸν	1	why is it that you will show yourself to us	**Judas** uses the expression **what has happened** to express his confusion about what Jesus said in the previous verse. The Jewish people were expecting the Messiah to come and reveal himself to the whole **world**, but Jesus said he would only show himself to his disciples. Therefore, **Judas** thinks something has caused Jesus to act differently than he had expected. If this would confuse your readers, you could say the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “what is causing you to only show yourself to us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JHN	14	22	v7dr	figs-exclusive	ἡμῖν	1	why is it that you will show yourself to us	When **Judas** says **us**, he is speaking of himself and Jesus’ other disciples, so **us** would be exclusive. Your language may require you to mark this form. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
JHN	14	22	gv3a	figs-metonymy	τῷ κόσμῳ	1	not to the world	Here, **world** refers to the people who live in it. Alternate translation: “to the people living in the world” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

JHN	14	23	ad6d	figs-exclusive	πρὸς αὐτὸν ἐλευσόμεθα, καὶ μονὴν παρ’ αὐτῷ ποιησόμεθα	1	My Father	When **Jesus** says **we** in this verse, he is speaking of himself and God the Father, so **we** would be exclusive. Your language may require you to mark this form. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
JHN	14	23	h9tl	figs-explicit	καὶ μονὴν παρ’ αὐτῷ ποιησόμεθα	1	we will come to him and we will make our home with him	This clause refers to God and **Jesus** dwelling within the person who **loves** and obeys **Jesus**. After Jesus’ resurrection and return to heaven, he and God live inside every believer through the Holy Spirit. If this might confuse your readers, you could say the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “and we will live within him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

JHN	14	24	c3ju	figs-metonymy	ὁ λόγος	1	The word	Here, **word** refers to what Jesus has just said in the preceding verses.

JHN	14	24	d7ay	figs-explicit	οὐκ ἔστιν ἐμὸς	1	that you hear	Here, **mine** refers to the source of what Jesus has said. What Jesus has said did not come from himself, but from God.

JHN	14	24	ke2f	figs-possession	τοῦ πέμψαντός με Πατρός	1		Jesus is using the possessive form to describe the source of **the word**.

JHN	14	24	az71	figs-explicit	τοῦ πέμψαντός με Πατρός	1		Here this phrase refers to God. See how you translated it in [5:23](../05/23.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

Alternate translation: “as my representative” or “in place of me” (2) with the authority of Jesus. Alternate translation: “with my authority” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
JHN	14	26	ig83	figs-hyperbole	πάντα	1		Here, **everything** is an exaggeration that Jesus uses for emphasis. He means that the **Holy Spirit** would teach the disciples all that they needed to know about what he had taught them. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could say the plain meaning. Alternate translation: “everything that you need to know about what I have said” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
JHN	14	27	t9c4	figs-abstractnouns	εἰρήνην ἀφίημι ὑμῖν; εἰρήνην τὴν ἐμὴν δίδωμι ὑμῖν	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for this idea, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **peace** in another way. Alternate translation: “I leave you a peaceful feeling; I give you my peaceful feeling” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
JHN	14	27	fb4o	figs-metaphor	εἰρήνην ἀφίημι ὑμῖν	1		Here Jesus speaks of **peace** figuratively as if it were an object that he could **leave** with someone. If this would confuse your readers, you could use a different expression. Alternate translation: “You will feel peace after I leave” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JHN	14	27	jve8	figs-ellipsis	οὐ καθὼς ὁ κόσμος δίδωσιν, ἐγὼ δίδωμι ὑμῖν	1		Jesus is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete.

Alternate translation: “I do not give to you peace as the world gives peace” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
JHN	14	27	i7gm	figs-explicit	οὐ καθὼς ὁ κόσμος δίδωσιν, ἐγὼ δίδωμι ὑμῖν	1		Here, **as the world gives** could mean: (1) the manner in which **the world gives** **peace**.

JHN	14	28	s8bx	figs-quotesinquotes	ἐγὼ εἶπον ὑμῖν, ὑπάγω καὶ ἔρχομαι πρὸς ὑμᾶς	1		If the direct quotation inside a direct quotation would be confusing in your language, you could translate the second direct quotation as an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: “I said to you that I am going away, and I will come back to you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
JHN	14	28	ayiy	grammar-connect-condition-contrary	εἰ ἠγαπᾶτέ με, ἐχάρητε ἄν	1		Jesus is making a conditional statement that sounds hypothetical, but he knows that the condition is not true. Jesus knows that at this point his disciples don’t truly love him in the way that they should. Use a natural form in your language for introducing a condition that the speaker believes is not true. Alternate translation: “If you loved me, but you don’t, you would be glad, but your aren’t” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-contrary]])
JHN	14	28	s3t3	figs-explicit	πορεύομαι πρὸς τὸν Πατέρα	1	I am going to the Father	Here Jesus implies that he will return to his **Father**. Alternate translation: “I am going back to the Father” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JHN	14	28	gtk5	figs-explicit	ὁ Πατὴρ μείζων μού ἐστιν	1	the Father is greater than I	Here Jesus could mean: (1) that the Father has greater authority than the Son while the Son is on the earth. Alternate translation: “the Father has greater authority than I have here” (2) that Jesus functions in a subordinate role to the Father for all time. Alternate translation: “the Father has a superior role than I have” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JHN	14	28	ymq4	guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	τὸν Πατέρα…ὁ Πατὴρ	1	Father	**Father** is an important title for God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
JHN	14	29	cj9y	figs-ellipsis	εἴρηκα ὑμῖν	1	Father	Jesus is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete.

Alternate translation: “I have told you this” or “I have told you what will happen” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
JHN	14	30	ah3s	figs-explicit	ὁ τοῦ κόσμου ἄρχων	1	ruler of this world	Here, **the ruler of this world** refers to Satan. See how you translated this phrase in [12:31](../12/31.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JHN	14	30	ea6m	figs-explicit	ἐν ἐμοὶ οὐκ ἔχει οὐδέν	1	ruler … is coming	Here **has nothing in me** means that Satan has no control over Jesus and cannot make him do anything. If this might confuse your readers, you could say the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “he is not able to control me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JHN	14	31	n3et	grammar-connect-logic-goal	ἀλλ’ ἵνα γνῷ ὁ κόσμος, ὅτι ἀγαπῶ τὸν Πατέρα, καὶ καθὼς ἐνετείλατο μοι ὁ Πατὴρ, οὕτως ποιῶ	1		Here, **so that** introduces a purpose clause. The first event that is done to accomplish this purpose could be: (1) a phrase Jesus left out that can be supplied from the context of the previous verses. Alternate translation: “but the ruler of this world is coming so that the world might know that I love the Father, and just as the Father commanded me, thus I do” or “but these things will happen so that the world might know that I love the Father, and just as the Father commanded me, thus I do” (2) what is stated later in the sentence, in which case the order of the clauses must be changed. Alternate translation: “but just as the Father commanded me, thus I do, so that the world might know that I love the Father” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])

JHN	15	intro	k9jd			0		# John 15 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n1. Jesus says he is the vine (15:1–8)\n2. Jesus commands his disciples to love each other (15:9–17)\n3. Jesus promises that his disciples will be persecuted (15:18–16:4)\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Vine\n\nJesus used the vine as a metaphor for himself. The vine of the grape plant takes water and minerals from the ground and gives them to the leaves and grapes that are on the branches. Without the vine, the branches, grapes, and leaves die. He wanted his followers to know that unless they loved and obeyed him, they would be unable to do anything that pleased God. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/vine]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/grape]], and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n### “Remain in me”\n\nJesus uses the word “remain” as a metaphor. He is speaking of a believer being spiritually joined to someone else as if the person “remained” in the other person. Christians are said to “remain” in Christ. The Son is said to “remain” in believers. Many translators will find it impossible to represent these ideas in their languages in exactly the same way. In ([15:7](../15/07.md)), the UST expresses this idea of “my words remain in you” as “obey what I have taught you.” Translators may find it possible to use this translation as a model.\n
JHN	15	1	aws2			0	Connecting Statement:	The part of the story from the previous chapter continues. Jesus continues to speak to his disciples either at the end of their evening meal or after they have finished that meal and are walking to Gethsemane. It is unclear whether or not they left immediately after Jesus said “Let us go from here” at the end of the previous chapter ([John 14:31](../14/31.md)).
JHN	15	1	fen5	figs-metaphor	ἐγώ εἰμι ἡ ἄμπελος ἡ ἀληθινή	1	I am the true vine	Here Jesus uses the **true vine** figuratively to refer to himself. As a **vine** is the source of life for its branches, so Jesus causes people to live in a way that pleases God and brings other people to believe in Jesus. Since the **vine** is an important metaphor in the Bible, you should translate the words directly or use a simile and not provide a non-figurative explanation in the text of your translation. Alternate translation: “I am like a true vine” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JHN	15	1	puzl	translate-unknown	ἡ ἀληθινή	1		The word translated **vine** refers specifically grapevine plant that produces grapes. If your readers would not be familiar with grapevines, use an equivalent word in your language for a **vine** that grows fruit. Alternate translation: “grapevine” or “fruit-producing vine” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
JHN	15	1	hqj7	guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	ὁ Πατήρ μου	1	my Father	**Father** is an important title for God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
JHN	15	1	w2d4	figs-metaphor	ὁ Πατήρ μου ὁ γεωργός ἐστιν	1	my Father is the gardener	Here, Jesus uses **farmer** figuratively to refer to God. Just as a **farmer** takes care of the**vine** to ensure it is as fruitful as possible, so God takes care of his people. If this might confuse your readers, you could use a simile. Alternate translation: “my Father is like a gardener” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JHN	15	1	t4ne		ὁ γεωργός	1	my Father is the gardener	While **farmer** is a general term for anyone who farms the ground, in this context it refers to someone who takes care of grapevines and grows grapes. Alternate translation: “vine grower” or “grape farmer”
JHN	15	2	p311	figs-exmetaphor	πᾶν κλῆμα ἐν ἐμοὶ μὴ φέρον καρπὸν…καὶ πᾶν τὸ καρπὸν φέρον…ἵνα καρπὸν πλείονα φέρῃ	1	He takes away every branch in me that does not bear fruit	Jesus speaks about people who claim to be his disciples but are not by continuing the metaphor of a vine. In this paragraph, Jesus uses **branch** figuratively to refer to both true and false disciples. He also uses **bearing fruit**, **bears fruit**, and **bear more fruit** figuratively to refer to living in a manner that pleases God, especially demonstrating the Christian qualities called the “fruit of the Spirit” in [Galatians 5:22–23](../../gal/05/22.md). You could express this metaphor as a simile if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “Everyone who claims to be my disciple but does not please God is like a branch in me that does not bear fruit … and every person who pleases God is like a branch that bears fruit … so that he might be like a branch that bears more fruit” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])
JHN	15	2	wt8w		αἴρει αὐτό	1	takes away	Alternate translation: “he cuts it off of the vine and takes it away” or “he breaks it off of the vine and throws it away”
JHN	15	2	enrh		καθαίρει αὐτὸ	1	takes away	The word translated **prunes** could mean: (1) remove excess parts from a plant. Alternate translation: “he trims it” (2) to cause something to become clean. Alternate translation: “he cleans it” (3) remove excess parts from a plant in order to make it clean. See the discussion of John’s use of double meaning in Part 3 of the Introduction to this book. Alternate translation: “he prunes it so that it will be clean”
JHN	15	3	xn3j	figs-metaphor	ἤδη ὑμεῖς καθαροί ἐστε	1	You are already clean because of the message that I have spoken to you	The word translated **clean** is related to the word translated “prunes” in the previous verse. Here Jesus uses **clean** to imply that the branches have already been cleaned by pruning off the excess parts. If this might confuse your readers, you could use a simile. Alternate translation: “You are like branches that have already been pruned and are clean” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JHN	15	3	ls0g	figs-metonymy	τὸν λόγον	1	You are already clean because of the message that I have spoken to you	Here, **word** refers to the message or teachings of Jesus. If your readers would misunderstand this use of **word**, you could say the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the message” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
JHN	15	3	l5zz	figs-you	ὑμεῖς…ὑμῖν	1	you	The words **You** and **you** in this verse are plural and refer to the disciples of Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
JHN	15	4	qvv9	figs-explicit	μείνατε ἐν ἐμοί, κἀγὼ ἐν ὑμῖν…ἐν ἐμοὶ μένητε	1	Remain in me, and I in you	See how you translated a similar phrase in [6:56](../06/56.md). See also the discussion of **Remain in me** in the General Notes for this chapter. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JHN	15	5	mw4t	figs-metaphor	ἐγώ εἰμι ἡ ἄμπελος; ὑμεῖς τὰ κλήματα	1	I am the vine, you are the branches	See how you translated **vine** in [verse 1](../15/01.md) and “branch” in [verse 2](../15/02.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JHN	15	5	r4di	figs-explicit	ὁ μένων ἐν ἐμοὶ κἀγὼ ἐν αὐτῷ	1	He who remains in me and I in him	See how you translated this similar expression in the previous verse. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JHN	15	5	hzh4	figs-metaphor	οὗτος φέρει καρπὸν πολύν	1	he bears much fruit	See how you translated **bears fruit** in [verse 2](../15/02.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JHN	15	5	b1qd	figs-explicit	ποιεῖν οὐδέν	1	he bears much fruit	Here Jesus uses **nothing** to refer to doing **nothing** that pleases God or to lack any spiritual fruit. It does not refer to doing **nothing** at all. If this would confuse your readers, you could say the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “do nothing that pleases God” or “do nothing acceptable to God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JHN	15	6	fgnm		ἐὰν μή τις μένῃ ἐν ἐμοί, ἐβλήθη ἔξω ὡς τὸ κλῆμα καὶ ἐξηράνθη, καὶ συνάγουσιν αὐτὰ καὶ εἰς τὸ πῦρ βάλλουσιν, καὶ καίεται	1		In middle of this verse, Jesus changes from referring to the **branch** in a singular form to a plural form. If this change would be confusing in your language, you could change the singular forms into plural forms. Alternate translation: “If people do not remain in me, they are thrown outside like branches and are dried up, and they gather them into the fire, and they are burned up”
JHN	15	6	d5mt	figs-explicit	μένῃ ἐν ἐμοί	1		See how you translated **remain in me** in the previous two verses. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JHN	15	6	h6cu	figs-activepassive	ἐβλήθη ἔξω ὡς τὸ κλῆμα καὶ ἐξηράνθη	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “the farmer throws him outside like a branch and he dries up” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
JHN	15	6	k1tm	figs-metaphor	τὸ κλῆμα	1	he is thrown away like a branch and dries up	Here Jesus uses **branch** figuratively to refer to someone who claims to be Jesus’ disciple but is not. See how you translated the similar use of **branch** in [verse 2](../15/02.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JHN	15	6	ura6	writing-pronouns	καὶ συνάγουσιν αὐτὰ καὶ εἰς τὸ πῦρ βάλλουσιν, καὶ καίεται	1	he is thrown away like a branch and dries up	The first **they** refers to an indefinite subject, but the second **they** refers to the object. If this would be confusing in your language, you could translate them differently. Alternate translation: “and some helpers gather them and throw them into the fire, and they are burned up” or “and someone gathers them and throws them into the fire, and those branches are burned up” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
JHN	15	6	e789	figs-activepassive	καίεται	1	they are burned up	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “the fire burns them up” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
JHN	15	7	knr4	figs-explicit	μείνητε ἐν ἐμοὶ	1	ask whatever you wish	See how you translated **remain in me** in the previous three verses. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JHN	15	7	lpzq	figs-idiom	τὰ ῥήματά μου ἐν ὑμῖν μείνῃ	1	ask whatever you wish	This is an idiom that means to obey Jesus. See how you translated a similar expression in [8:31](../08/31.md) (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
JHN	15	7	m38f	figs-ellipsis	ὃ ἐὰν θέλητε, αἰτήσασθε	1	ask whatever you wish	Jesus is leaving out a word that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could supply the word from the context. Alternate translation: “ask God whatever you desire” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
JHN	15	7	mcz5	figs-activepassive	γενήσεται ὑμῖν	1	it will be done for you	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

JHN	15	8	pq2t	figs-pastforfuture	ἐν τούτῳ ἐδοξάσθη ὁ Πατήρ μου	1	My Father is glorified in this	Jesus is figuratively using the past tense in order to refer to something that will happen in the future. He is doing this to show that the event will certainly happen. If this is confusing in your language, you could use the future tense. Alternate translation: “My Father will be glorified in this” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture]])
JHN	15	8	yq67	figs-activepassive	ἐν τούτῳ ἐδοξάσθη ὁ Πατήρ μου	1	My Father is glorified in this	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

JHN	16	intro	wb8v			0		# John 16 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n1. Jesus promises that his disciples will be persecuted (15:18–16:4)\n2. Jesus describes the work of the Holy Spirit (16:5–15)\n3. Jesus says that he will return to his Father (16:16–28)\n4. Jesus says that his disciples will soon abandon him (16:29–33)\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### The Holy Spirit\n\nJesus told his disciples that he would send the Holy Spirit to them. The Holy Spirit is the Helper ([14:16](../14/16.md)) who is always with God’s people to help them and to speak to God for them. He is also the Spirit of Truth ([14:17](../14/17.md)) who tells God’s people what is true about God so they know him better and serve him well. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/holyspirit]])\n\n### “The hour is coming”\n\nJesus used these words to begin prophecies about events that could be shorter or longer than sixty minutes. “The hour” in which people would persecute his followers ([16:2](../16/02.md)) lasted for many years. However, “the hour” in which his disciples would scatter and leave him alone ([16:32](../16/32.md)) was less than sixty minutes long. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]])\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### Simile\n\nJesus said that just as a woman is in pain when she gives birth to a baby, so also his followers would be sad when he died. But just as the woman is happy after the baby is born, so also his followers would be happy when he became alive again. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

JHN	17	intro	nb2a			0		# John 17 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nThis chapter is one long prayer that can be divided into three parts according to the topics of Jesus’ prayer requests:\n\n1. Jesus prays for himself (17:1–5)\n2. Jesus prays for his disciples (17:6–19)\n3. Jesus prays for all Christians (17:20–26)\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Glory\n\nScripture often speaks of God’s glory as a great, bright light that visually represents how great God is. When people see this light, they are afraid. In this chapter Jesus asks God to show his followers his true glory ([17:1](../17/01.md)). (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/glory]])\n\n### Jesus is eternal\n\nJesus existed before God created the world ([17:5](../17/05.md)). John wrote about this in [1:1](../01/01.md).\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### Prayer\n\nJesus is God’s one and only Son ([3:16](../03/16.md)), so he could pray differently from the way other people pray. He used many words that might seem to be commands. Your translation should make Jesus sound like a son speaking with love and respect to his father and telling him what the father needs to do so that the father will be happy.

JHN	18	intro	ltl2			0		# John 18 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n1. Soldiers and guards arrest Jesus (18:1–11)\n2. The priests question Jesus and Peter denies Jesus (18:12–27)\n3. Pilate questions Jesus (18:28–40)\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### “It is not lawful for us to put any man to death”\n\nThe Roman government did not allow the Jews to kill criminals, so the Jews needed to ask Pilate, the governor, to kill him ([18:31](../18/31.md)).\n\n### King of the Jews\n\nWhen Pilate asked if Jesus were the King of the Jews ([18:33](../18/33.md)), he was asking if Jesus were claiming to be a political leader like King Herod, whom the Romans allowed to rule Judea. When he asked the crowd if he should release the King of the Jews ([18:39](../18/39.md)), he is mocking the Jews, because the Romans and Jews hated each other. He was also mocking Jesus, because he did not think that Jesus was a king at all. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])

Here Jesus uses the form of a question to add emphasis to his statement. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “I should certainly drink the cup that the Father has given to me!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
JHN	18	11	m4f3	figs-metaphor	τὸ ποτήριον ὃ δέδωκέν μοι ὁ Πατὴρ, οὐ μὴ πίω αὐτό	1	the cup	Here Jesus uses **cup** figuratively to refer to the sufferings he will soon experience as if they were a **cup** of bitter-tasting liquid that God would give him to **drink**. If this use of **cup** and **drink** would confuse your readers, you could say the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “My suffering which the Father wants me to endure, should I certainly not endure it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

One Roman official had appointed **Annas**, but ten years later another official deposed him and caused **Caiaphas** to be **high priest** instead. However, the Jews still considered Annas to be **high priest**. It would probably be best to state the matter as simply as possible for your readers. Alternate translation: “first to the high priest Annas, for he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was the other high priest that year” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could supply these words from his original statement in [11:50](../11/50.md).

This interpretation would mean that these phrases would be similar to the phrase “the other disciple whom Jesus loved” that occurs in ([20:2](../20/02.md)). Alternate translation: “I, another disciple, followed Jesus. Now I was known to the high priest, and I entered” (2) an unknown disciple. Alternate translation: “a certain disciple, followed Jesus.

Alternate translation: “Now because it was cold, the servants and the officers had made a charcoal fire and were standing there, warming themselves” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
JHN	18	18	bbe9	figs-explicit	οἱ δοῦλοι	1	Now the servants and the officers were standing there, and they had made a charcoal fire, for it was cold, and they were warming themselves	Here, **the servants** refers to the personal **servants** of the high priest.

JHN	18	19	e8h3	figs-explicit	ὁ…ἀρχιερεὺς	1	The high priest	According to [18:13](../18/13.md) the **high priest** here is Annas. He would later send Jesus to Caiaphas in [verse 24](../18/24.md). If this use of **high priest** might confuse your readers, you could say who the person is explicitly. Alternate translation: “Annas, the high priest” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JHN	18	20	h2kj	figs-metonymy	τῷ κόσμῳ	1	I have spoken openly to the world	Here Jesus uses **the world** figuratively to refer to all of the people in the world.

JHN	18	20	ltlp	figs-hyperbole	ἐγὼ παρρησίᾳ λελάληκα τῷ κόσμῳ	1		Here, **to the world** is an exaggeration that Jesus uses to emphasize that he spoke publicly.

The Jewish law required the Jewish leaders to question witnesses first in legal cases. Therefore, Jesus is using this question to emphasize that the Jewish leaders are breaking their own law by questioning him instead of questioning witnesses. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “You should not be asking me these questions!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

The Jewish leaders believed that they would become ceremonially unclean if they entered the house of someone who was not a Jew. If they became ceremonially unclean, then they would not be allowed to celebrate the Passover Festival. Therefore, the Jewish leaders did not enter the governor’s palace. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain this in the simplest way possible.

JHN	18	40	qy3p	figs-explicit	τοῦτον	1	Not this man, but Barabbas	Here the Jewish leaders say **this one** as a disrespectful way to refer to Jesus without saying his name.

JHN	19	intro	u96u			0		# John 19 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n1. Soldiers beat and mock Jesus (19:1–3)\n2. The Jewish leaders convince Pilate to crucify Jesus (19:4–16)\n3. Soldiers crucify Jesus (19:17–27)\n4. Jesus dies on the cross (19:28–37)\n5. Jesus’ friends put his body in a tomb (19:38–42)\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text in order to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in [19:24](../19/24.md), which are words from the Old Testament.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### “Purple garment”\n\nPurple is a color like red or blue. The soldiers mocked Jesus by putting him in a purple garment. This was because kings wore purple garments. They spoke and acted like they were giving honor to a king, but everyone knew that they were doing it because they hated Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])\n\n### “You are not Caesar’s friend”\n\nPilate knew that Jesus was not a criminal, so he did not want to have his soldiers kill him. But the Jews told him that Jesus was claiming to be a king, and anyone who did that was breaking Caesar’s laws ([19:12](../19/12.md)).\n\n### Ancient Jewish burial customs\n\nAccording to the burial customs of that time, a dead person’s family would wrap the dead body with many strips of linen cloth and place it on a table inside a tomb. The tomb was either a cave or a room cut out of the side a large rock. According to Jewish tradition, the body was left to decompose in the tomb for one year. Then the family would then place the bones in a stone box. If your readers would be unfamiliar with these burial customs, then you may need to provide explanations in your translation or in a note for [verses 39–42](../19/39.md).\n\n### The tomb\n\nThe tomb in which Jesus was buried ([19:41](../19/41.md)) was the kind of tomb in which wealthy Jewish families buried their dead. It was an actual room cut into a rock. It had a flat place on one side where they could place the body after they had put oil and spices on it and wrapped it in cloth. Then they would roll a large rock in front of the tomb so no one could see inside or enter.\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### Sarcasm\n\nThe soldiers were insulting Jesus when they said, “Hail, King of the Jews.” Pilate was insulting the Jews when he asked, “Should I crucify your king?” He was probably also insulting both Jesus and the Jews when he wrote, “Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### Gabbatha, Golgotha\n\nJohn explained the meanings of these two Aramaic words (“The Pavement” and “The Place of a Skull”). Then he used Greek letters to express the sound of these words. You should also use the letters of your language to express the sounds of these Aramaic words.

JHN	19	31	oeeb	figs-genericnoun	ἐπὶ τοῦ σταυροῦ	1		John is speaking of the three crosses that the men were hanging on, not of one particular cross.

JHN	19	38	xtva	figs-explicit	Ἰωσὴφ ὁ ἀπὸ Ἁριμαθαίας	1	Joseph of Arimathea	Since [Luke 23:50](../../luk/23/50.md) indicates that **Joseph** was a member of the Sanhedrin, he was likely dwelling in Jerusalem. Therefore, John would mean here that **Joseph** was originally **from Arimathea**. **Joseph** had not come **from Arimathea** to Jerusalem for this occasion. If this would confuse your readers, you could say the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “Joseph, who was originally from Arimathea” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JHN	19	38	d3hz	translate-names	Ἰωσὴφ ὁ ἀπὸ Ἁριμαθαίας	1	Joseph of Arimathea	**Arimathea** was a city in Judea. Alternate translation: “Joseph who was from the city called Arimathea” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
JHN	19	38	e3ap	figs-possession	διὰ τὸν φόβον τῶν Ἰουδαίων	1	for fear of the Jews	John is using the possessive form to describe the **fear** that **Joseph** felt for the Jewish leaders.

JHN	19	38	h7ra	figs-synecdoche	διὰ τὸν φόβον τῶν Ἰουδαίων	1	for fear of the Jews	Here, **the Jews** refers to the Jewish leaders. It does not refer to the Jewish people in general. See how you translated this term in [1:19](../01/19.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
JHN	19	38	t22g	figs-explicit	ἵνα ἄρῃ τὸ σῶμα τοῦ Ἰησοῦ…ἦρεν τὸ σῶμα αὐτοῦ	1	if he could take away the body of Jesus	John implies that **Joseph** wanted to **take away the body of Jesus** in order to bury it.

JHN	19	39	gqkc	translate-names	ὁ ἐλθὼν πρὸς αὐτὸν νυκτὸς τὸ πρῶτον	1	Nicodemus	This clause refers to the meeting between Jesus and Nicodemus that is described in [John 3](../03/01.md). If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “who had met Jesus before when he visited him at night” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JHN	19	39	ekyu	figs-explicit	φέρων μίγμα σμύρνης καὶ ἀλόης	1	Nicodemus	According to the burial customs of Jesus’ time, people prepared this **mixture** in order to put it on Jesus’ body as a way to honor him and to counteract the smell of decay. If this would confuse your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes to put on Jesus’ body” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JHN	19	39	d3d2	translate-unknown	σμύρνης καὶ ἀλόης	1	myrrh and aloes	This **mixture of myrrh and aloes** consisted of pleasant-smelling substances that were mixed together into an ointment that was put on a dead body in order to counteract the smell of decay. If your readers would not be familiar with these substances, you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “pleasant-smelling substances” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
JHN	19	39	xks9	translate-bweight	ὡς λίτρας ἑκατόν	1	about one hundred litras in weight	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express this in terms of modern measurements, either in the text or a footnote. One **litra** is about one third of a kilogram or three quarters of a pound. Alternate translation: “about 33 kilograms in weight” or “weighing about thirty-three kilograms” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bweight]])
JHN	19	40	m9k6	translate-unknown	ἔδησαν αὐτὸ ὀθονίοις μετὰ τῶν ἀρωμάτων	1		Wrapping a dead body in strips of cloth was the burial custom in this culture. See the discussion of this in the General Notes for this chapter. If your readers would not be familiar with such a custom, you could describe it more specifically, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “wrapped strips of linen cloth around his body and put spices under the strips of cloth” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
JHN	19	41	fb25	writing-background		0		Here John interrupts the main story line in order to provide some background information about the location of the tomb where they would bury Jesus. Use the natural form in your language for expressing background information. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
JHN	19	41	uib1	figs-activepassive	ἦν δὲ ἐν τῷ τόπῳ ὅπου ἐσταυρώθη κῆπος	1	Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “Now in the place where they crucified Jesus there was a garden” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
JHN	19	41	qd1a	figs-activepassive	ἐν ᾧ οὐδέπω οὐδεὶς ἦν τεθειμένος	1	in which no person had yet been buried	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “in which people had not yet buried anyone” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
JHN	19	41	bx6g	figs-doublenegatives	οὐδέπω οὐδεὶς ἦν τεθειμένος	1	in which no person had yet been buried	The phrase **no one had yet** translates two negative words in Greek. John uses them together to emphasize that the tomb had never been used. If your language can use two negatives together for emphasis without them cancelling each other to create a positive meaning, it would be appropriate to use that construction here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
JHN	19	42	nr4r	figs-explicit	διὰ τὴν παρασκευὴν τῶν Ἰουδαίων	1	Because it was the day of preparation for the Jews	According to Jewish law, no one could work after sundown on **the day of preparation** because sundown marked the beginning of the Sabbath and Passover. This meant that they had to bury Jesus’ body quickly. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “because the Passover and Sabbath were about to begin that evening” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JHN	19	42	c70e	figs-infostructure	ἐκεῖ…διὰ τὴν παρασκευὴν τῶν Ἰουδαίων, ὅτι ἐγγὺς ἦν τὸ μνημεῖον, ἔθηκαν τὸν Ἰησοῦν	1	Because it was the day of preparation for the Jews	If it would be more natural in your language, you could change the order of these clauses. Alternate translation: “they laid Jesus there because of the day of preparation of the Jews and because the tomb was close by” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
JHN	19	42	jsyu	figs-explicit	τὴν παρασκευὴν τῶν Ἰουδαίων	1		See how you translated a similar phrase in [verse 14](../19/14.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JHN	19	42	jtfz	figs-euphemism	ἔθηκαν τὸν Ἰησοῦν	1	Because it was the day of preparation for the Jews	John is referring to putting Jesus’ dead body in a tomb as laying him down. This is a polite way of referring to something unpleasant and accurately describes the Jewish burial practice of laying a dead body on a table inside the tomb. See how you translated a similar expression in [11:34](../11/34.md). Alternate translation: “they entombed Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
JHN	20	intro	nm1y			0		# John 20 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n1. Mary Magdalene, Peter, and John go to Jesus’ tomb and find it empty (20:1–10)\n2. Mary Magdalene meets Jesus (20:11–18)\n3. Ten disciples meet Jesus (20:19–25)\n4. Thomas meets Jesus (20:26–29)\n5. John states the purpose for this Gospel (20:30–31)\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### The tomb\n\nThe tomb in which Jesus was buried ([20:1](../20/01.md)) was the kind of tomb in which wealthy Jewish families buried their dead. It was a room cut into a rock. It had a flat place on one side where they could place the body after they had put oil and spices on it and wrapped it in cloth. Then they would roll a large rock in front of the tomb so no one could look inside or enter.\n\n### “Receive the Holy Spirit”\n\nIf your language uses the same word for “breath” and “spirit,” be sure that the reader understands that Jesus was performing a symbolic action by blowing air out of his mouth, and that Jesus was referring to the Holy Spirit, not his breath. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/holyspirit]])\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### Rabboni\n\nJohn used Greek letters to express the sound of this Aramaic word. Then he explained that the word means “Teacher.” You should also use the letters of your language to express the sounds of the Aramaic word.\n\n### Jesus’ resurrection body\n\nWe do not know what Jesus’ body looked like after he became alive again. His disciples knew he was Jesus because they could see his face and touch the places where the soldiers had put the nails through his hands and feet and pierced his side. However, he could also walk through solid walls and doors and sometimes people didn’t recognize him. It is best not to say more than what the ULT says about Jesus’ resurrection body.\n\n### Two angels in white\n\nMatthew, Mark, Luke, and John all wrote about angels in white clothing with the women at Jesus’ tomb. Two of the authors called them men, but that is only because the angels appeared in human forms. Two of the Gospel authors wrote about two angels, but the other two authors wrote about only one of them. It is best to translate each of these passages as it appears in the ULT rather than trying to make the passages all say the exact same thing. (See: [Matthew 28:1-2](../../mat/28/01.md) and [Mark 16:5](../../mrk/16/05.md) and [Luke 24:4](../../luk/24/04.md) and [John 20:12](../../jhn/20/12.md))
JHN	20	1	a8vl	figs-explicit	τῇ…μιᾷ τῶν σαββάτων	1	first day of the week	John uses **first** to imply the **first** day of the week. If this might confuse your readers, you could say the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “on the first day of the week” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JHN	20	1	sb4m	translate-ordinal	τῇ…μιᾷ τῶν σαββάτων	1	first day of the week	Here John is actually using a cardinal number, “one,” to mean **first**.

These women are mentioned in [Matthew 28:1](../../mat/28/01.md); [Mark 16:1](../../mrk/16/01.md); and [Luke 24:1](../../luk/24/01.md), [10](../../luk/24/10.md), [24](../../luk/24/24.md). Since she is not speaking of the two disciples, **we** is exclusive. Your language may require you to mark these forms. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

JHN	20	9	jywe	writing-background	γὰρ	1	they still did not know the scripture	**For** here indicates that this verse provides background information about the kind of belief that was mentioned in the previous clause. **For** here does not indicate a reason or cause. At that time, the disciples believed Jesus had risen from the dead only because the tomb was empty. They still did not understand that the scriptures said Jesus would rise from the dead. Use the natural form in your language for expressing background information. Alternate translation: “But even then” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])\n

JHN	20	16	k468		Ραββουνεί	1	Rabboni	Here John writes out the sounds of this Jewish Aramaic word with Greek letters. Since John translates the meaning later in the verse, you should write out this word using the most similar sounds in your language.

JHN	21	intro	e1bg			0		# John 21 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n1. Jesus eats breakfast with his disciples (21:1–14)\n2. Jesus restores Peter as his disciple (21:15–19)\n3. Jesus and Peter speak about John (21:20–23)\n4. John concludes his Gospel (21:24–25)\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### The metaphor of sheep\n\nBefore Jesus died, he spoke of himself taking care of his people as if he were a good shepherd taking care of sheep ([10:11](../10/11.md)). After he became alive again, Jesus commanded Peter to take care of other believers in the same way. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### “The disciple whom Jesus loved”\n\nThe Apostle John referred to himself as the disciple “whom Jesus loved” twice in this chapter ([21:7](../21/07.md), [20](../21/20.md)). Your language may not allow people to speak of themselves as if they were speaking about someone else. If this is the case, then you will need to use a first person pronoun to these references and the other references to John throughout this chapter. You would also need to use first person plural pronouns in this chapter for all references to the disciples as a group, since John was one of them. If your language can retain the third person references, then you may want to make these references to John explicit by adding “John” next to them. See the discussion of this in Part 1 of the General Introduction to the Gospel of John. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/johntheapostle]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])\n\n### Different words for “love”\n\nIn [verses 15–17](../21/15.md), Jesus and Peter speak to each other using two different words in the original language that could both be translated as “love.” These words are often used interchangeably. However, when they are used together like in [verses 15–17](../21/15.md), they can have slightly different meanings. One word can refer to a type of love that is based on affection and friendship, but the other word can refer to a type of love that is based on sincere devotion and high esteem for the person being loved. Although the UST translates both of these words as “love,” the notes will provide more specific alternatives.
