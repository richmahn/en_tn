# all the kingdoms of the earth

Here "all" is an exaggeration, as there were kingdoms over which Cyrus did not rule. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# for him a house in ... Judea

You may need to make explicit that the house was for people to worship Yahweh. Alternate translation: "a house in ... Judea where people can worship him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
