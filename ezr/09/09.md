# but has extended covenant faithfulness to us

The abstract noun "faithfulness" can be stated as "faithful" or "loyal." See how you translated a similar phrase in [Ezra 7:28](../07/28.md). Alternate translation: "but he as been faithful to us" or "he has been loyal to us" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# in the sight of the king of Persia

The king could not literally see the temple, but he did know about what was happening in Jerusalem. Here "sight" is a metonym for what a person knows. Alternate translation: "so that the king of Persia knows about it" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# God's house

the temple

# could give us a wall of safety

The wall that keeps people safe is a metaphor for Yahweh protecting his people. Alternate translation: "could keep us safe" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
