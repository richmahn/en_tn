## translationNotes

* **our evil practices and our great guilt** - Israel did not utterly destroy the people practicing evil before God. Israel began marrying them and following their religious practices being led astray from God.
* **since you...have held back what our iniquities deserve and left us survivors** - This is an example of God's mercy in action.
* **should we again break your commandments ** - This was exactly what some of the returnees have done. They broke God's commands by marrying the people of the land and worshiping their gods.
* **Will you not be angry and annihilate us** - God destroyed all of Israel before and Ezra feared that He would do it again and then there would no one left.
