# Connecting Statement:

This continues the decree that King Artaxerxes gave to Ezra.

# the Province Beyond the River

This is the name of the province that was west of the Euphrates River. It was across the river from the city of Susa. See how you translated it in [Ezra 4:10](../04/10.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# that anything that Ezra asks from you should be given in full

This can be expressed in active form. "Give Ezra in full anything he asks of you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# should be given in full

The phrase "in full" here represents whatever quantity necessary to do the work. Alternate translation: "should be given as much as he needs" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
