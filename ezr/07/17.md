# So buy in full ... offerings

The phrase "in full" means as many as are necessary to complete the task. They were to use the gold and silver to buy all they needed in order to worship God in the temple. Alternate translation: "Buy as many of the oxen, rams, lambs, grain and drink offerings as are needed" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
