## translationNotes

* **dread was on them** - The people were living in fear of the people currently living in the land. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
* **They offered burnt offerings to Yahweh at dawn and evening** - One of the first things the people did was to re-institute the temple sacrifices. This was before the temple was rebuild.
