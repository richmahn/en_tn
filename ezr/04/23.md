This can be translated in active form, in which case you will need to make explicit who read the decree from the king to the officials. Alternate translation: "The messengers from King Artaxerxes read his decree" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
