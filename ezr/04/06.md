# wrote an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem

The abstract nouns "accusation" can be translated as a verb "accuse." You may need to make explicit what the enemies accused the Judeans of doing. AT: "wrote a letter in which they accused those who lived in Judah and Jerusalem of disobeying the king" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
