# the Province Beyond the River

This is the name of the province that was west of the Euphrates River. It was across the river from the city of Susa. See how you translated this in [Ezra 4:10](../04/10.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# Tribute and taxes were paid to them

This can be translated in active form. Alternate translation: "The people in Jerusalem paid tribute and taxes to those kings" or "Those kings were able to collect tribute and taxes" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
