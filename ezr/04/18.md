# The letter that you sent me has been translated and read

This can be translated in active form, in which case you will need to make explicit who translated and read the letter to the king. Alternate translation: "I have had my servants translate and read the letter that you sent to me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
