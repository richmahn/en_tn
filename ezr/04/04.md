# the people of the land

"the people who were living in the land at that time," which could include non-Jews and Jews whose families the Babylonians had not taken into exile

# made the Judeans' hands weak

This speaks of the people of the land discouraging the Judeans as if they made their hands physically weak. AT: "discouraged the Judeans" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Judeans

people who returned from Babylon and settled in the land of Judah

# to frustrate their plans

"to make it so the Judeans could not build the temple as they had planned"

# wrote an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem

The abstract nouns "accusation" can be translated as a verb "accuse." You may need to make explicit what the enemies accused the Judeans of doing. AT: "wrote a letter in which they accused those who lived in Judah and Jerusalem of disobeying the king" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
