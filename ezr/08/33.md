# the silver, gold, and objects were weighed out

This can be translated in active form. Alternate translation: "the twelve priestly officials weighed out the silver, gold and objects" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# the silver, gold, and objects were weighed out ... into the hand of Meremoth

Here "the hand of Meremoth" represents Meremoth's care of the silver, gold, and objects. The men weighed those things and gave them to Meremoth to take care of them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# Meremoth ... Uriah ... Eleazar ... Phinehas ... Jozabad ... Jeshua ... Noadiah ... Binnui

These are the names of men. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
