# General Information:

There is an apparent shift in authorship beginning here. Chapters 1-7 were written as if the author was writing about Ezra. Chapter 8 was written as if the author was Ezra.
Verses 2-14 are a list of leaders and their ancestors. All of them are men. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
