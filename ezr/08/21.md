# to seek a straight path from him for us, our little ones, and all our possessions

The word "seek" represents asking God to do something for them. Here a "straight path" represents safety while they travel. Alternate translation: "to ask God to give us, our little ones, and all our possessions safety while we travel" or "to ask God to protect us, our little ones, and all our possessions while we travel" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
