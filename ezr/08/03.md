# Hattush, who was of the descendants of Shecaniah, who was from the descendants of Parosh

This can be written as a separate sentence after "Zechariah." Alternate translation: "Hatush was a descendant of Shecaniah, who was a descendant of Parosh"

"with Zechariah there were 150 males listed in the record of his genealogy"
