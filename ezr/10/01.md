# As Ezra prayed and confessed ... threw himself down

Ezra speaks of himself as if he were someone else. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pronouns]])

# threw himself down

quickly went from standing to lying facedown

# before God's house

in front of the temple

# Shekaniah

See how you translated this in [Esra 8:5](../08/04.md).

# Jehiel

See how you translated this in [Esra 8:9](../08/08.md).

# We have been unfaithful to our God

This was made as a public confession, not as a boastful claim.
