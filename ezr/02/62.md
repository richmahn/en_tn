This can be translated in active form. The abstract noun "priesthood" can be translated as the verb "work as priests." AT: "the other priests treated them as if they were unclean and did not allow them to work as priests" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
