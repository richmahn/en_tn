front:intro	hz6m				1	# Introduction to Haggai\n\n## Part 1: General Introduction\n\n### Outline of Haggai\n\n1. The people must finish the temple for Yahweh to bless them again (1:1–15)\n2. This temple will be more glorious than the first temple (2:1–9)\n3. Yahweh will bless a defiled people (2:10–19)\n4. Yahweh will defeat the nations and establish his ruler (2:20–23)\n\n### What is the book of Haggai about?\n\nThe people of Israel lacked necessary things like food and warm clothes. The prophet Haggai told them that they lacked such things because they were not obeying Yahweh. If the people of Israel would listen to Yahweh and start rebuilding the temple, then Yahweh would send rain and bless them again. The people listened and began to work on the temple. Yahweh encouraged the people, the priests, and the leaders. Yahweh told them that he was with them and would bless them when they would build the temple.\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nThis book traditionally has been titled “Haggai” or “The Book of Haggai.” Translators may decide to call it simply: “The Sayings of Haggai” or “The Prophecies of Haggai.” \n\n### Who wrote the book of Haggai and when?\n\nThe prophet Haggai wrote this short book of two chapters. Haggai wrote this book after the exiles returned from Babylon. The exiles returned during the reign of the Persian king, Darius the first. We do not know very much about the prophet Haggai. However, we know that the prophets Haggai and Zechariah lived at the same time. Both Haggai and Zechariah are mentioned in Ezra 5:1 and 6:14. Ezra 5:1 and 6:14 indicate that Haggai and Zechariah lived and prophesied together for the sake of the people of Israel that had returned from exile. Thus readers can use Haggai to interpret Zechariah, and they can use Zechariah to interpret Haggai.\n\nHaggai 1:1 indicates that Haggai began his prophetic ministry during the sixth month of Darius’s second year, which was sometime between August and September of 520 B.C. According to Haggai 1:1, Haggai started to prophesy on the first day of the sixth month, which is probably the 29th of August in the year 520 B.C. But in contrast, Haggai 2:10 states that the last prophecies of Haggai occurred on the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month of the same year of Darius’ reign in Persia. The twenty-fourth day of the ninth month of the second year of Darius’ reign would be approximately in the middle of December of 520 B.C. Therefore, Haggai only prophesied to the people of Israel for a brief, roughly four-month period of time. When Haggai prophesied, the nation of Israel had no ruler or king of her own by whom to date Haggai’s prophecies. Thus, Haggai had to date his prophecies by the reign of Darius, king of Persia and suzerain of Judah. Much of our current knowledge about Darius the first comes from the famous Behistun Inscription. Haggai dates his prophecies by the reign of a pagan, Persian king to indicate that Jesus’ words of Luke 21:24, the “time of the Gentiles,” were now the state of things for the people of Israel.\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### Did Haggai prophesy before Ezra and Nehemiah?\n\nHaggai prophesied before the time of Ezra and Nehemiah. Both Haggai and Zechariah are mentioned in Ezra 5:1 and 6:14.\n\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\n\n### What does “consider your ways” mean?\n\nYahweh, through the prophecies of Haggai, told the people to “consider your ways” several times in this book. This means that he wants them to think carefully about how they have lived and behaved. For example, see the translation notes for verses 1:5 and 1:7 provided here.\n\n**Set your heart to examine your ways** means that God wants the people of Israel to consider their ways or to think carefully about their behavior. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Consider your ways” or “Think carefully about your ways" or “Set your heart to examine your behavior” rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom
1:intro	n84r				1	# Haggai 1 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Farming imagery\n\nHaggai’s prophecies use the imagery of farming in reference to spiritual matters. For example, Haggai 1:6 indicates that the people of Israel had done a great amount of work, but they had very little to show for all of their effort. Thus, the lack of blessing from Yahweh indicates that the people of Israel needed to repent and build the temple.\n\n**Set your heart to examine your ways** means that God wishes the people of Israel to consider their ways or to think carefully about their behavior. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Consider your ways” or “Think carefully about your ways” or “Set your heart to examine your behavior” rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom\n\nThe words **Darius**, **Haggai**, **Zerubbabel**, **Shealtiel**, **Joshua**, and **Jehozadak** are the names of men. rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names\n\nOften, throughout the book of Haggai, Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. Alternate translation: “this is what Yahweh has declared” or “this is what I, Yahweh, have declared” rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person

You could convert the Hebrew day and month into an approximate date on the calendar that your culture uses. However, the Jews used a lunar calendar, so if you use a solar calendar, the date will be different every year and the translation will not be entirely accurate. So you may just want to give the number of the day and the name of the month on the Hebrew calendar, and say in a footnote approximately what time of year that is on your calendar.\n

If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “Now is not the time for you yourselves to live in your covered houses, while this house lies ruined.”

1:9	vl6m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠אַתֶּ֥ם רָצִ֖ים אִ֥ישׁ לְ⁠בֵיתֽ⁠וֹ	1	Here, **while every one of you runs to his own house** means that the people of Israel only were concerned about their own homes and not about the house of God. The people of Israel only worked on their own houses, but they did not build God’s house. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state the meaning plainly.

1:10	suc8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	כָּלְא֥וּ שָמַ֖יִם מִ⁠טָּ֑ל	1	Haggai uses **the heavens withhold the dew** to describe a lack of water coming to the land as dew in the morning. The dew that appears at night is spoken of as if it formed in the sky and fell like rain. The sky is spoken of as if it were a person who refuses to give a present, or as a parent who refused to feed his child. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the heavens do not give any dew” or “no dew forms” or “the heavens withhold water in the morning”
1:10	zjm1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	מִ⁠טָּ֑ל	1	Here, **the dew** refers to moisture on the crops and plants that only comes in the morning before the sun evaporates the water. Thus, **dew** was an important source of water for the crops and plants in the rainless summer months of the land of Israel. The translator should retain the term **dew** or find a more general term for moisture or water that is not directly from rain falling from the sky. Alternate translation: “water in the morning” or “moisture in the morning”
1:10	khqc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	וְ⁠הָ⁠אָ֖רֶץ כָּלְאָ֥ה יְבוּלָֽ⁠הּ	1	Haggai uses **the earth withholds its produce** to describe a lack of crops and harvest for the people of Israel. The author speaks of **the earth** as if it were a person who could not give the people produce or crops. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the earth does not give its produce” or “the earth withholds its crops”

This repetitive style of speaking or writing is called a “litany.” Use a form in your language that someone would use to list a series of reasons for something. Alternate translation: “upon all the land, and upon all the crops, and upon every living thing, and upon all your labor”\n\n
1:11	v7pk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וְ⁠עַל־הַ⁠תִּיר֣וֹשׁ וְ⁠עַל־הַ⁠יִּצְהָ֔ר	1	Here, **new wine** and **oil** represent grapes and olives, or the natural produce and crops before they are changed to their products for humans to eat or use. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your language or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and upon the grapes, upon the olives”
1:11	ird4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	וְ⁠עַ֖ל כָּל־יְגִ֥יעַ כַּפָּֽיִם	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **labor**, you can express the same idea with a verbal form such as “work hard.” Alternate translation: “everything you have worked to make” or “the results of your work”
1:11	zygf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	כַּפָּֽיִם	1	Here, **your hands** represent the labor of each person among the people of Israel. The labor that the hands perform means the things that the labor produces. The hand represents the person. Alternate translation: “your effort” or “your work”

If it would be helpful, you could use an equivalent idiom from your language or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Then … obeyed Yahweh and Haggai” or “Then … listened to Yahweh and Haggai”
1:12	e9sl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וַ⁠יִּֽירְא֥וּ הָ⁠עָ֖ם מִ⁠פְּנֵ֥י יְהוָֽה	1	This clause could mean: (1) the face could represent the person.

Alternate translation: “Yahweh moved the heart of” or “Yahweh inspired”

2:23	h7nz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	וְ⁠שַׂמְתִּ֖י⁠ךָ כַּֽ⁠חוֹתָ֑ם	1	Yahweh is saying that Zerubbabel will be like **a signet ring** because he, as king of Israel, would represent Yahweh in some official way, such as a symbol of the king’s royal authority and power represents the king. A **signet ring** is a ring worn by a king that is similar to a coin with a design engraved on it. A **signet ring** was used to imprint melted wax and seal an official document, such as a letter, for a king. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “I will make you like my official signature” or “I will make you like my royal seal” or “I will make you like a symbol that represents me”
