front:intro	hz6m				1	# Introduction to Haggai\n\n## Part 1: General Introduction\n\n### Outline of Haggai\n\n1. The people must finish the temple for Yahweh to bless them again (1:1–15)\n2. This temple will be more glorious than the first temple (2:1–9)\n3. Yahweh will bless a defiled people (2:10–19)\n4. Yahweh will defeat the nations and establish his ruler (2:20–23)\n\n### What is the Book of Haggai about?\n\nThe people of Israel lacked necessary things like food and warm clothes. The prophet Haggai told them that they lacked such things because they were not obeying Yahweh. If the people of Israel would listen to Yahweh and start rebuilding the temple, then Yahweh would send rain and bless them again. The people listened and began to work on the temple. Yahweh encouraged the people, the priests, and the leaders. Yahweh told them that he was with them and would bless them when they would build the temple.\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nThis book traditionally has been titled “Haggai” or “The Book of Haggai.” Translators may decide to call it simply: “The Sayings of Haggai” or “The Prophrecies of Haggai.” \n\n### Who wrote the Book of Haggai and When?\n\nThe prophet Haggai wrote this short book of two chapters. Haggai wrote this book after the exiles returned from Babylon. The exiles returned during the reign of the Persian king Darius the first. We do not know very much about the prophet Haggai. However, we know that the prophets Haggai and Zechariah lived at the same time. Both Haggai and Zechariah are mentioned in Ezra 5:1 and 6:14. Ezra 5:1 and 6:14 indicate that Haggai and Zechariah lived and prophesied together for the sake of the people of Israel that had returned from exile. Thus the books of Haggai and Zechariah help readers to interpret each other.\n\nHaggai 1:1 indicates that Haggai began his prophetic ministry during the sixth month of Darius's second year, which was sometime between August and September of 520 B.C. According to Haggai 1:1, Haggai started to prophesy on the first day of the sixth month, which is probably the 29th of August in the year 520 B.C. Haggai 2:10, in contrast, states that the last prophecies of Haggai occured on the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month of the same year of Darius' reign in Persia. The twenty-fourth day of the ninth month of the second year of Darius' reign would be approximately in the middle of December of 520 B.C. Therefore, Haggai prophesied to the people of Israel only for roughly a brief, four-month period of time. When Haggai prophesied his two chapters, the nation of Israel had no ruler or king of her own so as to to date Haggai's prophecies. Thus, Haggai had to date his prophecies by the reign of Darius, king of Persia and suzerain of Judah. Much of our current knowledge about Darius the first comes from the famous Behistun Inscription. Haggai dates his prophecies by the reign of a pagan, Persian king so as to indicate that Jesus' words of Luke 21:24's "time of the gentiles" were now the state of things for the people of Israel.\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### Did Haggai prophesy before Ezra and Nehemiah?\n\nHaggai prophesied before the time of Ezra and Nehemiah. Both Haggai and Zechariah are mentioned in Ezra 5:1 and 6:14.\n\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\n\n### What does “consider your ways” mean?\n\nYahweh, through the prophecies of Haggai, told the people to “consider your ways” several times in this book. This means that he wants them to think carefully about how they have lived and behaved. For example, see the translation notes for verses 1:5 and 1:7 provided here.\n\n**Set your heart to examine your ways** means that God wishes the people of Israel to consider their ways or to think carefully about their behavior. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Consider your ways” or "Think carefully about your ways" or "Set your heart to examine your behavior" rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom
1:intro	n84r				1	# Haggai 1 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Farming imagery\n\nHaggai's prophecies use the imagery of farming in reference to spiritual matters. For example, Haggai 1:6 indicates that the people of Israel had done a great amount of work but they had very little to show for all of their effort. Thus, the lack of blessing from Yahweh indicates that the people of Israel needed to repent and build the temple.\n\n**Set your heart to examine your ways** means that God wishes the people of Israel to consider their ways or to think carefully about their behavior. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Consider your ways” or "Think carefully about your ways" or "Set your heart to examine your behavior" rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom\n\nThe words **Darius**, **Haggai**, **Zerubbabel**, **Shealtiel**, **Joshua**, and **Jehozadak** are the names of men. rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names\n\nOften, throughout the book of Haggai, Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. Alternate translation: “this is what Yahweh has declared” or “this is what I, Yahweh, have declared” rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person

You could convert the Hebrew day and month into an approximate date on the calendar that your culture uses. However, the Jews used a lunar calendar, so if you use a solar calendar, the date will be different every year and the translation will not be entirely accurate. So you may just want to give the number of the day and the name of the month on the Hebrew calendar, and say in a footnote approximately what time of year that is on your calendar.\n

If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “Now is not the time for you yourselves to live in your covered houses, while this house lies ruined.”
1:4	uga1			סְפוּנִ֑ים	1	Here, **covered** means "paneled" or "roofed". Scholars are not sure of the exact meaning, but **covered** most likely has the meaning of "roofed".

1:6	rma3			וְ⁠אֵין־לְ⁠שָׁכְרָ֔ה	1	Here, the clause **but cannot get drunk** means that there is not enough wine to satisfy the people’s thirst.

1:9	eb3a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠נָפַ֣חְתִּי ב֑⁠וֹ	1	Here, **I blew it away** means that God removed the harvest and crops for the people of Israel to eat. The people of Israel are not able to find their harvest or crops. Thus, the author describes the lack of crops as if the people of Israel were looking for crops but Yahweh had blown them away as if they were dust. Alternate translation: “I spoiled them” or “I caused them to spoil” “I caused them to disappear”
1:9	wsac		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	יַ֣עַן מֶ֗ה	1	Haggai is using the question form to supply the assumed answer.

1:10	suc8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	כָּלְא֥וּ שָמַ֖יִם מִ⁠טָּ֑ל	1	Haggai uses **the heavens withhold the dew** to describe a lack of water coming to the land as dew in the morning. The dew that appears at night is spoken of as if it formed in the sky and fell like rain. The sky is spoken of as if it were a person who refused to give a present or a parent who refused to feed his child. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the heavens do not give any dew” or “no dew forms” or "the heavens withhold water in the morning"
1:10	zjm1			מִ⁠טָּ֑ל	1	Here, **the dew** refers to moisture on the crops and plants that only comes in the morning before the sun evaporates the water. Thus, **dew** was an important source of water for the crops and plants in the rainless summer months of the land of Israel. The translator should retain the term **dew** or find a more general term for moisture or water that is not directly from rain falling from the sky. Alternate translation: "water in the morning" or "moisture in the morning"

The author speaks of **the earth** as if it were a person who could not give the people produce or crops. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the earth does not give its produce” or “the earth withholds its crops”

This repetitive style of speaking or writing is called a “litany.” Use a form in your language that someone would use to list a series of reasons for something. Alternate translation: “upon all the land, and upon all the crops, and upon every living thing, and upon all the labor of your hands!”\n\n
1:11	v7pk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וְ⁠עַל־הַ⁠תִּיר֣וֹשׁ וְ⁠עַל־הַ⁠יִּצְהָ֔ר	1	Here, **new wine** and **oil** represent grapes and olives, or the natural produce and crops before they are changed to their products for humans to eat or use. Thus, “wine” and “oil” are metonyms for grapes and olives. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your language or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and upon the grapes, upon the olives”
1:11	ird4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	וְ⁠עַ֖ל כָּל־יְגִ֥יעַ כַּפָּֽיִם	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **labor**, you can express the same idea with a verbal form such as “work hard.” Alternate translation: “everything you have worked to make” or "the results of your work"
1:11	zygf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	כַּפָּֽיִם	1	Here, **your hands** represent the labor of each person among the people of Israel. The labor that the hands perform is a metonym for the things that the labor produces. The hand is a metonym for the person. Alternate translation: “your effort” or "your work"

If it would be helpful, you could use an equivalent idiom from your language or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “obeyed Yahweh and Haggai” or “listened to Yahweh and Haggai”
1:12	e9sl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וַ⁠יִּֽירְא֥וּ הָ⁠עָ֖ם מִ⁠פְּנֵ֥י יְהוָֽה	1	This clause could mean: (1) the face could represent the person. Alternate translation: “the people feared Yahweh” or (2) the face could be a metonym for the person’s presence. Alternate translation: “the people were afraid to be in Yahweh’s presence”
1:13	xobq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אֲנִ֥י אִתְּ⁠כֶ֖ם	1	Here, **I am with you** is an idiom meaning that God favors or will help the people of Israel to rebuild the temple and live in the land of Israel. The idiom encourages the people of Israel by expressing the idea of support and favor from God. If this phrase does not have that meaning in your language, use an idiom from your language that does have that meaning or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: "I am with you to help" or "I am here with you" or "I am here to protect you"

See how you translated the month number in [Haggai 2:10](../02/10.md). You may need to make explicit which month is mentioned. Alternate translation: “on the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month” or “on the twenty-fourth day of the same month”

You may also be able to use special formatting to set off the quotation. See how you translated similar second-level quotations in [Haggai 2:2](../02/02.md) and [Haggai 2:11](../02/11.md).
