Habakkuk continues his prayer to God.

## contention rises up ##

"fighting among the people is becoming more common"

## the wicked surround the righteous ##

This can mean that righteous people suffer injustice because 1) "wicked people have more power than righteous people" (see UDB) or 2) "there are more wicked people than righteous people." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
