# General Information:

Habakkuk continues speaking to Yahweh about the Chaldeans.

# He brings ... he drags ... his fishnet ... he gathers ... his dragnet ... he rejoices ... he is glad

The words "he" and "his" refer to a Babylonian solider who represents all of the Babylonian soldiers. These pronouns can be stated as plural. Alternate translation: "They bring ... they drag ... their fishnets ... they gather ... their dragnet ... they rejoice ... they are glad" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# all of them ... drags men away ... gathers them

Here "them" and "men" refer to people in general. This can be stated in first person to include Habakkuk as one of the people. Alternate translation: "all of us ... drags us away ... gathers us" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# He brings all of them up with a fishhook ... in his dragnet

Habakkuk speaks of the Chaldeans conquering people easily as if the people were fish that the Chaldeans catch with fishhooks and fishnets. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# fishhook ... fishnet ... dragnet

tools used to catch fish
