# General Information:

Habakkuk continues speaking to Yahweh about the Chaldeans.

# Your eyes are too pure

Here the word "eyes" represents Yahweh who sees. Alternate translation: "You are too pure" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# those who betray

This refers to the Chaldeans. The word "betray" refers to people who have been disloyal or have broken agreements that they have made.

# Why are you silent while the wicked swallow up those more righteous than they are?

Habakkuk speaks of wicked people destroying others as if the wicked were swallowing them. Alternate translation: "Why are you silent while the wicked destroy those more righteous than they are?" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# those more righteous than they are

This refers to the Israelites, about whom Habakkuk had been complaining. The reader should understand that these are wicked people, but they are "more righteous than" or not as wicked as the Chaldeans. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])
