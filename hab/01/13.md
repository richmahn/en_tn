Habakkuk continues speaking to Yahweh about the Chaldeans.

## "those who betray" ##

"the Chaldeans, whom no one can trust"

## swallow up ##

"destroy" (UDB)

## like fish in the sea ... like creeping things ##

These two phrases express the same idea that God has allowed the Chaldeans to treat the Israelites as if they were creatures with very little value, and not like people should be treated. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
