# You make men like fish in the sea

Habakkuk compares the way in which the Chaldeans will kill people without remorse with the way in which people will kill fish without remorse. AT: "You cause men to become no more important than fish" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# like creeping things without a ruler over them

The words "creeping things" refer to insects and other bugs that crawl about. Just as insects have no ruler to organize and defend them, the people are defenseless before the Chaldean army. The verb may be supplied from the previous phrase. AT: "you make men as defenseless as insects that have no ruler" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
