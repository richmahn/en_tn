# how long will I cry for help, and you will not hear?

The reader should understand that Habakkuk has been crying to Yahweh for help for a long time. He asks this question because he is frustrated and wants to know how much longer it will be before Yahweh responds. Alternate translation: "how much longer shall I cry for help before you will respond?" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
