# He brings ... he continually slaughter

In 1:15-17 the singular pronoun "he" and "his" refer to a Babylonian solider who represents all of the Babylonian soldiers. These pronouns can be stated as plural. AT: "They bring ... they continually slaughter" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# Will he therefore keep emptying his net, and will he continually slaughter the nations without mercy?

Habakkuk asks this question because he is frustrated and wants to know how long Yahweh will allow the Chaldeans to continue to destroy people and nations. AT: "Will you therefore let them empty their fishing nets and continue to slaughter the nations while they feel no compassion?" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# keep emptying his net

Habakkuk speaks of the Chaldeans preparing to conquer more nations as if they were fishermen who empty their nets so that they can use them to catch more fish. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
