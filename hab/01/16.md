# he sacrifices to his net and burns incense to his dragnet

Habakkuk speaks of the weapons that the Chaldeans use to conquer people and nations as if the weapons were fishing nets that they use to catch fish. Alternate translation: "they offer sacrifices and burn incense to the weapons that they use in battle" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
