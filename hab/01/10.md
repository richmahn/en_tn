# General Information:

Yahweh continues to describe the Chaldean soldiers.

# So they mock kings, and rulers are only a mockery for them

These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The word "mockery" can be translated with a verbal phrase. AT: "So they mock kings, and rulers are only something for them to mock" or "So all they do is mock kings and rulers" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# the wind will rush on

Yahweh speaks of how swiftly the Chaldean army moves from one city to the next as it conquers each one as if it were a wind that blows swiftly along. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# guilty men, those whose might is their god

This refers to the Chaldean soldiers.
