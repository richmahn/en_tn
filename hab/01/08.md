## Their horses...their horses ##

the horses of the Chaldean soldiers

## quicker than the evening wolves ##

The horses of the Chaldeans are compared to fierce wolves that run after their prey in the evening when they are very hungry because they have not eaten all day. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## their horsemen ##

The Chaldeans' soldiers riding the horses.

## leopards ##

large, swift cats (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

## they fly like an eagle ##

"the horsemen ride as quickly as eagles fly" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

## their multitudes go like a desert wind, and they gather captives like sand ##

The Chaldeans are many, and like the grains of sand the wind picks up in a storm are too many to count, so no one can count the people they capture and make prisoners. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
