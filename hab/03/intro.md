#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers, or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 2:1-20, which is a prayer by Habakkuk.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Poetry #####
Although this is a prayer, it is in the form of poetry. Habakkuk uses startling imagery to show his fear of Yahweh. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/fear]])
