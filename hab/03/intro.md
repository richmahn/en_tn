# Habakkuk 03 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations set each line of poetry farher to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetry in 3:1-19.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Poetry #####
Although this is a prayer, it is in the form of poetry. Habakkuk uses startling imagery to show his fear of Yahweh. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/fear]])
