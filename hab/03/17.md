# General Information:

Habakkuk describes his reaction to his vision of Yahweh.

# though the produce of the olive tree disappoints

"though the produce of the olive tree fails" or "though the olive tree fails to produce olives"

# though the flock is cut off from the fold

The word "flock" may refer to sheep or goats, or both. The word "fold" refers to the fenced-in area where shepherds keep their flock. Habakkuk speaks of the flock dying as if someone were to cut off the flock, as a person would cut a branch from a tree. AT: "though all the flock dies and the folds are empty" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
