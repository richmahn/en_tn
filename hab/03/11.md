# General Information:

Habakkuk continues to describe his vision of Yahweh.

# The sun and moon stood still

The sun and moon not moving in the sky is spoken of as if they were people who stopped walking and stood still. Alternate translation: "The sun and moon stopped moving" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# in their high places

"in the sky"

# at the flash of your arrows ... at the lightning of your flashing spear

These two phrases share similar meanings and tell why the sun and moon have stood still. The lightning flashes in the sky are spoken of as if they were arrows that Yahweh shoots from his bow or a shining spear that he throws through the sky. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the flash of your arrows as they fly

"the flash of your flying arrows"
