## translationNotes

* Habakkuk describes Yahweh.
* ** your anointed one** - This can also mean "your Messiah," but the reference is clearly to "your people," so use a common noun here, not as a proper name.
* **You shatter the head of the house of the wicked** - "You completely destroy the leader of the wicked people" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
