# General Information:

Habakkuk continues to describe his vision of Yahweh.

# You have brought out your bow without a cover

This means that Yahweh has removed his bow from its protective case and is prepared to shoot. AT: "You have prepared to shoot your bow" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# You divided the earth with rivers

Possible meanings are 1) "You created rivers that divide the lands through which they run" or 2) "You split open the earth and rivers flowed forth."

# The mountains saw you and twisted in pain

The effects that Yahweh's presence has on the mountains is spoken of as if the mountains were people who writhe in pain. This may refer either to the mountains shaking from an earthquake or to the water from the storm eroding the sides of the mountains as the streams flow down. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# Downpours of water passed over them

Possible meanings are 1) torrential rains fell on the mountains or 2) the rain caused raging streams to flow down the mountains.

# the deep sea raised a shout

The loud noises that the sea makes as the wind and storm pass over it are spoken of as if the sea were a person who begins to shout loudly. AT: "the deep sea became loud" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# It lifted up its waves

The level of the water in the sea rising and the storm winds causing waves in the sea is spoken of as if the sea were a person who lifts its waves. AT: "Waves began to form in the sea" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
