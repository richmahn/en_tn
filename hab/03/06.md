## translationNotes

* Habakkuk continues to describe his vision of Yahweh.
* **measured the earth** - This can mean 1) he surveyed it the way a conqueror would before assigning portions to his governors (see ULB) or 2) he made it shake (see UDB).
* **eternal mountains...everlasting hills** - "mountains that have existed since the beginning of time...hills that will exist until the end of time." If your language has no different words for "hills" and "mountains" or for "eternal" and "everlasting," you can combine them as the ULB did.
* **bowed down** - in worship to God. "were flattened to the ground" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
