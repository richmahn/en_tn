Habakkuk describes his fear when he thinks about how Yahweh would punish the Chaldeans.

## my inner parts trembled! My lips quivered...Decay comes into my bones...under myself I tremble ##

These refer to fear caused by thinking about future events. Habakkuk uses several parts of his body to express that every part of him is afraid.  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## Decay ##
