# General Information:

Habakkuk begins to describe his vision of Yahweh coming to judge his enemies and to save his people. The vision continues through [Habakkuk 3:15](./14.md). It is full of metaphorical language and uses different kinds of parallelism. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# God came from Teman, and the Holy One from Mount Paran

Teman and Mount Paran were both located south of Judah. Habakkuk speaks of God coming to Judah from the direction of Mount Sinai.

# His glory covered the heavens

"His splendor covered the sky." Here the word "glory" refers to the bright light that biblical writers often associate with God's presence.

# the earth was full of his praise

Here the word "praise" is a metonym for God's qualities that cause people to praise him. Alternate translation: "the earth was full of his glory" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
