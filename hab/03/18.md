# General Information:

Habakkuk continues to describe his reaction to his vision of Yahweh and determines to praise him.

# the God of my salvation

The word "salvation" can be translated with a verb. AT: "the God who saves me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# he makes my feet like the deer's. He makes me go forward on my high places

Habakkuk speaks of Yahweh keeping him safe and enabling him to survive during difficult times as if Yahweh were to make him as sure-footed as a deer that can climb easily on rugged and dangerous mountain sides. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
