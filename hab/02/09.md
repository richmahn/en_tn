Yahweh continues to answer Habakkuk. He refers to the Chaldeans as though they are one person.

## who carves out evil gains for his house ##

"who works to get dishonest profits for his family"

## set his nest on high ##

"builds his house far from trouble"

## the hand of evil ##

This can be translated 1) "the hand of evil," treating "evil" as a person (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]]) or 2) "evil people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]]).

## You have devised shame for your house by cutting off many people ##

"Because you cut off many people, your family will be suffer shame"

## You ##

singular (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])

## cutting off ##

destroying (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]]

## sinned against your own soul ##

"hurt yourself"

## stones...rafters of timber ##

The "stones" and "rafters of timber" represent the people hurt in the building of the house, who in turn represent the people destroyed by the Chaldeans. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
