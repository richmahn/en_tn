## translationNotes

* Yahweh answers Habakkuk.

* **tablets** - These are flat pieces of stone or clay that were used for writing.
* **the one reading them might run** - This can mean 1) someone will run with the tablets and read them to people (see UDB) or 2) anyone who reads them will be able to read them easily (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
* **and will finally speak** - What is written will happen or become real. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
* **and will not tarry** - Possible meanings: 1) "and will not wait" or 2) "and will not come slowly"
