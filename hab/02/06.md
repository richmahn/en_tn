# General Information:

Yahweh continues to answer Habakkuk and to speak of the Chaldeans as if they were one man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Will not all these create

The words "all these" refer to the nations and peoples from [Habakkuk 2:5](../02/05.md). This negative rhetorical question emphasizes the positive answer. It can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: "All of these nations and peoples will certainly create" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Woe to the one increasing what is not his

It is implicit that he is increasing his possession of things that do not belong to him. Alternate translation: "Woe to the one who claims for himself more and more things that do not belong to him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# For how long will you increase the weight of the pledges you have taken?

The word "pledges" refers to objects that people give to others from whom they have borrowed money as a guarantee that they will repay their debt. As the man collects more and more pledges, the total weight of the pledges that he carries increases.

# For how long will you increase the weight of the pledges you have taken?

The Chaldeans robbing the people of the nations of their wealth is spoken of as if the Chaldeans were a person who forces others to give him pledges and to pay him what they do not owe. Alternate translation: "For how long will you make yourself rich by extorting others?" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
