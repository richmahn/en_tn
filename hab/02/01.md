## I...my...me ##

Habakkuk

## he ##

Yahweh

## I will stand at my guard-post and station myself on the watchtower ##

These phrases say the same thing in two different ways. "I will stand at my post on the watchtower" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])  Habakkuk uses these phrases to compare himself waiting to hear from God to a soldier standing guard on a watchtower. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## I should turn from my complaint ##

The word "turn" compares someone changing their mind to turning from one thing to another. "I should stop complaining and agree with God." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
