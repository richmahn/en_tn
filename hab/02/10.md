# You have devised shame for your house

Here to "devise shame" means that the plans that the man devised have resulted in shame. One possible meaning is that the word "house" is a metaphor in which the Babylonian empire is spoken of as if it were a house that the man has built. AT: "By your plans, you have brought shame on the house that you have built" Another possibility is that the word "house" is a metonym for "family." AT: "By your plans, you have brought shame on your family" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
