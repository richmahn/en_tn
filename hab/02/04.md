## translationNotes

* Yahweh continues to answer Habakkuk.
* **Behold** - The word “behold” here adds emphasis to what follows. Alternate translation: “Indeed.”
* **Man's soul is puffed up...within himself...the arrogant young man...he will not abide, but enlarges his desire...and...is never satisfied. He gathers to himself...and gathers up for himself** - Yahweh speaks of the Chaldeans as though they are one person. "The souls of the Chaldeans are puffed up...within themselves...the arrogant young men...they will not abide, but enlarge their desire...and...are never satisfied. They gather to themselves...and gather up for themselves."
* **upright** - correct or as it should be (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
* **He gathers to himself every nation and gathers up for himself all of the peoples** - This is saying the same thing in two different ways.  "He collects all the people from every nation" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]]) "He" refers to the Chaldeans as though they are one person.
* **gathers** - "collects"
* **every...all** - a very large number (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
