# Habakkuk 02 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers, or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 2:1-20, which are extended quotations.

This chapter is arranged in a series of questions and answers between Yahweh and Habakkuk.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### "The righteous will live by his faith" #####
This is an important phrase in Scripture. Paul also uses it to explain that man is justified by his faith. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/justify]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]])
