# Habakkuk 02 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetry in 2:1-20.

This chapter is arranged in a series of questions and answers between Yahweh and Habakkuk.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### "The righteous will live by his faith" #####
This is an important phrase in Scripture. Paul also uses it to explain that man is justified by his faith. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/justify]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]])
