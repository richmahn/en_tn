# General Information:

Yahweh continues to answer Habakkuk and to speak of the Chaldeans as if they were one man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Woe to the one who builds a city with blood, and who establishes a town in iniquity

These two phrases are saying the same thing in different ways. AT: "A warning to the Chaldeans who built their cities with what they have stolen from the people they have killed" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# the one who builds a city with blood

Here the word "blood" is a metonym for murder. It is implicit that the person builds a city by means of the goods that he stole from those whom he has killed. AT: "the one who kills people and steals their goods in order to build a city" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# who establishes a town in iniquity

It is implicit that the person builds a city by means of the goods that he stole from those whom he has killed. Here the word "establishes" means "to begin." AT: "who starts a town by means of the profit that he has acquired through evil behavior" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
