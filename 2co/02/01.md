# Connecting Statement:

Because of his great love for them, Paul makes it clear that his rebuke in his first letter to them (the rebuke of their acceptance of the sin of immorality) caused him pain as well as pain to the church people in Corinth and the immoral man.

# I decided for my own part

"I made the decision"

# in painful circumstances

"in circumstances that would cause you pain"

# If I caused you pain, who could cheer me up but the very one who was hurt by me?

Paul uses this rhetorical question to emphasize that neither he nor they would benefit if his coming to them would cause them pain. AT: "If I caused you pain, the only ones who could cheer me up would be the very ones whom I had hurt" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# the very one who was hurt by me

This can be stated in active form. AT: "the very one whom I had hurt" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
