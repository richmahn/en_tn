## translationNotes

* Paul continues the letter to the people of the church at Corinth
* **So I decided for my own part ** - "I made the decision"
* **you in painful circumstances** - AT: "when you are doing things I strongly disapprove of"
* **If I caused you pain, who could cheer me up but the very one who was hurt by me?** - Paul tells the Corinthians that they make him happy and hurting them would make both of them unhappy. AT: "If I caused you pain, I would be unhappy because you are unhappy." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
