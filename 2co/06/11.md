# Connecting Statement:

Paul encourages the believers at Corinth to be separated from idols and live clean lives for God.

# spoken the whole truth to you

"spoken honestly to you"

# our heart is wide open

Paul speaks of his great affection for the Corinthians as having a heart that is open. Here "heart" is a metonym for a person's emotions. AT: "we love you very much" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
