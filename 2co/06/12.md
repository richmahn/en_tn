# You are not restrained by us, but you are restrained in your own hearts

Paul speaks of the Corinthians lack of love for him as if their hearts were squeezed into a tight space. Here "heart" is a metonym for a person's emotions. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
