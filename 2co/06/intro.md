# 2 Corinthians 06 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations set apart quotations of the Old Testament by indenting them. The ULB and other English translations indent the words in 6:2, 16-18 that are quoted from the Old Testament.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Servants #####
Christians are said to be servants of God. This is because they are called to serve God in their life no matter the circumstances. This holds true even if one has very challenging circumstances. 

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter ####

##### Contrasts #####

Paul uses four pairs of contrasts: righteousness versus lawlessness, light versus darkness, Christ versus Satan, and the temple of God versus idols. These contrasts are intended to differentiate between Christians and non-Christians. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/light]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/darkness]])

##### Light and darkness #####
These are common images in the New Testament. Light is used here to indicate the revelation of God and his righteousness. Darkness describes sin and sin seeks to remain hidden from God. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/light]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/darkness]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]]) 

##### Rhetorical questions #####
Paul uses a series of rhetorical questions to teach his readers. All of these questions make essentially the same point: Christians should not intimately fellowship with those who live in sin. These questions are repeated for emphasis. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]]) 

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### We #####

It is likely that Paul's usage of the pronoun "we" represents at least Timothy and himself. It is possible that it may also include other people.
