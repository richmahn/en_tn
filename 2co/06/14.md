# General Information:

In verse 16, Paul paraphrases portions from several Old Testament prophets: Moses, Zechariah, Amos, and possibly others.

# Do not be tied together with unbelievers

This can be stated in positive terms. AT: "Only be tied together with believers" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])

# be tied together with

Paul speaks of working together toward a common purpose as if it were two animals tied together to pull a plow or cart. AT: "team up with" or "have a close relationship with" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# For what association does righteousness have with lawlessness?

This is a rhetorical question that anticipates a negative answer. AT: "For righteousness can have no association with lawlessness" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# For what fellowship does light have with darkness?

Paul asks this question to emphasize that light and darkness cannot coexist since light dispels darkness. The words "light" and "darkness" refer to the moral and spiritual qualities of believers and unbelievers. AT: "Light can have no fellowship with darkness" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
