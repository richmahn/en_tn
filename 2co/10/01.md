# by the humility and gentleness of Christ

The word "humility" and "gentleness" are abstract nouns, and can be expressed in another way. AT: "I am humble and gentle as I do so, because Christ has made me that way" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# who assume that

"who think that"

# we are living according to the flesh

The word "flesh" is a metonym for sinful human nature. "we are acting from human motives" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
