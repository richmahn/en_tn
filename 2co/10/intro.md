# 2 Corinthians 10 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations set quotations from the Old Testament farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text. The ULB does this with the quoted words of verse 17.

In this chapter, Paul returns to defending his authority. He also compares the way he speaks and the way he writes.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Boasting #####
"Boasting" is often thought of as bragging, which is not good. But in this letter "boasting" means confidently exulting or rejoicing.

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter ####

##### Metaphor #####

In verses 3-6, Paul uses many metaphors from war. He probably uses them as part of a larger metaphor about Christians being spiritually at war. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]]) 

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### Flesh #####

"Flesh" is possibly a metaphor for a person's sinful nature. Paul is not teaching that our physical bodies are sinful. Paul appears to be teaching that as long as Christians are alive ("in the flesh"), we will continue to sin. But our new nature will be fighting against our old nature. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/flesh]])
