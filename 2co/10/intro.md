# 2 Corinthians 10 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations set apart quotations of the Old Testament by indenting them. The ULB and other English translations indent the words in 10:17 that are quoted from the Old Testament.

In this chapter, Paul returns to the topic of defending his authority. He also addresses the difference between the way he speaks and the way he writes.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Boasting #####
Boasting is another word for bragging. Bragging has negative connotations while boasting should not.

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter ####

##### Metaphor #####

In verses 10:3-6, Paul uses many metaphors from war. These are probably used as part of a larger metaphor about Christians engaging in spiritual warfare. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]]) 

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### Flesh #####

This is a complex issue and it is possible that "flesh" is a metaphor for a person's sinful nature. It is not the physical part of man that is sinful and it appears that Paul is teaching that while man remains alive ("in the flesh"), he will remain sinful regardless of his effort. His new nature will fight against his old nature. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/flesh]])
