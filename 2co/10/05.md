# every high thing that rises up

Paul is still speaking with the metaphor of a war, as if "the knowledge of God" were an army and "every high thing" were a wall that people had made to keep the army out. AT: "every false argument that proud people think of to protect themselves"

# every high thing

"everything that proud people do"

# rises up against the knowledge of God

Paul speaks of arguments as if they were a wall standing high against an army. The words "rises up" mean "stands tall," not that the "high thing" is floating up into the air. AT: "people use so they will not have to know who God is" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# We take every thought captive into obedience to Christ

Paul speaks of people's thoughts as if they were enemy soldiers whom he captures in battle. AT: "We show how all the false ideas those people have are wrong and teach the people to obey Christ" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
