# For godly sorrow brings about repentance that accomplishes salvation

The word "repentance" may be repeated to clarify its relationship to what precedes it and what follows it. Alternate translation: "For godly sorrow produces repentance, and repentance leads to salvation" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# without regret

Possible meanings are 1) Paul has no regret that he caused them sorrow because that sorrow led to their repentance and salvation or 2) the Corinthians will not regret experiencing sorrow because it led to their repentance and salvation.

# Worldly sorrow, however, brings about death

This kind of sorrow leads to death instead of salvation because it does not produce repentance. Alternate translation: "Worldly sorrow, however, leads to spiritual death" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
