## our bodies had no rest ##

AT: "we were very tired" or "we were exhausted"

## the comfort he had received from you, ##

AT: "the news of the encouragement that he had received from you Corinthians."

## when he told us of your great affection, your sorrow, and your deep concern for me; ##

AT: "He told us about your love for me, your sorrow about what had happened, and your deep concern for my welfare."

## so I rejoiced even more. ##

AT: "I was filled with joy." \\
