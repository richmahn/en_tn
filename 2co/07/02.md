# Connecting Statement:

Having already warned the people of Corinth about other leaders who were striving to get these Corinthian believers to follow them, Paul reminds the people of the way he feels about them.

# Make room for us

This refers back to what Paul said in [2 Corinthians 6:11-13](../06/11.md) about them opening their hearts to him. AT: "Make room for us in your hearts" or "Love us and accept us" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
