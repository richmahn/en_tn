# 2 Corinthians 07 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

In verses 2-4, Paul finishes his defense. He then writes about Titus' return and the comfort it brought.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Clean and unclean #####

Christians are "clean" in the sense that God has cleansed them from sin. They do not need to be concerned with being clean according to the law of Moses. Ungodly living can still make a Christian unclean. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/clean]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]])

##### Sadness and sorrow #####
The words "sad" and "sorrow" in this chapter indicate that the Corinthians were upset to the point of repenting. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/repent]]) 

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### We #####

Paul likely uses the pronoun "we" to represent at least Timothy and himself. It may also include other people.

##### Original situation #####

This chapter discusses in detail a previous situation. We can figure out some aspects of this situation from the information in this chapter. But it is best not to include this type of implicit information in a translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
