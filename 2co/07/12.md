# the wrongdoer

"the one who did wrong"

# your good will toward us should be made known to you in the sight of God

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "so that you would know that your good will toward us is sincere" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# in the sight of God

This refers to God's presence. God's understanding and approval of Paul's truthfulness is referred to as God being able to see them. See how you translated this in [2 Corinthians 4:2](../04/01.md). Alternate translation: "before God" or "with God as witness" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
