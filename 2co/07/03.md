# It is not to condemn you that I say this

"I do not say this to accuse you of having done wrong." The word "this" refers to what Paul just said about not having wronged anyone.

# you are in our hearts

Paul speaks of his and his associates' great love for the Corinthians as if they held them in their hearts. AT: "you are very dear to us" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# for us to die together and to live together

This means that Paul and his associates will continue to love the Corinthians no matter what happens. AT: "whether we live or whether we die" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# for us to die

"us" includes the Corinthian believers. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-inclusive]])
