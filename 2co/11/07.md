# Did I sin by humbling myself so you might be exalted?

Paul is beginning to claim that he treated the Corinthians well. This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement, if necessary. AT: "I think we agree that I did not sin by humbling myself so you might be exalted" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# freely preached the gospel of God to you

"preached the gospel of God to you without expecting anything from you in return"
