# Connecting Statement:

As Paul continues to affirm his apostleship, he talks about false apostles.

# in order that I may take away the claim

Paul speaks of a false claim that his enemies state as if it were something that he can carry way. Alternate translation: "so that I might make it impossible" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# they are found to be doing the same work that we are doing

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "that people will think that they are like us" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
