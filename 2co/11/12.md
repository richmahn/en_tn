# Connecting Statement:

As Paul continues to affirm his apostleship, he talks about false apostles.

# in order that I may take away the claim

Paul speaks of a false claim that his enemies state as if it were something that he can carry way. AT: "so that I might make it impossible" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# for which they want to boast

While Paul's boast was that he "freely preached the gospel" ([2 Corinthians 11:7](./07.md)), his enemies boasted that they could speak well ([2 Corinthians 11:6](./05.md)).

# they are found to be doing the same work that we are doing

This can be stated in active form. AT: "that people will think that they are like us" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# For such people

"I do what I do because people like them"

# deceitful workers

"dishonest workers"

# disguise themselves as apostles

"are not apostles, but they try to make themselves look like apostles"
