# Who is weak, and I am not weak?

The word "weak" is probably a metaphor for a spiritual condition, but no one is sure what Paul is speaking of, so it is best to use the same word here. AT: "I am weak whenever anyone else is weak." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Who has been caused to stumble, and I do not burn?

Paul uses this question to express his anger when a fellow believer is caused to sin. Here his anger is spoken of as a burning inside him. This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement.
