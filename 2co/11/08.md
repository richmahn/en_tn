# I robbed other churches

This is an exaggeration to emphasize that Paul received money from churches who were not obligated to give to him. AT: "I accepted money from other churches" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# I could serve you

The full meaning of this can be made explicit. AT: "I could serve you at no cost" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
