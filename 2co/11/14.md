By stating this in a negative form Paul is emphasizing that the Corinthians should expect to meet many "false apostles" ([2 Corinthians 11:13](../11/13.md)). Alternate translation: "we should expect this" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])

# Satan disguises himself as an angel of light

"Satan is not an angel of light, but he tries to make himself look like an angel of light"

# an angel of light

Here "light" is a metaphor for righteousness. Alternate translation: "an angel of righteousness" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
