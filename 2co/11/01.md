# Connecting Statement:

Paul continues to affirm his apostleship.

# put up with me in some foolishness

"allow me to act like a fool"

# jealous ... jealousy

These words speak of a good, strong desire that the Corinthians be faithful to Christ, and that no one should persuade them to leave him.

# I promised you in marriage to one husband. I promised to present you as a pure virgin to Christ

Paul speaks of his care for the Corinthian believers as if he had promised another man that he would prepare his daughter to marry him and he is most concerned that he be able to keep his promise to the man. AT: "I was like a father who promised to present his daughter to one husband. I promised to keep you as a pure virgin so I could give you to Christ" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
