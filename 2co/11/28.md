# there is the daily pressure on me of my anxiety

Paul knows that God will hold him responsible for how well the churches obey God and speaks of that knowledge as if it were a heavy object pushing him down. Alternate translation: "I know that God will hold me accountable for the spiritual growth of all the churches, and so I always feel like a heavy object is pushing me down" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
