# Why? Because I do not love you?

Paul uses rhetorical questions to emphasize love for the Corinthians. These questions can be combined or made into a statement. Alternate translation: "Is it because I do not love you that I do not want to be a burden to you?" or "I will continue to keep you from paying for my needs because this shows others that I love you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# God knows

You can make clear the understood information. Alternate translation: "God knows I love you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
