"accept me when I act like a fool." See how a similar phrase was translated in [2 Corinthians 11:1](./01.md).

# You are wise yourselves!

Paul is shaming the Corinthians by using irony. AT: "You think you are wise, but you are not!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])

# enslaves you

Paul uses exaggeration when he speaks of some people forcing others to obey rules as if they were forcing them to be slaves. AT: "makes you follow rules they have thought of" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# he consumes you

Paul speaks of the super-apostles' taking people's material resources as if they were eating the people themselves. AT: "he takes all your property" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# takes advantage of you

A person takes advantage of another person by knowing things that the other person does not and using that knowledge to help himself and harm the other person.

# I will say to our shame that we were too weak to do that

"I shamefully admit that we were not bold enough to treat you like that." Paul is using irony to tell the Corinthians that it was not because he was weak that he treated them well. AT: "I am not ashamed to say that we had the power to harm you, but we treated you well" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])

# Yet if anyone boasts ... I too will boast

"Whatever anyone boasts about ... I will dare to boast about it also"
