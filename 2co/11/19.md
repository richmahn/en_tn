# put up with fools

"accept me when I act like a fool." See how a similar phrase was translated in [2 Corinthians 11:1](../11/01.md).

# You are wise yourselves!

Paul is shaming the Corinthians by using irony. Alternate translation: "You think you are wise, but you are not!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])
