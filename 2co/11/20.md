# enslaves you

Paul uses exaggeration when he speaks of some people forcing others to obey rules as if they were forcing them to be slaves. Alternate translation: "makes you follow rules they have thought of" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# he consumes you

Paul speaks of the super-apostles' taking people's material resources as if they were eating the people themselves. Alternate translation: "he takes all your property" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# takes advantage of you

A person takes advantage of another person by knowing things that the other person does not and using that knowledge to help himself and harm the other person.
