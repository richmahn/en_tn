# I will say to our shame that we were too weak to do that

"I shamefully admit that we were not bold enough to treat you like that." Paul is using irony to tell the Corinthians that it was not because he was weak that he treated them well. AT: "I am not ashamed to say that we had the power to harm you, but we treated you well" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])

# Yet if anyone boasts ... I too will boast

"Whatever anyone boasts about ... I will dare to boast about it also"
