# But I am afraid that somehow ... pure devotion to Christ

"But I am afraid that somehow your thoughts might be led astray from a sincere and pure devotion to Christ just as the serpent deceived Eve by his craftiness"

# your thoughts might be led astray away

Paul speaks of thoughts as if they were animals that people could lead along the wrong path. AT: "someone might cause you to believe lies" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
