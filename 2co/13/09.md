"when I use my authority"

# so that I may build you up, and not tear you down

Paul speaks of helping the Corinthians to know Christ better as if he were constructing a building. See how you translated a similar phrase in [2 Corinthians 10:8](../10/07.md). AT: "to help you become better followers of Christ and not to discourage you so you stop following him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
