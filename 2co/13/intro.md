# 2 Corinthians 13 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

In this chapter, Paul finishes defending his authority. He then concludes the letter with a final greeting and blessing. 

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Preparation #####
Paul instructs the Corinthians as he prepares to visit them. He is hoping to avoid needing to discipline anyone in the church so he can visit them joyfully. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/disciple]]) 

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####
##### Power and weakness #####
Paul repeatedly uses the contrasting words "power" and "weakness" in this chapter. The translator should use words that are understood to be opposites of each other.

##### "Examine yourselves to see if you are in the faith. Test yourselves." #####
Scholars are divided over what these sentences mean. Some scholars say that Christians are to test themselves to see whether their actions align with their Christian faith. The context favors this understanding. Others say these sentences mean that Christians should look at their actions and question whether they are genuinely saved.
