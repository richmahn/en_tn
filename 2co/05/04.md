# while we are in this tent

Paul speaks of the physical body as if it were a "tent." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# in this tent, we groan

The word "tent" refers to "the earthly dwelling that we live in." The word groan is a sound that a person makes when they eagerly desire to have something that is good. See how you translated this in [2 Corinthians 5:2](./01.md).

# being burdened

Paul refers to the difficulties that the physical body experiences as if they were heavy objects that are difficult to carry. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# We do not want to be unclothed ... we want to be clothed

Paul speaks of the body as if it were clothing. Here "to be unclothed" refers to the death of the physical body; "to be clothed" refers to having the resurrection body that God will give. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# to be unclothed

"to be without clothes" or "to be naked"

# so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life

Paul speaks of life as if it were an animal that eats "what is mortal." The physical body that will die will be replaced by a resurrection body that will live forever. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life

This can be stated in active form. AT: "so that life may swallow up what is mortal" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
