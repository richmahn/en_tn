# Connecting Statement:

Paul continues by contrasting believers' earthly bodies to the heavenly ones God will give.

# if the earthly dwelling that we live in is destroyed, we have a building from God

Here a temporary "earthly dwelling" is a metaphor for a person's physical body. Here a permanent "building from God" is a metaphor for the new body that God will give believers after they die. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# if the earthly dwelling that we live in is destroyed

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "if people destroy the earthly dwelling that we live in" or "if people kill our bodies" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# It is a house not made by human hands

Here "house" means the same thing as "building from God." Here "hands" is a synecdoche that represents the human as a whole. This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "It is a house that humans did not make" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
