# in this tent we groan

Here "this tent" means the same thing as "the earthly dwelling that we live in." The word groan is a sound that a person makes when they eagerly desire to have something that is good.

# longing to be clothed with our heavenly dwelling

The words "our heavenly dwelling" means the same thing as "building from God." Paul speaks of the new body that believers receive after they die as if it were both a building and a piece of clothing that a person can put on. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
