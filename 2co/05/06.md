# Connecting Statement:

Because believers will have a new body and have the Holy Spirit as a pledge, Paul reminds them to live by faith that they may please the Lord. He continues by reminding them to persuade others because 1) believers will appear at the judgment seat of Christ and 2) because of love for Christ who died for believers.

# while we are at home in the body

Paul speaks of the physical body as if it were a place where a person dwells. Alternate translation: "while we are living in this earthly body" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# we are away from the Lord

"we are not at home with the Lord" or "we are not in heaven with the Lord"
