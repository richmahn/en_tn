# Connecting Statement:

Because of Christ's love and death, we are not to judge by human standards. We are appointed to teach others how to be united with and have peace with God through Christ's death and receive God's righteousness through Christ.

# For this reason

This refers to what Paul has just said about living for Christ instead of living for self.
