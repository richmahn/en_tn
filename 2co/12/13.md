# how were you less important than the rest of the churches, except that ... you?

Paul is emphasizing that the Corinthians are wrong to accuse him of wanting to do them harm. This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: "I treated you the same way I treated all the other churches, except that ... you." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# I was not a burden to you

"I did not ask you for money or other things I needed"

# Forgive me for this wrong!

Paul is being ironic to shame the Corinthians. Both he and they know that he has done them no wrong, but they have been treating him as though he has wronged them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])

# this wrong

not asking them for money and other things he needed
