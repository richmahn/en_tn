# Connecting Statement:

In defending his apostleship from God, Paul continues to state specific things that have happened to him since he became a believer.

# I will go on to

"I will continue talking, but now about"

# visions and revelations from the Lord

Possible meanings are 1) Paul uses the words "visions" and "revelations" to mean the same thing in hendiadys for emphasis. Alternate translation: "things that the Lord has allowed only me to see" or 2) Paul is speaking of two different things. Alternate translation: "secret things that the Lord has let me see with my eyes and other secrets that he has told me about" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
