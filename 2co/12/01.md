# Connecting Statement:

In defending his apostleship from God, Paul continues to state specific things that have happened to him since he became a believer.

# I will go on to

"I will continue talking, but now about"

# visions and revelations from the Lord

Possible meanings are 1) Paul uses the words "visions" and "revelations" to mean the same thing in hendiadys for emphasis. AT: "things that the Lord has allowed only me to see" or 2) Paul is speaking of two different things. AT: "secret things that the Lord has let me see with my eyes and other secrets that he has told me about" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])

# I know a man in Christ

Paul is actually speaking of himself as if he were speaking of someone else, but this should be translated literally if possible.

# whether in the body or out of the body, I do not know

Paul continues to describe himself as if this happened to another person. "I do not know if this man was in his physical body or in his spiritual body"

# God knows

"only God knows"

# the third heaven

This refers to the dwelling place of God rather than the sky or outer space (the planets, stars, and the universe).
