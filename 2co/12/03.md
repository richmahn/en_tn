# General Information:

Paul continues to speak of himself as though he were speaking of someone else.

# this man ... was caught up into paradise

This can be stated in active form. Possible meanings are 1) "God took this man ... into paradise" or 2) "an angel took this man ... into paradise." If possible, it would be best not to name the one who took the man: "someone took ... paradise" or "they took ... paradise."
