# My grace is enough for you

"I will be kind to you, and that is all you need"

# for power is made perfect in weakness

"for my power works best when you are weak"

# the power of Christ might reside on me

Paul speaks of Christ's power as if it were a tent built over him. Possible meanings are 1) "people might see that I have the power of Christ" or 2) "I might truly have the power of Christ." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
