# I will most gladly spend and be spent

Paul speaks of his work and his physical life as if it were money that he or God could spend. Alternate translation: "I will gladly do any work and gladly allow God to permit people to kill me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# for your souls

The word "souls" is a metonym for the people themselves. Alternate translation: "for you" or "so you will live well" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# If I love you more, am I to be loved less?

This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: "If I love you so much, you should not love me so little." or "If ... much, you should love me more than you do." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# more

It is not clear what it is that Paul's love is "more" than. It is probably best to use "very much" or a "so much" that can be compared to "so little" later in the sentence.
