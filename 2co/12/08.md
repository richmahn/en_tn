## Lord about this, ##

AT: "Lord about this thorn in the flesh," or "Lord about this affliction"

## "My grace is enough for you, ##

"'My favor is all you need"

## for power is made perfect in weakness." ##

AT: "for my power works best when you are weak.'"

## Therefore I am content for Christâ€™s sake, ##

AT: "That is the reason why I take pleasure in my weaknesses,"

## in distresses, ##

AT: "in distresses that I suffer for Christ's sake,"

## for whenever I am weak, then I am strong. ##

AT: "for whenever I am weak, then Christ's power is strong in me."
