# Three times

Paul put these words at the beginning of the sentence to emphasize that he had prayed many times about his "thorn" ([2 Corinthians 12:7](./06.md)).

# Lord about this

"Lord about this thorn in the flesh," or "Lord about this affliction"

# My grace is enough for you

"I will be kind to you, and that is all you need"

# for power is made perfect in weakness

"for my power works best when you are weak"

# the power of Christ might reside on me

Paul speaks of Christ's power as if it were a tent built over him. Possible meanings are 1) "people might see that I have the power of Christ" or 2) "I might truly have the power of Christ." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# I am content for Christ's sake in weaknesses, in insults, in troubles, in persecutions and distressing situations

Possible meanings are 1) "I am content in weakness, insults, troubles, persecutions, and distressing situations if these things come because I belong to Christ" or 2) "I am content in weakness ... if these things cause more people to know Christ."

# in weaknesses

"when I am weak"

# in insults

"when people try to make me angry by saying that I am a bad person"

# in troubles

"when I am suffering"

# distressing situations

"when there is trouble"

# For whenever I am weak, then I am strong

Paul is saying that when he is no longer strong enough to do what needs to be done, Christ, who is more powerful than Paul could ever be, will work through Paul to do what needs to be done. However, it would be best to translate these words literally, if your language allows.
