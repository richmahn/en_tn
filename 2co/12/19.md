# Do you think all of this time we have been defending ourselves to you?

Paul uses this question to acknowledge something that the people may have been thinking. He does this so that he can assure them that it is not true. AT: "Perhaps you think that all of this time we have been defending ourselves to you." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# In the sight of God

Paul speaks of God knowing everything Paul does as if God were physically present and observed everything Paul said and did. AT: "Before God" or "With God as witness" or "In the presence of God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# for your strengthening

"to strengthen you." Paul speaks of knowing how to obey God and desiring to obey him as if it were physical growth. AT: "so that you would know God and obey him better" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
