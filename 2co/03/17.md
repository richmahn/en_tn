# Now all of us

Here the word "us" refers to all believers, including Paul and the Corinthians. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-inclusive]])

# with unveiled faces, see the glory of the Lord

Unlike the Israelites who could not see God's glory reflected on Moses' face because he had covered it with a veil, there is nothing to prevent believers from seeing and understanding God's glory. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# We are being transformed into the same glorious likeness

The Spirit is changing believers to be glorious like him. This can be stated in active form. AT: "The Lord is transforming us into his same glorious likeness" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# from one degree of glory into another

"from one amount of glory to another amount of glory." This means that the Spirit is constantly increasing the glory of believers.

# just as from the Lord

"just as this comes from the Lord"
