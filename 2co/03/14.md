# But their minds were closed

"But their minds were hardened." Paul speaks of the minds of the Israelite people as objects that could be closed or made hard. This expression means that they were unable to understand what they saw. Alternate translation: "But the Israelites could not understand what they saw" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# For to this day

to the time at which Paul was writing to the Corinthians

# when they read the old covenant, that same veil remains

Just as the Israelites could not see the glory on Moses' face because he covered his face with a veil, there is a spiritual veil that prevents people from understanding when they read the old covenant. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# when they read the old covenant

"when they hear someone read the old covenant"

# It has not been removed, because only in Christ is it taken away

Here both occurrences of the word "it" refer to "the same veil." This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "No one removes the veil, because only in Christ does God remove it" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
