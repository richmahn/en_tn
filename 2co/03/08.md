# How much more glorious will be the service that the Spirit does?

Paul uses this question to emphasize that "the service that the Spirit does" must be more glorious than "the service that produced" because it leads to life. Alternate translation: "So the service that the Spirit does must be even more glorious" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# the service that the Spirit does

"the ministry of the Spirit." This refers to the new covenant, of which Paul is a minister. Alternate translation: "the ministry that gives life because it is based on the Spirit" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
