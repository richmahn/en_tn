# same earnest care

"the same enthusiasm" or "same deep concern"

# For he not only accepted our appeal

Paul is referring to his asking Titus to return to Corinth and complete the collection. AT: "For he not only agreed to our request that he help you with the collection" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
