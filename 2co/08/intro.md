# 2 Corinthians 08 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Chapters 8 and 9 begin a new section. Paul writes about how churches in Greece helped needy believers in Jerusalem.

Some translations set quotations from the Old Testament farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text. The ULB does this with the quoted words of verse 15.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Gift to the church in Jerusalem #####

The church in Corinth started preparing to give money to the poor believers in Jerusalem. The churches in Macedonia also had given generously. Paul sends Titus and two other believers to Corinth to encourage the Corinthians to give generously. Paul and the others will carry the money to Jerusalem. They want people to know it is being done honestly. 

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### We #####

Paul likely uses the pronoun "we" to represent at least Timothy and himself. It may also include other people.

##### Paradox #####

A "paradox" is a true statement that appears to describe something impossible. These words in verse 2 are a paradox: "the abundance of their joy and the extremity of their poverty have produced great riches of generosity." In verse 3 Paul explains how their poverty produced riches. Paul also uses riches and poverty in other paradoxes. ([2 Corinthians 8:2](./01.md))
