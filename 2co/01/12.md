# General Information:

In these verses Paul uses the words "we," "our," "ourselves," and "us" to refer to himself and Timothy and possibly others who served with them. These words do not include the people he was writing to. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

# We are proud of this ... your reason for boasting

The words "proud" and "boasting" here are used in the positive sense of feeling great satisfaction and joy in something.

# Our conscience testifies

Paul speaks of not being guilty as if his conscience were a person that could speak. Alternate translation: "We know by our conscience" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# not relying on fleshly wisdom but on the grace of God.

Here "fleshly" represents human. Alternate translation: "We have not relied on human wisdom but on the grace of God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
