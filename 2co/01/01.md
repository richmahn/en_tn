## translationNotes

* **Paul** - “From Paul.” Your language may have a particular way of introducing the author of a letter. This could be translated as “I, Paul, wrote this letter.”
* **brother** - In the New Testament, the apostles often used the word “brother” to refer to fellow Christians, since all believers in Christ are members of one spiritual family, with God as their heavenly Father.
* **Achaia** - This is the name of a Roman province in the southern part of modern day Greece. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
* **Grace to you and peace** - The word "you" refers to the people of the church in Corinth and to the rest of the Christians in that area. This is a common greeting used by Paul in his letters.
