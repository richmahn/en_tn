Paul and Timothy continue the introduction of their letter.

## the God and Father  ##

"God, who is the Father"

## the Father of mercies and God of all comfort ##

These phrases are similar ways to say the same thing. The words "Father" and "God" are used to describe God as "the one who gives" or "the source" because God is the source of all things. AT: "the source of all mercy and comfort" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## comforts us in all our affliction ##

"us" and "our" include the Corinthians. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-inclusive]])
