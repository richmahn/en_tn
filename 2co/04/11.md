# We who are alive are always carrying around in our body the death of Jesus

Carrying the death of Jesus represents being in danger of dying because of being loyal to Jesus. Alternate translation: "For those of us who are alive, God is always leading us to face death because we are joined to Jesus" or "People are always causing us who are alive to be in danger of dying because we are joined to Jesus" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# so that the life of Jesus may be shown in our body

# so that the life of Jesus may be shown in our body
