# we do not mishandle the word of God

"Word of God" here is a metonym for the message from God. This phrase uses two negative thoughts to express a positive thought. AT: "we do not mishandle God's message" or "we use the word of God correctly" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
