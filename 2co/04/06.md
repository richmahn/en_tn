# Light will shine out of darkness

With this sentence, Paul refers to God creating light, as described in the book of Genesis.

# He has shone ... to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God

Here the word "light" refers to the ability to understand. Just as God created light, he also creates understanding for believers. AT: "He has shone ... to enable us to understand the glory of God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# in our hearts

Here the word "hearts" refers to the mind and thoughts. AT: "in our minds" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# the light of the knowledge of the glory of God

"the light, which is the knowledge of the glory of God"

# the glory of God in the presence of Jesus Christ

"the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ." Just as God's glory shone upon Moses' face (See: [2 Corinthians 3:7](../03/07.md)), it also shines upon Jesus face. This means that when Paul preaches the gospel, people are able to see and understand the message about God's glory. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
