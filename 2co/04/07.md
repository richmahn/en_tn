# we have this treasure in jars of clay

Paul speaks of the gospel as if it were a treasure and their bodies as if they were breakable jars made out of clay. This emphasizes that they are of little value compared to the worth of the gospel that they preach. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# so that it is clear

"so that it is clear to people" or "so that people clearly know"
