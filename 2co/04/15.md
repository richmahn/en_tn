# Everything is for your sake

Here the word "everything" refers to all of the sufferings that Paul has described in previous verses.

# as grace is spread to many people

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "as God spreads his grace to many people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# thanksgiving may increase

Paul speaks of thanksgiving as if it were an object that could become larger by itself. Alternate translation: "more and more people may give thanks" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
