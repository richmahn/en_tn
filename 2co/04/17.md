# this momentary, light affliction is preparing us for an eternal weight of glory

Paul speaks of his sufferings and the glory that God will give him as if they were objects that can be weighed. The glory far outweighs the suffering. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# that exceeds all measurement

The glory that Paul will experience is so heavy that no one can measure it. This can be stated in active form. AT: "that no one can measure" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
