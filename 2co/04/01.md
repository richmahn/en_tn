# Connecting Statement:

Paul writes that he is honest in his ministry by preaching Christ, not praising himself. He shows the death and the life of Jesus in how he lives so that life can work in the Corinthian believers.

# we have this ministry

Here the word "we" refers to Paul and his coworker, but not to the Corinthians. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

# and just as we have received mercy

This phrase explains how Paul and his coworkers "have this ministry." It is a gift that God has given to them through his mercy. Alternate translation: "because God has shown us mercy" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
