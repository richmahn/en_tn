## our gospel is veiled, it is veiled only to those ##

## the god of this world ##

This phrase refers to Satan. English translations refer to a false god using a small “g” and write God with a large “G” when referring to the one true God. Other languages may also choose to do that. Another way to distinguish them would be to use two different terms for “God” and “god.”
