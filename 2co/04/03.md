## translationNotes

* **our gospel is veiled, it is veiled only to those** - The word "veiled" refers to being not understandable.  If something is veiled it cannot be seen.  Not being seen is used to refer to not being understood. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
* **the god of this world** - This phrase refers to Satan. English translations refer to a false god using a small “g” and write God with a large “G” when referring to the one true God. Other languages may also choose to do that. Another way to distinguish them would be to use two different terms for “God” and “god.”
* **has blinded** - AT: "prevented understanding" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
* **the light** - The word "light" refers to the truth.  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
