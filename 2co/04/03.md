# But if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled only to those who are perishing

This refers back to [2 Corinthians 3:14-16](../03/14.md), where Paul explained that there is a spiritual veil that prevents people from understanding when they read the old covenant. In the same way, people are not able to understand the gospel. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled

This can be stated in active form. AT: "if a veil covers our gospel, that veil covers it" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# our gospel

"the gospel that we preach"
