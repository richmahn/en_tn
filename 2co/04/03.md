# But if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled only to those who are perishing

This refers back to [2 Corinthians 3:14-16](../03/14.md), where Paul explained that there is a spiritual veil that prevents people from understanding when they read the old covenant. In the same way, people are not able to understand the gospel. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled

This can be stated in active form. AT: "if a veil covers our gospel, that veil covers it" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# our gospel

"the gospel that we preach"

# the god of this world has blinded their unbelieving minds

Paul speaks of their minds as if they had eyes, and their inability to understand as their minds being unable to see. AT: "the god of this world has prevented unbelievers from understanding" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the god of this world

"the god who rules this world." This phrase refers to Satan.

# they are not able to see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ

As the Israelites could not see God's glory that shined on Moses' face because he covered it with a veil (See: [2 Corinthians 3:13](../03/12.md)), unbelievers are not able to see Christ's glory that shines in the gospel. This means that they are unable to understand "the gospel of the glory of Christ" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the light of the gospel

"the light that comes from the gospel"

# the gospel of the glory of Christ

"the gospel about the Christ's glory"
