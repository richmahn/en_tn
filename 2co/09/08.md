# God is able to make all grace overflow for you

Grace is spoken of as if it were a physical object of which a person can have more than he can use. As a person gives financially to other believers, God also gives to the giver everything he needs. AT: "God is able to give you more than you need" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs-metaphor]])

# grace

This refers here to the physical things a Christian needs, not to the need for God to save him from his sins.

# so that you may multiply every good deed

"so that you may be able to do more and more good deeds"
