# the one who sows ... reap a blessing

Paul uses the image of a farmer sowing seeds to describe the results of giving. As a farmer's harvest is based on how much he sows, so will God's blessings be little or much based on how generously the Corinthians give. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
