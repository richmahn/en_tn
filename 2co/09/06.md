## the one who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and the one who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully ##

Paul uses image of a farmer sowing to that of the Corinthians giving. As a farmer's harvest is based on how much he sows, so will God's blessings be little or much based on how much the Corinthian church gives. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## for God loves a cheerful giver ##

God seeks for his people to give willingly and gladly to assist in meeting the needs of their fellow believers everywhere.
