# 2 Corinthians 09 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations set apart quotations of the Old Testament by indenting them. The ULB and other English translations indent the words in 9:9 that are quoted from the Old Testament.

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter ####

##### Metaphors #####

Paul uses three agricultural metaphors to give instructions about giving to those in need. Their overall purpose is to explain the point that God will reward those who give generously. He does not give specifics about how or when God will reward them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/reward]])
