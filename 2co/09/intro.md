# 2 Corinthians 09 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations set each line of poetry further to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetry that is quoted from the Old Testament in 9:9.

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter ####

##### Metaphors #####

Paul uses three agricultural metaphors to give instructions about giving to those in need. Their overall purpose is to explain the point that God will reward those who give generously. He does not give specifics about how or when God will reward them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/reward]])
