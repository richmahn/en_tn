# For carrying out this service

Here the word "service" refers to Paul and his companions bringing the contribution to the believers in Jerusalem. Alternate translation: "For our carrying out this service for the believers in Jerusalem" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# but is also overflowing into many acts of thanksgiving to God

Paul speaks of the Corinthian believers' act of service as if it were a liquid of which there is more than a container can hold. Alternate translation: "It also causes many deeds for which people will thank God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
