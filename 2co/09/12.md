# For carrying out this service

Here the word "service" refers to Paul and his companions bringing the contribution to the believers in Jerusalem. AT: "For our carrying out this service for the believers in Jerusalem" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# but is also overflowing into many acts of thanksgiving to God

Paul speaks of the Corinthian believers' act of service as if it were a liquid of which there is more than a container can hold. AT: "It also causes many deeds for which people will thank God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Because of your being tested and proved by this service

This can be stated in active form. AT: "Because this service has tested and proven you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# you will also glorify God by obedience ... by the generosity of your gift to them and to everyone

Paul says that the Corinthians will glorify God both by being faithful to Jesus and by giving generously to other believers who have need.

# for his inexpressible gift

"for his gift, which words cannot describe." Possible meanings are 1) that this gift refers to "the very great grace" that God has given to the Corinthians, which has led them to be so generous or 2) that this gift refers to Jesus Christ, whom God gave to all believers.
